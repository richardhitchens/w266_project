MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for standing by, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions].
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Treasurer and Senior Vice President, Chuck Zebula. Please go
ahead.
Charles E. Zebula
Thank you, Carey. Good morning and welcome to the 2011 third quarter earnings webcast of American Electric Power.
Our earnings release and related financial information are available on our website, aep.com. The presentation slides
are also available on our website.
Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future
results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of the factors that may
cause results to differ from management's forecasts.
Joining me this morning are Mike Morris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Tierney, our Chief
Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.
I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael G. Morris
Thanks, Chuck. It's always nice when you get Brian's name correct. It shows how closely we all work together.
Welcome to everybody else on the phone, happy to have you here, as always pleased to be the first in the day and,
equally important, to be the first in the quarter.

Looking forward to sharing with you a number of very interesting successes that we had in a very successful third
quarter for both our shareholders and our customers. I am always amazed at page two. It's that detailed requirement to
tell you to be cautious about what you hear, and I know you'll all do that because you always do, and you'll write
appropriately about how you think American Electric Power is doing.
If we turn to page three, let me detail for you some of those successes that we are really quite pleased with. First off, on
ongoing earnings, we had $1.17 a share, which is $0.02, or $15 million, higher than Q3 in 2010 in, I think, what all of
us could consider to be a very shaky economy as compared to what we saw in the latter part of 2010 where things
appeared to be recovering.
Secondly, our GAAP earnings, reflecting the appropriate decision by the Texas Supreme Court, were substantially
higher than Q3 of 2010 by $373 million. I'll talk a little bit more about the Supreme Court decision a little later.
Thirdly, we are announcing a tightening of our 2011 forecast to $3.07 to $3.17 as a range, moving from the $3.10 to
$3.20 – or the $3 and 3.20 that we had been working with as our forecast for 2011. Brian will touch a bit on 2012, as he
gives his update.
Lastly, or most importantly on this particular page, the board of directors decided yesterday to increase the dividend by
2.2% or a full $0.01 per share, which takes us on an annual basis to $1.88. And for me anyway, it's pretty enjoyable to
see a consecutive dividend increase for the eight years of my tenure as Chief Executive Officer of American Electric
Power Company.
We also announced yesterday that we intend to redeem all of the preferred shares of our operating subsidiaries. That
will allow us to experience a few million dollars per year in earnings in '12 and beyond. We think it was the appropriate
thing to do and the appropriate time to do that.
And lastly and I would think most importantly, yesterday the board of directors in keeping with our long stated
succession planning, elected Nick Akins to succeed me as Chief Executive Officer and President of American Electric
Power on 11/11/11. Nick actually becomes the 10th president of American Electric Power in its over 100-year history
and only the sixth chief executive officer, as for years in the early go, most corporations didn't have that slot filled.
I am really pleased that Nick will continue to take the very conservative shareholder-customer view that we have
established at American Electric Power, continue to give the operating company presidents plenty of runway to make
difficult decisions. But he and others will always keep a sharp eye on the most important decisions that need to be
made.
With the C-level team made up of Nick and Brian Tierney, as CFO, Bob Powers, David Feinberg and Dennis Welch, I
really feel pretty comfortable about the team that Nick will be working with. And, of course, as Chair, I will be able to
sit back and add some advice when and if it's needed, but most importantly just simply enjoy the ride myself.
Let me turn to page four and talk about some of the other really significant events that happened during Q3. I know
there is much worry and concern about the first point on the top of this page, but I must tell you that we were quite
pleased to reach a settlement and file a stipulation in the ongoing 2012 through '15 electric security plan here in Ohio.
All but three folks agreed with the stipulation. Many of the other companies that would market into Ohio. Obviously as
you all know, the industrial energy users, which are a bit difficult to understand because their individual customers
receive pretty substantial rate decreases by the stip, but, of course, First Energy Solutions and OCC weren't signatories
to the undertaking. But that is really of no concern because we expect that there would be a debate and there has been.
We fully expect an order to be issued by the end of the year and we think that that will give great clarity to one of the
overhang issues that is of concern to you and us and our board of directors and that is the path forward in Ohio.
As we look at that particular undertaking, we are pleased with the opportunity to transition to market. We think that
that's the appropriate place for us to go as we continue to address that issue.

Secondly, and most importantly, with the environmental matters, American Electric Power, along with many others,
but clearly following the lead of our company have made some very honest and straightforward statements about the
potential ramifications of some [ph] wrongful (6:49) events that the Environmental Protection Agency is intending to
implement in the next short while which will have a dramatic, or could have a dramatic effect on our ability as an
industry to continue to keep the lights on 24/7.
Our story has been the same from the beginning to today. We continue to meet and have dialogue with the
Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, all of the RTOs that are affected, at least by our fleet,
and the impact that those rules may have on our fleet as well as the FERC.
We begin to -- sometime ago we began to have conversations with members of Congress, and we are quite pleased to
see what the House Republicans have done. Also encouraged by yesterday or earlier this week's announcements by a
bipartisan group of Senators, both Democratic and Republican sides of aisle, addressing the coal ash issue, which is
really a piece of legislation that was occasioned by a TV event at the TVA. That isn't a basis for continued regulatory
change, and we tried to point that out.
We're comfortable that some of the decisions that the EPA has made to date have moved in the appropriate direction
and we will continue to have that dialogue, because ours is one that takes away the risk of reliability impact and the
unnecessary expense that may be associated with some of these rules.
I think the particulate matter subset of the HAPs MACT rule is a perfect example. For a company like ours, where we
today capture 99.7% of all PMs, we're going to be required to go to 99.9%. The environmental benefits from that will
be marginal at best, and the forecasted capital investment is on the order of $700 million. It's those of kinds of events
that we think are ill thought through. At the end of the day, stretching the timeline out by a few short years, we can
reach the same environmental goals that the EPA and others are embracing, and we embrace along with them. So, we'll
continue to have that dialogue and continue to make those points as we go forward.
Our transmission undertakings, which were long announced and slow in growing, do in fact continue to reach some
pretty significant success milestones for us. We think that the order on RITELine by the FERC was an appropriate
order: it has reasonable rates of return, not the high numbers that we saw in the early undertakings and joint venture
transmission plays through the FERC, but reasonable for sure, north of 11%. We think it's a great place to put money to
work. In fact, with the approval and the ongoing activity in Pioneer, we feel like those partnerships and those joint
venture activities are beginning to gain some speed.
Our very quiet, but quite successful play in the state of Texas through Electricity Transmission Texas, is something that
we're really quite pleased. We are north of $1 billion capital invested by Q3 '11, and in fact we'll be north of about $3
billion by 2017, yet this decade. That's going to make some pretty substantial earnings growth potential for our
shareholders as we move forward in those endeavors.
Our well discussed and brought forth Transco project concept in our traditional service territory is also on a pretty
reasonable path. We'll be north of $1 billion invested sometime in calendar year 2012. We will continue to see pretty
substantial earnings strength from those activities by improving the reliability and the intellectual capacity of our
energy delivery system in our traditional service territory. So we really feel good about the things that are going on
there.
The last point on page four here is the verification of what we always thought to be the case: In early 2000s we along
with others implemented restructuring endeavors in the state of Texas. The PUCT at the time thought that maybe the
approach that we had taken, which was a straight out auction of our facilities, was in violation of the best approach to
take. Obviously we agreed wholeheartedly with the Supreme Court of Texas, as they remanded that case back with
directions that what was done by us and others were in fact in compliance with the law. And as you know, the decision
has added substantially to the solidness of our balance sheet, and as we look at the recovery of the interest rates over a
period of years, will add to our earnings strength as well.
So all in all, the third quarter, in almost any way we would measure it, has been a success for us, and we feel very
comfortable about that.

As we look at our year-end earnings forecast and the tightening of the zone, we think it addresses an adequate amount
of conservatism for the fourth quarter, because we, like others, are beginning to see more slowdown in the U.S.
economy. But we feel comfortable that we'll be well within the range that we have tightened for you.
And lastly, let me simply say that this is my last endeavor on an earnings conference call as Chief Executive Officer of
American Electric Power. I thank you for the support, the counsel and the professional friendships that we've developed
over the many odd years since I've been in the electric business in 1988 at Consumers Power Company, Northeast
Utilities and American Electric Power.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. And when he is completed we look forward to your questions. Brian?
Brian X. Tierney
Thank you, Mike. This morning I'll review the quarterly and year-to-date reconciliations for ongoing earnings through
the third quarter, review load trends and customer switching data and provide update on the company's capitalization
and liquidity. I'll also provide some comments on 2012 and then wrap up and get to your questions as quickly as
possible.
On slide five you'll see that ongoing earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $566 million or $1.17 per share. This is
$14 million greater than last year's third quarter ongoing earnings of $552 million, or $1.15 per share. Highlights for
the quarterly comparison include the refund of the provider of last resort charges from the Ohio electric security plan
remand, which accounted for a negative comparison of $0.06 per share or $43 million. We anticipate an additional
negative quarterly comparison in the fourth quarter of this year of approximately $0.04 per share.
Customer switching in Ohio accounted for a negative comparison of $0.04 per share or $33 million. We'll examine this
issue in greater detail on slide eight. Operations and maintenance charges net of offsets accounted for negative $0.03
per share or $19 million, and were primarily due to higher storm expenses and higher generation maintenance
expenses. Weather normalized retail margins were down $0.02 or $12 million for the quarter.
Off-system sales were essentially flat relative to last year's third quarter and came in at $111 million. Increases in
physical margins were largely offset by reductions in trading margins. Physical off-system volumes increased 31%.
While net generation from our coal fleet was essentially flat for the quarter; net gas generation was up 17%. Our East
and West natural gas fleets experienced similar percentage gains quarter on quarter with the East combined cycle fleet
outpacing our eastern peakers. In the western part of our system, the addition of the Lamar Stall plant contributed to the
quarterly improvement.
On the positive side, weather accounted for positive $0.02 per share, or $14 million and was favorable to normal
weather by $79 million. This was the warmest quarter in over 30 years for our West service areas and the seventh
warmest in the last 30 years for our East service territories. Other was positive by $0.04 per share and reflects modest
improvements in river operations, generation and marketing and transmission operations.
Carrying cost income from Texas Central's capacity auction true-up remand accounted for positive $0.04 per share or
$28 million for ongoing earnings. This reflects the carrying cost income for the 2011 period only. We anticipate
recognizing approximately $9 million in ongoing earnings associated with this carrying cost income in the fourth
quarter of this year.
In the earnings release, you'll see that for GAAP earnings the company recognized $682 million gross, which is $443
million, or $0.92 per share, net of taxes, from the stranded costs proceeding. The Public Utility Commission of Texas
hearing on this capacity auction true-up is scheduled for November 28th to 30th, and the company expects to securitize
the final ordered amount in the first quarter of 2012.
Rate changes net of offsets accounted for a positive comparison of $0.07 per share, or $53 million, compared to last
year's third quarter and came in from a number of our jurisdictions.

Turning to slide six, you will see that the company earned $1.310 billion, or $2.72 per share, in ongoing earnings for
the September year-to-date period. This compares favorably by $38 million to last year's ongoing earnings of $1.272
billion, or $2.65 per share.
As in the quarterly period, POLR charges from the Ohio ESP remand accounted for a negative comparison of $0.06 per
share, or $43 million. Customer switching in Ohio accounted for negative $0.10, or $76 million, year-to-date. And
again, we'll have more on this later.
Operations and maintenance expenses, net of offsets increased for the year by $48 million, or $0.06 per share, and were
mostly driven by higher storm expenses. Weather normalized retail margins year-to-date were the same as for the
quarterly period, down $0.02 per share.
On the positive side, off-system sales net of sharing were up $49 million, or $0.07 per share. Increases in physical
margins were only partially offset by lower trading margin and higher margin sharing with our customers. Year-to-date,
weather was flat to last year, but up $147 million versus normal.
Other was a negative $0.02 comparison to the 2010 year-to-date period. Increases in transmission operations, river
operations and generation and marketing were more than offset by two positive results that were realized in 2010: one
was the gain of a sale of an investment; and two, a positive foreign tax adjustment.
Similar to the quarterly results, the ongoing Texas Central carrying cost income was positive $0.04 cents per share, and
again, we expect some more positive ongoing earnings from this category in the fourth quarter as well.
And finally, rate changes net of offsets were positive $0.22 per share, or $163 million, versus last year's to-date period
and again came from multiple jurisdictions. As Mike stated earlier, the positive year-to-date results allow us to narrow
the guidance range for the year to $3.07 per share to $3.17 per share.
Turning to slide seven, you'll see the total weather-normalized sales were up 1.9% for the quarter and up 2.1% for the
year-to-date period. Weather-normalized Industrial sales have increased 5.2% for the quarter and 5.1% for the year.
Increases in Industrial sales were led by primary metals, which is up 13% for the quarter and 15% for the year, largely
being driven by a large aluminum customer in Ohio, which returned to full load from two-thirds load in the first quarter
of this year.
Weather-normalized residential load is up 5/10th of 1% for the year. For the year-to-date period, Residential was
particularly strong in our West regulated utilities, where we saw the addition of the system of the Valley Electric
Membership Corporation last year, and we see continued lag in our East regulated utilities. The Commercial segment is
flat for the year-to-date period, and we've seen common results between our East and West service territories in this
customer class.
Turning to slide eight, you will see that 8.3% of AEP Ohio's load has switched to competitive retail energy suppliers.
The majority of that load switching is in Columbus and Southern territory and most of that is in the commercial classes.
While the amount of load switching and gross margin associated with it has been larger than forecast, AEP has
experienced significant offsets to the margin lost in the form of capacity sales to competitive retail suppliers, off-system
sales margins from uncommitted energy and competitive retail margins. Combined, these items offset more than 75%
of the lost retail margin. AEP Ohio's filed stipulation seeks a fair price for capacity sold to competitive suppliers and
would have them pay closer to what non-switching customers pay for capacity above certain thresholds.
Turning to slide nine, I would like to spend some time talking about the progress that's been made in strengthening
AEP's balance sheet and liquidity positions. First, let me address liquidity. AEP has slightly greater than $3.1 billion in
net liquidity, supported by our two revolving credit facilities. We have taken advantage of current credit market
conditions and our strong balance sheet to increase and lengthen these facilities. In addition, there continues to be
strong appetite for AEP's commercial paper. We believe that our net liquidity is strong enough to support our
operations through current and future business environments.
Next, let's take look at our total debt to total capitalization ratio. Currently at less than 55%, our debt to cap ratio is the
best it's been in the last eight years. This is not by accident. The company has actively reduced costs and capital

spending, among other credit-friendly actions in recent years to improve the company's balance sheet.
Finally, looking at our credit metrics, AEP is well within BBB territory. Our FFO to interest coverage is well above
four times and our FFO to total debt is above 20%. Similar to our debt to cap ratio, these coverage ratios are at their
highest levels in years.
Turning to slide 10, I think you will see that our performance in 2011 has been solid. We have reflected in increased
rates associated with putting capital to work for the service of our customers and we have been able to convert that in
earnings to our shareholders through the rate activity that our presidents and the opcos have been able to take.
We have positive balance sheet and credit ratio results, as we have shown on the prior slide. This certainly will be
impacted by the Texas securitization that we anticipate executing in the first quarter of 2012. As we are able to get that
equity capital in the door, we will be able to recapitalize TCC, and then put the balance of those dollars to work in our
operating companies, in our transmission JVs and transcos, and on the environmental spend that we will need to make
to be compliant with the new EPA regulations.
We have continued focus on our opco model. Our presidents have been out there with their long-term capital plans,
their long-term rate plans, engaging in discussions with the regulators and customers about what the impact will be to
rates over time, and aggressively and positively working to make those results happen. For the 12-month period, our
ROEs for our combined operating companies is at 10.9% and our operating company presidents and their staffs
continue to get things done.
Let me spend a few minutes talking about 2012. We are very confident in our ability to grow earnings from 2011 to
2012. There are some headwinds and some things that we need to get resolved between now and the time when we'd
come out with more detailed guidance for 2012. Those include the Ohio stipulation, which needs to get resolved. I
think we have put together a positive stipulation with most of the parties involved, only a couple outlying, and we think
that that will be positively received by the Public Utility Commission of Ohio.
We have an outstanding rate case in Virginia, and we anticipate getting an answer to that by the end of the year, and
Mike spent some time talking about the environmental issues and we certainly expect to have more clarity around those
issues as we get to the end of the year, certainly for the CSAPR rules, which go into place in 2012.
As we get that certainty, as we come towards the end of the year, we'll be able to put together the more detailed
guidance that I know you are looking for, and expect to share that with you early in the new year. We fully anticipate
that the 3.25 point estimate guidance will be within the range that we'll be able to share with you in 2012.
Finally, I think you will be able to see that management has been committed to growing earnings and growing the
dividend, as our board is committed to that. That's been the hallmark of the Mike Morris era, as you could see from the
first slide, and I know that Nick Akins is as committed to growing earnings and the dividend for the benefit of our
shareholders as Mike was. And we certainly anticipate that to continue.
Before I turn the call back over to Carey for questions, I would like to note that this is Mike Morris's final earnings call
as CEO of the company. He has had 32 such calls as CEO of the company over the last eight years, and I think you can
see from what we have talked about today, he is leaving the company in a considerably stronger financial position than
what he found it in. I know it's important to Mike, and is appreciated by those of us who are employees, he also left the
employees of the company considerably safer than they were when he arrived here and I know the employees of the
company and our families are grateful to him for that.
So on behalf of the men and women of American Electric Power, I would like to thank Mike Morris for his dedication,
commitment and leadership to the company and tell him that we look forward to his continued leadership on the board
of directors. Thank you, Mike.

Carey, with that, I'd like to start taking questions.
Q&A
Operator
Sure. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Steve Fleishman. Please state your
organization, sir, your company.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Yeah. Hi. It's Steve Fleishman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That was the fastest
question I've ever gotten picked up. Mike, first congratulations, we are going to miss you on these calls.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Thanks, Steve.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: A couple quick things. First, on the switching numbers that you are providing, are those a
gross number or is that a net number? Is it net of the customers that have switched, but you've retained in your
competitive side?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: It is not net of customers that we've retained and that, Steve, along with off-system sales and
capacity sales to those competitive retail energy suppliers, are all net of those numbers that we've supplied.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. So both the percentage and the actual dollar margin, are those both gross numbers?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yes. The numbers on page eight are all gross numbers.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: And I think, Steve, what Brian suggested and suggested, in fact, laid out, was that we
recovered about 75% of those gross dollars with the various subsets of service that we provide to CRes providers as
well as the recaptured customers.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: And Steve, those offsets would come through in the lines for off-system sales and generation
and marketing.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay, great. And then, I guess one other question, I mean this year you've had the benefit
of a lot of favorable weather, at least according to your weather normalization numbers. Without that, it would have
been lower level from which to grow. But are there other – I mean, obviously the POLR thing hurt within the range, are
there other things, maybe even related to the weather being so hot that were – maybe your costs were higher? So if we
think about the weather impact, how do you think about that?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, obviously in this business warmer than normal weather is a blessing on occasion, and
as you surely remember, and we've all lived through, cooler than normal weather is equally devastating. So what we've
done over a series of years really, Steve, as you surely know, is when things are good we step on the pedal for O&M
spending. I think Brian's spiked out the impact.
We had a unique year in storm effects on the system. None of them large enough to touch the threshold of reserving for
future recovery under the 11 jurisdictional states that we do business for the most part. That's obviously an increase in
O&M spending. But we also have continued to do more work this year than we've done traditionally, because we
wanted to take full advantage of that weather. When you look at the weather impact, most importantly look at the
earnings year-over-year impact of the incredible rate successes we've continued to have in 2011, which is just
following the path that we've had since we came here in 2004.
So weather is good to us, it has been like all other utilities; without that, we would have had some challenges. But each
and every year we've touched our midpoint in earnings, and this would have been one more year where we would have
reacted to the weather, either constructively as we have, or conservatively if we needed to.

<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Great, thanks. I'll let someone else ask a question. Thank you.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Yeah, you bet, Steven. I'm surprised you were the first, but happy you were.
Operator
Thank you. And now to line of Greg Gordon from ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Mike, first of all, congratulations on a, by in what any measure is a very long and
distinguished career.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Thanks a lot, Greg. It surely has been a joy working with you and your colleagues.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: So, I just want to ask a follow-on question related to the first one. So when we look at the $83
million gross, I know you've indicated that there have been significant offsets, at the beginning of the year you had
indicated you thought you would be at about 17% switching and a $53 million sort of headwind. That was kind of what
was baked into the midpoint of your guidance. So I guess to ask the question really simply, when you look at the gross
number and you look at what you think the net number is, are you ahead of, behind or on budget for what you expected
for the year?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: I think it's clear that it has been a bit more aggressive than we thought that it would have
been. I think that had a lot to do with the ongoing availability of natural gas fired kilowatt hours being available in the
marketplace. The flip side of that is, of course, what Brian laid out to the question Steve had asked. That has given us
additional kilowatt hours to put into the market, so we've offset a great deal of it, but it has clearly been more
aggressive than we had forecasted.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Right. So on a gross basis more customers have left, but have some of the offsets also been
ahead of plan?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Yes, I think that's a really accurate way. So net-net, although I don't have the true net-net
number in my head, I would tell you on balance we think we have done real well in that space. And some of our
customers had the joy of having others supply energy to them. As you know, in a volatile market, sometimes that joy
becomes pain, but at least for this calendar year, the customers have done well, and I would argue the shareholders
have surely done well as well.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. And Brian, do we have a sense of what the range of outcomes is in terms of the, what's
your sort of the net proceeds of the Texas securitization is going to look like at this point?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yes, we do. So the estimate that's reflected today is the low end and the conservative estimate
of what we would anticipate our being able to securitize. We have filed higher amounts with the Texas commission. So
today, what we have recognized is a regulatory asset of the principal amount and the interest carrying charges of that
682 million. There is an incremental equity component that we'll recognize as the securitization amortizes over time;
that's about $116 million. And that brings us to a very low and conservative estimate of $817 million.
We have filed with the Texas commission because we believe we are entitled to amounts that range from that $817
million, which is extreme conservative and low, up to what we believe we would ultimately be entitled to, which is
about $1.2 billion, and we are awaiting the results from that Texas proceeding before we could recognize the higher
amounts.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: It will all be determined, Greg in the current proceedings that are in front of the PUCT. But
interestingly enough, if you go back to the root of our case, the actual foundation case, the Commission at that time
determined that the appropriate interest rate for AEP, Texas TCC and TNC, would in fact be 11.7%. And so we think
the Supreme Court really didn't give them much latitude to make any other choice. That is the rate that they found in
the case, and the Court didn't give them any direction about whether they should change that. They just said that has
been determined in our case. So we think we've got a fighting shot at the $1.2 billion that Brian mentioned, and we will

be aggressive in that approach because we think our owners deserve that over a period of years that we've waited for
the appropriate decision.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thank you, gentlemen.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Yeah, sure. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And now to the line of Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse, please go ahead.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Good morning. Congratulations, Mike.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Thanks, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: I guess just as your sole Chairman role here pretty soon, but can you just share your thoughts
from the board's perspective on the dividend right now as it relates to the increase yesterday and kind of how you guys
are approaching the payout ratio and growing the dividend here forward?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Yeah, I think the board was obviously very encouraged to do this yet one more time. They
were cautious for the 2012 view of that same point because we will get some clarity about the capital demands on the
system. We will get additional clarity, as Brian really pointed out, on what Ohio looks like. And there has been some
writing that is probably a bit more aggressive than it needs to be about the changing mix of the earnings stream of
American Electric Power going forward.
You can do a simple calculation to say we will be 20%-plus deregulated if you look at the fleet in Ohio, but the reality
of that is that many of those megawatts will be dedicated to other members of what will become a three-state pool, or a
three-party pool, I should say – actually, four or five states involved in it – as well as the continued serving of
municipal and co-op customers here in our service territory.
What Brian and I and the management team have really looked at when we look at the overall sequential step to market
is we will take that Ohio fleet, as it continues to free up, to as many longer term, more dependable contracts as we can
get, we are going to keep a pretty solid number of megawatt hours to take full advantage of the volatility in the
marketplace.
Our Commercial Operations group, as you know, has been very adept at being on the right side of those equations
frequently. And Lisa Barton and the Transmission group will begin to work hard on debottlenecking some of our
avenue to the East Coast markets where we will see substantially different margin on the upside by getting to some of
the higher cost marketplaces. I know our competitors over there won't be happy about that, but open markets are open
markets, and we will be the second-lowest cost producer in this particular region, but for those who are more heavy
nuke. So we look forward to that as it comes in. And it won't be near as risky as I know some have written about.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: And I guess, Mike, on that point, when you look at the power pools as you guys see it
developing and the ability for long-term contracts, what kind of percentage are you guys targeting as a management
team for long-term contract relative to market sales?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: A lot of it will be in the overall discussions with the other pool members because they are
going to be eager to have some capacity assigned to them going forward, so that that will work that way. It's our view,
although not yet finalized, that the pool will have a different base to it, that it won't be capacity long-short charges, but
more focused on energy charges, so we think we will be able to tie up a certain amount of those megawatts in those
kinds of undertakings, and that's yet to be negotiated. But our plan there is as it has always been: to keep the other
states as whole as we can in that process.
And I think in a competitive nature, I would rather not share exactly the number of megawatts that we intend to put
either into that play. To the extent that they are more advantageous for a 12, 14, 24-month window, as we look out at

the marketplace, we will put more there. The muni co-op piece, as you know, we have been hugely successful with that
on our Western footprint, and really have never had the opportunity, but for a few endeavors, in our Eastern footprint;
we will be a bit more aggressive there as well.
I think in that muni co-op area, American Electric Power is viewed as an incredibly strong and dependable supplier of
kilowatt hours. So we think we will have a great deal of success in that. But as you know, only time will tell. But I
assure you this, that from at least my Chair vantage point – and I know this board of directors very, very well and I
know Nick very well – this will not be a risky play.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. And I guess kind of on that, one last question on that vein, the other power pool
members, are they -- what kind of plans are you guys doing, or what are your conversations you are having with your
commissions there as far as them building their own generation for rate base rather than sticking to historic power
pools? Is that something that's advancing at this point?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Yeah. I think if you look at Appalachian Power in particular, Virginia has been desirous of
having more direct ownership of their generating capacity. The Dresden facility, which actually will come online
earlier than we thought and has already run some dry run tests, will be assigned to Appalachia, Virginia and West
Virginia. Charles Patton and the team have already gotten rate approval for that, or acceptance of that by the two state
commissions, so they're eager to have that done.
The issue in Kentucky will continue to be, depending on the environmental regulations, whether we retrofit Big Sandy,
we convert Big Sandy to some kind of a gas facility, or we enter into the power purchase agreements to satisfy
Kentucky's need, as we look at that issue going forward. So, we think there is a lot of flexibility there. We are in early
conversations, with Commission staff on those issues. And to-date they are fruitful, they are intended to be constructive
and I think it's pretty safe to say that's what we've experienced.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Very good, thank you. Mike, enjoy the next phase.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Thanks, Dan.
Operator
Thank you. And now to the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys, first of all, Mike, congratulations. Second of all, I have two sets of questions or
two questions: one more kind of earnings specific for the fourth quarter, and then going into 2012, and one more
strategic.
When I think about earnings so far this year, the POLR remand, I think, you said $0.06 in the third quarter and an
incremental $0.04 in the fourth. I assume that drops off beginning in 2012. And I know you had the increased
amortization of the POLR disallowance in this quarter and it showed up in the D&A costs. Does that continue forward
as well in the fourth quarter and then drop off in 2012?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Mike, it does continue, but it comes through a number of different lines in our earnings
release format. It comes through line two. It comes through other income and deductions, as well as depreciation and
amortization. And I think for the tie-out of which lines that comes through, I'd refer you to Bette Jo and Julie for the
specifics on that.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: That's fine. Mike, when you guys are thinking about Ohio long-term, meaning
strategically, when you get to market, or as you get gradually closer to market, do you want as a corporate strategy, and
maybe it's a combination of you, Brian, Nick and the board kind of thinking about this, do you want the earnings
volatility with having a sizable merchant generation fleet? Does that fit into your vision for what AEP is?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Yes, well, first off Michael, thanks for your friendly comments. Not really. Again, we will
hold a certain amount of that capacity in reserve and play that volatility market, obviously intending to take full

advantage of.
No matter, which way you look at the EPA implementations, the FERC's 80,000-plus gigawatts coming offline to the
EEI's 40, gigawatts coming offline, it's going to put a tremendous amount of pressure on the simple supply-demand
equation. We have, as a country, recovered about 95% of the overall weather adjusted electric output to the
pre-recession impacts in calendar 2008.
The electrification of the U.S. economy continues apace. I saw some comments that my good friend Jim Rogers said
the other day; I couldn't disagree with him more. We continue to see additional electrification commercially,
residentially, in the industrial space as well. So we are going to hold some megawatts back for that.
But this isn't the board. I assure you, Nick, the rest of the C-level management team and me sitting on the board and
watching from the Chair's perch, we are just not big gamblers. There is not much to be gained by that. You may have a
great month, you may have a great week, you may even have a great quarter, but I think the proudest comment I can
say about Commercial Operations, which started long before I got here, but during my tenure we have never, ever had a
losing quarter, and that just simply says that we are conservative and smart, and I think those are tremendous talents to
have in that particular shop.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: And I just want to follow-up on that one because I completely understand when you are
thinking about having exposured a day ahead or a month ahead or even 12 to 24 months out. But if you own a merchant
generation fleet, unless you've got 10 or 20-year PPAs, you have sizable commodity volatility and commodity
exposure. And it may not be in year one, but as we've seen in the industry for the last couple of years, and it's really for
the last 10 years and it's worked in both directions, you have the volatility; it's a matter of when it shows up.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: True.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: And that comes back to the – are you comfortable with the concept of having large swings
and maybe FY3 or FY4 earnings power due to just significant movements in either direction in either coal prices,
capacity prices or energy prices?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: No. it's pretty clear. If you look at what we have done with the fleet that we had to work
with in our Western footprint, long-term contracts are the standard and they are contracts that fluctuate with every input
piece into the cost of electricity, and most of them yield in the high, kind of mid double-digit returns on equity capital
investment when you calculate back to a traditional cost of service model, and that will really be what you see us do.
We, as you know, today, if I were out to buy some coal, it would cost me $70, $80 maybe $90 a ton. Our overall 2011
number is in the $40s. That's another place where we think we've got a huge competitive advantage. I think that's part
of why, when you look at the transition of our fleet here and in our Eastern footprint, some are happy to have the
opportunity to compete in our market. Lots of them would rather not see us compete in their market. And when our
fleet gets free, it will be intriguing to see how successful it is.
But again, we just don't have a belly for big plays, big swings. We will tie up as much of it in the pool arrangements as
we can. We will enter into some very long term contracts – you think of partners of ours like Buckeye Power, you think
of other major co-ops here in our footprint: AMP Ohio is looking to build some facilities going forward. They may
have trouble, as almost everyone does, building facilities. So we will be here to satisfy those kinds of loads as we go
forward. We've had success over the years in Virginia, West Virginia. We will continue to do a lot more of that as we
go forward...
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Thank you, Mike. Much appreciated and, once again, thanks and congrats.

<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Just to circle on the settlement process, is there any potential for it to be altered or to bring
more people in, or should we think of this as pretty much going to be a litigated situation going forward?
There has been some sort of focus on this MRO test now with the remand coming back and we have also the Duke
Energy settlement. I am just wondering whether or not this is still sort of – we're still – basically, this is going to be
litigated. Is that how we should see it, or do you think there could be any change or alteration before commission
[indiscernible] (46:38)?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: So, Paul, I think, we're in a hybrid litigation. We have a stipulation that's been signed by all
but three parties. At the last meeting, we had 47 lawyers there. All but three of them were in agreement with the
undertaking. Not all of them – obviously, some of them were multiple representatives of individual signers to the issue.
We have been unable to get OCC to ever join American Electric Power in any settlement. That's just a standard, and we
understand that. And we tried very diligently. We made some what we thought were very reasonable proposals to the
OCC. They chose not to sign on. We tried but could not satisfy the near-term desires of FirstEnergy and IEU. IEU and
FirstEnergy look like peas in a pod.
So we did what we could in that endeavor. The Commission staff was very direct on what they needed to sign on to a
stipulation. I know within the structure of a regulatory commission, the staff works on its own. It doesn't get direction
from the commission. But clearly, they are there in the same building and they know what was required.
So it will follow that hybrid litigated path. We're pretty much done with the direct testimony and pretty much done with
cross-examination of witnesses. The staff stood strong behind the case. There is some concern with the MRO issue, but
price is not the sole determinant of whether you do or don't pass that test. There are other intangibles and tangibles, and
the staff witness was very clear about that, particularly if you read the redirect testimony where he proffered that price
is but one of a number of areas that the Commission needs to look at.
I think, as a subset, there is a great deal of support in the state of Ohio for the development of the shale gas play. I think
a very unique subset of what our stipulation provides for is the ability to, over time, determine that some of the
Muskingum River facilities might coal-retire and get replaced with new shale gas-fired natural gas. Those are some
encouragements.
Our customers see some real benefits in this, including, as I'd mentioned, many of our large customers, a 5% to 10%
reduction in their overall rates. And that has always left a puzzle for us as to why not everyone signed on to the
settlement. But it is what it is. And we've put in a great case. We don't get any signal from anybody that there is
concern over that. The Commission will issue an order; whatever it is, we'll take a look at it. If it is what we filed,
obviously we're happy. If it isn't, we'll take a look at that and look at what our options are once that's done.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Assuming that they give you something that's pretty close to what you guys have settled
on, when you mention that the point estimate for 2012 and you mentioned that it's within your guidance, can you give
us a flavor of where it might be in terms of a range that you guys might be contemplating for 2012?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: It would be premature to take that step now, Paul. But the day we get that order and we get
a little clarity on what the environmental spend might need to be in '12, we'll be the first to share that with you. And
because the ESP has some legs on it, in that it will be a '12, '13, '14 event, we'll probably give you a pretty good look in
the out years as well and how we see utilization of the megawatts as they free up in the marketplace for those years as
well.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then just finally with the EPA, you sort of suggested that there might be some
delays or some sort of more appropriate or more conciliatory timing issues. Could you elaborate a little bit on that? Do
you actually think something like that might happen and how that might show up, or is that just you being logical and

thinking in a logical way as to how things should just happen as to maybe how – what we're seeing on the part of the
EPAs public statements?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Well, we all have public positions that we take. We have had a number of meetings with
the administrator. We have had a number of meetings with the system administrator in charge of air. They are people
that we have great respect for. They are quite eager to listen and have been more than meeting us halfway in an open
discussion of the impacts.
They, like the RTOs, are very concerned about reliability. I don't think anyone in this administration or any
administration wants to have the lights flicker or go off in some region of the country by ill-thought-through
implementation of policies that – again, at the end of the day, I know my friends in the environmental community are
arguing that AEP stands for trashing the Clean Air Act, and nothing could be further from the truth. What we're
suggesting is, stretch this thing out to maybe 2018, have some RTO flexibility for two more years, and you can get to
the same environmental footprint without the risk of reliability issues, without the unnecessary expense of all of us
falling all over each other to do the same work at the same time.
That's why, quite honestly, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers had been lockstepped with us on this
issue from day one, as have the mine workers and boilermakers and some others. There's just a better approach to take
to this, and you get to the same environmental conclusion. The healthcare effects, we've got medical folks who say
they're not real; they've got medical folks who say they are absolutely real. Whether or not, that ends or wins the
argument is almost immaterial.
What we're trying to here is be rational. And again, if that happens or doesn't happen, we have a plan. We have a plan,
we've already begun some of the hard work that we'll have to implement in '12. We are prepared to do what we need to
do. But it clearly will entail shutting plants down prematurely and having the impact on the local property tax and
employees that that will have.
The other side of the equation is absolutely accurate: once you begin to put capital money to work, jobs are created.
The issue here is will the lights stay on, and that's the argument that we make. So it would be premature for me to say
that we really sense that they're moving, but they are listening, and they're rational people. And I – the public
pronouncements that the administrator made in Denver last week or earlier this week would surely indicate that that
may not be the case. But Democrats on the Hill are beginning to say, wait a second, on both the House and the Senate.
There are some pretty strong union movements or hey, wait a second.
So we're looking forward for some relief. Clearly, the move she made on CSAPR for allowing for a better and longer
ability to move resources across state borders was helpful. Not all that needed to be done; we'll be able to comment on
that. I think next week or the week after and we will enter again comments as requested on a better approach to that
particular undertaking. So they are listening, and they are adjusting, and we are all going to get to the same place,
cleaner air, better air quality, and at the end of the day, more appropriately priced electricity without the reliability risk.

<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Yes, sorry, I was on mute and my congratulations too, Mike. We will miss you.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Thank you much.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: And if I could just ask on sales, you talked about I think Industrial obviously supply may be
a little to the upside, and primary metals is the big driver, and this one aluminum customer. What's the underlying
picture like, and how does that relate to where you thought you would be, and just some broader comments on the
service territory?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Jonathan, industrials have been strong throughout the year. For the first time this quarter,
we've seen, in our top 10 industrials, four of those customers showed some quarter-on-quarter decreases, very modest
in about the 0.5% decrease quarter-on-quarter for the year. But, of course, remembering they're off some pretty
significant increases over time that they had experienced already last year.
So as Mike was saying, our Industrial sales have recovered 95% of their pre-recession levels through 2008. So
Industrial has been very strong. The rate of increase starting to slow down in some of the top 10 industrial sectors.
In the Residential side, the West is very strong and the East continues to struggle. The West is driven by improvements
in our Texas and Louisiana service territories, not least of which is the acquisition, as I mentioned, of the Valley
Electric Membership Corporation. So Residential really sees a split between East and West: West continuing strength
and East continuing to struggle.
And then on the Commercial side, both areas continue to struggle, up for the quarter, but year-to-date flat. We had
forecast for the full year a recovery in the Commercial sector of 0.7%, and it looks like we're not going to be able to
make that for the year, as we're already so far into the year and are just flat. And again, common results across both
East and West for that Commercial.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: It's interesting, Jonathan, when you think about some of the points Brian made. Out West
when we look at our SWEPCO operating company, we have a U.S. Steel facility that was shuttered and running at
minimum demand, but based on shale oil and shale gas developments throughout that region of the country, it's at 24/7
now. We are beginning to see, at AEP Ohio, some incredible reactivity in the steel industry for drillpipe going on, and
what that says is that jobs are coming back in the energy sector; jobs lead to better commercial demand and better
residential demand, so we are hopeful.
When we look at '12, like everyone, we are worried, but we are seeing some signs and at least on one half of the
Presidential debate you are beginning to see everybody talk about energy development. Tom Donohue over at the
Chamber is starting to say, look, there are literally millions of jobs sitting on the shelf. If America would simply
develop its energy resource rather than look at it as a negative, we could move this economy forward quickly.
I was at a meeting a week ago with Jaime Dimon, well known to all of you, who suggests that from his vantage point –
of course this works well for his bank – but from his vantage point, the U.S. economy is simply waiting for someone to
step on the gas instead of the brake. And getting rid of all these silly regulations would be the first step in the right
direction in developing the energy resource base. So I guess you, like Paul, might think I'm running for office, but if I
did that would be my platform.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Is it premature to give us some sort of insight into what your early look on '12 might be in
the sales department?
<A - Michael G. Morris>: It will be in that range that Brian talks about, which will include that 3.25 point.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Well, more of the actual sales number.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Yes, look we are looking for some sales growth not unlike we have looked before. We
came into this year looking for something on the order of 1% to 2%. We will probably look at the same kind of the
number going into next year.
<A - Charles E. Zebula>: Carey, we have time for one more question.

All right. And that comes from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Good morning, Mike and echo everyone else and congratulations and happy trails.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: Thanks, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Just wondering if we look into '12, how should we think about the EPS impact of the supreme
court remand? What's going to happen there?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: The TCC remand?
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Yes.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah, so we have already experienced the ongoing earnings impact of the carrying charges.
What will start to reflect once we securitize is the equity component of that realization, of that securitization. And we
anticipate that that will be prorated over the time of the securitization. So it's about $116 million, and if you say that
that's prorated over the seven-year anticipated securitization period, we will be able to get that equity component in
addition to the interest carrying charges that we will be able to realize on an ongoing basis.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: By $112 million divided by seven ...
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: $116 million of the equity component divided by seven, but more weighted towards the front
end of the amortization period.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Okay. And you talk about your 3.25 point estimate; does that assume that the Ohio settlement
doesn't get tweaked too much from its current form?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yes, it does. We are assuming the reasonable outcome at which is what we believe that we
filed with the Commission, and we don't anticipate much if any tweaking to that, given the parties that we have added
on to that stipulation, and we anticipate a positive result as we work very hard to achieve that with the settling parties.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: But I think it's important, Paul, that we make sure we make this statement about '12 as we
look at it. The 3.25 will be inside of a range. It's not the point estimate that we had before, but this is a team that's used
to delivering and '12 won't be any different than 2004 and every year that we've worked here before that. So it's going
to be more challenging than we thought it would be based on what we originally had filed, but it will be a test of the
skill sets of this team, which have really never failed to satisfy.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Just back to Jonathan's question about the 5% Industrial recovery you saw in the quarter. Is that
sustainable? Or was there anything weird about that other than that smelter coming back?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah. I mean I think the thing that's weird about it is that we are at now 95% of our
pre-recession industrial sales. So to assume that that would continue indefinitely, I think, would be unreasonable. As
we are approaching that 100% mark, that rate of increase we'll certainly expect that to come in over time. And as I said,
much of that increase was driven by that primary metals customer, which is our largest industrial customer. And then
again, in six of the top ten categories, we still continue to see increases in both the year-on-year and the quarterly, with
only some modest falling off of those sales increases from four of those top ten sectors.
<A - Michael G. Morris>: And I think it's interesting, Paul, when you look back at, as we stepped into the 2009 abyss,
the questions that you were all asking us then, what does this look like? Is this a redo of 1980? And what we said to you
then has come to pass. What we said about 1980 was a lot of our industrial manufacturing facilities closed down, never
to reopen.
What we've seen through this recovery in 2010, 2011 and we hope would go on in '12 is that most of them have gone
back to multiple 24/7 shifts from one shift to two to three, the aluminum guy is going from two-thirds production to full

production. Everything but Century Aluminum has been back to where we saw it before, without any major loss of
customers. And Ohio Governor Kasich has done an outstanding job of reinvigorating capital investment in Ohio, and
we'll continue to see that throughout our footprint. So we are pleased with all of that.
Michael G. Morris
Let me bring this to a close simply by saying one more time, thanks to each and every one of you for your comments at
the outset of your questions. Maybe that made your questions a little more friendly and I appreciate that. Let this old
dog go home without too many nicks. But this is a great team, and it's going to be in great hands, and it will continue to
be an incredibly low risk, as my good friend on Mad Money says, low risk, high yield, safer than the U.S. government.
Invest your money in American Electric Power. Thanks a lot, team.
