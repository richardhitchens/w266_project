Next, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are
forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially
from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties, which are
disclosed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement contained in our press release and in
our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
Please also note that on today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross
margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, and earnings per share. Historical non-GAAP financial
measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation posted on the
Investor Relations portion of our website at Dell.com and in our press release included in our 8-K filed today. I
encourage you to review these documents
Please also note that unless otherwise mentioned, all growth percentages refer to year-over-year progress.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Brian.
Brian T. Gladden
Thanks, Rob.
The second quarter is another proof point that we're executing well against our strategy. We have put a big focus on
accelerating revenue growth in our Enterprise Solutions and Services business, and we've refined our strategy to focus
on three solutions domains. The first domain is next-generation computing solutions and intelligent data management.
The second domain is services, security, and cloud. And the third domain is end-user computing.
A key point of differentiation in our strategy is our midmarket design focus, which provides open systems that are
highly capable, affordable, and flexible enough to scale and meet the needs of large enterprises, public institutions, and
midsized businesses.
We're making significant and thoughtful investments to develop and acquire industry leading intellectual property in
systems management, storage, security, and networking. Good proof points thus far are the accelerated growth in
KACE systems management, the broader adoption of EqualLogic and Compellent storage solutions, and SecureWorks
managed security success. And now we're very excited about adding Force10 Networks to our business.
We're also significantly increasing investment levels in our sales and go-to-market capabilities across the business.
These investments are substantial and are now contributing to our growth, shifting our mix, and improving our
operating income. At its core, our strategy builds on Dell's unique ability to deliver a set of competitively differentiated
midmarket solutions.
Our first half results clearly demonstrate our ability to execute our strategy and win in the marketplace. We delivered
very good financial results, with first half revenue up 1% and non-GAAP operating income up 59% year over year.
As part of our strategy, we continue to make deliberate decisions to eliminate low value added revenue from the
portfolio and focus on key strategic areas for growth. There's no question that our revenue growth is being impacted by
our strategy, but that's a tradeoff we're willing to make. Our core business remains healthy, and we continue to see solid
demand for our Server, Dell Storage, and Services businesses.
As we continue to execute on our cost initiatives across the business and focus on higher value products with
Dell-owned intellectual property throughout our business, our product margins remain strong and contributed to
outstanding operating income and excellent cash flow generation this quarter.
Let's review our second quarter results. The key performance metrics are provided for your reference on pages five and
six in the web deck. Consistent with our outlook provided in May, revenue in the second quarter was $15.7 billion, up
1% year over year and up 4% sequentially. Our Enterprise Solutions and Services business grew 4% to $4.6 billion.

On a GAAP basis, operating income was $1.1 billion or 7.3% of revenue. We delivered earnings per share of $0.48,
and earnings per share was up 71% year over year. For the rest of this call, I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures.
We delivered 23.2% gross margins, driven by continued strong product cost execution, disciplined pricing, and an
ongoing shift to higher value Dell technologies. We continue to eliminate lower margin business that's not strategic to
the company long term. Specific examples of this include exiting lower value reseller business in both Storage and
Software as well as unfavorable retail and reverse auction deals in our Client business.
OpEx was $2.3 billion or 14.7% of revenue. The sequential increase in OpEx was driven by a shift in mix of the
products in our business. We are selling more Dell technologies that bring higher margins but also require higher levels
of R&D and higher selling costs. These spending increases are deliberate and well aligned with our transformation.
We've been pretty transparent of our intent to make these investments in the enterprise and will continue to do so while
at the same time tightly managing G&A and discretionary costs elsewhere in the business. Additionally, OpEx is also
higher due to incentive based compensation associated with the strong profit performance we've experienced through
the first half of the year.
Operating income grew 52% to $1.3 billion or 8.5% of revenue. The commercial segments as a whole delivered 10.5%
operating income, representing a 280 basis point increase from the previous year.
Interest and other expenses were $55 million, driven by approximately $70 million in quarterly interest, offset by
investment income.
For the quarter, our tax rate was 21%, consistent with our outlook and consistent with prior quarter.
Earnings per share increased 69% year over year to $0.54 per share.
In the quarter, vendor settlements resulted in approximately a $70 million benefit that increased gross margins 50 basis
points and earnings per share by $0.04.
In the second quarter, our cash conversion cycle was a negative 34 days. Days payable improved five days, driven by
linearity and increased contract manufacturing volumes, offset by a typically seasonal increase of two days in days
sales outstanding while days inventory remained flat. There's no change in our view that our cash conversion cycle will
remain in the mid-negative 30 days over the course of the year.
Finally, a real highlight for the quarter is the record $2.4 billion that we generated in cash flow from operations, and
we've now delivered $5.2 billion for the trailing four quarters. And we ended the quarter with $16.2 billion in cash and
investments as well as repurchasing $1.1 billion worth of stock, as we called out at the analyst meeting in June.
Now let's take a look at the lines of business and regional performance, which you'll find detailed on pages 11 through
15 of the web deck. Enterprise Solutions and Services revenue grew 4% to $4.6 billion, driven by strong performance
in servers, Dell Storage, and Services. Brad will discuss Server and Storage businesses in just a moment.
Dell Services revenue grew 6% to $2 billion. We saw very good growth from new signings in the quarter that will lead
to future top and bottom line results. The total contract value of new contracts signed in the last quarter was $1 billion
and was $1.3 billion for the first half.
As you know, new signings in this business tend to put initial pressure on the P&L, but later generate sustained profit
over the life of the contract. In addition, we continue to see increased demand for our SecureWorks managed security
offerings and added 200 new customers this quarter.
Our Services backlog is now $15.4 billion, up 11% from a year ago, and this is split between $6.8 billion in deferred
extended warranty and $8.6 billion in contracted services backlog.
Our Client business continues to be strong. We have significantly improved gross margins and operating margins, even
while managing through a significantly lower cost deflation environment in the quarter. We've now sustained client
OpInc above 5% for the last three quarters and believe we can maintain this level of profitability on a sustainable basis.

In our second quarter, Client revenue was up sequentially 6% and down 1% year over year to $8.5 billion, driven by
our public business where Client revenue increased 34% sequentially.
We're seeing similar profitability improvement in our Software and Peripherals business, where gross margins have
improved over 400 basis points year over year and 80 basis points sequentially. S&P grew 1% to $2.6 billion as we
focus on significant pruning activities, and it now represents 16% of our revenue. This is a good example of an area
where we're exiting portions of the business where margin rates and returns are low and products are not strategic to
our solutions focus. For example, we've reduced and eliminated a large number of consumer electronics offerings.
Also, reselling of third-party software is an area where we would selectively eliminate low value and low margin
offerings.
Growth markets continue to be strong. We define growth markets as markets outside the U.S. and Canada, Western
Europe, and Japan. These geographies now account for 28% of Dell's revenue, and revenue was up 14% over the
previous year. Specifically, India and China were up 21% and 20% respectively. Regionally, revenue in APJ and
EMEA grew 17% and 1% respectively, while revenue in the Americas was down 4%. In APJ, Enterprise Solutions did
well, with profitability up nicely there.
Turning to our segment level performance, which is detailed on pages 16 through 20 in the web deck, large enterprise
revenue was up 1% to $4.6 billion, led by strong demand for servers and services. Server growth was 5% and Services
growth was 11%. OpInc as a percentage of revenue improved 350 basis points to 9.8% of revenue, and they generated
$448 million of operating income.
Our public business achieved record profitability in the quarter. Overall, public OpInc was $484 million and improved
290 basis points to 10.9% of revenue. Public revenue was down 3% year over year but up 18% sequentially to $4.5
billion. Consistent with our outlook, public saw a typical seasonal uptick in revenue that was most notably in our Client
business, which increased 34% sequentially. We experienced strong second quarter sequential demand for servers,
storage, and services, but see continued weakness in Europe and the U.S. federal business.
We're keeping a close eye on the U.S. federal spend through its fiscal year-end ramp on September 30. The pipeline of
opportunities focused on government productivity is actually very good, but will still depend on how quickly these
opportunities close over the course of the quarter.
Small and medium business revenue grew 5% to $3.7 billion. In the second quarter, server storage and services grew
year over year and most of the remaining EMC storage business has now transitioned to Dell Technologies.
Overall in the second quarter, we delivered operating income of $404 million, or 10.9% of revenue, which is 180 basis
point improvement year over year.
Consumer revenue was up 1% to $2.9 billion, driven by strong growth in EMEA and APJ, whereas Americas revenue
declined. We're actively managing this business and moving our product portfolio to higher value products while
exiting lower margin products and retail business. We're gaining share among midrange and high value products,
consistent with our strategy. We saw some softness during the last month of Q2 and moving into the third quarter. And
specifically, U.S. consumer has been weaker than we had expected. We will continue to monitor demand dynamics
closely in light of the current macro environment.
Overall, consumer delivered $73 million in operating income or 2.5% of revenue in the quarter. For the first half of the
year, consumer delivered 3.5% operating income, which is good consistent performance, and about where we would
expect to see profitability in the business at this time.
Now I'll turn it over to Brad Anderson to discuss results in our Enterprise Solutions businesses.

At the analyst meeting in June, we discussed in detail the strategic reshaping of our enterprise portfolio and the
investments we are make to enhance our solutions capabilities and core processes. Our differentiated strategy has two
key areas of focus. First is next-generation computing solutions and architectures that address key customer needs, the
solutions that are easy to implement and manage, that address physical and virtual management holistically, and extend
adoption for key technologies by packaging the right functionality and intelligence regarding ease of use.
The second key area of focus is intelligent data management, which is developing an architecture that unifies storage
subsystems, both block and file, and offers advanced functionality that can be used across them and across the data's
life cycle. By coupling our unified architecture with the intelligent policy engine, we can dramatically simplify and
automate data movement and access while optimizing cost.
We are both developing and acquiring IP and capabilities to execute our strategic enterprise objectives, position
ourselves in the high growth areas of the business, and enhancing our enterprise profitability. Some recent announced
solutions and services include the Dell OpenStack Cloud Solution, which is the first available cloud solution offering
based on the OpenStack platform. We are now the first vendor to warrant servers and working environments with
temperatures up to 113 degrees Fahrenheit; unfortunately, like what we're seeing in Texas these days. And we
announced a partnership with Cloudera to provide solutions that reduce the complexity and costs associated with
Hadoop systems that processes large amounts of data.
With respect to acquisitions, the acquisition of Force10 will accelerate our next-generation computing and data
management strategies and greatly enhance the breadth of solutions we can provide for our data center customers. The
Force10 products and IP are very well positioned in the fastest growing segment of the data center networking.
Force10's history of product innovation and technology leadership and data center networking is very complementary
and very much aligned to our enterprise and network division, which we are calling the Virtual Network Services
Infrastructure or VNSI for short.
VNSI enables change to happen at the speed of the business and specifically addresses a simpler, more open network
environment that is easier to view, manage, and control, and one that can scale through today's requirements as well as
into the future.
A few of the Force10 solutions that exemplify the innovation and technology leadership include the Z series family of
switches, which is redefining the economics of price performance in switching through dense, high performance
switches that operate at lower power consumption and total cost. This platform is particularly appealing to the
midmarket segment; the innovative Adit series of top-of-rack switches, which can host third-party applications and
enhance network services at state-of-the-art low latencies for the most demanding applications; and finally, the E Series
chassis, which supports mission critical applications and increased network capability and efficiency, again at very
much reduced power and cooling cost.
We are on track. Because of the disciplined integration approach, we are targeting to close this within the next two to
three weeks.
Now let me tell you something about the rest of the business. The benefits of our midmarket design focus are clearly
evident in the success of EqualLogic, which continues to be a highly profitable line of storage and remains the leader in
the iSCSI market. The launch of the Dell EqualLogic FS7500 during the quarter brings the first scale-out NAS and
unified storage capabilities to the Dell EqualLogic platform. The FS7500 provides up to 10 times more file share
scalability than the legacy unified storage offerings in the marketplace today. It is the industry's only scale-out solution
optimized for midsize and smaller deployments.
Dell also announced its next-generation Dell EqualLogic software, which includes enhanced enterprise class storage
capabilities and automated load balancing. This is the second solution we have introduced utilizing IP from the Exanet
acquisition, and is another excellent example of our ability to effectively integrate acquired technologies into our
portfolio.
Similar to the early results we saw in EqualLogic, we are already seeing very promising results for Compellent.
Customers are clearly attracted to the fluid data architecture, as evident by our Q2 results. In its first full quarter after

being acquired, revenue is up 97% sequentially. Our global sales team and partners have delivered in a significant
expansion across the regions, as we sold Compellent in 47 countries in Q2 compared to only 30 in Q1.
In Q2, our total storage revenue declined 20%, but growth in Dell owned IP continued to show strength, up 15%, led by
the SMB segment growing at 27% year over year. This ongoing change in mix of our storage portfolio to more Dell IP
continues to benefit margins, as gross margin percent has increased approximately 800 basis points over the past 12
months, and trailing 12-month margin dollars are up over 16% year over year.
The server and networking business continues to benefit from a corporate refresh and midmarket focus. Our server and
networking revenue for the quarter increased 9%, with SMB up 17% year over year. Much of the strength overall is
driven by the continued push to virtualization. This continues to be a very important trend for our business, as it has
created more opportunities in Services and Storage as our customers are looking for end-to-end solutions to support
their virtualized environments. While we are pleased with the progress we have made and the results from this quarter,
we have more to do and are even more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
Now let me turn it back over to Brian.
Brian T. Gladden
Thanks, Brad.
Let's turn to the outlook. We're focused on delivering efficient IT solutions that provide both efficiency and flexibility
for our customers and value for our shareholders. We believe this will align our business with large and faster growing
markets, create a broader base of recurring revenue streams with higher profit potential, and reshape the P&L for the
company.
We've made significant progress during the last 18 months, and we are absolutely committed to our strategy which is
delivering growth in revenue, operating income, and cash flow, consistent with our long-term value creation
framework.
In addition, we've made great strides in optimizing our supply chain. And that has helped to make our core business
more healthy, profitable, and competitive globally.
As a result of these combined efforts, we're raising our operating income growth expectations for FY 2012 to 17% to
23% year over year versus our previous view of 12% to 18%. This total year outlook would be on top of last year's
non-GAAP operating income growth of 40%, and would likely put our profitability performance in line with our
long-term value creation targets.
On the revenue side, when we combine the strategic decisions to redirect resources from lower to higher value
solutions with a demand environment that has become more uncertain, particularly in light of recent macroeconomic
news, we're revising our FY 2012 revenue outlook to 1% to 5% growth versus our previous view of 5% to 9%. For the
third quarter, we see revenue roughly flat relative to our second quarter, which is in line with seasonality we've seen
over the last two years.
As you've heard from us on many occasions, we're managing the business for the long term. This is particularly
relevant during periods of increased short-term volatility in the demand environment. Assuming global IT spending
that's approximately 1.5 times GDP, we're committed to making the best decisions for our customers and shareholders
over time versus managing to a more variable short-term environment as the global economy heads towards a more
sustained recovery.
We anticipate interest and other to be around $70 million in expense, and we expect our full-year tax rate to be between
21% and 23%.
We're executing well on our strategy in an increasingly mixed demand environment. And we will continue to manage
the business for operating income expansion while investing in our business for the long term.

With that, I'll turn it over to Michael.
Michael S. Dell
Thanks, Brian.
We're pleased with our results in the first half, especially in Enterprise Solutions and Services. Our sustaining strong
growth in operating profits, earnings per share, and cash flow demonstrate that our strategy is working well. Customers
are validating our approach and continue to turn to Dell for productivity solutions regardless of the economic backdrop.
And you will see us continue to identify opportunities in a disciplined way that will generate profitable growth.
We're excited about our pending acquisition of Force10 Networks, but we know that value is created not by acquiring
companies, but rather by successfully integrating them along with continued investments in research and development
and sales capabilities. It's early, but we're building a strong track record of successful integrations.
Both our organic and inorganic investments are being made with a midmarket design focus. This emphasis is driving
more innovative thinking across our entire company and aligns with the largest engines of the growth, innovation, and
thought leadership in our industry. When you think about iSCSI, industry standard servers, virtualization, social
computing, and new collaboration tools, it all starts in the midmarket. This expansion of our capabilities and solutions
is opening up a broader base of the nearly $3 trillion IT market. These are exciting times for our team and our
customers, and we look forward to continuing to update you on our strategic progress.
With, that let's now open it up for questions and answers.
Robert L. Williams
Thanks, Michael; just a quick reminder to everyone on the line to please limit your questions to one with one
follow-up. Kristen, can we have the first question?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brian Marshall with Gleacher & Company.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great. Thanks, guys. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the new revenue
outlook with respect to the implications of the lower IT demand outlook out there relative to deemphasizing some of
the lower end margin businesses.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Brian, it's clear that the demand environment is weaker and a bit more uncertain than
what we had in our previous view. And we highlighted the U.S. and the developed countries as a driver there,
especially the consumer business. I would also say that the U.S. federal buying right now is a bit – we see a lot of push
out, but there are opportunities there. While the pipeline itself looks pretty good, the ability to close those has slipped
month to month as we move throughout the year.
The second element, obviously, is really our continued work around deemphasizing lower value business. I think that
clearly is contributing and results in lower revenue growth for the company. I think that's net-net a good thing for us,
obviously contributing to profitability, and it's something that we'll continue as we work through the portfolio and
mixing the business to higher value products.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Okay; having said that, a quick clarification. On the SMB side, it looks like your operating
margins were down about 140 basis points sequentially. Can you talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes there?

Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I think SMB in general was probably the strongest market. We saw, as you look at the
segments, it clearly had 5% year-over-year growth in revenue, a relatively stable margin environment for SMB,
continue to mix the business up. And it's clearly a space where you would see us making investments and higher OpEx
in the short term ahead of some of the growth with some of the new solutions and midmarket focused products and
services. So that's the fundamental dynamic, a place where we're making some investments, and that's affecting the
operating income in the short term.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great, thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Could you just talk a little bit more about the gross margin environment and what's
baked into your outlook for the rest of the year? You also, Brian, if you can reconcile those vendor settlements that you
said were positive in the quarter and whether those are recurring in nature as well and the component environment?
Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Ben. Again, we say it all the time, but we're focused on operating income. You're going
to continue to see a change in the shape of P&L as we mix more and more to higher value solutions and services. That's
going to be a macro trend that we think will continue.
We clearly have seen good execution in the team in terms of overall margins. I think a lot of things we've been talking
about for a long time with the supply chain, the product portfolio, sales execution around pricing, good pricing
environment continue to be elements that drive the performance here. The component cost environment we saw in the
quarter was relatively flat sequentially, which is clearly significantly less deflation than what we've seen over the last
few quarters. So I think the fact that margins continue to be relatively robust in the business in that environment, we
feel pretty good about that. We think it's a good proof point around our ability to sustain those margins and drive the
mix of the business as we move forward.
As it relates to the vendor settlements, I'm not going to get into specific details there. There are a couple specific items
there that we would have these from time to time. And in this case, it's just material enough that we called it out in the
quarter, but there's not anything specific we'll provide there.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: And my follow-up just on Storage, the ongoing growth rate is well below what you
have talked about long term for your target, where you get significantly in the double-digit range. How long of a ramp
until we get there? I know you have to anniversary out the EMC revenue, but it looked like the core Dell IP slowed a
bit too in the quarter. So how long until we get to the growth rate in Storage that you've been talking about at your
Analyst Day? Thanks and that's it.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Hey, Ben, on the storage side because of EMC being ramped down, we have always taken
the position that we think by the end of the year we're going to start being, again, accretive on our revenue growth.
We're already seeing the double digits, obviously, in the Dell branded IP. But we've just got to work through the tail of
EMC. And so we continue to be on a path that by end of year, we should be positive Storage growth overall and
continue to be in double digits for Dell IP.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Thank you very much.

<A - Robert L. Williams>: Toni?
Operator
One moment. Okay, Toni, your line is open.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Thank you. I wanted to get your perspectives on operating expenses. I certainly appreciate
the incremental investment that it takes to sell your own IP, some of the front-loading in sales and service. But the
magnitude of the operating expense increase over the last year is really significant. Your year-over-year revenues this
quarter were up $124 million. Your Enterprise revenues, which I appreciate may be driving that extended OpEx, were
up about $250 million. Yet your OpEx was up $500 million. So for $500 million in incremental OpEx, you're getting
net for the company an extra $100 million-plus in revenue and $250 million-plus in Enterprise. That certainly doesn't
sound like a good short-term trade. So perhaps you can explain a little bit about whether there's anything one-time, how
much of the increased OpEx is related to the higher compensation levels on a year-over-year basis, and when we can
expect this to flatten out as a percentage of revenue or decline as a percentage of revenue. And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Toni, I think your comment – we're not thinking about it as a short-term dynamic here.
These are clearly longer-term investments that we're making to reshape the business. I think we're focused on operating
income. We've talked about the fact that operating expense as a percentage of revenue is going to rise in the business.
All of the things that we're investing in, all of the acquisitions we're making are clearly in areas where OpEx is going to
be a significantly higher percentage of revenue. Therefore, we've got to see gross margin expansions that go with that,
but that's going to be a dynamic that will ultimately continue in the business.
Recognize that we spend a lot of time talking about the revenue environment and what that means, and you may see us
in some areas make some decisions to slow down investments, strategic investments as we look at the environment, but
we're committed to the long-term transformation. Some of the things I'll highlight that really contribute to the growth,
we've talked about sales specialists around Enterprise products. They now represent about 30% of our selling cost. We
added in this quarter alone over 2,000 growth oriented resources that are focused on R&D as well as selling these kinds
of products and solutions. I'd also highlight the fact that G&A is generally down in the business, and we continue to
manage this pretty tightly.
There's one other thing I'd call out. Obviously, as you think about the profit that we've delivered in the first half of the
year, we would also have relatively significant sequential impact from higher incentive-based compensation, so the
bonus plan in the business that's tied to higher profitability that we've seen in the first half of the year. Those are the
dynamics. It's a deliberate set of investments that we're driving, and it's a long-term transformation that ultimately we're
enabling here.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: And where along that path of investments are you? So perhaps you can quantify the
year-over-year impact of the incentive-based comp and whether you think that will continue in the second half. And
then where on that path are you because certainly you've front-loaded the expense? And so should we continue to
expect that second half OpEx expense will continue to increase from levels seen in Q2?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Again, I think we are watching the demand environment, Toni. And I think as we look at
that and specifically execute on these longer-term investments, there are some places where we'll maybe slow down
and clearly make some decisions to manage through some of that short-term dynamic.
I think the simple answer is we're going to continue to make the long-term investments. I think you'll see us as we look
at that second half operating income outlook that we've provided to you make the appropriate tradeoffs there between
costs based on the revenue environment that we see. And we feel confident with that 17% to 23% in the environment
that we see that we can make those tradeoffs and deliver that commitment.

Your next question is from Maynard Um with UBS.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi, thanks. Dell has typically had pretty good visibility to down and upturns given your Direct
business. Can you just talk about whether you started seeing that at the end of the quarter, whether that intensified into
August, just the timelines? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Maynard, we're saying third quarter feels like flat. I think that's pretty consistent with
what we've seen over the last couple years in terms of sequential dynamics. I would say that we saw some weakening
in parts of the market in the second half of the quarter that I would say we've seen continue. That would be the things
we highlighted: the U.S. consumer market clearly. The federal business is – again, there are some opportunities there.
But I think the question is how much of that gets closed out before the end of the fiscal year within the federal
government. So yes, it has clearly been a bit softer in the last few weeks. And obviously, we're monitoring that as we
move throughout the quarter.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Okay. And secondly, I just wanted to follow up on the question of OpEx. It sounds like you're
incrementally, obviously incrementally more concerned here on the macro side. And I'm wondering if your OpEx or
the way you've thought about OpEx, obviously you're going to continue to invest. But has that changed relative to the
revenues, or is this still the original plan on the lower revenues? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I think we're committed to the plan in terms of reshaping the business. I think given the
dynamics we're seeing from a demand standpoint in the marketplace, we're relooking at some of the timelines around
some of those investments. And I think it may mean a little bit different timeline in some of that. But I think in general,
you'll see us continue to make those investments. There are other areas within the business where we've consistently
been reducing OpEx spending to enable some of that funding, and we'll continue to drive those activities as well.
Operator
Your next question is from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Yes, Brian, I was hoping you could give us an update on your plans for share repurchase
in the back half of the year given that you did so much in the second quarter.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Richard, I wouldn't say anything different than what we said at the analyst meeting. I
think we're committed to this longer-term outlook of 10% to 30% of free cash flow. Free cash flow is pretty good, so
that obviously gives us a little bit more opportunity here. We are committed to the strategic investments that will
continue to be a use of cash. And we would expect the second half of the year, as we said at the analyst meeting, to
return to more of a normal level consistent with what we had prior to the second quarter.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay. The price of the stock is obviously pretty attractive here. So it sounds like you do
continue to have plans to buy back stock in the back half of the year but maybe not at the Q2 level. Is that the right way
to think about it?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, we'll continue to look at it. We're committed to continuing the program, and that's the
current view.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay. And since everybody else is asking a follow-up, I guess I'll ask a follow-up on the
health of the corporate upgrade cycle. You talked about incremental weakness in U.S. consumer and federal. Are there
other areas where you've seen a little bit of incremental caution or weakness here in recent weeks?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, maybe we'll let Michael comment as well. But I think in terms of corporate demand
between SMB and large enterprise has continued to be pretty solid. Those programs are multi-quarter, multiyear
programs to generally refresh and upgrade around servers as well as clients, and most of those activities continue.
We're not seeing significant disruption there. Maybe Michael can add a comment.

<A - Michael S. Dell>: Yes, that's right. The demand has been pretty steady, as Brian said. The upgrade programs that
companies have tend to be multi-quarter, and we haven't really seen significant change in those.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you for taking my question. My first question is just on the Google Motorola
acquisition, Michael, if you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on how this might change your strategy or how
you see it changing the mobile landscape.
<A - Michael S. Dell>: It's early to say because I don't think Google has – they obviously haven't finished the
transaction and they haven't said a whole lot about it. But I think certainly patents play a big role here and having
Android with a stronger ability to exhaust patent claims against it probably sets up an interesting competitive dynamic.
We're still quite interested in Android. I'll also tell that you our early work on Windows 8 on the tablet side looks to be
pretty encouraging. And so we think it's shaping up to be a competitive environment. I don't think beyond those two
that there are viable alternatives that make sense. So there's a lot of other noise out there in the market that I don't think
will amount to much of anything.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay, great. And then, Brian, if you could talk a little bit on the cash flow side, just any
more color you can give us on the drivers during the quarter, anything that might reverse itself in coming quarters just,
again, given the strength this quarter. Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Shannon, I think pretty solid cash performance; when you look at the cash, the
underlying cash earnings very strong. One of the elements you see is real strength in our Services deferred revenue
balance where we built that. That's up 11% year over year. That bodes well for the future and obviously contributes
cash in the short term. The cash conversion cycle, as we've said consistently, we think the mid-negative 30 days is the
range that we're in, and we think that's pretty sustainable. So I feel pretty good about the cash flow and its
sustainability.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great, thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from Brian Alexander with Raymond James.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Yes, I guess going back to the OpEx issue, have the hires you've made over the last 12
months generated the productivity results that you expected? And how do you measure that so that you can get
comfortable that these investments are generating appropriate returns? And when should we expect to see a noticeable
acceleration in your top line growth, which obviously you would expect in making these investments? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Brian, it's clearly something that we're tracking very, very closely. And I think one of the
things that I think is new and different is really having dedicated resources that are aligned with specific solutions, and
therefore our ability to track closely the progress we're making and the productivity we're getting from those
incremental resources. So I would tell you without providing, obviously, a lot of data there that we feel good about that.
In many cases, we have gates and the ability to modulate the pace at which we hire based on how that productivity is
playing out and how the solutions are growing. And it's absolutely clear that there are many cases where we're
investing this OpEx ahead of the revenue and margin that's going to come with it.
One of the dynamics is you look at some of the areas where we're growing quickly today. Whether you look at KACE,
whether you look at Compellent, whether you look at EqualLogic, these are all areas that have significant services
attached and very high margin attached services that ends up in deferred revenue. So that ends up being a nice annuity

for the business as we move forward. And it looks like in the short term like a big OpEx investment without a lot of
payoff. So I think you see that's one of the key elements that drives an 11% increase in the deferred balances. A lot of
these acquisitions and new technologies are ultimately contributing to that.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Okay, thanks. And just to follow up, how much of a drag on growth is the pruning that
you talked about having? How much of that is depressing your top line for the quarter and for your full-year outlook of
1% to 5% growth?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, I think it's a tough question to answer. There are specific areas we can highlight,
whether it's obviously the EMC wind down, whether it's specific software reseller agreements that we've walked away
from as a result of margin. Those are much easier to quantify and those are significant. Obviously, we could put
numbers on that of over $1 billion clearly associated with those activities. And then there's a more subjective area
where you have transactions and deals that you're choosing not to participate in, which is incremental to that. So if it's a
couple points on the total revenue, that wouldn't be surprising. It could be even more than that.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Okay, thanks so much.
Operator
Your next question is from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of the
competitive pricing environment, particularly in the Client business? And as you look into the second half, how are you
thinking about the pricing environment, particularly given what you're seeing with demand conditions right now?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Bill, I think the gross margins, I think, continue to be relatively stable, and we feel
pretty good about how that overall equation is playing out with component prices versus the overall pricing
environment.
I think in general, prices have been relatively – pricing has been relatively benign around the Client business, and that
continued for a few quarters now. And as we look going forward, that's obviously one of the areas where we would
continue to monitor the dynamics of the marketplace and react accordingly. But clearly, it has been relatively benign
when compared to historical trends.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thanks, good afternoon, just a follow-up to the question on pricing, Brian. There's a comment in
the slide deck about increased competition in large commercial accounts. Does that have to do with pricing competition
in large commercial accounts, or is that just a change in the Financing business?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Katy, I think your comment is actually on a slide for the DFS business, for Dell
Financial Services.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Right, right. I guess that's the question. Was it a change in pricing competition, or just a change
in competition around financing in those accounts?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: It was specific to the Dell Financial Services large enterprise originations and clearly some
different dynamics that are playing out with – in some cases with banks, for instance, becoming competitive in some of
those transactions that I guess we would call out as the primary driver there.

<Q - Katy Huberty>: Okay, got it. And then just a quick follow-up. Obviously a few questions about OpEx. And it's
clear what the strategy is. But as you think near term, with revenues flat into the third quarter, would you expect OpEx
to be flat sequentially, or with higher bonuses, does OpEx come up again in the third quarter?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I'm not going to get into the quarterly guidance at that level, Katy. I think we'll continue to
monitor the demand environment, and we're making the appropriate adjustments to the OpEx spend as we move
forward based on the environment.
So I think within the context of the operating income guidance we've provided, I think we'll let you think about that in
the detail you want to.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Okay, thanks.

Your next question is from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, Brian. I wanted to ask you a question about the year-over-year guidance and what it
implies for the January quarter.
It looks like to be above more than 1% annual growth, you need a seasonal bump in the January quarter of something
like 4% to 5%.
But I was just hoping could you perhaps give some color at least on what you're seeing today on what you're thinking
about the seasonality for the January quarter. I assume the consumer would be fairly weak, but the commercial side
sounds like it continues to be strong. Could you give any color on how you're thinking about the seasonality in
January? And then I have a follow-up, please.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, I think that – I mean some of those comments are fair. I think commercial demand
continues to be a key driver that we're counting on being relatively stable, as we've said.
There are really two areas that we're monitoring closely that will have a big impact there. It's the consumer business
and how that plays out. That would be a typical driver of seasonal pickup, third quarter to fourth quarter for us. And
we're counting on some of that, obviously, in this case, off of a lower third quarter, obviously. And then the overall
public spend, I think those are the things that we'll watch.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: So is mid-single-digits sequential growth a reasonable place to start for the January quarter?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, I think that's the way we're thinking about it, and it's fairly easy to back into that based
on the way we're providing the outlook now.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, fair enough. Then my follow-up is on Services. You had very strong sequential
growth in backlog. And it looks like a lot of the growth was in contracted services. And I think you highlighted in your
prepared remarks that that might have some impact on margins for Services in particular.
So I was hoping you could just give us some color as you look out over the next couple quarters, will Services margins
be flattish, up, or down?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, I think there's always a cycle of new contract signings happening. And there's always,
therefore, the impact on margins of those upfront investments you need to make to get those contracts up and running.
So look, I think in general, I wouldn't call that out as a pressure that we're going to say we have in the next few quarters
here.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.

<A - Brian T. Gladden>: We're going to have other contracts that we signed two years ago that are hitting their stride
and improving in terms of their margin.
So I think that cycle always continues, and we'll manage our way through it. I don't have any specific callouts on why
Services margins would dramatically change, other than the fact that we're trying to grow the business and mix the
business up.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, fair enough. Thanks very much.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: You're welcome.
Operator
Your next question is from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Thanks very much. I wanted to follow up on the margin question one more time. Your
guidance seems to imply that back-half margins, operating margins I'm speaking about, will be somewhere in the 7%
range, low 7% range versus the 8.5% you just reported. Is that decline expected to be more on the gross profit line or
the operating margin line?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Again, we're not going to provide that level of granularity in the outlook. I think we're
intentionally giving you operating income because that dynamic is going to change over time, and I think we want to
stay out of that discussion.
I think what you'll see is that's our outlook based on the market conditions we see now and the uncertainty. And as we
move forward and get through the third quarter, we'll obviously update you at that time. And I think we're reshaping the
P&L over time, and we need the flexibility to do that and not get into here's what the gross margin is going to be versus
here's what the OpEx is going to be in a quarter.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: As my follow-up, I want to go back to the demand environment on the corporate side of your
business. I'm just trying to reconcile your comments around steady demand with decelerating revenue growth against
easier compares in both the Enterprise business and the SMB business. Help me understand why you're seeing slowing
year-on-year growth, yet characterize the business as being healthy. Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I think you've got to break it into pieces here. And clearly as you look at the second quarter
results, we saw server growth at 9%. We saw the Dell Storage business at 15% growth, which is the Dell technologies.
We saw the Services business at 6%. So there are clearly some areas where we're seeing relatively strong growth.
I would also highlight the growth markets. And specifically India and China continue to be growing at greater than
20% in the quarter, and we expect that to continue.
As you look at overall dynamics of the P&L, those are clearly important areas where we're making investments, but
we're seeing very strong margins that come with that.
As you think about the second half, we would expect those to continue. And I think that's where we say that there's
relatively good stability. And I would just say that specifically client refresh activity in the corporate environment
continues.
So those are areas that we're counting on to be relatively stable. I think there are others that we called out quite a few
times on the call here that we think are a bit weaker, and consumer is clearly one of those.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Thanks a lot.

Your next question is from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Brian, I wanted to see if you can come back to the public
sector for a moment here. You talked about your total server revenue growth of around 9%. Can you give us some
context around what the public grew?
I know you talked about Client revenue being up 34% sequentially. But I'm just trying to get a sense in terms of what
drove the public outperformance in terms of operating margin whereas the other segments were down sequentially in
operating margin. Was it server or storage being much bigger than expected because maybe of a pre-budget flush ahead
of some of the government challenges out there?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I wouldn't say that. We can let Brad comment on the dynamics he's seeing in public around
some of his products, and then maybe I can talk about the P&L a little bit.
<A - Bradley R. Anderson>: Yes, on the public side, we didn't see a big spike in server revenue growth on the public
side, so it was less than the 9%.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, it was slightly less than 9%.
<A - Bradley R. Anderson>: It was slightly less than 9%. It was reasonable.
Where we see most of the server growth was in the SMB segment, and then particularly it was incredibly strong in the
Asian market.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, I think the total P&L discussion from a sequential standpoint is really about nice
leverage in the P&L. We saw nice overall revenue growth in that part of the business tied to the U.S. federal – or the
state and local timing. We saw good solid growth in both education and healthcare. And I think as you think about that,
that just contributed on a relatively good cost environment to have good leverage in the P&L in the quarter.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay, thank you. And then the follow-up is around the growth markets commentary. You
talked about the growth being around 17% year over year. That did decelerate versus the prior quarter.
I'm just trying to get a sense in terms of what does that mean going forward here? I know we have some pretty big
numbers here year over year for growth markets. But going from 17% growth down to 14%, are we going to single
digits now next quarter in terms of year-over-year growth in growth markets, and what are the drivers there?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I think we highlighted two of the drivers. Clearly India and China continued to be for us
relatively strong. We would expect that that will continue.
I think there's a couple of other places where you're seeing a little bit tougher compares and maybe less growth. Brazil
is an example where probably you saw mid-single growth in the quarter, and we think that's still a great market that has
lots of growth potential.
So we're still bullish on the growth countries playing a big role for us and continuing to grow at double digit rates for
sure.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you.

<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Thanks, guys, for taking the questions. Most of them have been asked and answered, but I
want to go back to the Storage piece of the business.
Obviously, you guys are folding in Compellent into this quarter. I know you guys reported 15% growth ex-EMC. But
just from a math perspective, it looks like that would imply a pretty sharp deceleration in the EqualLogic business

organically.
Can you talk a little bit about what the trend is specifically within EqualLogic and what you might be seeing from a
competitive landscape perspective?
<A - Bradley R. Anderson>: Yes, a couple things. One is we still see EqualLogic still as the iSCSI leader, and we still
see strong demand for the Dell IP.
What we did see in the quarter was we had a little bit of headwind where we've had to recall a vendor, a second tier
supplier, so we had a little bit of supply chain hiccup. We've done that, so that provided a little bit of headwind.
And then probably the other headwind was we just announced and we're starting to ship, actually this week, the next
generation EqualLogic controller and new software. And so I think we saw a little bit of waiting for the brand new
hardware to come out this week.
So I think the combination of those two things probably dampened it a little bit. Of course, those are now completely
behind us. And so the supply chain thing has been completely rectified, and we are now in a position to ship the new
products. So I see us being a little bit more balanced going into Q3.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: And then the follow-up question for me would on the server side. How are you thinking
about, relative to your current guidance, server and networking growth?
In particular, I think there have been a lot of questions thrown around, around obviously sitting in front of a transitional
cycle from Intel platforms. How are you thinking about that cycle? Are you factoring in any pause in front of that
potential product cycle?
<A - Bradley R. Anderson>: The actual launch of the next Intel platform is not yet real obvious or clear as far as the
timing. So I think we're still seeing the server refresh cycle continue. This is, I think, the seventh quarter of positive
growth. We're still seeing those configurations be rich, which is really helping the ASPs.
In fact, ASPs continue to trend up year over year, where the historical trend has always been down. I think this is,
again, probably the fifth or sixth period where we've had trending up ASPs.
So it continues to be pretty reasonable, and I would expect it to continue for the next quarter or so.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Thank you.

Your final question today is from Abhey Lamba with ISI Group.
<Q - Abhey Lamba>: Yes, thanks. Brian, I think the U.S. consumer was weak when you last gave guidance as well.
Have you seen things deteriorate since then, or were you expecting some pickup that is not coming in?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I guess it's hard to answer it that way. It has clearly been – we saw some weakness in the
second half of the quarter relative to what we were expecting coming into the quarter. So in that sense, it has gotten
weaker for sure.
<Q - Abhey Lamba>: Got it. And once you complete the Force10 acquisition, should we expect a similar impact on
the networking business as we are seeing with storage, where EMC is going down faster than growth in other sales?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I'll let Brad talk to that. But there will clearly be a similar dynamic where low margin
revenue today we have where we're reselling networking products will be replaced by Dell technology that has
significantly higher margins.
<A - Bradley R. Anderson>: No, Brian is absolutely right. Now the big difference here is that we didn't resell any
particular network vendor anywhere near the scale of EMC, and so there's less of a trough, if you will, that gets

emptied. But we clearly are going to drive Dell branded IP and we are really excited about the Force10 product. It's
leading technology. It's extremely complementary. We will continue to sell some other products to complement the
portfolio. But where we now have leading industry IP, we're going to sell the Dell branded.

Before we wrap up, let me just make one statement. I think clearly lots of proof points in the financial performance;
and really even when you look at it over the last year around our strategy and the investments that we're making, when
you look at it over the last four quarters, we've delivered $2.07 of non-GAAP earnings per share, which is up 83%.
Over the same period, we've delivered a GAAP operating income level of 7.3%, which is actually over our long-term
value creation framework.
We have improved gross margins by 600 basis points from a year ago and held them relatively steady over some
different component environments. We've also added over 300 basis points of OpEx, as we've discussed on the call
here, and we would say that all of that is deliberate and in critical strategic areas that we've been incredibly transparent
about. The P&L has changed pretty dramatically, consistent with really what we said we were going to do. And on top
of that, we generated $5.2 billion of cash flow from operations over the last year. So a lot of great proof points in terms
of the progress we're making, and we look forward to continuing to do that.
