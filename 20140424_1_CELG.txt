I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert J. Hugin
Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. It's an important and exciting day for us as
we announce a very promising addition to our late stage pipeline, the attainment of significant regulatory milestones,
demonstrable progress in advancing our internal and external pipeline programs, and solid first quarter results.
Our teams across the globe produced excellent results while advancing strategic corporate initiatives.
Our commercial teams increased product sales by 19% year-over-year, with total revenue rising by 18% to $1.73
billion. The leverage of our operating model was further demonstrated by the 113 basis point improvement in our
operating margin which contributed to a 22% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings per share. These excellent
results were achieved while absorbing the full impact of generics Azacitidine in the U.S. and other first quarter specific
events that Jackie will review. Based on solid first quarter results and the strong underlying demand across our product
portfolio, we're confident on our outlook for the remainder of the year.
Several important achievements during the quarter strengthened our growth outlook. We announced the U.S. approval
of OTEZLA for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis on March 21. In a moment Scott will review the progress of the
launch. We also announced this morning that we have accomplished the important milestones of submitting regulatory
applications in both the E.U. and in the United States for REVLIMID as a treatment for newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma.
Tangible progress was achieved in multiple pipeline programs. Partner programs from Agios and Acceleron were
highlighted at recent medical meetings. Very promising data were presented at the American Association for Cancer
Research meeting on AG-221, a first-in-class potent inhibitor of the IDH2 mutant protein implicated in multiple
malignancies. Our teams are accelerating development plans right now.
Encouraging interim Phase II data were present at the National Kidney Foundation meeting treating chronic kidney
disease with Sotatercept or ACE-011. We're advancing our Acceleron collaboration in not only chronic kidney disease
but also MDS and Beta-Thalassemia. Important late stage programs studying REVLIMID, oral Azacitidine and
ABRAXANE, and numerous indications advanced during the quarter.
Our internally generated early stage pipeline achieved milestones including the initiation of clinical studies with our
JNK inhibitor, targeting fibrotic diseases and the completion of dose range finding studies for CC-220, our immune
inflammatory directed [indiscernible] (4:30). We plan to initiate Phase II trials in sarcoidosis and lupus with 220 later
this year.
Exciting new collaborations with Abide and FORMA Therapeutics were established, further enhancing our diverse and
deep pipeline. It's an infrequent opportunity to be able to add a potentially transformative late stage asset to a pipeline.
We are very excited about the potential of GED-301(sic) [GED-0301]. 301 is an oral antisense DNA oligonucleotide
compound that recently completed a 166-patient, multi-center Phase II study in Crohn's Disease. The Phase II data has
been submitted to a major medical journal and will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. We acquired the

rights to 301 from Nogra Pharma Limited, a private pharmaceutical company that specializes in the early stage
development of gastrointestinal-targeted therapies. They have the track record of having successfully developed the
currently marketed product in this therapeutic category.
We believe that 301 has the potential to redefine the standard of care in Crohn's Disease. We plan to initiate a Phase III
registration program this year. Our investment in GED-301 not only reflects our belief in its exceptional potential value
to patients but also reflects our confidence in the future of our I&I franchise.
We're energized by the progress achieved during the quarter and are committed to delivering on our goals for the
remainder of the year. Jackie, Mark and Scott will add their perspective the on our results and on the considerable
opportunities in the coming quarters.
Let me now turn the call over to Jackie.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse
Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our Q1 call. We're off to a great start for the
year and produced results in line with our plan for Q1. We were very pleased with our product sales performance and
saw an acceleration in that growth for the quarter's year-over-year comparison of 19% versus the past couple of years.
As we exited the quarter, we saw strong momentum across the commercial metrics for REVLIMID, ABRAXANE and
POMALYST IMNOVID, and Mark will speak more about those in a moment. We are seeing those drivers benefiting
Q2 sales as we are now about a month into the second quarter.
In addition, we are very excited about the psoriatic arthritis approval for OTEZLA that we received in March, and the
I&I team is busy launching the product this quarter. Scott will give you more details on his team's activities after
Mark's update.
We are also quite pleased with our overall P&L performance, with adjusted earnings per share growing by 22% for the
quarter's year-over-year comparison, faster than our 18% total revenue growth. We remain focused on shareholder
returns and we continue investing for the future in both new R&D collaborations and other opportunities like the late
stage product acquisition we announced this morning. In addition, we bought back $1.7 billion of our own stock in Q1
and obtained approval from our board for an additional $4 billion authorization to continue repurchasing shares.
Here you can see the acceleration in product sales for the quarterly year-over-year comparison with the 19% growth for
this quarter exceeding the rates for Q1 in the prior two years despite the entry of generic competition to VIDAZA in the
U.S. In addition our portfolio of sales is more diversified than ever, with POMALYST IMNOVID, pancreatic cancer
for ABRAXANE, OTEZLA to come, starting with revenues in Q2, and more geographies coming into the mix.
We expect to recognize revenues from OTEZLA in the U.S. starting in Q2 as patients make their way through
titration-packed product and we subsequently see revenue-generating scripts. We have taken a conservative accounting
approach with respect to distribution pipeline fill, and for now are using a sell-through approach recognizing revenues
as scripts are filled and we'll move to a sell-in approach when we have enough experience in this market to feel
comfortable with that.
For quite some time our product sales growth at Celgene has been mainly volume driven, and this quarter was no
exception with 16 percentage points or 84% of the 19% growth coming from volume. We additionally saw a global 3%
increase from price in the quarter. At $1.67 for the quarter, fully diluted adjusted earnings per share grew faster than
revenues, up 22%. We produced this strong profit growth while investing in our I&I infrastructure, mainly in
commercial capabilities and launch preparations for OTEZLA, and while investing behind key hematology oncology
launches for ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer in both the U.S. and Europe and IMNOVID in Europe. Essentially all
of the $0.30 year-over-year increase in Q1 earnings per share came from operating income growth.
REVLIMID's growth was solid in Q1 with particularly strong performance outside the U.S., and the product posted
14% year-over-year growth for the quarter globally and 1% sequentially, in line with our plan. Branded VIDAZA was

impacted by generic competition in the U.S. and this caused the declines in U.S. and total sales for both the
year-over-year and sequential comparison. Outside the U.S., VIDAZA's growth continues to be strong at 14%
year-over-year. Buying patterns by our distributors impacted the sequential international comparison. And finally as a
reminder, sales of generic Azacitidine are included in other total sales.
On a year-over-year basis, ABRAXANE grew over 50% with similar performance from each of the U.S. and
international. Momentum behind the product is excellent following last year's approvals for pancreatic cancer in the
U.S. and Europe. Sequential growth in the U.S. was affected by buying patterns as with some degree of hindsight we
now recognize that in Q4 of 2013 there was across-the-board customer buying in advance of higher expected base
demand driven by pancreatic cancer. Though the demand metrics for the product look very good, and you will see these
in Mark's slides, the level of demand expected going into Q1 was not immediately realized. ABRAXANE is off to an
excellent start in Q2 and we are highly confident in our full year estimate for its sales. POMALYST IMNOVID's
position in relapsed refractory myeloma continues to strengthen, and sales grew over 375% as we move into our first
full year on the market in the U.S. and as the launch ramps up across Europe.
REVLIMID's 14.1% year-over-year growth for Q1 was 77% volume driven, with that growth at 10.8% plus a 3.1
percentage point contribution globally from price. This growth was very solid in light of the gross to net and typical
first quarter dynamics we often see in REVLIMID's quarter-to-quarter sales pattern, particularly in the U.S., and was in
line with our plans. All of the commercial metrics for REVLIMID are quite positive and we are seeing that reflected in
REVLIMID's performance so far in Q2. When we look back at REVLIMID's historical sequential pattern, we see that
Q1 of this year was in keeping with what we would expect, and we are happy with the global 1% sequential growth
over Q4 of 2013.
The key line items in our P&L are performing well. Gross margins improved by 70 basis points versus a year ago, and
30 basis points sequentially, driven by mix. R&D expenses came down as a percentage of revenues but grew on an
absolute basis by 8.5% year-over-year as we continue to make productive investments in R&D. Q4 2013 R&D spend
included $52 million in collaboration-related milestone payments, and this is the main reason for the sequential
reduction in Q1 expense as a percentage of revenue. The quarterly pattern of R&D spend will be impacted by the
timing of clinical trial activity across the portfolio and the timing of milestone payments.
SG&A expenses grew 25.4% and increased as a percentage of revenues for the quarter with our investments in I&I and
product launches. We still expect these to come in around 22.5% of revenues for the full year. Our strong revenue
growth and these expense dynamics drove our adjusted operating margin to 50.5%, in line with our full year guidance.
Our balance sheet and net cash from operations generation both remained very strong. As of March 31, we had just
over $5 billion of cash on our balance sheet after repurchasing $1.7 billion of our own shares and investing in business
development opportunities to support the long-term growth of the business.
In the quarter, we finalized two new R&D collaboration agreements with NantBioScience and Abide and added a new
collaboration to our partnership with FORMA. Upfront payments for these three deals totaled $309 million. In addition,
we are very excited about our late stage product acquisition from Nogra Pharma, and Scott will speak more about that
deal in a moment. The deal includes a $710 million upfront payment upon closing as well as potential regulatory and
sales related milestones. We expect our strong operating execution, business model and capital deployment strategy to
generate improving returns on invested capital over time, and we have a good track record in this regard.
We use GAAP-based income to calculate our ROIC metrics, and we show you these on a gross invested capital basis,
the dotted line in our ROIC chart, and on a net invested capital basis excluding cash, the solid line in our chart. You can
see the general trend to improving returns, with any given quarter or short period sometimes impacted by upfront
investments in business development activities or short-term cash accumulation. Our target is to produce sustained
improvements in ROIC over time as one metric to demonstrate the long-term productivity of our R&D and capital
investments, the quality of our operational execution, and the soundness of our financial strategy.
Our performance continues to be solidly rooted in strong top line growth and operational execution on a larger and
larger base of business, with increased diversification in our revenue stream. All of or metrics remain favorable. We are

performing well now and investing for the future with an eye on improving returns and providing value to our
shareholders. Q1 has given us a great start to the year, and today we are reaffirming our full year guidance for both
revenues and earnings per share.
Thank you, and let me now turn the call over to Mark.
Mark J. Alles
Thanks very much, Jackie. Good morning, everyone.
First quarter net product sales were in line with our plan, up 19% year-on-year to $1.708 billion. Our brands'
fundamentals are strong. Globally, more patients began therapy in the first quarter on REVLIMID, POMALYST
IMNOVID and ABRAXANE than ever before. Each of these products has achieved market leadership, and have
become backbone therapies for the development of additional novel agents for virtually all subsets with multiple
myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes and pancreatic cancer. Market share gains and duration of therapy increases for
REVLIMID and the ongoing global commercial launches for POMALYST IMNOVID in relapsed and refractory
multiple myeloma and ABRAXANE for metastatic pancreatic cancer are key drivers for our full year outlook and
beyond.
Early second quarter product sales trends are very positive. In the first quarter, our teams produced strong results that
offset much of the unfavorable impact of three variables. First, gross to net adjustments including the expected seasonal
increased rebates for REVLIMID tied to the Medicare Part D coverage gap. Second, the continued impact of generics
Azacitidine sales in the United States. And third, buying patterns for ABRAXANE in the U.S. and Japan. At the same
time, we made significant progress on multiple high value programs. As Bob mentioned, we submitted the REVLIMID
newly diagnosed multiple myeloma regulatory dossiers in Europe in February, and in the U.S. in April. Securing
worldwide approval for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma remains one of our most important
corporate objectives.
Key clinical trials are being initiated for our inline and pipeline products. Our research collaboration strategy is
beginning to yield active promising molecules. Among them is the Agios compound AG-221, a first-in-class inhibitor
of the IDH2 mutant protein. Promising but preliminary Phase I data were presented this month at the AACR meeting.
AG-221 demonstrated high response rates and an excellent safety profile in a molecularly defined group of patients
with relapsed and refractory acute myeloleukemia. With our development partner Acceleron we advancing both
Sotatercept and ACE-536 in Beta-Thalassemia and MDS. We expect to select one of these agents to enter a Phase III
study in Beta-Thalassemia later this year.
We turn to our first quarter results. REVLIMID sales were $1.144 billion, representing 14% year-on-year and a 1%
quarter-on-quarter growth. Key demand fundamentals remained strong in the U.S. Importantly, the average daily
number of new patients increased by 7% quarter-on-quarter. An all-time high of more than 34,000 unique patients were
treated with REVLIMID in the United States during the quarter. This large volume of patients on therapy at the start of
the year is a very positive indicator of our full year opportunity. As previously mentioned, sequential quarterly sales in
the U.S. were negatively impacted by the expected seasonal increased rebates for REVLIMID. Led by our team in
Europe, quarter-on-quarter international sales of REVLIMID grew 6%.
We continue to strengthen the product profile of REVLIMID beyond multiple myeloma. The results of the REVLIMID
MDS-005 Phase III study and non-deletion 5q minus low risk MDS and the MCL-002 randomized Phase II study in
relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma are expected during the second half of this year. We completed
enrollment in the REMARC Phase III study, testing REVLIMID as maintenance therapy for patients with newly
diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We are on track to complete enrollment in RELEVANCE, our Phase III
study of REVLIMID plus Rituxan in follicular lymphoma late this year. ASH 2014 could mark another inflection point
for REVLIMID in multiple myeloma, as we may start to see the initial data from several Phase III trials with novel
agents being developed on the RD backbone.

The POMALYST IMNOVID launch continues to exceed our first full year expectations. Driven by the U.S. market,
sales grew 376% year-on-year and 12% quarter-on-quarter to $136 million. We are very encouraged by the
performance of IMNOVID in Europe where key metrics suggest an adoption curve similar to or better than the 2013
adoption of POMALYST in the United States. Momentum should accelerate as reimbursement is achieved in several
major European markets from this quarter through the end of 2014 and the start of 2015. We remain on track to submit
the POMALYST regulatory dossier for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in Japan by the end of the third
quarter.
ABRAXANE year-over-year sales grew by more than 50% to $185 million. However as Jackie mentioned, the negative
impact from quarter-on-quarter buying patterns in the U.S. and Japan contributed significantly to a sequential quarterly
decline of 8%. It is clearer now that the sharp increase in the total number of patients treated per month with
ABRAXANE in the United States during 2013, and the anticipation of early 2014 demand, led excess inventory to
build at the very end of last year. Demand continued to grow in Q1 2014 but not enough to completely offset this
inventory build. A similar quarter-on-quarter pattern developed in Japan, causing our partner Taiho to reduce their
planned first quarter ABRAXANE orders. We are very confident that we will deliver 2014 ABRAXANE sales
consistent with our forecasted $850 million to $900 million.
Following the release of the results from the Phase III study of ABRAXANE plus gemcitabine in metastatic pancreatic
cancer and the FDA approval in September of 2013, this novel combination has rapidly become the new standard of
care. In less than one year, the market share of ABRAXANE plus gemcitabine in the first line treatment of metastatic
pancreatic cancer grew from approximately 5% to approximately 36%. We continue to expect peak share of this
combination in the United States to exceed 55%. Our experience in the U.S. and now in Germany suggests that we
should achieve rapid market adoption and share gains across global markets immediately following reimbursement. We
have successfully initiated our, and our pivotal study testing ABRAXANE plus gemcitabine in triple negative
metastatic breast cancer is enrolling very well.
With five we're weeks to go before the start of ASCO, we are aware of approximately 70 abstracts that have been
submitted featuring our inline and pipeline agents across several major cancers and multiple patient subsets. We are
pleased with the number and quality of the REVLIMID abstracts in multiple myeloma and lymphoma, POMALYST
abstracts in multiple myeloma and ABRAXANE abstracts in pancreatic cancer and breast cancer.
In summary, our first quarter results delivered robust year-on-year growth of 19% and were consistent with our 2014
forecast. Key product value drivers such as market share, duration commercial launches in international markets, and
new data that can expand our core indications are advancing.
Most importantly, we successfully submitted marketing applications for REVLIMID plus low-dose dexamethasone for
the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in Europe and in the United States. We are executing well. We are
very confident in our outlook and we are committed to helping patients with cancer worldwide.
Thanks very much. And I'm pleased to welcome Scott Smith to the call.
Scott Smith
Thank you very much, Mark, and good morning to you all.
2014 has already been a milestone year for Celgene I&I marked most importantly by the U.S. approval of OTEZLA for
the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. We have a strong and highly differentiated label. The indication is broad and
includes adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis, supporting the use across a wide variety of PSA patient segments.
Early feedback from prescribers has been very encouraging, especially noting inclusion of language confirming the
treatment of OTEZLA was also improvement not only in size and symptoms of PSA but also an improvement to
[indiscernible] (25:04) as well as physical function in patients with active PSA.
Feedback was also strong that OTEZLA could represent a completely new paradigm for the treatment of PSA by
providing a product without black box and warnings about malignancies or serious infections nor any requirements for

TB testing or routine laboratory monitoring. We are very encouraged by the initial feedback about OTEZLA from both
physician and patient communities. The commercial organization has executed on the launch plans exceptionally well
and we are pleased with the positive momentum generated in the very short period of time. We are focused on two key
near-term objectives. One, broad and frequent reach to target physicians; and two, facilitating patient access to
OTEZLA.
Our sales representatives were in the field calling on customers within three days of approval and have reached
virtually 100% of target, many repeatedly. In total we've given over 12,000 OTEZLA details so far in April. Our
account management teams have been engaging with payers to secure formulary actives and reimbursement, a process
that we expect will take three months to 12 months as is typical for products in this category. We have already achieved
our first formulary approvals and are happy with our early progress.
In the meantime, we believe our reimbursement and patient assistance program, OTEZLA SupportPlus, working in
conjunction with specialty pharmacy is well positioned to provide assistance to physicians' office to get patients started
on therapy as quickly as possible. For patients, OTEZLA SupportPlus provides access to a team of advocates, including
those focusing on co-pay assistance and a free drug program for those who are uninsured. Our team is well prepared to
accomplish their objective and we'll look forward to discussing initial results and prescription trends over the next few
months.
We believe Celgene I&I is well positioned for significant growth in the coming years. Following last month's PSA
approval, we anticipate a U.S. psoriasis approval of OTEZLA in September. In Europe, we expect a combined PSA
psoriasis opinion by year-end with an approval in Q1 2015. We are also focused on geographic expansion beyond the
U.S. and E.U. Our Phase III registration trial in Japan is rapidly enrolling and we anticipate a submission in 2015 and
an approval in 2016. In addition, we have initiated our global expansion plans for OTEZLA, and anticipate approvals in
Canada, Australia and Switzerland over the next six months to 18 months.
We believe OTEZLA has the potential to have broad utility across a spectrum of inflammatory diseases. Top line
results from our Phase III AS trial are expected later this quarter. We will also initiate a Phase III trial on Behçet's
disease and Phase II trials of OTEZLA on IBD and atopic dermatitis later this year.
A key objective for us in 2014 is to enhance and accelerate the I&I portfolio. We are encouraged about the potential of
other Phase II compounds in the pipeline, specifically sotatercept in renal anemia and CC-220, an I&I specific [ph]
emit (28:00).
Furthermore, today's announcement of our acquisition of GED-301 from Nogra is very, very exciting. This therapy
truly fits with our mission to bring innovative treatments to patients in areas of high unmet medical need. We believe
that 301 with unique mechanism and profile has the potential to transform the treatment of Crohn's Disease, a chronic
disabling disease that affects over a million patients worldwide. Exciting results were seen in both a Phase Ib and
166-patients Phase II trial showing consistently high response rate and rate of remission after just four weeks of
treatment. Data from the Phase II program should be available shortly through publication as well as presentation at
appropriate medical meetings.
As Bob stated earlier, we will work aggressively towards beginning the Phase III trials later this year. We are very
pleased to have reached agreement to develop and commercialize this breakthrough compound.
These are exciting times for Celgene I&I. Our team is working passionately to help ensure we can bring not only
OTEZLA but other transformational treatment options to patients worldwide in the near future.
Now I'd like to turn it back to Bob.

I hope you can sense our enthusiasm and optimism about the future of Celgene. Our teams around the world are
committed to maximizing the significant potential of our deep and diverse portfolio. We are well positioned to achieve
our key 2014 milestones and to deliver on our long-term targets. Thank you everyone for joining us this morning.
Operator, please open the line to questions. Thank you.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Sonnier of William and Blair. Your line is now
open.
<Q - John S. Sonnier>: Hey, thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on the progress, and in particular, the
filing, the REVLIMID filing in Europe. And I'm wondering if you're able to give us any granularity on what the
breadth of that filing looks like? Any age limits, transplant status, et cetera?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks for the question, John. It's Mark. As we've said, our base case is that we would get a
label for transplant ineligible patients, so by definition elderly patients. But we're at the start of the process and we'd
still be looking to get the broadest possible label.
<Q - John S. Sonnier>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from a Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. Good morning. I realize you may be a little
bit constrained in what you can talk about with the Natco situation. But I was just wondering if you can talk about how
a Markman outcome would actually impact the way you're dealing with the challenger. Is there any outcome in your
opinion from the Markman that could swing a resolution one way or another?
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Thanks for the question, Matt. Obviously in litigation we're limited about what we can say.
We have spent a long time building extensive intellectual property estate for REVLIMID. We intend to vigorously
defend our rights, and we're confident about the outcome and we don't believe there's anything in the near term that will
be dispositive on the case through Markman hearing. But we'll let you know as that progresses
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Group. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I had a couple questions on OTEZLA if I
might. Well it's one question really, just sort of sounds like two.
But first is, Scott, is it possible that you could actually get the payers to require that patients step through OTEZLA,
new patients, step through OTEZLA before receiving TNF? So I'd just like you to talk through that. How realistic is
that as a possible goal for the franchise? Because that would obviously be I think, correct me if I'm wrong, pretty
transformative for adoption? And then just a quick one, a yes or no. Are you or will you or do you plan on sampling?
<A - Scott Smith>: So just to answer the first question, certainly our mid to long-term goal is to get to an advantaged
position ahead of TNF in a certain number of plans. Right now for 2014 we're really focused on solidifying the initial
footprint, making sure that we're in a non-disadvantaged position. And then if we can move that forward to a more

advantaged position longer term that depends on how much demand we can drive, and the volume we drive, and how
well we execute. But certainly our mid to long-term goal is to be in an advantaged position relative to TNF in a number
of plans in the midterm.
The second question, we are sampling titration packs at the moment. These are patient starter kits, 14 days requirement
to get patients on. That's the focus of our sampling right now is initiation of patient trial. And so that's being done at the
physician level.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Porges at Bernstein.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Hi. I think I'm on the call. Quickly just housekeeping. Could you give us a sense of
exactly what the swing in ABRAXANE was between Q4 and Q, and whether the Q1 results actually reflect demand or
whether there was some shortfall?
And then, Jackie, could just comment how are you accounting for the fluctuations in the value of the equity positions
that you've accumulated. Do you mark-to-market or do you just keep it on the books at the acquisition cost? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Geoff. Let me start with the second question. So if the entities are public companies,
the stakes are marked-to-market at the end of the quarter. However, the gains on those flow through other
comprehensive income and not through the P&L. If we would have a sustained loss on any of those, we would take that
loss through the P&L. On the private company equity stakes, those are also run through valuation models and tested for
impairment essentially, and those if we have gains on those, they will not run through the P&L unless we sell the stakes
and if we have losses on them, they are taken to the P&L. So it's a pretty conservative accounting in treatment.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: So Jackie, is that through the pro forma P&L or just the GAAP P&L?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Both of them.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: The first part of the question, Jeff, it's Mark, is the swing in inventory we estimate to be in the
$15 million range, but it's not exactly clear. But it's in that range. And then as you saw in the slide that I presented, the
first quarter patient demand curve moves sideways a little bit, but as you see in March, the last data point, it has
returned to growth. So it was a little bit of a combination mostly the inventory swing, a little bit of a sideways demand
curve, but it's back on track.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys. Congratulations on the performance. So I guess I'm just want to ask a little bit
more about the pipeline. You've been very active in business development. So first of all, Isis has been trying oral
antisense for a while. Maybe you can talk a little bit about what gives you comfort in the mechanism for 301. And then
a broader question around pipeline acquisition. When you're thinking about adding value to the company, do you have
peak years in mind? Like when do you see – you have multiple products, when do you see these really peaking or
really starting to add value for the company? Thanks.
<A - Scott Smith>: Relative to the other oral antisense drugs which have gone to a variety of different places, I think
you see here the coupling of the antisense technology with delivery system that delivers the drug right on site in the gut

for absorption at the site of the path of the physiology of the disease. And then when you see the clinical data, the Phase
II data, you can see a very robust response. And we're looking forward to getting that data out. But clearly, the data, the
clinical data, and the evidence that you look at gives you a feeling of the magnitude of effect.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Robyn. It's Jackie. Just on the pipeline question and I think the timing of contribution
of revenues, just as a reminder for everybody, out to 2017 the numbers that we've given you I think you have very good
visibility to the drivers behind the growth embedded in those numbers. And we've highlighted on numerous occasions
some of the things that could happen over that timeframe that would lead to revenues that are not included in our
financial model. And I would say the last sort of item on the checklist there was the filing for REVLIMID newly
diagnosed in both the U.S. and Europe, which is now done. And then we'll see those approvals come. So when you
think about that, I think it's pretty clear what's driving that and what potential upsides may be.
When we look at other major indications that could come for REVLIMID for example, in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas,
when we look at the late stage product acquisition that we announced today, all of those things would be contributing
after 2017, so they could start to kick in, in a somewhat meaningful way in 2018, 2019. ACE-011 is another one that
we haven't talked too much about from a timing standpoint. It could come out in that 2019, 2020, 2021 timeframe.
And all of those products then would be contributing significantly to growth beyond 2017 while REVLIMID,
ABRAXANE and other products are continuing to grow as they expand from an indication standpoint. So we're really
trying to have things come into the portfolio and layer in nicely with respect particularly to that sort of mid-stage
timeframe that would be kind of 2018 to 2021.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Co. Your line is now open.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to ask just a few more about GED-301. Was this
a competitive auction? And can you talk about what stimulated your interest in this? Was it just the Phase II data, or is
there something about the target or the indication or something else that you guys have had your eyes on? And, lastly
do you have the necessary IP given this is an antisense?
<A - Scott Smith>: So just to maybe answer the second question. Certainly Crohn's disease is a target. IBD in general
that we've been very interested in. We will be initiating, as I stated in the prepared remarks, a program in IBD with
OTEZLA that we think has the right profile. Very significant unmet medical need, particularly in Crohn's where the
remission rates from TNF therapy are very, very low. Patients don't maintain that remission very long. So there really is
need for new approaches and new therapies there. Relative to the other question...
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: It was a competitive process, and I think it would be safe to characterize that as having
been highly competitive.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: And the IP? Or license?
<A - Scott Smith>: We believe that there's appropriate and strong IP out through a significant period of time.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Significant diligence on that as part of the whole process.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Yeah, we feel quite good about the IP, and there's some differences that we could see with
respect to extensions and things like that. But it would go beyond the 2027 timeframe.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thanks a lot.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple related ones on the
REVLIMID filing in Europe. Do you guys expect any benefit from the prior review or is this new filing just so
completely different?
And then on the new, what's the next step I guess following the recent NICE guidance for REVLIMID in the U.K., is
this impactful or do you guys – is this just less relevant now that you have the first line filing in Europe in the books?
Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Geoff. It's Jackie. So on the timing for the review, we've assumed that it would be
standard review time and go the full timing cycle for purposes of the financial model in both the U.S. and Europe. So if
it happens to be a little bit faster than that, that's great, but we've assumed that they'll take the full standard review time.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Geoff, it's Mark. Just want to be clear. We're talking about the recent headline from NICE about
Thalidomide, Velcade, REVLIMID reimbursement, correct? That's what you're referring to?
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: That's right. Yeah.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Right. So it's a great question. Thank you for it. We had sought to expand the utilization of
REVLIMID and the reimbursement for REVLIMID to a more second-line population under the NICE reimbursement
umbrella. This was not a newly diagnosed discussion at all. In that setting, and as part of a process that's ongoing,
NICE issued their declaration that it was not cost effective at that time. We continue to go through this process and are
optimistic that notwithstanding the newly diagnosed indication and approval later, that we could expand utilization and
reimbursement for REVLIMID in the U.K. to second line. So that's ongoing.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And just as a reminder, when you received the same preliminary negative opinion before we
got the very positive position we have with NICE for REVLIMID today.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Correct.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: All right. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber of Citi. Your line is now open.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Great. I have two questions. Jackie, one, first one for you. Just give us a little bit of a sense it
looks like R&D, I believe you're going to need to potentially ramp up a lot into the back of the year and SG&A down.
I'm just trying to understand exactly how do you get there from here? And SG&A will have to go down and R&D is
going have to go up to hit your guidance. How do you get there?
And then two, I don't know if you can answer it. When you look at what Natco their own IP that they filed relating to
their essentially Anhydrous Lenalidomide, the one without water, it had similar peaks to Form A, which is your
one-year polymorph and so relates to specifically the anhydrous polymorph. But you guys are also alleging or you're
using the Form B which is the heavy hydrate. So what's going on here? They're saying they don't have water in their
polymorph but you guys are asserting your polymorph it does have water. So give us a little bit of sense kind of where
you're going with this, if you can. Thank you.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thanks, Yaron. So with respect to the timing on the expenses, I mean I think we had
always characterized the SG&A as very likely being frontloaded to the early part of this year given the timing of the
investments in the I&I unit and the buildup that we needed to do there ahead of OTEZLA approval. So you see that
reflected in the numbers.
And as well as on the timing on the launch-related expenses for the other products that we've discussed in the
hematology oncology area. So you've got pretty significant frontloading of the expenses in SG&A, and then the

revenues will be accelerating over the course of the year, as Mark mentioned in his comments. And that's how we think
that that is going to play out to get us to the full year guidance number of 22.5% for SG&A versus where we are today.
On the R&D expense side, again I think that it looks a little bit light at the beginning of the year, especially coming out
of the end of last year when we had a pretty significant number of milestone expenses in there. We do include
collaboration-related milestone payments in our adjusted P&L, and we had a lot of those in the fourth quarter. The
absolute dollars still grew 8.5%. And we've got a big base of R&D spend and a big portfolio where you have some
clinical trial activity ramping down, some others ramping up, and that's all taken into consideration in our forecast. And
we'll see how that plays out over the course of the year, but we're right where we expected we would be with that.
With respect to the Natco questions, I mean that was a pretty detailed question. There are some things that we really
can't comment that much on given the ongoing nature of the process and the impending Markman hearing. But there's
some things that we're happy to take up offline in terms of the specific patent coverage and things like that, if that's
okay.

Thank you. Our next question comes from a Chris Raymond of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.
<Q - Chris J. Raymond>: Thanks. Just a question on POMALYST. So with the U.S. being sort of flat to I guess
maybe down a little bit sequentially quarter-on-quarter, I'm just kind of struck by the fact that this is two drugs now
when you take POMALYST and Kyprolis that are indicated for later lines of therapy in multiple myeloma that were
down sequentially. Is that just – are you seeing something broader in the market or is that just a coincidence, or is there
something else going on? Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks for the question, Chris. It's Mark. I agree with you. The third plus line market seems to
have consolidated a bit here in the last let's say three to four months. That said, I wouldn't draw any conclusions about
the uptick of POMALYST. We see great patient demand, physician experience on in particular the response rate and
then the safety profile where we see duration increasing nicely is something that I think over this year will realize
potentially some upside.
And the reason is clear. The patient base is growing as duration, and you're very familiar with this with REVLIMID, it
would be better than expected. And we are seeing early signs that duration will be better. We think not only will we
achieve our base case for the year but there might be upside. So I think for POMALYST the dynamics are good. We
did see a little bit of sideways movement here but we're very, very optimistic based on patient experience, physician
experience, and our own analysis of what's happening with duration.
<Q - Chris J. Raymond>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Liang of Leerink. Your line is now open.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thanks very much. I have a question on the two REVLIMID Rituxan R-squared studies that
you're initiating. Can you talk about the considerations that went into starting these trials? Was the initiation based on
anything from the current trials, including the current Phase III studies remark and relevance?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Sure. I'm not exactly sure I understand your question. But we have for, as you know, for many,
many years believed that the combination of REVLIMID plus Rituxan as a chemo-free approach to the treatment of all
histologic subsets in lymphoma is a major advance in the treatment of disease. So the REMARC study first is building
on the maintenance paradigm to try to extend the benefit of a Rituxan-based therapy, in this case, R-CHOP, we're very
excited about this. This is a large study. It's fully enrolled. And if one tracks the biology of what would be expected to
happen with these patients at high risk of relapse after responding to R-CHOP, we would be looking for readouts,

perhaps earlier than expected. And remember the control arm is placebo.
With respect to REVLIMID Rituxan in follicular lymphoma, again, being chemo-free for these patients with indolent
disease, we think it brings a very effective safe approach in treating patients over time. And we think the combination is
going to be quite good. So optimizing REVLIMID's clinical potential as a single agent or in combination with
antibodies, Rituxan, other antibodies, is a high clinical priority, and we're very excited about the future.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
<Q - Josh E. Schimmer>: Thank you. I've received questions from investors who believe that the REVLIMID method
of use patents in Europe may be at risk this year. So maybe you can give us some sense of the current status
expectations for 2014 updates and addressing these concerns for us? Thank you.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Josh, it's really hard to hear you. Could you say that one more time please?
<Q - Josh E. Schimmer>: Sorry. Can you hear me better now?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: A little bit.
<Q - Josh E. Schimmer>: Sorry for the problems. So I've had questions from investors who believe that the
REVLIMID method of use patents in Europe may be at risk this year. So perhaps you can address their current status
expectations for 2014 and address those concerns?
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: We are taking a long time to build the portfolio internationally. We feel very confident about
where we are with those patents. And there is going to be challenges from time to time with our patents. We feel very
confident about where we stand, and that they will be enforceable, and we'll achieve the outcomes that we expect.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Yeah, I mean the patents are – continue to be enforceable during this process. So I think
that's one thing to keep in mind. And so far, other grounds that have been put forth in the original proceeding were not
found to be sufficient for in-depth validation of the patent, so...
<Q - Josh E. Schimmer>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo Security. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple on 301. I'm wondering if you could talk
a little bit about the timelines and potential cost for Phase III program? Clarify is that already incorporated in your
long-term guidance? And then maybe just generally speaking over the long-term based on the remission response rates
you're seeing so far here, do you envision this being positioned as sort of a replacement for biologics or more like an
earlier line option? Sort of looking to where your positioning POMALYST in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi Brian. Let me start with the cost question and then hand it over to Scott. So probably
the total development cost, and we're still working through the plan and refining the numbers a little bit. So I would this
expense range I'm going to give you is probably on the conservative side until we know a little bit more. But would be
multi-year expense over about five years of $250 million to $300 million. So it's, on a per year basis it's quite a
digestible number in the grand scheme of our overall portfolio. Because it is new I can't tell you that it's specifically
included in our long-term guidance. But what I would say is we estimate though that portfolio of R&D expense over

the long period of time in such a way that an amount like this is probably absorbable within what we've already got in
the financial model.
<A - Scott Smith>: And just in terms of the structure of the Phase III program, I think we would like to work
aggressively to initiate by the end of this year, and we're thinking about that. The data in itself as you've noted is very
striking and very different than anything you see in the market today. We think that can help enrollment as well when
we get an opportunity to get that out.
And in terms of positioning, you'd like to work through a sort of a formal Phase III trial before you fix on positioning.
But certainly we see because of the oral nature of the drug, because of the type of efficacy we see, because of the
differentiated side effect profile that you see relative to Remicade and other traditional agents used here, we see an
opportunity for it to be used in the pre-biologic space aggressively, similar to the opportunity we see for OTEZLA.
We can talk more fully about it when the data is out there in the world. I can't right now, but I think it will be striking
and obvious as to what direction we're going to take the molecule when we get a chance to get that data out.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hey. Great. Thanks. In regards to business development, you've done a ton of deals, 21, 22, 23,
can't count them all. But this one was particularly large at $700 plus million upfront. Can you talk to your appetite for
business development? It's even more I guess numerically this year on a dollar basis than last year. Where do you think
we're going? I'm sure you can't have a specific target number, but maybe you can talk broadly about your appetite and
where that's going to be going over the next year or so.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Thanks for the question. We don't have a target for what we plan to do going forward this year
or in future years. We certainly do understand the financial constraints of what we want to be able to do and what we
can achieve. But it's really driven by the opportunity that we fundamentally believe having a strong internal research
capabilities give us insights into programs that would really expand those franchises and really produce synergies that
we can then really build campaigns in different areas to produce disruptive technologies and breakthrough therapies.
And so it is fundamentally driven from an internal perspective where we believe a transformational impact on patients
can be achieved. We then have to put what's out there in the context of what we can financially support, et cetera. But
so far the opportunities as we've seen them have been supportable under the financial model that has been built for
Celgene appropriately.
Obviously late stage assets are going be more expensive than earlier stage assets. But when you find one that like this
one that we believe can be really transformative to the way that medicine is practiced in this unmet area of medical
need we're going to act on them. But again, we don't have many things that we're looking at today, but we'll be
opportunistic as we see things arise.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: And I think consistent with that and what we've talked about and done in most the recent
past, it can be a combination of collaboration agreements. You saw a couple of ones that we did in the first quarter, as
well as what we would characterize as – bolt on may be the wrong word but a more modest size acquisition. This deal
has the nature of an acquisition of a product. And yes it's a little bit more of an upfront amount, but if think back to the
Avila acquisition that we did a couple years ago it was much, much, much earlier for $350 million up front, I think you
can put it in perspective. And as Scott has said, when you see the data I think you'll understand why we were so
interested in this acquisition.

thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.

looked like from a market share chart that you gave that your market share penetration is starting to flatten out a little
bit but you also pointed to that your expectations that market share will be above 50%. So I just wonder if you could
talk a little bit about those dynamics, and then maybe just talk about the country-by-country rollout in Europe. Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks for the question. Certainly a dynamic growth rate on share and patient volume over about
a one-year period. So not surprising that there was a little bit of a sideways trend going into Q1.
On pancreatic cancer and lung cancer we have two growth drivers. Pancreatic cancer, we are being used almost
exclusively in performance-status patients who are in the zero to one category. These are patients where ABRAXANE,
Gemcitabine and the data we produce offer an ideal match. The expansion of the opportunity is into performance-status
patients who are not as, let's say well-off. And we see that happening and we're doing some research to support that. In
addition, we had, as I said, opened our Adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial in the quarter and we think that this
segmentation clinically and in the market will continue to see a very, very nice uptick in pancreatic cancer.
In lung cancer, our program for squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer is boosted by a medical fair-sponsored trial of
maintenance ABRAXANE in the setting of squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and that program is ongoing. In
addition, the Tenacity Program, again ABRAXANE Gemcitabine in triple negative metastatic breast cancer, is an
important way to think about the future of the brand also. So we're going to have periods where we don't have the
dramatic growth that you see historically but we have high hopes that the brand will grow and become a blockbuster in
our portfolio. And the clinical programs and the execution are there to make that happen.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: I think we have time for about three more questions, so if we can, if they're really fast ones
we can take another one. But let's probably target three more questions.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Hey thanks for taking my questions. Sorry to keep on focusing on 301. Scott, I know you gave
us a little bit of Phase II color. And I know that we're going to see the data a little bit more. But I guess everyone's just
trying to tie up the high sum paid. You talked about higher remission and response rates. Was there something else in
that Phase II, such as fast onset of action. I think you said four weeks treatment. Is this the Phase II that they talked
about before where they treated for two weeks, and measured maintenance at four? I guess I'm trying to say is response
rate and the speed of response a key driver for your optimism here?
<A - Scott Smith>: Sorry, folks. Thanks for the question. I think both those were key drivers here. Response rate, high
number of patients into remission, how quickly that remission was achieved. And then duration of that remission,
length of time, the durability of response were three important things that we looked at. And again, we'll have to wait to
take a look at the data. But it is very, very different than you see in the marketplace today. And I think there's a
completely different benefit risk in this product than you see that exist in the marketplace today. Safety plays into it as
well. Because of the absorption nature we see a very different safety profile emerging. So a combination of all those
things together sort of led us to believe that this could be really a transformational asset in this market space.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek of Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is now open.

<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Hi. Thanks. Another one on 301. I'm wondering if the size of the payments and the contingent
payments as well would suggest that the royalty rate would be relatively low? If you can just give us some sense of
that.
And then in the slide toward the end where you say it could meaningfully diversify revenue in 2019 and 2020. I guess
that would mean, I just want to be clear that you're not saying that the drug wouldn't come on the market until 2019?
Presumably you could get it on before then. If you can just give us some clarity on that. Thanks.
<A - Scott Smith>: Just so maybe on the second question first. This is Scott. Thanks for the question. We will
obviously try and develop the drug as quickly as you can. We need to get it up as quickly as we can. We need to get the
studies up and going. We need to see enrollment rates. We'll do it as quickly as we can. 2018, 2019, 2020, we can
provide more clarity on exactly that once we finalize regulatory interactions and have a finalized Phase III plan that
we're only initiating. So in some time we can give you some more clarity on the exact time that we would expect to
have then data and then to submit.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: And just with respect to the royalty rates, they aren't double digit but – and they are tiered.
We would consider them sort of customary for this particular market.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Mike King of JMP Securities. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mike G. King>: Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in, guys. Just a couple of quick questions in terms of upcoming
milestones. Are you willing to disclose the PDUFA date for the U.S. approval for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma?
And then where are we with regard to readouts on top line for OTEZLA for ankylosing spondylitis and CC-486 for
AML?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Mike, it's Mark. And I guess the OTEZLA question will go to Scott. On the PDUFA for
ABRAXANE newly diagnosed in U.S. as soon as we have the PDUFA date...
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: REVLIMID.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: I'm sorry, REVLIMID. REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma. As soon as we have the
PDUFA date we'll disclose it.
<A - Scott Smith>: From the ankylosing spondylitis study to enrollment we will have data in the first half, so this
quarter, Q2, we'll have some top line data.
<Q - Mike G. King>: And 486?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Specifically, Mike, 486?
<Q - Mike G. King>: Yeah, I thought you were having a readout for the AML study for...
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yeah, as I've said in my prepared remarks, we have two studies. It's not 486. It's AZA in AML
and then REVLIMID in the non del 5q. These data are expected in the second half of the year now. They've event
driven like all of our pivotal trials and we look forward to probably – EHA at the earliest would be the medical
meeting, but then again, it could be ASH depending on the gating and the timing of events.
<Q - Mike G. King>: Thank you.
