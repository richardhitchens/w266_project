Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are Bob Hugin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jackie
Fouse, our Chief Financial Officer; Mark Alles, who is the Global Head of our Hematology and Oncology business;
and the Global Head of our Inflammation and Immunology business, Scott Smith.
As a reminder, during today's call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook, in
addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may
cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q
on file with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we undertake no duty to update or revise
them.
Finally, reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part
of the earnings release.
I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert J. Hugin
Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. I appreciate the opportunity to review the
exceptional results and progress achieved during the second quarter.
Strong global operating momentum drove outstanding commercial and financial results across all of our products and
geographies. At the same time, we significantly advanced our pipeline from early research programs to key regulatory
actions around the world. These results position us extremely well to accomplish our key goals for 2013 and to deliver
on the promise of 2017 and beyond.
Our commercial performance in the second quarter was excellent. REVLIMID produced impressive results in markets
around the world. ABRAXANE continued its accelerated sales trajectory that began with the launch of the lung
indication in the United States late last year. And we're very encouraged by the POMALYST results in the United
States. The first full quarter of sales exceeded our expectations, generating strong momentum for the rest of the year.
Several important clinical and regulatory events in the second quarter also position our hematology/oncology franchise
for the next phase of growth. Our REVLIMID franchise was strengthened by the approval in Europe for MDS
deletion-5q and the approval in the United States for mantle cell lymphoma. These label expansions reflect both the
perseverance of our teams and the focus on solutions for patients.
And just two weeks ago we also announced that MM-020, our Phase III study of REVLIMID and dexamethasone in
newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival. We look forward to the
presentation of this data at upcoming medical meetings and to advancing our regulatory strategies for newly-diagnosed
multiple myeloma.
And with pomalidomide, we are finalizing our launch plans in Europe, having received a positive CHMP opinion in
May. Our teams are also developing global launch plans for ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer, with a PDUFA date of
September 21 in the United States and ongoing review of our application in Europe.
Over 400 data presentations at major medical meetings in the first half of this year highlighted the growing body of
important clinical data from our portfolio. In a few moments, Mark will provide a more complete perspective on the
progress and opportunities in our hematology/oncology franchise.
Our lead product in our inflammation and immunology franchise, apremilast, continues to make excellent progress. Our
regulatory applications for psoriatic arthritis in both the United States and Canada are under active review. Our
psoriasis submissions in the United States and Canada, as well as our combined psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis
submission in Europe, are on track for later this year. In May we announced positive results from our sixth pivotal
Phase III study of apremilast, the PALACE-4 study in DMARD-naïve psoriatic arthritis patients.

Apremilast was highlighted at EULAR, the European Congress of Rheumatology in Madrid last month, building the
knowledge of this product in the medical community. In a few minutes, Scott Smith, the leader of our I&I franchise,
will provide his insights on our commercial, clinical, and regulatory strategies as we move toward launches in the
United States and Canada early next year.
We continue to invest in the future as we seek to expand our high-potential internal pipeline and portfolio of external
collaborations. I am very excited about the progress being achieved on multiple programs, both at Celgene and with our
partners. Our pipeline is the lifeblood of our future, and we're energized by its promise.
This outstanding operating momentum and the strength of our business model positions us very well to accomplish our
near- and longer-term objectives. Our outlook supports raising our full-year financial guidance for REVLIMID sales,
total product sales, and earnings per share; and Jackie will provide her perspective on this revised guidance next.
The achievements of the second quarter demonstrate the power of our strategic imperatives: maximizing the full
potential of our hematology franchise, expanding our oncology business, building a global I&I franchise, and
advancing our innovative early pipeline. We are focused on delivering on the extraordinary potential of our portfolio.
Thank you. Let me now turn the call over to Jackie.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse
Thank you, Bob, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on our Q2 earnings call. The Celgene team built
on the strong momentum we created in Q1 of this year, and produced yet another great quarter in Q2. We accelerated
year-over-year product sales growth in Q2, as POMALYST had its first full quarter of revenues in the U.S., and as
ABRAXANE momentum continues to build, with new indications contributing to that franchise's growth.
Net product sales grew 17% year-over-year, and REVLIMID sales grew 13% year-over-year, with volume growth
continuing to be the main driver for all products. Sequential growth was 9% for the total net product sales and 5% for
REVLIMID. Our P&L metrics are strong across the board, and our operating margin grew 180 basis points
year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially.
As previously announced, we completed our prior share repurchase authorization back in June, having repurchased
16.3 million shares for $1.8 billion in the first half of this year, and our board approved a new $3 billion authorization
at its last meeting.
We also invested in new R&D collaborations, including Concert, FORMA, and Tengion, and struck a new
collaboration agreement with MorphoSys. With the 17% year-over-year growth, total net product sales reached $1.564
billion, a new record sales quarter for Celgene. Total revenues also grew 17% year-over-year, to $1.6 billion. All of our
major products posted solid growth in the quarter across the globe.
Our 17% product sales growth came from 16% volume growth and a net 1% positive contribution from the net of price
and foreign exchange. The impact of foreign exchange was about $30 million negative for the Q2 year-over-year
comparison, in line with our internal plan.
As a reminder, that impact in Q1 was about $27 million negative. That brings the total negative foreign currency
impact for the first six months of this year to about $57 million, and we continue to expect about $100 million for the
full year, with most of it impacting REVLIMID and with most of it coming from Europe.
Adjusted earnings per share was $1.52 for Q2, up 25% over Q2 of 2012, and driven by growth in operating income, as
our business model continues to deliver P&L leverage. Adjusted earnings per share grew by $0.30 versus one year ago,
with $0.26 coming from operating income growth and a net $0.04 from the combination of tax rate and share count.
Reviewing the details of our net product sales, REVLIMID increased nicely at about 13% year-over-year, up 16% in
the U.S. and 8% in international, including a negative impact from foreign exchange on international sales. Excluding
this impact, international year-over-year growth would have been 13%, and total global REVLIMID growth, 15%.

Sequential growth in the U.S. was a strong 10%, and international sequential volume growth was very solid across all
major markets, but was offset by negative price and currency effects in the quarter.
VIDAZA continues to grow well outside the U.S. and posted solid mid-single-digit gains year-over-year and
sequentially. ABRAXANE is showing strong momentum following last year's non-small cell lung cancer approval in
the U.S., as well as good growth in the breast indication outside of the U.S. The product grew 41% year-over-year, with
the U.S. up 38% and international, 55%. Global sequential growth was 26%.
We were extremely pleased with the performance of POMALYST in its first full quarter of sales in the U.S.
POMALYST's growth was demand-driven. Demand for the product is exceeding our expectations and the product is on
track for an outstanding 2013, building to a strong full-year expectation for 2014, when we expect to have commercial
sales in both the U.S. and Europe.
Looking at the components of REVLIMID's growth for the Q2 year-over-year comparison, total growth was about
13%, with 11.4% coming from volume, 3.7% from price, and negative 2.5% from foreign exchange. The U.S. market's
16% year-over-year growth for the quarter came about 60% from volume and 40% from price. With respect to
international, total year-over-year growth was 8%, but volume growth reached 15%, as the net impact of price for the
quarter was negative and the negative foreign currency impact was about 6%, with the greatest impact being in Europe.
Our P&L dynamic continues in line with our expectations. We improved product gross margins to 95.1%, driven by
favorable sales mix. R&D expense as a percentage of revenue declined, reflecting timing of spend on milestones in
clinical trials.
SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was higher in the quarter due to ongoing launch expenses for
POMALYST, prelaunch expenses for ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer, incremental expenses for Inflammation and
Immunology, and expenses related to a large number of medical meetings in Q2 of this year. We expect SG&A as a
percentage of revenue to trend lower over the remainder of the year.
Our operating profit margin improved versus one year ago and versus the prior quarter, and reached 49.6% for the
quarter. Our effective tax rate rose slightly in Q2, driven by higher sales for both POMALYST and ABRAXANE in the
U.S. and their impact on geographic mix of income.
We are delivering sustainable operating leverage, and on this chart we track our current-year progress in that regard on
a year-to-date basis every quarter and the trend in our metrics for the past few years. You can see we continue in Q2 of
2013 to build on a strong start to the year from Q1. This performance is the result of excellent execution across all
Celgene functions. And, now that we have two quarters of 2013 in our trailing-12-month return-on-invested-capital
calculation, you also now see our returns increasing for 2013.
Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of Q2 stood at just over $4 billion, and our balance sheet remains
very strong. In Q2, we generated over $700 million of cash flow from operations, and we spent just over $800 million
on share repurchases.
On the strength of our Q2 performance, and given our outlook for the remainder of this year, we are updating our
full-year financial guidance as follows. We are raising total net product sales to approximately $6.2 billion, growth of
15% versus 11% previously. We are raising REVLIMID net sales to a range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, growth at
the midpoint of 13% versus 10% previously.
We are raising EPS guidance by $0.25, to a range of $5.80 to $5.90, growth of 19% versus 14% previously. We
continue to assume a fully-diluted weighted average share count of 430 million shares. We assume a possible generic
VIDAZA entrant in the U.S. at the beginning of Q4.
We also expect to ramp up our investment in inflammation and immunology commercial infrastructure in the U.S. as
we move toward year-end and into 2014 in advance of an expected launch of the psoriatic arthritis indication for
apremilast in the U.S. next year. We forecast our operating profit margins to be at least 49%, as we have P&L
flexibility in both the R&D and SG&A expense lines.

We may see a slightly higher effective tax rate for the full year versus our previous guidance of 16.5%, depending on
the mix of income between the U.S. and international markets. As of now, we see that rate coming in between 16.5%
and 17%. In the future, it will then trend back down to our 16.5% longer-term guidance.
With this positive update, I will now close and turn the call over to Mark. Thank you very much.
Mark J. Alles
Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone. As you heard from Bob and Jackie, our clinical, regulatory, and
commercial teams delivered outstanding second quarter results. I am pleased to add my perspective on second quarter
product sales, current drivers of growth, and some of the significant franchise expansion opportunities for our
hematology and oncology business.
In the second quarter, excellent demand growth for REVLIMID and ABRAXANE, solid VIDAZA sales, and the early
commercial success of POMALYST combined to generate total product sales of $1.564 billion, strong year-on-year
growth of 17%, and quarter-on-quarter growth of 9%. REVLIMID's second quarter sales grew 13% year-on-year and
5% sequentially, to $1.052 billion. Increased demand was the overwhelming driver of performance. ABRAXANE's
second quarter sales were $155 million, representing 41% year-on-year and 26% quarter-on-quarter growth.
Continued stable use in metastatic breast cancer and adoption in non-small cell lung cancer combined to produce this
record quarterly result. Our teams in the United States and in Europe, and our partners in Japan, Australia, and Latin
America, are all preparing for regulatory approval and the commercial launch of ABRAXANE plus gemcitabine for
pancreatic cancer, a major unmet medical need around the world.
The POMALYST launch is confirming the unmet medical needs of patients with heavily pretreated multiple myeloma.
Commercially, the U.S. launch is exceeding our expectations. Quarter-on-quarter sales grew by 132%, to $66 million. I
will provide more insight into the launch of POMALYST later.
The second quarter performance of our leading cancer brands is a key indicator of the momentum we are generating.
Important growth drivers – duration of therapy, market share, geographic expansion, and new launches – combined to
generate strong sales growth. Other significant franchise expansion opportunities are just now coming into focus; many
more are in development.
Across markets, REVLIMID gained share in myeloma. Duration of therapy was up in the quarter. In Europe, our team
has successfully grown share and duration in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We are pleased with the early
launch success of REVLIMID in China, and our teams in Japan, Canada, and Australia produced excellent second
quarter results.
The U.S. launch of REVLIMID for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma added an immediate growth driver.
Our European team is working to secure reimbursement across markets for the recently-approved deletion-5q MDS
indication.
Optimizing the full potential of REVLIMID requires global regulatory approval for its use in patients with
newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma. A central element of our regulatory strategy is based on the results of the MM-020
study. Among the completed randomized Phase III studies designed to potentially secure approval, the MM-020 study
features important clinical outcomes regulatory agencies, physicians, and patients are seeking.
As you know, the primary endpoint was progression-free survival. The primary analysis measured the difference in
progression-free survival between Arm A and Arm C. Key secondary endpoints included overall survival, response
rates, and safety. Earlier this month, we announced that the MM-020 study met its primary endpoint. Working with the
study investigators, and in consideration of our regulatory strategy, we plan to submit an abstract to the American
Society of Hematology for the December ASH meeting.

Given the strength of the data package we now have, we are moving forward with our plan to submit regulatory
applications for REVLIMID for the treatment of newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma in the U.S. and in Europe by the
end of this year. Other global submissions will follow.
Presented at ASCO and again at EHA, the GIMEMA Phase III study of REVLIMID maintenance for newly-diagnosed
multiple myeloma after treatment with either MPR or autologous stem cell transplantation is the third randomized trial
in the younger transplant-eligible population to demonstrate superior progression-free survival, and the second study in
this population to demonstrate an overall survival advantage when REVLIMID is used as maintenance therapy until
disease progression.
Recent international medical meetings have also featured key data on REVLIMID in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We are
particularly impressed with the activity and safety of the combination of REVLIMID plus RITUXIMAB. As you know,
we are conducting a series of late-stage trials seeking to define the optimal patient population as part of our registration
strategy for this chemo-free regimen.
The results of the CALGB 50803 Phase II study of REVLIMID plus RITUXIMAB in patients with
previously-untreated follicular lymphoma were presented during the International Congress on Malignant Lymphomas.
This multicenter study reported a response rate of 93%. By PET scan, 72% achieved a complete response. The median
follow-up was just over 1.5 years.
This is the second Phase II trial of the R-squared regimen in untreated follicular lymphoma to demonstrate a
greater-than-90% overall response rate, with a very high percentage of complete responses. We believe that these data
provide compelling support for the ongoing conduct of the RELEVANCE study, our randomized Phase III registration
trial comparing the combination of REVLIMID plus RITUXIMAB to RITUXIMAB plus standard chemotherapy in
first-line follicular lymphoma. Enrollment is on target, with full approval expected to be completed by the second half
of 2014.
Approximately 50% of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who complete treatment with RITUXIMAB plus
CHOP chemotherapy achieve long-term remissions and can be considered cured. The other 50% do not do well and are
usually treated with a series of therapies spanning months or even years before eventually dying from their disease. We
are committed to developing novel therapies for these patients. This is the population where we anticipate REVLIMID
maintenance therapy could provide substantial clinical benefit.
The REMARC study is a randomized Phase III trial testing REVLIMID maintenance versus placebo following
treatment with standard R-CHOP in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We expect enrollment in REMARC
to be completed by the end of this year.
Last week we announced the discontinuation of the CLL-008 study due to an imbalance in the number of deaths in
patients treated with REVLIMID versus chlorambucil. We are disappointed with this outcome, but we have learned
more about the efficacy and safety of REVLIMID in previously-untreated patients with CLL who also have extensive
comorbidities.
Importantly, all other REVLIMID sponsored studies and investigator-initiated studies in CLL are continuing further
existing protocols. REVLIMID remains one of the most active drugs in development for CLL, and we're investing in a
robust program focused on a variety of clinical settings.
For example, our Phase III study, CLL-002, testing REVLIMID maintenance following documented response after one
or two lines of therapy, is enrolling well, with greater than 60% of patients now approved. Success in CLL-002
potentially defines a very unique segment of the market and may represent the optimal treatment strategy for
single-agent REVLIMID in this disease.
Our early drug development team has made important progress defining the dose and schedule of the CC-292, our
potent Btk inhibitor. Phase I studies in hematology have been initiated for the combination of REVLIMID plus
CC-292, REVLIMID plus ibrutinib, and the combination of CC-292 plus RITUXIMAB.

Driven by the outstanding execution of our commercial team and significant patient need, second quarter sales of
POMALYST were excellent. Year-to-date brand performance across all of our internal metrics is exceeding
expectations. While it is much too early to appreciate the length of treatment duration, repeat prescriptions are being
dispensed to a high percentage of patients. The successful launch of POMALYST in the U.S. market is helping us
prepare for our launch in Europe immediately following the final approval decision by the European Commission, a
regulatory approval we expect to receive very soon.
We were pleased with the diversity of clinical data presented during ASCO and EHA supporting the clinical profile of
POMALYST, and expect presentations of updated and new data to continue through the ASH meeting in December
and beyond.
ABRAXANE has entered a new phase of sales growth and potentially transformative clinical development. Our
near-term priorities for this major cancer brand have not change. We need to maximize its full potential in metastatic
breast cancer, optimize the opportunity in non-small cell lung cancer, and secure global regulatory approval and market
access for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.
We continue to expect final overall survival results from our Phase III study in metastatic melanoma in the fourth
quarter and our supporting studies in bladder cancer and other solid tumors. ABRAXANE is on track to become our
first oncology blockbuster brand.
Years of strategic thinking, innovative clinical research, and consistently strong operational execution are coming
together to create significant new opportunity for our global cancer franchise. Our in-line portfolio offers substantial
value to patients, physicians, and payers, supporting our efforts to effectively commercialize our market-leading cancer
therapies. For the next five years and beyond, we have numerous high-value catalysts that support our robust outlook
for growth, and we intend to capitalize on every one of them.
Speaking of our outlook for growth, I'd like to turn the call over to Scott Smith, the Global Head of our Inflammation
and Immunology franchise. Thank you very much.
[0D109B-E Scott Smith]
Thanks, Mark. It's a pleasure to be here with you today, speaking about the I&I franchise and the progress that we've
made over the past months. To date for apremilast, we've enrolled over 4,000 patients in the global commercial
registration programs, and in the past 12 months, we have seen positive results in six Phase III trials in psoriasis and
psoriatic arthritis and a positive Phase II trial in Behçet's disease.
We have also made significant progress with our regulatory filings. We submitted the U.S. PsA NDA in March and
have since received acceptance of the filing PDUFA date of March 21, 2014. In Q2, we submitted the NDS for PsA to
the Canadian authorities, and we are also on track for combined PsA psoriasis submission in the EU, as well as
submission for psoriasis later in the U.S. and Canada later this year.
In addition, the apremilast Phase III POSTURE trial in ankylosing spondylitis is rapidly accruing, and we anticipate
complete enrollment this quarter. We also initiated enrollment in a Japanese psoriasis PsA registration trial earlier this
year.
Last month, at the EULAR European Congress of Rheumatology, we presented PALACE-3 top-line data as well as
PALACE-1 52-week results, and you can see from the graph on the left, the results of PALACE-3 are remarkably
consistent with PALACE-1 results, with the apremilast BIB arm achieving an ACR20 score of 43% at week 16.
Additionally, the 30-mg BID arm achieved statistical significance on a number of key secondary endpoints, including
ACR50, ACR70, as well other key measures of physical function and quality of life at week 24. What created a lot of
excitement was the graph on the right that demonstrated that with continued treatment, the ACR20 scores of apremilast
continued to improve to the 50% to 60%-plus level by week 52.
It should be noted that apremilast was well-tolerated, and the prolonged exposure did not result in any unexpected
increase in adverse events or laboratory abnormalities.

Poster of the randomized Phase II trial BCT-001 investigating apremilast 30-mg BIB versus placebo in Behçet's disease
also generated a lot of excitement at EULAR. Behçet's disease is a very significant immune-mediated disease with
limited treatment options. In this 111-patient trial, there was a 71% complete response rate and 89% overall response
rate for apremilast, as shown on the graph on the left.
As well, there was a very rapid response, as demonstrated by the change in oral ulcer count, that you can see from the
graph on the right. We are continuing our meetings with various health authorities, discussing the possibility of using
the data from this trial for a potential Behçet's approval.
The second half of 2013 promises to be even more substantial in terms of the quantity and quality of additional data
that we will bring to the medical community. This data should include presentations of PALACE-2 and PALACE-3
52-week data, data in difficult-to-treat symptoms of PsA such as enthesitis and dactylitis; and additional, deeper views
of ESTEEM 1 and Behçet's trials.
We have also made significant progress in filling out our key Global Commercial and Medical Affairs leadership roles.
These positions have been filled with high-caliber candidates that have significant and deep experience at successfully
launching and commercializing blockbuster drugs in the immunology space.
In the meantime, our new heads of U.S. Commercial and Global Marketing have already begun to have a major impact.
We are accelerating all key launch activities to ensure full preparedness for early 2014 U.S. and Canada launches.
We are very, very excited as we prepare to bring a potentially significant new treatment option to the millions of
patients worldwide with PsA and psoriasis. We are very confident about the opportunity ahead of us, the opportunity to
create a new global standard for the treatment of psoriatic disease.
Thank you very much. Now I'd like to turn it back to Bob.
Robert J. Hugin
Thank you, Scott, and thank you, Jackie and Mark. The second quarter was truly outstanding. I want to thank all of my
colleagues at Celgene for their commitment to producing outstanding results and for striving to improve the lives of
patients worldwide. We are energized by the progress achieved in the first half of the year, and are focused on
producing outstanding results for the full year.
Much has been achieved in the past few months. Even more importantly, because of our investments in innovation and
our focus on patients, the future of Celgene has never been brighter. We look forward to updating you multiple times
later this year, including on our quarterly conference call on October 24, at the American College of Rheumatology
meeting in late October in San Diego, and at the American Society of Hematology meeting in early December in New
Orleans.
Thank you very much for your support. And, Operator, we can now open the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Geoff Porges from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Geoffrey Porges>: Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on a very strong quarter and the helpful
guidance and information. I have a question on ABRAXANE. That was a surprise that the result was so strong. And
perhaps you could give us some color on that, particularly how much of the growth came from the pancreatic cancer
based on use under the compendia listing? And, secondly, could you talk a little bit about the exact status outside the
U.S. of the approval for ABRAXANE, and are you going to have a full-scale launch in Europe and in other

geographies, or is it going to continue to come out on a more restricted basis? Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Geoff, thanks. It's Mark. Thanks for the question. So yeah, we're very pleased with the quarter
and ABRAXANE's sales trajectory. The majority of the incremental gain comes from the lung cancer launch. We are
seeing adoption starting in the pancreatic cancer segment. As you know, the NCCN guidelines upgraded the category to
1. The data have been presented multiple times, starting back in January, again at ASCO, at the World GI symposium
that just happened, so awareness of the survival advantage and then the access in the U.S. is starting to create that
momentum.
OUS, Europe is very important for us in terms of regulatory work, and we look to a full-scale launch of the pancreatic
cancer indication in Europe. We'll build the clinical program with Europe and U.S. collaboration for an adjuvant
pancreatic study, so that will support the ongoing profile of the product for years to come. You recall, in Australia, we
have a partner; and in Japan, in fact, in the quarter, our partner was successful getting not only a lung cancer approval
but also gastric cancer. So a lot of things happening ex-U.S., and of course we're very pleased with the progress in Q2
in the U.S.
<Q - Geoffrey Porges>: Thanks very much. That's very helpful.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: ...taking my question. Just given the recent positive data with 020, I was wondering if you
could comment on what are the next steps for figuring out what Europe wants to see as far as 020 for filing and 015,
and how do you think about using these two trials to get approval of REVLIMID in Europe? Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks, Robyn. It's Mark again. Bob, if you want to comment, please. But, Robin, we're very
pleased that MM-020 met its primary endpoint. We continue to follow up on the results of MM-015 and the two
maintenance trials as well. So our intent is to continue to move forward with filing strategies by the end of the year in
the U.S. and in Europe, followed by other markets around the world. The comprehensive data will be considered all the
way through the process.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: As a follow-up, though, do you know yet whether you will file on both together or on them
separately?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yeah, we're beginning discussions with regulators now, and so we want to leave the diversity of
options for us and them wide open.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Yeah, I think we want to make sure that patients all around the world have the most rapid
access to REVLIMID in newly-diagnosed myeloma, and so as we finalize that strategy, we're going to do the one that
gets access the most quickest, but we're very optimistic that we're going to begin, by the end of the year, the filings.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Company.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thanks for taking my question and congrats again on a great quarter. Maybe another one for
Mark – it does look like POMALYST and ABRAXANE, as Geoff mentioned, are doing very, very well. Could you
provide us some sort of a benchmark for where you are in terms of market share in the relapsed/refractory myeloma
population for POMALYST and then off-label ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer?

<A - Mark J. Alles>: Eric, thanks. It's Mark. With respect to pomalidomide, we are very excited about the launch. It's
going extremely well. We have a lot of metrics we look at. Because the product is in the market just four months, we
are beginning to see share gains that are meaningful, but I think it's a bit early to declare what market share is or isn't.
Certainly, in line 3-plus, the share is meaningful and very competitive, given the marketplace as you know it. With
respect to the ongoing launch, we see a lot of interest in combining POMALYST with other novel agents, so I think
that's going to drive the brand. And the data that recently came out, including subsets of patients with renal
insufficiency, etc., these are very important confidence-builders in the launch of the product.
With respect to ABRAXANE and share in pancreatic cancer, there is a meaningful share starting to show up, but again,
it's early in terms of from the time the date is in the market, market access becomes stronger, and what we're doing in
terms of preparing for launch, we're going to be in a good place to run to the PDUFA date. Remind you that the
PDUFA date is in September, September 21, and we still expect given the progress we're making in Europe that we
could have an end-of-year launch – approval launch in Europe. So I think all-systems-go for ABRAXANE in
pancreatic cancer.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Rachel McMinn from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Yeah, thanks. Maybe another way of asking the question, can you talk a little bit about the
REVLIMID versus pomalidomide dynamics, so maybe what percentage of POMALYST is coming from REVLIMID –
patients that would have otherwise been on REVLIMID? And then just a totally separate question, on 020, do you think
that overall survival trends are going to be important in getting European regulators comfortable with the data set, or is
PFS alone, when we see those curves, is that sufficient to really answer outstanding questions on the product? Thank
you.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Hi, Rachel. It's Mark. Thanks for the question. First, there's absolutely no cannibalization going
on between pomalidomide and REVLIMID. If anything, REVLIMID is expanding in share and in duration as a
consequence of the confidence in the market, being able to transition for patients who really exhausted first- and
second-line therapy, to be able to then have that confidence to go to a third- or even a fourth-line therapy.
Pomalidomide's profile with an overall survival advantage in that setting is quite comforting to the market.
With respect to MM-020, the PFS advantage, of course, is the center-point of the comprehensive data package we have.
There is no doubt that the overall benefit/risk in front of all regulators includes the assessment of trends for overall
survival, and then of course in the context of the safety profile, that there's nothing going on in the survival trend
positively or negatively that is being driven by particular side effects. So I think, in the end, PFS stands alone. Other
endpoints, including the overall safety and other trends in clinical outcomes, are part of that consideration. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Gene Mack from Brean Capital.
<Q - Gene C. Mack>: ...question. Actually, was wondering if Mark, maybe, and Jackie, if you guys could comment on
some of the strategy driving the MorphoSys deal and how you see maybe the development of that compound impacting
the various settings in myeloma, maybe where – I know it's early days, but maybe where we should see trials beginning
to unfold? And then maybe, Jackie, I don't know if it's too early to tell, but is this something that could wind up
impacting your 2017 guidance? Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yeah, hi, it's Mark. Let me jump in. Jackie and I will probably go back and forth a little bit on
the answer. The collaboration with MorphoSys is very important because it represents a new therapeutic way of
thinking about the treatment of multiple blood cancers – myeloma for sure, but we think CD38 is a target beyond
multiple myeloma, and we fully intend to investigate that. So we think this is an important, maybe best-in-class

therapeutic antibody against CD38 and are looking to fully develop it.
With respect to R&D, I think that there are different segments one could think of. We are very early in that assessment
but have pretty good ideas about how we would, with MorphoSys, think to develop the asset in multiple blood cancers.
With respect to guidance long-term, I think Jackie can answer that question, but my view is this is complementary to
our R&D program.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Completely agree. I would say that, today, we don't see an impact on 2017 guidance. We
have a number of projects that are not included in our assumptions for guidance in 2017 that could represent upside to
that guidance, and we've talked about those some in the past, and I would put this in that category, as well as the timing
is faster than what we're thinking about today.
<Q - Gene C. Mack>: And is it too early to tell when this drug might become commercially available?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: I think it's a little bit early. I don't know about too early. We certainly look forward and think that
it could be in a sort of classic Phase II to Phase III development cycle; on the earliest side, maybe four years; on the
longer side, maybe a five- to six-year window. But, again, a lot of that depends on, once the full integration of the
collaboration happens, we can get started.
<Q - Gene C. Mack>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from JPMorgan.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the question. I've got one on 020
and one on REV in CLL. So there's been a big benefit for you guys waiting for 015 to mature with respect to SPMs,
PFS to OS. I'm just curious if you thought 020 at this point was mature enough to make a compelling case, or if you
feel like there is a benefit to waiting a bit longer for these other things to mature? And then on REV in CLL, when you
look at, historically, tumor lysis syndrome had been a concern previously. Was this an issue in the ORIGIN study, or
was it just the type of patient enrolled in that study? Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Geoff, thanks for the question. We are comfortable that we are ready to begin very, very direct
dialogue with regulatory agencies with our intent to file in the U.S. and Europe, submit by the end of the year – filing,
of course, is a regulatory decision – and then go outside of those markets very rapidly. So our plan is intact. We'll
submit before the end of the year, hopefully in both parts of the world, and we will use 2014 to go to the rest of the
world.
With respect to TLS and CLL, I think it is an important question. There is a heterogeneity, across the patient death, the
imbalance in the CLL-008 study. There are no patterns. There's no direct cause and effect that we see. The deaths were
early. So we think that what's really happening in this setting was that extensive comorbidities and the age of the
population led to some early deaths, probably linked to disease resolution, but hard to really know.
That said, I think we're very, very comfortable with the idea that REVLIMID in combination in CLL, all of the
different studies that are ongoing, the profile, even in the setting of some morbidities, is quite good. In the setting of
maintenance, after patients are de-bulked, we're very excited because we think, once the tumor load is less, we think the
immunosurveillance effect of REVLIMID, that mechanism, is going to be quite effective. So we're optimistic. We
learned a lot, and we're moving into a more confident way of segmenting CLL going forward.

<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Jackie's been not asked a lot of questions, so I thought I'd bring her into the dialogue, if
I might. I would love to get updated thoughts on use of cash. There's obviously been rumors and press reports of lots of
M&A activity in the space; would love to know kind of where your head is, Jackie and perhaps, Bob, on use of cash.
And specifically, I'll go out on a limb and ask, would you be willing to comment on whether or not you've entered the
process that's going on over at Onyx? And then the follow-up is maybe just, I know in the past you've said you're
keeping your partnering options open for apremilast, and now that we're getting dangerously close to the PDUFA and
the launch, I'd love to know your updated thoughts on that, if any. Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thank you, Mark. I was feeling a little bit neglected here with no questions up to now, so I
appreciate it, and I'm sure Bob will want to jump in.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: I'm here for you.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: I think, as we've often said, we don't comment on specific transactions in the M&A space
that may be out there in the environment. What I would reiterate, and you've seen it from our activity thus far this year,
is that we continue to place a higher priority on the kinds of agreements that you've seen us strike with MorphoSys and
others so that we are complementing our internal research capabilities and our internal technology platforms with other
technologies and compounds that we think could lead to breakthroughs or represent best-in-class products in the future.
And we think layering that on top of an extremely strong organic growth profile that we have for many, many years to
come is a top priority for us right now.
So, with that, I think I'll move on to the apremilast partnering question – or maybe let Bob chime in as well, and then
we'll let Scott talk about apremilast partnering.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Yeah. I think, before Scott talks about apremilast, I just want to reiterate our strategic
perspective of how we've looked at new franchise and opportunities, and there are key factors that drive our
decision-making and our thinking on it. And the two that are most significant when we look at new franchises are: is
the data strong enough to really allow an entrant to make a new market here or a new impact on existing markets in a
meaningful way, and the data's strong enough to justify that kind of issue. So the first case there, I think, is becoming
more and more clear, with six positive pivotal Phase III studies and the continuing positive maturing of the data, very,
very important for us as we look at those decisions.
And, secondly, the other really important factor to us is, can we attract and have the right people that can lead the
efforts to ensure that we have the expertise and the capability to really deliver and maximize the value of the franchise
and the asset that we think about ourselves. Clearly, from a strategic perspective, maintaining ownership of your
products and reaping the full benefit from them for your shareholders and your franchise for yourself has great
long-term value, like the proposition that we've achieved globally, both financially and operationally, with REVLIMID
in our hematology/oncology franchises, which have accrued great benefit to us.
So I think that, strategically, over the past six months, we have very resoundingly answered the question about the
quality, the importance of the data, the benefit to have a significant impact on patients, and I think Scott and the team
have done a spectacular job of really attracting and building a leadership team that gives us the capability to take on
whatever challenges and opportunities we seek to pursue.
That being said, we should always be open-minded about opportunities in indications and geographies to ensure that we
maximize the full net present value of the franchise. But, as I hope you can tell from my comments, that I think this is a
very exciting opportunity to strengthen the breadth of our company strategically, and the key decisions that we are
faced with are ones out of clear strength from the data and the quality of the people leading the effort.
<A - Scott Smith>: Yeah, not much to really add to what Bob said. We're building a tremendous leadership team.
We're in full commercialization mode and acceleration, getting ready for launches both in the U.S. and Canada, which
are likely to come in the early part of 2014. So we are fully committed to that build and moving forward and
accelerating all our activities. And as Bob said, we're also engaged in some geographic or therapeutic discussions to see
if we can accelerate our overall top line by engaging in that. But we're hiring the leadership team with the feel that

we've got a tremendous asset, great data, and we're hiring the best people we can hire in the world for us to maintain
core commercialization of the asset.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: And just maybe to close the loop, we talked specifically about our view on M&A. Bob and
Scott just covered how we're thinking about apremilast and maximizing that opportunity. Just on the broader implied
question of use of cash, you've seen us execute on a business strategy for the past few years and a financial strategy that
supports the business strategy and that is focused on creating shareholder value. And you've seen what we've delivered
on that. You've seen that we've renewed our share repurchase authorization, which is just one tool amongst an
armatorium of tools that we have to manage the business investment and the capital structure. And you're going to see
us continue to consistently apply those strategies on a go-forward basis.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Liang from Leerink Swann.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thanks very much. I just have a question on R-squared. Is there a plan to seek compendia
listing based on the CALGB data presented by [ph] Dr. Martin (50:44) and the M.D. Anderson data, and can you
update us on the plans to have an interim look for the RELEVANCE trial?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks, Howard. So, currently, REVLIMID with the mantle cell approval and other data,
including R-squared, has very good access in the U.S. market. Of course, it's different around the rest of the world. The
RELEVANCE trial would be unblinded for the results on an event-driven basis. Again, this is like we've been talking
about with MM-020 for so long; there's no plan to do anything before. It would happen exactly on time with respect to
the protocol. In terms of CLL, so across the board, this regimen, R-squared, has become a chemo-free doublet, where
not only can we look at it in the context of acute therapy, but also a longer course of therapy because of the lack of
certain toxicities.
I think the other thing that's important is we're building an R-squared strategy in first-line diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma. We have very, very important ongoing analyses that are informing us about using an R-squared CHOP
versus an R-CHOP Phase III approach, and we think that this biomarker GCB/ABC is still a very important way for us
to look at differentiated performance of an R-squared doublet with or without CHOP included. So, much more to come
in the CLL and NHL programs off of the R-squared backbone, and I look forward to talking more about this with you
at ASH, and even into next year, because the data will continue to mature.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from Citi.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I've got a question on 020 and a question on POM.
Just on 020, crossover should not be a huge issue, right, the way that the study was designed? Patients, once they
discontinue, went on to subsequent therapies. I'm trying to get a sense, do you think you can show survival benefit
[indiscernible] (52:57) survival benefit over time, or how should we think about that? And then, secondly, just on
POM, how much of the initial kind of %58 million in the U.S. is bolus or pent-up demand versus being sustainable
demand and growing from there?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Hi, Yaron. It's Mark. Thanks for the question. You started with a question about crossover, and
these are things we'll find out over time as the results get analyzed and sensitivity analyses get done. What we know is
that progression-free survival 2 is part of the ongoing analysis, so of course that now – and you know that the European
guidance for regulatory review now does include a view to PFS2. This will then provide that calculation of any impact,

good or bad, with respect to progression-free survival. So we will have those data. They'll probably be part of an ASH
presentation. And so I think we just have to wait and see what we learn about that specifically.
With respect to overall survival and time, I'll just state the facts. You recall that the final PFS is where we unblinded the
study. That's the endpoint. Interim survival and then other survival analyses will continue with respect to the
benefit/risk. This all still ties directly to a year-end submission strategy in U.S., Europe, followed by the rest of the
world.
You asked about pomalidomide in the markets, and the vast majority – I don't have an exact percentage, but its
overwhelming majority is demand-based with new patient starts, total prescriptions. And then, as I mentioned, we are
seeing early signs that a high percentage of those new prescriptions are being repeated, so cycle 2, a little bit of cycle 3
already. I think that's something we'll be able to update you more about it, again, when we get a little bit further into the
launch.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: It's Bob. I just want to add a little something to that. Obviously, early in the launch, it's – you
have to be a little bit cautious, and clearly, the expectations, our expectations have been exceeded by the start of it. But
I also do want to point out that we did not have, as with other compounds on occasion, a very heavy number of – large
number of patients that were in a compassionate use program that rolled over into an early access program. So we did
not have that phenomenon here. That being said, it's still early, and we're encouraged, and it's exceeded our
expectations and we're going to keep pushing.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Thanks. Congrats on the quarter and on MM-020. A follow-on question on survival – I know
you've sort of addressed this in a couple ways, but when people get to ASH, there'll be an expectation, and people are
going to be focused on looking at the survival curves. Should one expect even trends this early, or is it just simply too
early to even see trends? How should we think about that as we go to ASH? And then, secondly, for Mark, in CLL,
that's a very fast-moving field; a lot of things were presented both at ASCO and ASH for orals in CLL. Did you guys
have the assets in-house to de-bulk the tumor? How do you think about your position in CLL?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yeah. So, at ASH, the data set will, of course, focus on the primary efficacy endpoint; that is
PFS. All of the secondary endpoints would have data. Sitting here today, it's not exactly clear what those data sets will
be, but we would expect that they would include the hazard ratio and an estimate of overall survival. That's an
expectation. Whether that's ready or not is to be determined. With respect to CLL, I think your question's important in
terms of about acute treatment of CLL, and I'll just remind you again, this is where follicular, and then aggressive,
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, we really like how REVLIMID plus RITUXIMAB is creating a different way of
thinking about the acute treatment of the disease.
And so, yes, the answer is REVLIMID used in a certain way is very effective at treating CLL in an acute stage. As a
single agent, we think it may be more effective maintaining the benefit over time. That said, as I mentioned, CC-292 is
moving very nicely into a more mature Phase I study in hematology, so we think CC-292 has made good progress, and
we look forward to seeing how that asset plays out; more data coming at ASH, more development outlines coming then
as well.

question for Jackie – at your R&D Day recently, you gave guidance for 2015 REVLIMID sales that I think may have
been a little bit below people's expectations. I know, today, you've increased your 2013 REVLIMID sales guidance. I
was wondering if you'd maybe just talk through the dynamics that might be shaping this. Did you see a re-acceleration
in uptake since May? Is $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion still the number we should be thinking about for 2015. Or do you
have expectations maybe for growth slowing down in the medium term a little bit more, perhaps, than we've been
expecting? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Yeah, thanks for the question, Brian. With respect to updates to the longer-term guidance,
we do that from time to time when we've got clear trends that we see. As opposed to where we were back in May with
the R&D Day, I think where we sit today, we've got the evidence of the momentum that we saw across the world in
demand for REVLIMID, and we feel very good about what that looks like. We're also sitting here today with the
benefit of the positive outcome on the primary endpoint for the MM-020 trial. So I think that where we sit today, we
feel quite good about where we are with REVLIMID and the future for REVLIMID, and even greater clarity on the
regulatory pathways and the way forwards for the submissions on newly-diagnosed.
So I think we can continue to reiterate our confidence in our longer-term targets, and you've seen how we feel about the
shorter term with 2013 and the visibility that we have there to increase the guidance on REVLIMID revenues for this
year. So, continue to watch for more to come on that with respect to future updates on the longer-term guidance, and
we feel very good about where we are.
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Thanks very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ying Huang from Barclays.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Thanks for taking my questions. So I have a question on apremilast NDA. I know we saw the
52-week data from PALACE-1 at EULAR last month. Did you include that data in the NDA, and would that be
included in the label when FDA approves the drug? And then, secondly, you guys already saw some extension data
from PALACE-2 and 3. Do you also see the similar trend to what we saw in PALACE-1 – that is, over time, you
actually increase efficacy?
<A - Scott Smith>: So, in terms of the NDA, the 52-week data is not in the NDA. We would hope to submit that data
at some point after the initial approval and get that in the label. There's often longer-term observed data in competitors'
labels of this type. Your second question was relative to do we see similar things with PALACE-2 and 3. We see very
similar trends in the long-term data; when you take a look at the observed data in these trials, for all the trials, very,
very – one thing that's striking – and we'll get all the data out in the second half of the year, longer-term data for
PALACE-2 and 3 – very consistent, and gets even more consistent when you take a look at the longer-term endpoints;
so yes, very consistent with the program.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And what about publication strategies, Scott, in terms of all the data? How are we doing with
that?
<A - Scott Smith>: Yeah, so we're moving forward. The first we would look to get the first PALACE-1 published.
That is being close to being submitted. There's a lot of data there. We would publish the full 52-week, and then we
would work to publish PALACE-2, PALACE-3. And then there's a lot of sub-publications which would come from
each of those – each of those pending, there's lots of subsets of that data that you can take, taking a look at
enthesitis/dactylitis. But it's by far – the PALACE-1 through 4 program, by far the largest PsA program ever initiated
globally by any molecule, and there's a lot of data, and there's going to be – there's a lot of good data that exists today,
and there's going to be a lot more over the next couple years.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Bob, thanks for answering that question. If I can just slip another one, can you guys provide an
update on the patent challenge by Actavis?

<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: This is Jackie. Hi. So, not a lot new has happened. We speak about this fairly often, where
we're still in the discovery phase on the new patents where we had to go through the process again. As you know, the
timeline got extended once. Our estimate at the current time, I guess, if we have a view on timing would be that there's
no Markman hearing scheduled for the moment. It could come sometime next year. But we still go through discovery,
and we expect that to continue over the course of the year right now. So not really anything new since the last time we
talked about it. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - M. Ian Somaiya>: Hi. Just a question on the filing for REVLIMID for newly-diagnosed in maintenance – can
you just maybe speak to the strategy to get an overall survival claim, whether it's in Europe or in the U.S., which trial
you think it'll be based on, and maybe give us a sense of the timing? As I look at the slide deck, you're pointing to a Q4
2013 filling based on 015 and 020. If you're confident on 015, would you wait for the overall survival benefit to be
confirmed in 020 before submitting that data?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Ian, thanks. It's Mark, appreciate the question. Just a clarification, the use of the word
maintenance gets mixed up a little bit in how we talk about newly-diagnosed myeloma. I understand why. I want to
make it clear that, in 020, patients are treated from diagnosis of myeloma continuously or for fixed course, and that was
a clinical strategy built into the trial, so there's no – technically, there's no maintenance effect other than continuous
treatment. That said, I think it's very important that we focus on that we have four studies with progression-free
survival advantages that are quite robust. This is the clinical benefit endpoint that regulators have recognized in cancer
for a very long time.
All other data will be part of the regulatory review, including benefit/risk assessments with respect to updated incidence
rates for SPMs, how that does or doesn't play out, survival trends, et cetera. So there's not an either/or. This will all be
based on the overwhelming efficacy of the drug with respect to progression-free survival. And then we will, based on
the comprehensive data package we have, submit in the U.S., submit in Europe, and follow those submissions around
the world as rapidly as possible.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Joel Sendek from Stifel.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Hi. Thanks a lot. I have a question on apremilast too. And maybe I'm looking into it a little bit
too closely here, but if you look at slide 36, the box on the submission looks like it's in the third quarter. Should I read
into that at all? And I'm also wondering, since you have the 52-week data in PALACE, will you have, at some point,
52-week data on ESTEEM? And if so, will that be part of the – will you submit at some point maybe in the hope to
getting possibly maintenance use of apremilast in psoriasis? Thanks.
<A - Scott Smith>: So let me – sorry about that. Let me answer the second question first. And we do look at
longer-term data for ESTEEM and see increasing response. We take a look at the observed data, et cetera in the
ESTEEM program. 52-week data we don't necessarily have in ESTEEM because the study design is a little bit
confounded. Regulatory authorities wanted to see in the context of the psoriasis study a randomized withdrawal after
week 32 for some of subsets of patients who had had response, how long does it take for disease to come back and
some of those things.
So we don't have straight long patients on drug for 52 weeks non-uninterrupted like we did with the PALACE program.
But we will, in the second half of the year, hopefully, have some presentations of the longer-term ESTEEM data. It's a
little more confounded, I think, than you'll see with PsA. Same trends that you see in PsA; just the study design creates
some differences. The first question was relative to submission in the third quarter of – which particular submission?

<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: With psoriasis, U.S.
<A - Scott Smith>: Psoriasis U.S. NDA will be in the second half of the year. It's not a Q3 or Q4. We purposely put
that second half there.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: So as soon as possible.
<A - Scott Smith>: As soon as possible.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Yeah, we've shown it on the slides just as a – it could fall right at the end of Q3 or
beginning of Q4 and be a just little bit ahead of the others, so it's – optically, it looks like that, but yeah.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: No change to our plans.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: No change to the plan at all.
<A - Scott Smith>: And it will be the next submission likely.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: I think we've got five people in the queue. We may not get to all of you, so it depends on
how long the questions are. We're going to take at least two more. Next question?

Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Wei from Jefferies.
<Q - Thomas A. Wei>: Thanks for taking the question. I'm wanting to ask just a housekeeping thing on the
contribution of wholesaler inventory stocking for the POMALYST sales during the quarter, and then also a question on
REVLIMID market share, which has been pretty stable now in the mid-50%s for a while. I'm curious where you see
that going over time and if you think that MM-020 can kind of restart share gains in the U.S., or is it something else
that you think could be the driver of share gains higher than mid-50%s?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks, Thomas. It's Mark. On inventory, we've seen, as expected, weeks-on-hand for
pomalidomide come down as demand has grown, so inventory is moving exactly as we expected. With respect to
MM-020 and what's happening in the myeloma share circumstance, it's very interesting, because data sets, of course, do
move share. But the other thing that is part of our program, that we think over the next year to three, that will be
important are the combined studies looking, for example, at Bristol-Myers Squibb's elotuzumab in combination with
REV/dex, looking at the KYPROLIS development in combination with REV/dex.
So there're multiple, multiple market-shaping events that will move share from where it is today. What we control
directly is submitting to the U.S. regulatory authority – I took your question to mean U.S. alone, so FDA – our
newly-diagnosed application, and then finally being able to – assuming that we get a positive outcome, being able to
directly promote REVLIMID/ dexamethasone or a combination that would be in the label for newly-diagnosed
myeloma. That, we definitely believe will reaccelerate adoption of REVLIMID and share in newly-diagnosed patients.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: We're going to try to take two more questions, so.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Schimmer from Lazard Capital Markets.
<Q - Josh E. Schimmer>: Okay, thanks for squeezing me in. Have you started to see any meaningful inflection in the
use of the R-squared regimen in the U.S. with the approval of the 20-mg dose, or when might we see that? And do you
have any plans on studying apremilast as add-on to biologics, and if so, when might this start? Thanks.

<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks for the question. On the R-squared regimen and the introduction of the 20-mg dose for
lymphoma specifically, it's early. We don't see a lot of adoption in the market for the combination, but we do see
tremendous investigator interest. So I think we're on the leading edge of being able to establish that regimen.
<A - Scott Smith>: The focus of our future clinical development is not likely on add-on to biologics. Certainly, there'll
be some exploration of that for safety reasons and some utilization. But we see the primary positioning for apremilast
being used before biologics, and can be in some cases after biologics with failures, but the primary position being in
that pre-biologics space base earlier than biologics. And we see a very different risk/benefit profile emerging from the
Phase III data which would support that use early.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: So I think, Operator, we have time for one last question, please.
Operator
Thank you. And our final question for today comes from Matthew Roden from UBS Securities.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, assuming MM-015 and 020 are supportive of label
expansion of REVLIMID in Europe, should we be modeling uptake in the transplant setting as well as the
non-transplant setting, the latter being where those trials were conducted? I realize that you have other data sets like
ECOG that could be supportive here, but I just wanted to clarify this issue because I know that the EU tends to be very
specific in its labeling, and I just don't know to what extent that applies here. So it would be helpful if you could walk
us through what settings and combinations you think your filings will be supportive of outside the U.S.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Matt, thanks for the question. So, in the end, we would want to have as many segments in
newly-diagnosed myeloma represented in our label in Europe and around the world as possible. And this is my point
about combination therapy. So, MPR, RD, these are regimens, as you well know, that could be approved for elderly or
younger patients. So, right now, our models include all patient populations. I think the only category where we discount
rapid adoption or major adoption is in the higher-risk group because that's still an open-ended question about
cytogenetics and some of the things that are in development that might be specific to high risk. That said, these
combinations with REVLIMID are as effective as all other existing regimens for high-risk patients.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: And just to make sure that you're aligned with our model assumptions, we have pushed the
transplant setting revenues out to close to two years later than the non-transplant setting, just from the standpoint of
when we actually start to see material revenues and when they start to ramp up. So it is -
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Outside the U.S.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Outside the U.S., outside the U.S., so it is layered into the model that way.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse
With that, thank you very much for being on the call with us today. We appreciate it, and we look forward to seeing
you and speaking with you soon.
Robert J. Hugin
Thank you.
