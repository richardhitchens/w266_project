earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K Report and in the company's other reports already on file with the
SEC.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP
financial measures may be found in the first quarter 2015 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides
as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at
ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review some key points
related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed. Once Jeff

completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.
With that, let me turn it over to Jeff.
Jeffrey C. Campbell
Well, thanks, Rick and good afternoon everyone. Overall, Q1 was a solid quarter for the company, consistent with the
framework and financial outlook we presented at investor day last month. The quarter reflected solid core underlying
performance as well as several discrete impacts, including the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and various changes to
our co-brand relationships.
As you recall, we discussed at investor day our expectations for the first quarter. And in fact, EPS growth of 11% did
come in better than our full-year outlook, and even a little better than we thought a few weeks ago; in part due to the
timing of our incremental spending on growth initiatives, which will ramp up over the course of the year, along with
some other timing benefits that we don't expect to repeat as we go through the year. I'll discuss these items in more
detail later in my remarks. Importantly, for these reasons, our full-year 2015 EPS outlook remains unchanged, as we
continue to expect EPS growth to be flat to modestly down.
Looking back to the financial outlook framework from investor day, our core underlying performance remained
consistent and continued to be driven by solid revenue growth of 5%, after adjusting for FX and business travel
revenues in the prior year, disciplined cost controls, and a strong balance sheet, that enabled us to return a substantial
amount of capital to shareholders in the form of repurchases over the past year.
Our results also reflect some of the discrete impacts that we discussed a few weeks ago. In the co-brand space, we are
seeing the impact from the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada, as well as the reset impact from the
early renewals we have done with several other co-brand partners, including Delta, Starwood and Cathay Pacific. In
addition, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the first quarter and represented a significant headwind to our
quarterly earnings performance.
Importantly, during the quarter, we also continued to have strong momentum on key initiatives. Highlights included the
expansion of our small merchant coverage through OptBlue, the announcement of the Plenti loyalty coalition program
in the U.S., the signing of the new Charles Schwab co-brand along with the renewal of our co-brand relationship with
British Airways and Iberia, as well as the announcement just today of our new wearable payments partnership with
Jawbone. We were also very pleased by our strong 2015 CCAR performance, which will provide us with the flexibility
to increase our dividend and share repurchases going forward. As we discussed at investor day, we believe that these
developments are indicative of the many attractive opportunities for growth that we have over the longer term.
So that is the quarter in a simple summary. So we get into the details, I will warn you that lapping the impact of 2014's
Global Business Travel and Concur transactions, along with the 2015 discrete impacts of FX and our co-brand changes,
all combined to make understanding our results this year a bit more complex than usual.
To begin now with our financial results for Q1, as you can see on slide two, reported billings growth was 3%. Like
many other global companies, the strength of the U.S. dollar had a significant impact on our growth rates this quarter.
As the dollar continued to strengthen, the magnitude of the FX impact increased, and for the first quarter, depressed our
growth by nearly four percentage points. As a result, FX adjusted billings growth was 7%, significantly higher than our
reported rate. I'll provide more details on our billings performance shortly, but lower gas prices in the U.S. and the
termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada clearly had an impact on our results.
Reported revenue growth of negative 3% was of course also impacted by FX, as well as the inclusion of business travel
revenues in the prior year. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 5%, consistent with both the prior
quarter and recent trends.
Net income grew by 6%, helped by disciplined expense control and lower provision costs, both of which also reflected
some timing benefits in the quarter, which helped offset the discrete impacts of FX and the changes in our co-brand

relationships.
Below the net income line, we continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to our
shareholders. Over the past year, we have repurchased 48 million shares, which translated to a 4% decline in average
shares outstanding. This decline in shares outstanding, along with the modestly lower tax rate drove the 11% diluted
EPS growth that we generated during the first quarter. This performance also resulted in an ROE of 29% for the period
ending March 31, well above our on-average and over time target of 25% and demonstrate the continued strength of
our business model.
Let's now move to a more detailed review of our key performance drivers during the first quarter starting with billed
business on slide three. On an FX adjusted basis, billings growth slowed modestly from 8% in Q4 to 7% during the
quarter. Looking at the results by segment, in our U.S. consumer and small business segment, growth also decelerated
slightly to 7% in Q1. This performance was impacted by the more than 30% decline in gas prices year-over-year, as
well as slower retail sales growth consistent with industry-wide trends in the U.S.
I would note that in the U.S., we did not see any material impact on our billings growth from the announced
termination next year of our relationship with Costco. As we would have expected however, we have started to see
some slowing of new Costco co-brand card acquisitions, which along with any future customer behavior changes that
we may experience, will likely begin to impact our performance somewhat later this year.
It's also worth noting on billings that the deceleration in Q1 was more pronounced in our GCS segment, where billings
were up 4% on an FX adjusted basis, as we seem to see a slowdown in spending across a number of corporate
customers primarily in the U.S. GNS continues to be our strongest billings growth segment, with FX adjusted growth
of 16% during the quarter. This continued strong growth demonstrates the diversity of our business model, given the
much higher than company average returns on equity we achieved in the GNS business.
Finally, ICS' FX adjusted growth was 2% during Q1, but as we began to see last quarter, we saw very different trends
by region, as you can see on slide four. The slowdown in international regions came primarily from LACC, where
volumes were down 4% versus the prior year, driven by a drop-off in Canadian billings. As you recall, we began to see
volumes slow in Canada during Q4, when card acceptance at Costco in Canada was expanded to include other
networks. Beginning January 1, American Express products were no longer accepted in Costco warehouses in Canada,
and we are now seeing the full impact from the termination of this relationship on billed business.
In contrast to LACC, we saw improved growth in the JAPA region, which was, again, the fastest-growing region in the
quarter, up 16% on an FX-adjusted basis. This solid performance continued to be powered by strong growth in China
and Japan. In all international regions, you see that like other U.S. companies with a significant global footprint, our
reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates.
To provide you with some additional perspective here, on slide five, we have again included a comparison of our
reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth rates for the last eight quarters. As you can see in the trajectory of the blue
dotted line on the slide, our adjusted revenue growth remains consistent with recent trends, in the 5% range. However,
during the first quarter, foreign exchange had a more significant negative impact on our results than in prior periods,
dragging adjusted revenue growth down by nearly four percentage points. At current FX rates, we would expect to see
a similar drag in the second quarter.
As you can see in the second row, the bottom of the chart, the dollar has strengthened by 10% to 30% year-over-year
against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U.S. Now, of course, this revenue impact is partially
offset by the benefit we receive from having certain expenses denominated in international currencies, but there is a
bottom line impact, especially when rates move this dramatically.
Over the longer term, we continue to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a diverse set of
markets around the world is a strength of our business model. As we discussed at investor day, however, if the current
rates hold, FX will continue to have a significant discrete impact for the balance of the year.

Turning now to loans, you see on slide six that worldwide loans are up 4% versus the prior year. Consistent with
historical seasonal trends, we did see a drop-off in loan balances versus year-end and a small sequential increase in net
interest yield during the first quarter. In the U.S., which constitutes the majority of our loan portfolio, growth was
relatively consistent with the prior quarter at 7%.
On the international side, reported loan balances were down year-over-year, due to the negative impact from FX rates
and a decline in loans related to the Costco Canada co-brand portfolio. Stepping back, our loan growth has consistently
been above the industry over the past two years, and we talked at investor day about the opportunity to continue this
trend by growing share with existing Card Members, as well as attracting new customers to our franchise. Having said
this, however, I'd also remind you that net interest income this quarter still made up only 18% of our total revenues.
And given the expected runoff in loans associated with the Costco U.S. co-brand portfolio next year, even if we
continue to grow our core loan portfolio at the higher rates you have seen, our overall business model will remain very
spend focused.
So now putting together our billings and loan performance, you see on slide seven that revenues declined 3% on a
reported basis, but increased by 5% after adjusting for FX and business travel revenues in the prior year. I'll note that
revenue growth during the current quarter does reflect a portion of the negative impact from our co-brand partnership
early renewals, as well as a larger impact versus Q4 from the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada.
Even with these discrete impacts, however, adjusted revenue growth of 5% is consistent with recent trends, illustrating
the ongoing strength of our underlying core business.
The two largest components of revenue are, of course, discount revenue and net interest income. To start with the
former, during the first quarter, discount revenue grew by 1%, which was approximately 200 basis points below the
reported growth in billed business of 3%. The first driver of this difference was a decline in our reported discount rate,
which was down two basis points versus the prior year. This year-over-year decline is slightly smaller than in recent
quarters, in part because the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume, where we earned a much lower discount rate,
actually raises the company average discount rate. The discount rate also reflects continued growth in our OptBlue
program, as merchant acquirers actively sign up new merchants onto the American Express network.
As Ed discussed at investor day, 14 of the top 15 merchant acquirers in the U.S. are now part of OptBlue. Last year,
when Anre Williams introduced this new program to you at the February Financial Community Meeting, he said that
we expect to increase our small merchant acquisition by 50% or more for the next several years starting in 2015. And
while this is obviously a multi-year effort, we, in fact, signed more than 400,000 new small merchants last year in
2014. So we are clearly off to a good start. We are also undertaking similar efforts to improve our small merchant
coverage in many other markets around the world.
Also contributing to the gap between discount revenue and billed business growth was faster growth in both GNS
volumes and contra-revenue items, including cash incentives and certain payments related to our renewed co-brand
relationships.
Turning to the other key component of revenue, net interest income, we saw a healthy 8% growth rate, driven by our
continued efforts to grow our loan portfolio as well as lower funding costs. As the majority of our loan portfolio is in
the U.S., the impact of FX is smaller on net interest income than on other revenue lines.
Moving now to credit performance on slide eight. You can see that our lending credit metrics remain at or near
historically low levels and that our write-offs and delinquency rates both remained relatively consistent with recent
trends. As you can see on slide nine, despite this steady lending credit performance, provision expense dropped 13%
versus prior year. Typically, we experienced a reserve release during Q1 due to the seasonal decline in loans and
receivable balances versus year end. The increase in the reserve release versus the prior year is largely due to charge
card, where the prior period included a modest reserve build.
Moving to our lending reserve coverage levels on slide 10, coverage remained relatively consistent, after considering
the impact of the seasonal decline in loans and receivables I just mentioned. We believe coverage levels remain
appropriate, given the risk level inherent in the portfolio. Thinking about the balance of the year, it is important to note

that we would expect reserves to build modestly in line with loan growth and any changes in credit performance.
Therefore, we would expect provision to increase year-over-year and to represent a headwind to growth for the
remainder of 2015. Moreover, as we discussed at investor day, we did build into our multi-year financial outlook, an
assumption that we would see some steady upward tick in write-off rates and a modest build in reserves over the
outlook period.
Moving below revenue now to expenses on slide 11. On a reported basis, expenses declined by 5% versus the prior
year. Excluding business travel expenses incurred in 2014, adjusted total expenses increased by 1%, and also, of
course, benefited somewhat from the strength of the U.S. dollar. I'll come back to operating expenses and marketing
and promotion in a moment, first, however, I'll touch on a few other items on this slide.
Rewards expense grew by 4%, which was relatively consistent with our reported billed business growth. Now rewards
expense in the current quarter does include a portion of the discrete impact from our renewed co-brand relationships.
The resultant increase in our rewards costs, however, was partially offset by some timing benefits this quarter related to
our Membership Rewards Program.
Next, while it's a relatively small percentage of total expenses, cost of Card Member services increased significantly
year over year by 18%. As background, the portion of the expenses in the line are related to the payments we may
provide partners for services such as baggage fees, companion tickets and airport lounge access, which have increased
as a result of our renewed co-brand relationships. For the remainder of 2015, given that Q1 of last year also included
elevated costs and costs of Card Member services, we would expect to see an even higher level of growth for this line
item.
Last on slide 11, the tax rate during the first quarter was 34%, which was relatively consistent with recent quarters, but
slightly below the prior year. As we mentioned at investor day, our assumption is that the tax rate will remain roughly
in line with recent performance during 2015.
Let's turn now to marketing and promotion expenses, which account for the majority of our spending on growth
initiatives. Slide 12 shows the trend of these costs. And you see that while this quarter's marketing and promotion
expenses were 4% higher than the prior year, you'll also notice that these costs have historically been much lower
during each year's first quarter. More broadly, as we think about 2015, we continue to evolve our plans around the
timing and level of incremental spending on growth initiatives. As we have said, the majority, but not all, of this
spending will occur in marketing and promotion. Considering this, we would expect marketing and promotion expenses
to be relatively similar with the elevated levels of 2014, which you can see on this slide, included higher levels of
expenses in Q2, when we had the business travel joint venture transaction gain, and in Q4, when we had the Concur
gain. While we could have made the decision to reduce investments from their elevated 2014 levels, as we discussed at
investor day, we believe that the right decision for shareholders to best position the company for the medium- to
long-term is to keep investments at an elevated level this year, in anticipation of the termination of our relationship with
Costco in the U.S. during early 2016.
As Ken, Ed, and Steve discussed in detail a few weeks ago, the incremental spending in 2015 will focus on the many
growth opportunities that we see across all segments in our company, including our efforts to capture a meaningful
portion of the spend and lend of our Costco Card Members in the U.S.
Turning now to operating expense performance on slide 13, our reported results continue to reflect the impact of
business travel in the prior year, across a number of expense categories complicating line-by-line comparisons. That
said, excluding business travel expenses incurred in the prior year, adjusted operating expenses in total decreased by
2% in the quarter. I'll also note that during the quarter, we benefited from some specific items in the other net line,
which we do not expect to repeat going forward. As you think about the balance of the year, I'd also point out that
operating expenses have historically been lower during Q1.
Moving to slide 14, adjusted operating expense growth, of course, remained well below our stated 3% growth target.
As we discussed at investor day, maintaining disciplined control of our expenses, particularly operating expenses,
remains a key driver of our earnings performance. As Steve noted that day, however, we are not achieving this

disciplined expense control through a cutback in investment levels, but rather through ongoing efforts to increase the
efficiency of the organization. We continue to make substantial investments within operating expenses to support our
growth initiatives.
Now shifting to our capital performance on slide 15. During the current quarter, we returned 65% of the capital we
generated to shareholders while strengthening our already strong capital ratios. As I mentioned at investor day, share
repurchases of approximately $750 million for the first quarter were below the amount included in our 2014 CCAR
submission. Due to some nuances in the 2014 CCAR rules associated with the capital generated by employee plans,
these rules have evolved for future CCAR periods, but did cause our Q1 payout ratio to be somewhat lower than in
recent quarters. I'd also point out that the 2015 CCAR process gives all participants more flexibility on the timing of
share repurchases across the five-quarter CCAR approval period. Accordingly, the exact timing and size of our
repurchases in 2015 will be driven by many factors, including, but not limited to the levels of our earnings and the
demand for other capital uses.
Looking at our capital ratios on the bottom of the slide, you see a more significant increase year-over-year in our Tier 1
capital ratio. This was driven by the $1.6 billion in preferred issuances we executed during the last two quarters. As a
reminder, we will see the EPS impact from the dividend payments associated with these issuances beginning in Q2.
These payments will reduce our net income available to common shareholders by approximately $20 million each
quarter.
Stepping back from these quarterly results, our strong relative performance in the 2015 CCAR process and the FED's
non-objection to our capital plan clearly illustrate the strength of our capital position and business model. This
reinforces our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength, and we
remain committed to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
Before moving on to your questions, let me make just a few final comments, stepping away from the complexity I just
took you through and going back to the key themes in our results. We believe that our core underlying performance this
quarter was solid and reflected the continued strength of our business model and the trends we discussed last month at
investor day. Earnings per share growth of 11% was better than our full-year 2015 outlook, in part due to some specific
benefits in Q1, most notably in provision and operating expenses, and also because we have not yet seen a ramp-up in
incremental spending on growth initiatives. Clearly, given our 11% EPS growth in Q1, simple math would indicate that
EPS growth would have to be negative for the balance of the year to meet our continued outlook for full-year EPS
growth to be flat to modestly down.
Looking at the second quarter, in particular, I would remind you that you will begin to see the impact from our recent
preferred share issuances and that the prior-year EPS of $1.43 included a net benefit from the business travel joint
venture transaction. Considering this, while it is obviously very early in the quarter, we would expect earnings per
share in Q2 to be more significantly down from last year. All this is consistent with our previous comments that
quarterly earnings performance should be more uneven than it has been historically, while we go through this
transitional period. Given this dynamic, our focus has been on our full-year earnings outlook rather than our
performance in any individual quarter.
When we consider our Q1 performance, and our Q2 comments, and the context of the multi-year financial outlook that
we reviewed at investor day, we believe we are on track and are continuing to do the right things to position the
company for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick for some details on our Q&A session.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. And we'll go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
<Q - Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani>: Thank you. I guess my question will be on Costco Canada. I know you guys have
addressed it throughout the last couple of times you've spoken. But now that you have a full quarter's worth of
experience at Costco Canada, could you maybe just talk about your ability to retain spending on those customers' cards
and how you think it reflects relative to your strategy in the U.S.? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Thanks, Sanjay, for the question. Maybe, let me start by providing just a little bit of
context for Canada, because we've given a fairly unusual amount of color around the U.S. where we've pointed out that
that relationship consists of about 70% of the co-brand spend being out of store, also talked about the co-brand in the
U.S. accounting providing 8% of global billings. Just to draw a contrast to Canada, in Canada the Costco co-brand and
Costco as a merchant, are representing a more significant portion of our country total billings in Canada. The other
probably two very important differences to point out to you are that the portion of spend on the Costco Canada
co-brand that was in-store was much higher; it was about 60% in-store. And, of course, in Canada, there was no sale of
the portfolio.
So with all that as context, you're correct that this is the first full quarter since the termination of acceptance of Amex
products in Canada on January 1, as you would expect, that means all of the in-store spend goes away. But we, while
it's still early, I would say, continue to be pleased, as you now heard us say in a couple forums, by our efforts to capture
the spend and lend of the Canadian Costco Card Members, and, of course, in Canada, we did issue a new cashback
card. As you would expect, we are very focused on those customers who clearly have an affinity with the American
Express brand. And I'd say there have been significant earnings and we are encouraged by them and we are being very
thoughtful about how we will apply them in the U.S. As you would expect, Sanjay, I probably don't want to provide a
lot of color and detail beyond that general statement. But we are encouraged one quarter in.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Yes, Jeff. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how we should think about a
potential gain from the Costco sale. And sometimes these portfolios can trade for 15%-plus premiums. Can you talk
about some of the offsets and how that may also impact your capital return, given that you were able to return more
than 100% in the CCAR?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, couple of comments. I really, in terms of the progress, potential outcome, Don, on
any portfolio sale, I can't really comment beyond what we've already said, which is we'll just have to see – you know,
there is a process, and we'll see how it plays out. In terms of the financial outlook we have provided, I would remind
everyone that we did not include any assumption about a gain on the sale of the portfolio. So any gain would be
incremental to the outlook we laid out.
When you think about capital implications, obviously, if there is a portfolio sale, there is a significant reduction in
risk-weighted assets, since the Costco U.S. loan portfolio, as we previously talked about, constituted about 20% of our
global loan portfolio? That in and of itself, depending upon how quickly we ramp our efforts elsewhere to replace that
spend, that, of course, frees up some capital.
And to the extent there is a sale and there is a gain, I think it's fair to say that we'd have to look at the timing and
amount of any gain and think about what portion of it we might want to use to make sure we're fully funding our efforts
to capture the future spend and lend from our relationships with the Costco Card Members and what portion should

drop to the bottom line.
Clearly, we have a very strong balance sheet already. And I think we've demonstrated a very strong and steady
commitment to using that balance sheet to return capital to the shareholders. It's also fair to say, though, that the nature
and timing of the CCAR process means there's often a lag between big developments that impacts capital and our
ability to run them through the CCAR process. So we'll kind of have to see how this plays out. But hopefully that gives
you a sense, Don, of how we're thinking about the various components.

And our next question will come from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Ho>: Good afternoon. Can we talk about the expense ramp and specifically what areas you are investing,
particularly, as we start in the second quarter and maybe this quarter as well, and how are they different than some of
the areas that you have invested in in previous years, and, in particular, like coalition partners? And do you expect the
Costco USA build to accelerate towards the end of the year versus the middle part of the year?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Good question, David. Let me make a few comments. One of the reasons why we have
continued to talk a little bit about an expectation that you'll see more quarterly unevenness in our earnings is we think
the prudent thing here is to be a little flexible around the timing and amounts that we choose to spend around one of the
things that we will be ramping our growth, spending initiatives – our growth initiative spending on, that's focusing on
the capturing the future spend and lend from our relationship with Costco Card Members. It's a very complex process.
Between now and 2016, that will play out in that relationship, and we need a little bit of flexibility that will determine
when we choose to ramp up some of our marketing efforts and when we don't.
Certainly, that is one of the elements though when you think about what is different this year and potentially next year
about the range of things that we do growth spending on. We have a very rich pool of very dedicated American Express
Card Members and we will do our best to capture their future spend and lend.
The second thing I'd like to point out for 2015 is, we are very excited about the launch of Plenti, since you brought up
coalition. As you would imagine or as you'd recall, we have a pretty well-trod track with the loyalty coalition business
as we've launched it in other countries for understanding the flows as you go from the first year of launch which is
more of an investment year as the program then matures in the coming years.
So I think it's fair to say that we want to make sure this is a really strong launch and we're putting a lot of resources
towards that in 2015 and that's probably a little different in terms of the profile that you would have seen last year and a
little different than what you will see next year as the program moves beyond the launch phase.
Beyond those two things, I would say, really that we will be investing in the range of growth opportunities we have
across the company. We try to do a pretty thorough overview of those at investor day and they really span the
company. So you'll see us continue to invest in some of the international markets where we've seen particularly high
rates of growth. Lately, you'll see us continue to invest around our small business and middle-market efforts. You'll see
us continue to invest in some of the areas where we believe expanding the breadth of the demographic that our brand
reaches out to is producing new opportunities, and you'll see us continue to do some things that we think will drive this
steady growth in lending that you've seen above industry averages. So that's probably how we think about the spending
overall.

your different businesses, including, for example, co-brand, particularly since it seems like, you know, your GNS and
charge card businesses generate structurally higher returns and are a big driver of that 25%-plus return target that you
have? I don't think you guys have discussed that in the past. But I do think it could be helpful, you know, to the extent
if you give some kind of indication, be helpful for investors to assess the risk that people have been worried about that
you could continue to lose future partnerships to competitors who are willing to accept lower returns.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Bill, that's a good and actually very important question. So you know, we have a range of
businesses across American Express, and, of course, we have a fairly unique business model in our core business. That
range of businesses and that business model produce a tremendous return on equity relative to most of our peers in
financial services. And so we are thrilled that we have an ROE which this quarter was 29%, and we have a really strong
track record of meeting our more than 25% target, and I think it's a real commentary on the strength of our business
model.
But we shouldn't confuse that with hurdle rates for incremental investments or for how we think about bidding for
business. Because, of course, if you really look at our cost of capital, you will, of course, get to numbers far, far below
25%. And I could spend the rest of the call getting philosophical about exactly how you might calculate our cost of
capital and we look at it, as you would expect in many ways, but suffice it to say, it is much below 25%, and it is
somewhere around the 10% range, depending on which measure you want to look at. And when we're thinking about
incremental opportunities in a bidding situation, I don't really believe that we would take a different economic choice
based strictly on a hurdle rate.
Now, we do make choices based on the next part of your question, though, which is we do have a range of
opportunities in our business. And we generate a range of returns on equity and a range of returns on an incremental
dollar of expense spending as well. And so, when we think about opportunities, we're always making sure that anything
we do is going to generate incremental value for our shareholders and be above our returns on capital. But we also have
to think about the range of opportunities in the financial and managerial resources that we have to allocate across those
opportunities. And one of the things you heard us talk a fair amount about, going all the way back to the February 12
investor call that Ken and I had on Costco, is that we thought about where we were with Costco, one of the things we
really thought about was the range of other opportunities we have, some of the non-financial constraints that a future
contract might have entailed. And when we baked all of those things together, we came to the conclusion that in the
long run, we would be better off pursuing another path.
But I think it would be a real misnomer for anyone to conclude from that, that, oh, American Express is never going to
pursue a transaction or a piece of business that has a return on equity below 25%, so they're not competitive. Our job is
to create value for our shareholders. And if – of course, I'd like to create it at the highest possible ROE, and I'd like to
create it in the highest possible parts of our business. But if I can create a new chunk of business at something that is
closer to our hurdle rate, we will absolutely, of course, pursue that business, if it's the best alternative in the long run for
the company.

And our next question will come from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Montgomery.
<Q - Sameer Gokhale>: Hi, thank you. My question was about your loss provisions and the reserve release. Jeff, you
provided a bit of an explanation. I think you talked about the provisioning, the reserve release being more related to
charge cards, I think, this quarter, if I heard you correctly. But it just seems like between last quarter and this quarter,
there seem to be a lot more volatility than we've seen, I think, at least in recent quarters – recent years, between Q4 and
Q1. So were there any changes made to any underlying assumptions that would drive this kind of volatility? So if you
could just parse that out a little bit, that'd be helpful.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: It's a very accurate description, Sameer, I think of where we are in the last couple of
quarters. I would have to call this quarter's provision, one that is certainly off the normal trend. I talked in my remarks
about the fact that, of course, you have a normal Q4 to Q1 decline in your loan and receivable balances. And that does

generally drive a seasonal, therefore, decline in your reserves. And that happened this year, as it did last year. However,
you have a combination of the fact that last year's first quarter had a few various more specific items that happened to
drive that number up a little bit. This quarter, we had some of the kind of specific adjustments or items that you have
every quarter in the provision that happened to drive it down a little bit. You put those two together and you suddenly
get a really big year-over-year difference.
I think the more – which is why also in my remarks, I try to point people to I think the more important thing to think
about here is, as we look at the rest of 2015, [indiscernible] (45:05) current economic environment, we'd expect
write-off trends to stay pretty strong. However, we've been steadily growing our loan balances and you'd expect
reserves to build along with those loan balances, and some of the specific items that drove the Q1 result, we wouldn't
necessarily expect to repeat. So you put all of that together and I would expect to see provision going up year-over-year
in 2015. And then I'd also just remind you that in terms of what assumptions we made in the financial outlook we've
given for 2016 and 2017, we did assume in 2016 and 2017 that you do see some modest up-tick in write-off rates,
hence provision and reserves.

Our next question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. Jeff, can you just clarify in terms of the 2016 broad guidance that you
gave back in February and reiterated at the recent investor day, does it contemplate the forgone net interest income
from a sale of the Costco portfolio? That's really it, I suppose.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: A good question, Eric. And what I would say is that because we can't be completely sure
of the timing and outcome of any potential portfolio sale, we built an outlook for 2016, which we think we can achieve
under a range of potential outcomes for the portfolio and we built an outlook that, to be explicit, does not include any
potential gain on a sale.
So we think, no matter what assumption you might want to make about the resolution around the portfolio, we think we
have enough levers in our business to hit the outlook we've given you for 2016. Now, certainly, there is some things
that could drive you above that. If there is a gain on a sale, for example, that is clearly not in our outlook and would be
incremental. But we just don't know enough about the final outcome and the timing of the final outcome to be specific
beyond the comments I just made.

And our next question will come from Cheryl Pate with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Cheryl M. Pate>: Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to touch on billed business a little bit and if we can split it up
into international and U.S. On the international side, I was just wondering if you could maybe spend a minute on how
you think about potential hedging strategies to help offset some of the headwinds. And then on the U.S. side, if could
you provide a bit of color for how you're thinking about trends as we look at the rest of 2015, and, you know, on top of
that potential to maybe take some share with OptBlue, seemingly tracking a bit ahead of expectations. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Let me take those one at a time, Cheryl. On hedging, so we do some foreign exchange
hedging, but it's really about, frankly, helping us have a clear view from a planning perspective within a quarter. It
helps us know what the FX impact is going to be. In essence, if the beginning of a quarter, we do a bunch of hedging,
that unwinds as you get to the end of the quarter. So you're not further impacted by anything that happens in the
quarter. That obviously has zero impact on our longer-term trend or on the year-over-year declines.
And as we think about doing any other kind of strategy longer-term, to hedge, our conclusion at the end of the day is
that we think there's value in the diverse set of global businesses we have. We think in the long run, the currencies go
up and down and [indiscernible] (49:23) over time and that the frictional cost and frankly the volatility that the

accounting drives for any longer-term hedging strategy has caused us to shy away from it. So that's how we think about
hedging.
On the U.S., obviously, we'll have to see where the economy goes as we get into the rest of the year. I think it's fair to
say from our experience in the first quarter, we haven't started to see estimates of GDP growth in the U.S. or elsewhere.
But I think when we look at our own experience and some of the external data around retail sales, when we look at
what's happening to gas prices, when we look at some of the admittedly, some of anecdotal stories we hear in our
corporate card business, it suggests to us that it was certainly not the most robust of quarters for economic growth. So
really, in that environment, for us to, once you adjust for FX in last year's business travel, get to 5% revenue growth,
we actually feel pretty good about it.
When you think about the rest of the year, you are correct. I mean, we're upbeat about OptBlue. It is a multi-year effort.
I want to be clear that when Anre Williams on our team first talked about it at the February Financial Community
Meeting last year, we talked about it in the context of sort of 2015 to 2017. In that vein, we are encouraged that we
actually signed up 400,000 merchants in 2014 and that was sort of before we told you we'd started to ramp the program
much.
So we do think, as we get into the latter part of 2015, that we should begin to see a meaningful benefit from OptBlue
and we remain very encouraged by it. We obviously remain very encouraged by lots of other things in the market. Our
steady growth in the U.S. and growing our lend portfolio, we expect to be able to continue and we think we are doing
that without materially changing the risk profile of the company by really focusing on capturing a fairer share of our
Card Member spend.
We're excited about our continued efforts around broadening the reach of the brand, with things like the EveryDay
Card. And we're excited about things like Plenti. And if you haven't focused on it, I'll point out to you, we're going to
launch a Plenti co-brand, which we think will be a very interesting play as just one more step on our pathway of
broadening the demographic reach of the brand and the franchise.
So we'll have to see where the economy goes and what the environment does. But those are probably some of the
things we're thinking about as we look to the rest of the year.

And our next question will come from Craig Maurer with Autonomous.
<Q - Craig Jared Maurer>: Yeah, good evening. Just a fast question is the sharp decline -or sharp decline but the
slowing in commercial card spend, if you could first tell us where or in what parts of the economy you're seeing that
weakness most clearly? And secondly, historically, talking to Amex, we've discussed our corporate spend trends,
leading consumer spend trends by about six months. Do you still think of that as a good relationship that the slowdown
in commercial could be forecasting a slowdown in consumer towards the back-half of the year? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, so good question, Craig. Let me just remind everyone of the facts. So what I think it
does to us as well, strike us is that in the corporate card segment, you saw a sequential slowing from 8% in Q4 to 4% in
Q1. And that's clearly a much sharper sequential slowing than you've seen elsewhere. As we have dug into that a little
bit, it is primarily driven by the U.S., and seems to be a little bit more striking in our larger accounts in the U.S.
In terms of what this means for the broader economy six months from now, I guess I'd be cautious. One, if you look at
corporate spending, it tends to be a little bit more volatile than some of our other segments, because companies have
gotten pretty good over the years at turning on and off their travel spend and other T&E spend in response to their own
business challenges and own sense of the economic environment. I think in any part of our business, we're always
cautious about saying does one quarter make a trend. So we'll have to see. I guess I'd say it's a note of caution for us,
but I wouldn't want to read too much into it at this point in time.

And our next question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: Hey, guys, thanks. Craig actually just asked my question, but I'd love to get a little bit more
of a specific answer. You defined where the slowdown was in terms of size of the customer. But I think what I'm
interested in, and I suspect Craig was as well is, is there any industry that we can specifically look to? I think
everybody is sort of wondering about oil and gas, and also any category of spend where you saw it particularly?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Yeah. Well, those are good questions, Rick, and ones, believe me, we've been asking
ourselves. So maybe I'll even take this opportunity to step back a little bit. Certainly, we are watching very closely
across our global portfolio for any impact both billings and credit arising from the rather dramatic drop in oil prices.
And, you know, what I would tell you for now is certainly we see the billings impact with the drop in oil prices.
Remember, it's 2% to 3% of our billings, so a 30% drop cost us about one point of billings growth.
You know, we do see some drop in spend from some of the oil services companies in the grand scheme of our overall
billings. However, that does not total up to anything that is significant for us. We have not seen any significant
deterioration in credit yet, either by industry or parts of the U.S. or parts of the globe that are particularly driven by an
oil economy. But believe me, we are watching all of that like a hawk.
It's also difficult for us to say whether, well, are people taking the monies, their savings from – savings from slightly
lower oil prices and using it to spur more spending elsewhere, that's tough for us to see. I'm not saying it's not
happening, but not sure we can really see any of it.
So to come all the way back to the origin of your question, which is what's driving the sharper sequential decline in
corporate card, I think we've done enough work to say, it doesn't appear to be isolated to oil services. It doesn't appear
to be isolated to any particular industry or geography, any – with any finer point than it is primarily U.S., not in other
parts of the world.

And our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Good afternoon, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Hi, Ryan.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: So I just wanted to ask you one quick question regarding loan growth. You know, you made the
comment that, you know, you could have some slower growth related to Costco. You know, your growth has been
running in the 4% to 5% range. Just wanted to get a sense, given the efforts that you're putting into this from a growth
perspective, we've seen some across the industry have accelerating growth rates. And I was just wondering, given the
focus here, should we expect that we could actually start to see growth rates across the lending area accelerating or do
you think the offsets from a run-off from Costco are going to overtake the incremental growth that you're seeing in the
rest of the portfolio?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, I think I might break the answer, Ryan, into three components, so we think about
this; talk a little bit about U.S.; talk a little bit about international; and then separately talk about Costco. Because in the
U.S., in fact, our loan growth this quarter was 7%, and has been running up at the 6% to 7% rate for the last couple of
quarters. And I would say that if you look at the kinds of things that Ed in particular talked about at investor day, this is
an area where we think we could run that number up a little higher than that in the current industry environment,
without any material change in our risk profile, by continuing to build from a marketing perspective, new customers as
well as with existing customers, both bring in our borrowing-focused customers as well as capture more of our fair
share of the borrowing behavior of our existing customers. We're pretty upbeat about that and think it's a real
opportunity for the company.

Internationally, we have a much, much smaller loan portfolio. We do think we can achieve steady growth. That's
masked right now by the very significant foreign exchange impacts you see, and the fact that – and this goes now to our
third point, there was a loan portfolio associated with Costco Canada. While we didn't sell the portfolio, as you would
expect, because the – as I said earlier in response to a question, because 60% of the spend on the Canadian Costco
co-brand was in-store. As that spend went away January 1, you see a more rapid decline in some of the loan balances as
well. And so that will drag on the international piece a little bit.
The third component to think about is Costco in the U.S. So we can't be sure of the outcome of any potential sale of the
portfolio. But that portfolio, if it were to be sold, represents 20% of our loans. So you could accelerate your growth
excluding that by a significant amount from 7%, it's still going to take you a long time, frankly, to get back to even
where we are today, in terms of the overall loan portfolio and what that means for the spend-centricity, if you will, of
our overall income statement.
So long-winded answer to your question, but I think you do have to think about loan growth in the context of those
three categories. So I think we've time for one last question, operator.
Operator
Thank you. And that will come from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: Thank you. I just wanted to focus a little more on small business, and maybe how the lending
growth in small business and OptBlue, how that's tying together. I mean, every merchant acquirer talks positively about
OptBlue and one of them talked about moving it into Canada. You said, Jeff, earlier that you're moving in something
similar in related markets. At the investor meeting you had, you showed the merchant loan portfolio growing from
almost nothing to $500 million over the last couple of years. So how is that tying together? Do you expect to grow the
loan portfolio along with OptBlue? Is that part of the strategy? And will that be not only in the U.S., but in other
markets? And is this any way to quantify in some way the incremental effect you think that will have on spend growth
or loan growth?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, that's a good series of questions, Bob. And in some ways, I think the way I would
tie it together, my answer is to say, remember, one of the aspects of our unique closed loop model is we work
extremely hard every day, not just to generate value for our Card Members, but we work extremely hard every day to
figure out how we generate more value for our merchants. We're very excited about the OptBlue program and we think
it is making it easier for smaller merchants to work with us. We think it's going to expand their business opportunities
and we're very excited about what it will do for merchant coverage over the next few years. We do lots of things to try
to help small businesses operate better.
When you look at our open business, which, on the issuing side, targets small businesses. It's really all about helping
drive the success of those businesses and giving them access to spend capacity that our business model and our charge
card model really is able to fairly uniquely provide them and we really try to use that and have used it over the years to
drive to a very significant position with small businesses. Things we do like Small Business Saturday are another
example of what we do to help drive value and support for our merchants.
Merchant financing in that context is just another extension of the same drive and we have to constantly work at how
do we find new ways to add value to merchants. Very excited about merchant financing and we think it is not only a
good opportunity for us to, in a very thoughtful, measured, risk profile centered way, grow our financing portfolio. We
think it's a real value-add for our partners, particularly some of our smaller business partners. So hopefully that strategy
all fits together. It's really part of what we have to do every day.

So with that, I would like to thank you all for joining tonight's call and participating in the Q&A session. I would
summarize by coming back to the fact that, that we think our results in the first quarter reflect solid core underlying
performance. When you think about our Q1 performance and what I said today about Q2, and when you think about it
in the context of the multi-year financial outlook that we reviewed at investor day, we think we're on-track and we're
continuing to do the right things to position the company for the long term.
So with that, I wish all of you a good evening and I'm going to turn it back over to Rick who is going to provide a brief
overview of the investor conferences we plan to participate in during the second quarter. Rick?
