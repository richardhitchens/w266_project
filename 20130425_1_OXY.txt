Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Core income for the quarter was $1.4 billion or $1.69 per diluted share
in the fourth quarter of this year – excuse me, the first quarter of this year compared with $1.6 billion or $1.92 per
diluted share in the first quarter of 2012 and $1.5 billion or $1.83 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, the current quarter results reflected higher realized oil prices, reduced
operating expenses in the oil and gas business and higher earnings in the midstream segment. These were offset by
lower volumes in the Middle East and North Africa region due to planned maintenance turnaround and higher DD&A
rates.
I'll now discuss the segment breakdown. Oil and gas core earnings for the first quarter of 2013 were $1.9 billion
compared to $2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2012 and $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012. On a sequential
quarter-over-quarter basis, higher realized oil prices and lower operating expenses were offset by lower Middle
East/North Africa volumes and higher DD&A rates. Our sales volumes in the Middle East, North Africa were lower
compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 due mostly to the timing of liftings as well as the effect of the maintenance
turnaround in Qatar and full cost recovery under our contract in Oman. This reduced our 2013 first quarter earnings by
about $200 million after-tax compared with the fourth quarter of 2012.
Costs associated with the turnarounds, pipeline disruptions in Colombia and other factors further reduced our earnings
by about $30 million after-tax. Combined, these factors reduced oil and gas segment earnings by approximately $450
million on a pre-tax basis. Oil and gas production costs were $13.93 per barrel for the first three months of 2013
compared to $14.99 per barrel for the full year of 2012. Production cost at this level already beats our previous full year
2013 guidance. The lower costs were attributable to our domestic operations where production costs were $3.37 per
barrel lower in the first quarter of 2013 from the full year of 2012. In our Middle East/North Africa operations,
operating costs increased by about $2.50 per barrel on a sequential quarterly basis. This increase was due to the planned
maintenance turnaround in our Qatar North Dome and South Dome fields and to a lesser extent the planned turnaround
in Dolphin.
First quarter 2013 total daily production on a BOE basis was 763,000 barrels, which was 16,000 barrels per day lower
than the fourth quarter of 2012 and 8,000 barrels per day higher than the first quarter of 2012. Approximately 13,000
barrels of the total sequential decrease in the quarterly production came from Qatar and Dolphin where the planned
maintenance impacted production. I'm pleased to say the turnarounds were executed successfully and production has
returned to normal levels.
Our domestic production was 478,000 barrels per day, an increase of 3,000 barrels per day from the fourth quarter of
2012 and this now marks the 10th consecutive quarterly domestic volume record for the company. Production was 5%
higher than the first quarter of 2012. Almost all of the net sequential quarterly increase came from production in the
Permian. Focusing on liquids production, it was flat with the fourth quarter, reflecting a drop in production in our Long
Beach operations resulting from the effect of lower spending under our production sharing contract there and slightly
lower production elsewhere in California in the steam flood operations. This was offset by higher production in other
areas, mainly in the Permian and Williston.

Latin America volumes were 31,000 barrels per day, which was 1,000 barrels lower compared to the fourth quarter and
5,000 barrels higher than the same period in 2012. The reduction from last quarter was due to heightened level of
insurgent activity in the region. In the Middle East/North Africa, production was 254,000 barrels per day, a decrease of
18,000 barrels from the fourth quarter of 2012 and 20,000 barrels from the first quarter of 2012. The planned
maintenance turnarounds in Qatar reduced our production 13,000 barrels per day. The impact of full cost recovery and
other factors affecting production sharing and similar contracts reduced first quarter production volumes by an
additional 5,000 barrels per day compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Details regarding other country-specific
production levels are available in our Investor Relations supplemental schedules.
Middle East/North Africa volumes were further lower than production volumes in the first quarter due to the timing of
liftings. First quarter realized prices were mixed for our products compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Our
worldwide crude oil realized price was $98.07 per barrel, a 2% increase from the fourth quarter, while worldwide
NGLs were $40.27 per barrel, a decrease of about 11%, and domestic natural gas prices were about flat at $3.08 per
million cubic feet.
First quarter 2013 realized prices were lower than the prior year first quarter prices for crude oil and NGLs. On a
year-over-year basis, price decreases were 9% for worldwide crude oil and 23% for worldwide NGLs. Domestic natural
gas prices were higher by about 8%. Realized oil prices for the quarter represented 104% of the average WTI price and
87% of the average Brent price. Realized NGL prices were 43% of the average WTI price and realized domestic gas
prices were 91% of the average NYMEX price. For the first quarter of 2012, the comparable percentages were 105% of
WTI, 91% of Brent for oil, and 51% of WTI for NGLs and 100% of NYMEX for gas.
At current global prices, $1 per barrel change in oil prices affects our quarterly earnings before income taxes by $37
million and $7 million for a $1 per barrel change in NGL prices. A change in domestic gas prices of $0.50 per million
BTU affects quarterly pre-tax earnings by about $30 million. These price change sensitivities include the impact of
production-sharing and similar contract volume changes.
Taxes other than on income, which are generally related to product prices, were $2.63 per barrel for the first quarter of
2013, compared to $2.39 per barrel for the full year of 2012. The 2013 amount includes California greenhouse gas
expense of $0.05 per barrel. First quarter exploration expense was $50 million. We expect second quarter 2013
exploration expense to be about $100 million for seismic and drilling in our exploration programs.
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2013 were $159 million, compared to $180 million in the fourth
quarter of 2012 and $184 million in the first quarter of 2012. The sequential quarterly decrease was due to higher
ethylene costs and increased competitive activity, particularly in the domestic caustic soda markets. This was partially
offset by higher VCM and PVC prices.
The Chemical segment second quarter 2013 earnings are expected to improve to about $170 million, benefiting from
higher seasonal demand in the construction and agricultural markets.
Midstream segment earnings were $215 million for the quarter compared to 2013 – excuse me, for the first quarter of
2013 compared to $75 million in the first (sic) [fourth] (10:08) quarter of 2012 and $131 million in the first quarter of
2012. Over 70% of the 2013 sequential quarterly increase in earnings resulted from improved marketing and trading
performance. The remainder of the increase came from improved margins in the gas processing and power generation
businesses and higher earnings from foreign pipelines.
The worldwide effective tax rate on our core income was 38% for the quarter. This included a benefit resulting from
the relinquishment of an international exploration block. Our first quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the
Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the second quarter to be
approximately 41%.
In the first three months of 2012, we generated $2.9 billion of cash flow from operations before changes in working
capital. Working capital changes reduced our cash flow from operations by about $200 million to $2.7 billion.

Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2013 were $2.1 billion. This capital spend was $440 million lower than the
fourth quarter of 2012, with about half of the decrease in the oil and gas business. First quarter capital expenditures by
segment were 80% in the oil and gas business, 15% in midstream and the remainder in chemicals. These and other net
cash flows resulted in a $2.1 billion cash balance at the end of March.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the three months of 2013 were 804.7 million and the weighted
average diluted shares outstanding were 805.2 million. We had approximately 805.6 million shares outstanding at the
end of the quarter. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 16% at the end of the quarter. Our annualized return on equity
for the first three months of 2013 was 13.4% and return on capital employed was 11.4%.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen to discuss other aspects of our operations and provide guidance for the
second quarter of the year.
Stephen I. Chazen
Thank you, Cynthia. Occidental's domestic oil and gas segment produced record volumes for the 10th consecutive
quarter and continue to execute on our liquids production growth strategy. First quarter domestic production of 478,000
barrel equivalents per day consisting of 342,000 barrels of liquids, 817 million cubic feet of gas of – per day was an
increase of 3,000 barrel equivalents per day compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.
We are executing a focused drilling program in our core areas, and to date, we are running ahead of our full year
objectives in our program to improve domestic operational capital efficiencies. For example, we have reduced both our
domestic well and operating costs by about 19% relative to 2012. This is ahead of our previously stated targets of 15%
well cost improvement and a total oil and gas operating cost below $14 a barrel for 2013. While we are still in the early
stages of this process and making a longer-term projection is difficult, our goal is to sustain the benefits realized to
date, achieve additional savings in our drilling costs and reach our 2011 operating cost level over time without a loss in
production or sacrificing safety. Purpose of these initiatives is to improve our return on capital.
I will now turn the discussion over to Bill Albrecht, who will provide details of our domestic drilling programs and of
the capital and operational efficiencies initiatives that we have implemented.
William E. Albrecht
Thank you, Steve. This morning I'd like to share with you the three main objectives of our 2013 domestic program.
First, delineate our core or anchor drilling areas in the Permian Basin. We've accumulated more than 1.7 million net
acres covering both relatively established and emerging plays in the Permian. This year, we're focused on delineating
incremental opportunities in established plays, as well as testing the potential of many emerging plays. Second, drive
capital efficiency, particularly in our core drilling programs. We believe that the results of our capital efficiency
improvement program are not only scalable across our core programs, but that these results are also sustainable. And
third, enhance our cash margins through operating expense reductions.
Turning now to our first objective, our Permian Basin activity. As we've said in the past, under current market
conditions, our growth will come largely from oil. The Permian will play a key role in that growth. In 2013, we expect
to spend $1.9 billion in the Permian. Approximately, two-thirds of this capital will be spent in our non-CO2 business.
In this business, we'll drill approximately 300 wells, 90% of which will be focused in four plays, the Wolfberry, Yeso,
Delaware Sands, and Wolfbone.
The Wolfberry has been a solid core play for many years at Oxy and represents the largest proportion of our activity. In
2013, we'll drill a mix of infill wells and already established core areas and step-out wells in emerging areas of the play.
We expect step-out wells to pretty much mirror the solid results we've seen in drilling hundreds of Wolfberry wells in
the last several years.

The Delaware will be about a quarter of our activity in 2013. We're seeing increased opportunity to enhance economics
utilizing horizontal drilling and completions to develop established tight-sand reservoirs. We expect to drill 12
horizontal wells targeting the Delaware sands this year. Our emerging Yeso play in New Mexico has demonstrated
encouraging results. As a result in 2013, we expect to increase drilling activity by 30% from 2012 levels.
The Wolfbone play in Reeves County, Texas is the newest of the plays. Throughout 2012, we were able to acquire a
meaningful mostly contiguous acreage position. We drilled a handful of wells in 2012 and we'll increase our activity
this year as we further delineate our acreage position. Because of the multi-pay nature of the play, wells will be mostly
vertical at this stage, although we'll drill a number of horizontal wells in sweet spots of this multi-pay interval. Early
results are encouraging. 30-day IP rates are averaging between 170 and 235 barrels of oil equivalent per day depending
on the area. The key to success is a low cost structure. We've been drilling for less than a year in the Wolfbone and
have already seen substantial improvements in well costs. As we build infrastructure and establish a steady program,
we expect to see further progress in our costs.
In addition to these four core programs, we believe we have opportunities in several of other emerging plays. We plan
to drill 20 to 25 wells testing horizontal potential in the Bone Spring, Wolfcamp and Cline across our acreage position.
I'll now turn to our second objective, driving capital efficiency. There are essentially four elements of our overall
capital efficiency strategy. These are locking in our drilling programs, modifying well objectives and designs,
improving operational execution, and improving our contracting strategies. We are measuring our progress by
comparing our 2013 well costs to 2012 using the 2013 program attributes. In other words, for our benchmark year of
2012, we are using cost that we incurred for the same mix of well locations and types being drilled in 2013. By
implementing all four elements, we've already achieved more than a 19% reduction in our well costs relative to the
2012 benchmark across our domestic assets.
The most important improvements were achieved in the Williston, the Wolfberry, and shale drilling at Elk Hills where
costs have dropped by 32%, 20% and 22% respectively.
Let me describe each of the four elements in more detail. First, we found that locking in our drilling programs for
appropriate lead-times results in significant efficiencies. This has allowed us to have fit-for-purpose drilling rigs in each
core area, minimize the number of drill site contractors and minimize drilling and mobilization times as well as rig
move distances. To this end, as we developed our drilling programs for the year, we locked in our drilling plans for two
to three months in advance, depending on location across all of our assets. Consequently, we reduced our rig down
times by 20%. For example, in the Williston, our optimized drilling schedule designed to minimize rig mobilizations
has reduced move costs by 33%.
The second element is modification of well objectives and design. For example, in our Wolfberry program, we now run
only two strings of casing instead of three, which has saved approximately $250,000 per well. We've also reduced costs
by 47% per frac stage per Wolfberry well without any degradation in production. At Elk Hills in our anchor shale
program, we're running mostly slotted liners instead of cemented liners, saving $1.5 million per well, again, with no
degradation in production. In a number of our programs, we've reduced the amount of gel loading and resin coated
sand, thus reducing completion costs. In short, we're seeing the benefits in the form of reduced drilling and completion
times, and reduced and more efficient use of materials and supplies.
Let me now turn to the third element, improving operational execution. While we're making numerous incremental
changes in our day-to-day activities everywhere, we've made significant improvements, specifically in the Permian and
Williston business units. In both areas, we're optimizing our use of water and completion operations by using flow-back
and/or produced water in stimulations, which is generating substantial savings this year. In the Williston, more of the
wells we're drilling have been trouble free, particularly due to improved directional tool reliability. And finally, we've
made a fundamental change in the way and the extent to which we use contractors and outside consultants to manage
and supervise our drilling programs. A heavier reliance on our own personnel for these tasks has already resulted in
efficiencies, while providing more growth opportunities for our people.

The last element of our capital efficiency effort is contracting strategies. In this regard, principally in the Permian,
Williston and at Elk Hills, we've reduced our stimulation contract pricing. We've also reduced our fluid hauling costs
by implementing a trucking cluster concept whereby certain trucking fleets are dedicated to specific core areas. Overall,
we've improved our completed well costs in the Williston from an average $10 million per well as recently as just four
months ago to $8.2 million currently. We believe that we're now top quartile in well costs in the play, and our current
goal is to bring average Williston well costs down to $7.5 million. We believe at this level, we'll have the flexibility to
focus on continuing development of our Russian Creek acreage where we plan to drill 46 wells in 2013, concentrating
on the sweet spot of our acreage there.
Our development will be mainly in the Middle Bakken, with other wells testing both the Pronghorn and Three Forks
formations. In another one of our anchor programs, the Wolfberry, we've seen sustained reductions in completed well
costs where costs are down from $3.5 million to $2.6 million.
Lastly, I'd like to discuss the third objective of our overall domestic strategy. And that is enhancing our cash margins
through reductions in operating costs. While our operating costs have also benefited from some of the actions taken for
capital efficiencies that I just described, we've taken additional steps specific to reducing our operating costs, especially
in the areas of downhole maintenance and workovers which, together, make up the bulk of our costs.
I'd like to share a few examples with you of the actions we've taken toward achieving our goal. First, in order to
optimize our well servicing rig cost, we're eliminating inefficient workover rigs. While this has caused an overall
decline in our workover rig count, we're finding that through better planning and scheduling, we're able to perform a
similar number of well servicing jobs as we did with a larger fleet. As a result, we've not seen any production fall off
from these reductions.
Second, through a more rigorous review of wells that are repair and maintenance candidates, we've been able to reduce
our workover needs by dropping uneconomical wells from our list. These wells will be subject to ongoing evaluations
based on market conditions.
Third, we're evaluating the efficiency of our maintenance crews and prioritizing the most efficient ones. Through more
direct on-location supervision, more efficient crews, optimized maintenance scheduling to allow better planning and
tighter controls over spending limits and job approvals, we've already been able to reduce our well intervention times
and maintenance and workover costs.
Fourth, we're also focusing on our surface operations, which constitute another large cost driver and we've been able to
achieve efficiencies in our use of chemicals, water handling and disposal activities. Water handling and disposal is a
major cost for the company. Therefore, it's a key area of focus for us. In some locations, we've been able to find ways
to recycle more of our produced water, reducing our sourcing as well as disposal costs and as a result, handling water in
a more environmentally conscious manner.
We're also working with our suppliers to address the costs of these supplies and services. In addition, we're working on
optimizing our use of injectants and energy. For example, we're improving our C02 in steam utilization through
ongoing pattern surveillance and evaluation of injectant to oil recovery ratios. And we're reducing our energy costs
through maximizing the use of self-generated energy and rate re-negotiations.
As a result of our efforts, compared to the 2012 levels, our downhole maintenance and workover costs have dropped
36% and our overall surface operations costs by 16%, contributing to a 19% reduction in our operating costs on a BOE
basis across all of our domestic assets.
Our total domestic operating costs per barrel dropped from $17.43 per barrel in 2012 to $14.06 per barrel in the first
quarter of 2013. We believe our ongoing efforts will yield additional improvements going forward.
I'd like to add that the great success we've had to date in achieving our capital efficiency and operating expense
reduction goals is the result of implementing literally thousands of small ideas, suggestions and decisions being made
every day, mainly at the field level. I'm extremely pleased that our personnel at every level have stepped up in a big
way to achieve our stated goals of achieving 15% capital efficiency gains and so far exceeding this goal and reducing

our annualized operating expenses by a minimum of $450 million.
While we've made progress in both our capital efficiency and operating cost reduction efforts, we're still in the early
stages of this process, and therefore, our data is based on a relatively small portion of our overall program. In addition,
we executed a relatively trouble free drilling program in the first quarter. Nonetheless, given our results to date and our
people's effort in this endeavor, we're optimistic we can sustain and further improve upon the results achieved to date.
I'd like to emphasize that our overarching goal is to make sure we achieve these improvements without, in any way,
compromising the safety of our operations and of our people and without impacting our growth plans.
I'll now turn the call back to Steve Chazen.
Stephen I. Chazen
Thank you, Bill. With regard to the total return to shareholders in February, we increased our dividend by 18.5% to an
annual rate of $2.56 per share from the previous annual rate of $2.16. We have now increased our dividend every year
for 11 years, and a total of 12 times during that period. This 18.5% increase brings 11-year compounded dividend
growth rate to 16% per year.
I will now turn to the second quarter outlook. Production, domestically, we continue to expect solid growth in our oil
production for the year as a result of the nature and timing of our drilling such as steam flood drilling in California. We
expect second quarter liquids growth to be modest, with higher growth coming in the second half of the year. We just
received word today that we've got permits for three new steams – three new compressors for our steam flood program.
One is already on. So I think we're going – doing well in California on this, just a slow start this year.
In the first quarter of 2013, our base gas production did not decline as much as we had initially expected. Estimating
the production for the rest of the year still remains challenging. We expect to see modest declines in our gas production,
a result of our reduced drilling on gas properties and natural decline, as well as a number of gas plants turnarounds
scheduled in our Permian business for the rest of the year. Internationally, excluding Iraq, at current prices, we expect
production to be higher in the second quarter, back to around the fourth quarter 2012 levels, with the increase coming
mainly from resumption of production in Qatar. Iraq's production is directly correlated to quarterly spending levels
which continue to be volatile.
We expect international sales volumes also to get back to about fourth quarter levels based on our current lifting
schedule. Our first quarter capital spend was $2.1 billion. We expect the second quarter rate to be higher. Our annual
spending level is unchanged and expected to be in line with the $9.6 billion program I discussed on the last call.
As you can see, the business is doing well and we are continuing to make progress in our operational and financial
goals. I'm very pleased that employees at all levels have stepped up to the challenges we've presented to them, and are
focused on their jobs. We've not seen any significant negative turnover trends in our workforce.
As I've stated before, I remain committed to staying through the succession process. We're now ready to take your
questions about the performance of the business. However, we do not have anything to add beyond our public
announcements about the ongoing board activities and succession process.

<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: They sure did. So my question regards the sequential decline in earnings of $450 million
dollars which was highlighted, I think, on slide 3 and specifically whether you can provide any additional insight into
the component, which is likely to be transitory, meaning some of the elements were identified but how much of the
sequential decline relates to factors that are not normally recurring like maintenance and pipeline disruptions and lifting
variances, et cetera?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think Cynthia has that variance so let her answer it.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - Cynthia L. Walker>: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Doug. Really the only component of the quarter-over-quarter decline
that we expect to be recurring is the Oman contract impact which is about $50 million of the $450 million. The rest of it
all relates to timing of liftings as well as the Qatar turnaround which you mentioned – Qatar's turnarounds and the
pipeline disruptions in Colombia.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thank you, Doug.

Your next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I've got a...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: ... couple, if I may, Steve. On the cost, Steve, if I look at the costs on the U.S., you obviously
broke that out for us and I take your commentary about the total company. It looks to me at least that the international
costs were up a couple of – maybe $2 to $3 a barrel.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: That's right.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: And I'm wondering – so that sounds about right? So basically, when the production comes back
on in the second quarter, does that mean your run rate is now below $13, and if you could help us with where you think
the stretch goal gets to on your operating costs? And I've got a follow-up, please.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah. We'll let Cynthia give you the first part and I'll answer the second part. So where
does that put our run rate?
<A - Cynthia L. Walker>: Yeah, in the second quarter, there will be some other factors likely offsetting things, but we
wouldn't expect to get substantially below the levels that we are currently. We won't be below $13 a barrel in the
second quarter. Some of the activity that we didn't do in the first quarter will come into the second quarter.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think that...
<Q - Doug Leggate>: And in terms of stretch goals?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Pardon me?
<A - Cynthia L. Walker>: Sorry?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: And sorry...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We expect that the U.S. business – maybe simplify it a little bit for you – we expect the U.S.
business to – we're going to be cautious on the operating costs here to make sure we're not affecting safety and
production. So we expect those costs to continue to go down, but obviously not as quickly as it did in this quarter. The
international costs will come back into line. They were up this past quarter, but we think they'll be down next quarter.

Yeah, and by putting money into the – what we've done, turnarounds will increase the reliability and we should actually
do better on a gross basis. There may be some turnaround costs and stuff that'll roll through, I think, was what Cynthia
was referring to. But the fundamental numbers will be lower. There might – again, there might be some additional
turnarounds, not in the Middle East, but in the U.S. Sandy, you want to comment on the Middle East?
<A - Edward A. Lowe>: Yeah, Doug. The – in Qatar we are actually producing at record levels over the past, since the
past few years of 118,000, 119,000 gross and the actual extra money we've spent on the turnaround, we got much
higher reliability. We have records in Oman right now of 335 – 235,000 barrels a day gross. And we actually are
reducing OpEx per barrel there, but still paying attention to production reliability and safety issues.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We give you more answer than you thought, I guess, hun?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: No, that's very helpful. Steve, my follow-up, and I hope you're going to forgive me for this one
ahead of time. I realize you don't ...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I'm very – I've become more and more forgiving in my old age.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. I realize you don't want to talk about the board situation, however, my question relates to
you in terms of your intentions. But when we followed in the past, you've always stated that you saw yourself being in
position for quite a while in executing a strategy that ultimately took you towards a million barrels a day. Should we
rule out the possibility of you staying around a bit longer if the board, for example, had a change of heart? And what is
your strategic vision for the company longer term?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I'm not going to answer the first question. I – that's really outside the purview of what we
want to talk about. On the strategy issue, the company, as we get – the company is really executing well. I mean every
day I'm sort of happy to talk about the operations. And I think the company is doing real well. I think we'll continue to
grow nicely. You have little bumps in the road in the quarter but fundamentally, I really couldn't be happier about the
progress we're making as a company. The million barrels a day, I think, is a reasonable objective. What we're going to
do from call to call is while Bill got to talk this time, we'll let somebody else talk next quarter, and maybe we'll talk
about California next quarter and have Vicky come and talk. So we'll try to give you more detail, but one call at a time
rather than try to flood you with it. So I think you'll see that the strategy of building a large domestic business, together
with a highly profitable international business will work for us. So I think the vision right now is sort of that one. So I –
unless you want to ask the same question in other way.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Well, I'm just saying, would you ever see that there's been a lot of speculation about structural
changes whether it was separating one part or another whether it'd be the MLPs or whether it'd be California getting
split off. Is that something that even enters into the discussion right now, or is it just not on the table?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think we always are looking for ways to improve the return to the shareholders, and I think
we, and I mean everybody in the company, is committed to that. And whatever actions would – if we can find actions
that are meaningful and are accretive to value, we'll do those things.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: All right. I'll leave it at that. Thanks, Steve.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thank you.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Leo Mariani of RBC.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Hey, guys. I mean it looks like you've certainly kind of gotten more optimistic on some of these
new plays here in the Permian. I want to get a sense of how much of that is attributable to your recent cost reductions
and how much may be attributable just to better well performance?

<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think probably – the key to Permian, in my view, is cost, repeatable low drilling costs.
And the change in the returns by these reductions is market. Bill, you want to comment on returns?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Yeah, Leo, across the plays that I've mentioned, we're seeing solid 15%, 20% plus
returns. And as Steve said, what's really been a big enhancing factor is what we've done to take dollars out of our cost
structure there.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: And so the...
<Q - Leo Mariani>: All right.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: ...the barrel, the IPs, the ultimate recoveries are the same as our experience. But I think that
by driving the cost down, by returns, we're not doing the IRR sort of returns, this is sort of a more sustainable kind of
returns. IRRs have to do with how fast you get your money back. So I think we're doing real well. We're very pleased
with the progress in the Permian at this point.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Okay. So just to clarify on the return, that's more of an after-tax corporate return?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Absolutely. Oh, yeah.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We – unfortunately, when you make a lot of money, you pay a lot of taxes.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Okay. And I guess just a question on California. You mentioned being able to reduce some of the
costs by about $1.5 million per well, I think you said, in Elk Hills in the shale program. It sounds very substantial. Just
trying to get of a sense of how much that can improve your economics there.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: California, we're doing well. We continue – we've got more to go here in California. I think
we're in the early phases of cost reduction in California. Again, the people that work there are doing a fabulous job.
And so I think we're trying to get the costs down to even lower sustainable levels before we boost the number of rigs at
work. So we need to get our costs down to what we think is sustainable levels, which will be lower than we're showing
here. And then we'll build the program up from there.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: But I think there's more room here. I'm very optimistic about the capital, the well cost
program, the 19%; it would be disappointing if that's all that turned out of this.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Okay. That's really helpful. And I guess in terms of your first quarter, you guys talked about
5,000 barrels a day internationally that you lost due to, I guess, production sharing contract payout. I'm just curious to
whether or not there's going to be any further impact during 2013 from PSCs and projects [ph] that didn't pay out
(40:50)?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I don't think much. I think we're probably at – for this year where we need to be – where
we'll be. Because you know you got to go to another level of payouts. Pretty much the programs are – the big programs
are pretty stable. Yeah
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Thanks. Steve, just a follow-up on some of the California unconventional comments, I
know the plan is to get some of the well costs down. I guess if we look back a few years ago on some of the early
results, that relationship between costs and what look like could be the EURs and production for well was very, very

favorable. Maybe the costs got a little bit higher and now you're trying to bring them back down. Can you comment on
what the well results look like? And whether part of the issue here is just maybe the geology is obviously different or
not as robust as before or – really any color, and again, I'm talking about the unconventional in California?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah, I think it's – we haven't been able to drill where we wanted to drill all the time and so
some of it's related to that. And that's created some inefficiencies. And the well costs got markedly higher than we
would like and while it didn't make them terrible, certainly, it was sort of wasteful. So I think as far as the results are
concerned, I think they're in line with what we said before, the IPs, those sorts of things. But we have shifted the focus
to more conventional drilling to get more – less decline in the program, was underlying decline because I think the
decline is what's – what we're trying to fight against.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Were the declines unexpected? I mean usually unconventional does come with quick
declines or is it just...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's been, I think, more than we originally thought.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Yeah. Got it, got it. And any update on the permitting process in California? I know
it's always a challenge, but any improvement there at all?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: You know, the permitting – I don't think this is North Dakota. So I think the permitting
process here continues to be – we've made a lot of progress in the last year or so. And but also continues to be hard to
predict from a quarter-to-quarter basis. So you get some good news, you get some not so good news. I think that we've
built a program this year that doesn't rely on the permitting process to deliver the results.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Yeah.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: And so we'll be able to deliver a good set of results this year. Low finding costs and
reasonable growth. Hopefully, we'll build a backlog of permits so we can do the same thing next year but at a higher
level of spending.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Yeah. And then just finally, thank you, on the Bakken. It looks like the well costs have
come down quite a bit. This has always been an area for you guys where you've kind of been on the bubble of whether
you were kind of in or out. Sounds like you're a little more optimistic on the Bakken. Is this now on kind of the right
side of the return threshold? Or still more work to do in the Bakken?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: More work to be done.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Yeah. What kind of rig count are you looking at there this year, Steve?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Yeah, Arjun, this is Bill. It's six. It should be between six and seven.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Got it. And then...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We're going to be able to, obviously, do more work with six or seven rigs than we might
have done last year with nine or 10.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Yeah.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: So the goal is to get the organization and the people to get more efficient with the rigs
before you add more rigs, because part of this gain or a lot of this gain is having the best crews on the rigs. So as you
add the new – another rig, it may diminish the quality of the crew. So the goal here is, we're trying to make the
company as efficient as possible before we do any major increase in spending.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Yeah. And then just lastly and I apologize for all the questions, given...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: That's okay.

or your CFO's thought on stock buybacks and how excited or unexcited you are to do those at this point?

Thank you. Your next question comes from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Hi. Good morning everybody.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Morning.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Steve. Steve, in the past, you've spoken about the difficulty in finding value from, for example,
splitting the company. Is that still the way you view things, that essentially with the stock having traded off and
relatively cheaper, could you now see the benefit of a Middle East, North America split? Thanks.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think that's something that we consider all the time. Obviously, the cheaper the stock, the
more you have to look at other alternatives. And so valuing each piece is, it's maybe fairly straightforward to do the
U.S., valuing the international standalone is really more complicated, because there's not a lot of good comps. So I
think that we'll look at everything but obviously, with a lower stock price, things that might not have worked before
might work now. That isn't any kind of forecast or anything. It's just sort of a tautology.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yeah, I've got you. The – I guess the other issue with the Middle East is it would be politically
somewhat difficult, I imagine, to, for example, sell the whole business?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think that generally if you went and sold individual countries, you'd have to gain the
consent of the individual country. So if you wanted to sell, I don't know, some country, generally the contract requires
somebody else to – the country to approve the sale. However, if the business were split off or something, it may not
take so much effort.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yeah, that makes sense. There's a lot of speculation around the potential for an MLP of the
midstream. Can you just talk a little bit about how you see that? Thanks.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah, I think we look at virtually everything and we no shortage of suggestions. I think you
start looking for things that move the needle a lot rather than things to fine-tune.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Well, you mean, the – an MLP would be a fine-tuning or would be ...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah, I think an MLP would be a fine-tuning rather than a major mover. That's something
one can think about over time. But an MLP is a, hopefully, low cost capital. So I mean presumably, the play would be
you sell the MLP, take the proceeds and buy the shares and so I – but we also can borrow at 2.5%. So I – you just –
you're looking for things that, at least initially are things that move the needle a lot rather than tweaking, re-tweaking
things. A tweak, for example, we're selling our joint venture in Brazil and we'll get like $250 million or something like
that for it and that – and so that'll close here in a few weeks and we can use some of that money to reduce the share
count. But there's lots of tweaky things that one can talk about. But...
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yeah, I guess the needle...

<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: But the first of our focus is on things that really change value.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yeah, I guess that would be selling the whole of Oxy or splitting it, right?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, selling the whole of Oxy, that's – that won't take many phone calls to line up – to find
out if there are buyers.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yeah, right. One – I think it's probably one call, isn't it?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah, one call. He probably – who knows. But that's – so we don't want you to hire a lot of
investment bankers to study the call. So I think that's an improbable outcome.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Okay. So, yeah, so it's basically – I mean, what else is there, needle moving, other than
splitting?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, I don't know, but there may be other things, there may be assets we can sell that aren't
contributing to – much to the business. I mean there's lots of things we could do that are different than just splitting.
But I mean – and maybe even splitting doesn't move the needle, but we – the first thing you need to focus on is what
really matters, and then you can focus on things to improve it slightly. But I think you don't want to go down a path of
sort of a delicatessen approach to this where you slice a piece of bologna off and you throw it to the wolves.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Let me – the biggest risk on the stock no question is your future. You really have to address
this question of how long do you think it's going to take to find a CEO and how much longer are you going to be doing
this job?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I know. We're not just going to answer that. I think we've – the press releases and the board
and our statements speak for themselves.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Okay. A technical question. If the Chairman and certain board members are not re-elected, how
long is it before they are replaced and how does that process work, technically speaking?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's really a decision for the board to make; it isn't something that you can read the proxy
[ph] and it tells (52:11). But it's really a board decision.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Okay. Steve, I'll leave it there. Thanks for your comments.

<Q - Matthew Portillo>: Just a few questions.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's always morning in California.
<Q - Matthew Portillo>: Just one additional question in terms of the potential for share repurchase. Can you talk a
little bit about your capital structure and how you think about kind of the appropriate leverage for your balance sheet
today? Just trying to get a better sense of how much capital you have to access on a potential share repurchase or other
opportunities you're looking at to enhance shareholder value?

<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I don't think we probably won't want to wander into the exact capital structure. For a
commodity-based company, you need a strong balance sheet to withstand the ups and downs so that you can react to
opportunities that occur in an ugly market. And then there are operations in the Middle East. It's very important if
you're going to sign for a long-term project, 30 years or something like that, you that have a solid balance sheet so that
they believe that you're going to be around. I don't – that's sort of a qualitative view. What the exact number is, I just
don't know. But we have a lot of financial flexibility.
<Q - Matthew Portillo>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We've kept a very strong balance sheet for that.
<Q - Matthew Portillo>: Perfect. And then just two quick asset-level questions. I was wondering if you can give us
some color. The Wolf Bone sounds like a new play you're focusing on. If you can give us a little bit of color on how
you're seeing well costs and potentially returns or EURs there. And then I have one quick follow-up on the midstream
side.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Bill?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Yeah. Matt, on the Wolf Bone, what we're seeing for – these are completed well costs
including hookup. We're in the $3 million to $3.5 million range, completed well costs.
<Q - Matthew Portillo>: Thank you. And then just the last question on the midstream side of the business, you
obviously saw a pretty significant uptick in operating profit for the quarter. Just trying to get a little bit better sense of
how we should think about that midstream in marketing and trading part of that business. The $100 million you guys
generated there and how that should trend over the rest of the year or how volatile that may be as we move into the
second and third quarter. Thank you.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We'll start with what we're saying. Willie will answer the question but you should view it as
volatile. Go ahead, Willie.
<A - Willie C. W. Chiang>: Thank you, Matt. I think you saw last year's number we were kind of in the low 400s, and
as Steve said, a lot of wells for the whole year and a lot of what we do rides on arbitrage opportunities and market
prices. We keep reinforcing that one of our key roles is to make sure that everything that we produce gets access to the
highest markets. So we've done things like renegotiate contracts to uncouple them from things like WTI. You'll see us
take a lot more capacity in pipelines to get out of constrained areas particularly the Permian. And if you look at our first
quarter results, a lot of that was due to the arbitrage opportunity between Permian and the Gulf Coast. It's because of
our storage capacity that we had as well as transport capacity allowed us to capture that. So we hope we can maintain
that pace going forward, but again, a lot of it is market based.
<Q - Matthew Portillo>: Thank you very much.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Very little of it was from fiber operation. Most – almost of all of the gain was from gas
plants and arbitrage between – with our capacity to move oil around. So instead of showing up in the oil segment
because it was it wasn't our oil, it will show – shows up in the segment.

<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: I was wondering if you could go back and – to California a little bit and discuss the CapEx
trends there. So I guess in the middle of the year you were trending at about $550 million in CapEx a quarter and now
you're down to – close to $300 million in CapEx. So is this the new trend through the year?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think we're budgeting $1.5 billion in California this year.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. So then we should see that number sort of pick up as we get to the end of the year, is
that...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: That's right. Actually, all of the capital. We had a slow start in spending this year. Not all
bad by the way. So we had a slow start everywhere, the costs are coming down and you'll see the capital spending go to
the $9.6-ish billion level for the year for the whole company. So we'll start to see a pickup of it in the second and third
quarters.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. And then I want to go back to also a comment you made earlier. You said that some of
the declines you were seeing in California were higher than what you expected initially. Was that – is that what resulted
in the reserve revision you guys took in the 10-K?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: The reserve revision largely was a single, old, non – a conventional oil part of Elk Hills
field. And it has a different kind of production driver, and the wells there have declined more than we thought but it's
not conventional. So it fell off the curves, so we took the write-down on the reserves. But it's not a unconventional, it's
not really shales, it's a reservoir that's probably been producing almost a 100 years, and will probably produce for
another 100 years.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, understood. And then just if you could, on the rig count, it's been kind of bouncing
around. The last year or two, you were at kind of 50 rigs on average in 2011 and then you were at 60 somewhat rigs on
average for 2012, and then by the end of the year, you were 41 rigs. So what's the trend for this year?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We believe 50 to 55 rigs.
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Yeah, in the Americas.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Americas, yeah.
<A - William E. Albrecht>: 50 to 55, pretty stable.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. So I'm trying to reconcile that with the 10-K where you talk about 41 rigs at the end of
the year.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah. At any time these rig numbers, how many you have, we answer it almost too
truthfully. And so it's exactly what it is that day, or the day before. And it could be three rigs or four rigs higher or
lower the next day. So I wouldn't make too much of the exact number.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, understood. And one last question in terms of – if I look at the year-over-year growth in
volumes in the lower 48, how much would you say of the volume growth was attributed to the acquisitions you made
last year?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: A little bit. We made a gas acquisition in California at the end of last year. So I think some
of that was California, and then a little bit elsewhere, but it's very hard. Most of what we acquired was PUD locations.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, understood. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thank you.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Sven Del Pozzo of IHS.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: Yeah, good morning.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: I'm trying to quantify, I know it's a hard question to answer because it is driven by
third-party operators, but how much do you budget for, out of the $1.9 billion in the – you said, two-thirds of $1.9
billion in CapEx in the Permian and non-C02 businesses?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: That's right.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: How much?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: $600 million and $1.3 billion, as I remember.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: Oh, that would be operated versus non-operated but the ...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: No, no, no, no, no, no.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: That's total. The C02 business is almost all our operated. The 1.3 includes some of the
non-operated ones. We have to estimate that number, obviously. It's not our choice.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: Yeah. And so in relation to the – to that non-operated estimate, I was wondering what kind
of exposure you have to non-operated wells, and I would imagine with cost cutting efforts going on that perhaps, you
might decline to participate in third party wells? And how much exposure do you have to third-party business in the
Permian?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We clearly have some. You might decline. What the – generally the result, what I'd like to
have from them is the results they tell the Street rather than the AFEs we see.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: Would it be possible to quantify the – of your 1.7 million net acres and that you consider
prospective for these emerging plays, how much of that is non-operated acreage and how much is operated?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I don't think we can do that here on the phone.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: And then...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: You can see the gross and net, we show you gross and net, so you get some idea of our
percentage. So I mean that may help you some. But we don't actually keep our records that way.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: Okay. The – yeah, I saw 2.5 million net acres in the Permian on your website for the total
acreage number.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: That's right.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: Does that include what you acquired in Reeves County? Was that last year for the Wolf
Bone stuff?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's whatever, whatever was there on 12/31.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: Okay. And then there were just some comments, and I was just looking over the fourth
quarter call that talked about C02 maintenance. Might that – I mean, is that on the horizon or has it already – have we
already seen the mains in the first quarter?

<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah, Bill will answer that.
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Yes, Sven, we've got one of our major C02 recycling plants getting ready to undergo a
turnaround. It's going to start, I think, next Saturday. Last about two weeks.
<Q - Sven A. Del Pozzo>: All right, all right. Well, thanks, everybody.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thank you. Chris?
<A - Christopher G. Stavros>: We have one last question.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
And your final question comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Guys, just one more on the cost side. I mean clearly you're running ahead of schedule on
your cost reductions, but since the end of the quarter, we've seen WTI and Brent both coming down about $10. What
would it take for you to accelerate or let's say up-size your cost production target for the year?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, we might do it internally, but it will be – we'll show you actuals.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Okay. And I mean have – anecdotally, have you seen some softening across the value
chain in the last, let's say, four weeks?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: The – you're talking about costs? Yeah, we contract on a longer basis than that. Certainly,
the costs from suppliers is – what they're charging has come down. But we don't do a lot of daily sorts of activities.
Most of our stuff is contracted for a period. So it's really hard for us to tell about the last month.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Okay. Fair enough. I'll take that offline. Thanks.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thank you. Chris?
Christopher G. Stavros
