MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Carrie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome
everyone to the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would like to turn over
to your VP of Investor Relations, Ms. Yijing Brentano. Please go ahead.
Yijing Brentano, Vice President – Investor Relations
Thank you, Carrie, good morning, and welcome to Sprint Nextel's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Call. Thanks for
joining us this morning. For the format of the call, Dan Hesse, our CEO, will discuss operational performance in the
quarter, and then our CFO, Bob Brust will cover the financial aspects of the quarter.
Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are
both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website. Slide two is our cautionary statement. I want to
point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a
number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking
statements. We provide a comprehensive list of the risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review
including our form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and in Part 2, Item 1A, risk factors of our quarterly
reports on form 10-Q.
Turning to slide three, throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our
non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the third quarter can be found

on attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at
www.sprint.com/investors.
Next, I would like to cover our EPS results. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the third quarter was $0.30
compared to $0.25 in the second quarter 2010 and $0.17 in the year-ago period. The sequential change in EPS was due
primarily to drivers that also impacted the sequential change in OIBDA, which Bob Brust will discuss in more detail
later on the call.
I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse.
Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Yijing, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us this morning. If you'd turn to slide four, I was
asked at an investor conference recently to describe Sprint's performance in one word, and I chose the word
momentum. Our last two quarters, the second and third quarters of 2010, represent the best quarters ever for Sprint,
both in postpaid churn and in year-over-year improvement in postpaid net adds. Driven by our best retail net add
performance in over four years, we grew total wireless subscribers by 644,000 in the third quarter, our highest quarterly
net add total since 2006.
As is my habit, I'll discuss our results in the context of Sprint's three overarching priorities: the customer experience,
the brand and cash. But as a change of pace, let me start with the third, cash. Primarily driven by more postpaid and
prepaid gross adds and upgrades plus some anticipated seasonal factors, quarterly OIBDA was driven down
sequentially to $1.34 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow now stands at $1.6 billion allowing us to maintain strong
liquidity with a cash and cash equivalents balance of 4.7 billion. Total net operating revenues increased sequentially
and year over year.
Please go to slide five. With respect to the customer experience, I am pleased to report we've achieved our 11th
consecutive quarter of improvement in Customer Care Satisfaction and in First Call Resolution. Top-box satisfaction
and bottom-box satisfaction both achieved all time bests, as did First Call Resolution. Our networks achieved yet
another all time best result for fewest blocked calls.
In a recent third party survey, our customers gave Sprint our highest rating ever on network satisfaction. According to
the recent J.D. Power and Associates' Wireless Call Quality Performance Study, Sprint came in first or second place in
five of six regions, and we have shown the most improvement of any carrier over a three year period. In the J.D. Power
Retail Sales Satisfaction Study, Sprint moved from last place in recent years to a virtual tie for first place. In the
Vocalabs National Customer Service Survey, Sprint's call satisfaction tied for first place.
On the business side, we won seven ATLANTIC-ACM awards for business connectivity and wireless business
excellence, and Sprint again walked away with the top honors in the Nemertes 2010 PilotHouse Awards for MPLS
services, receiving the top overall score. The customer experience improvements are reflected in our churn results. And
as mentioned, the last two quarters have been the best two churn quarters in our history. The percentage of postpaid
customers that carry a prime credit rating remains at a strong 84%, an important determinant of involuntary churn.
On the voluntary side, customers who are on contract churn at a lower rate than those who are off contract. We are
getting more customers on contract, but our off-contract churn the past two quarters has been our lowest on record, and
our return rate in the first 30 days is actually lower since we launched Sprint's unique full 30-day money back
guarantee this year than it has been for any previous year on record.
Moving to slide six and the brand. The Sprint brand continues to gain strength. One measure of brand health is
subscribers. In the third quarter we had positive postpaid net adds for the Sprint brand for the fourth consecutive
quarter. In the second quarter the Sprint brand was the fastest growing postpaid brand of all major postpaid brands in
terms of net new customers. 354,000 net adds in the third quarter represents over a 5% annualized growth rate in the
size of the total Sprint postpaid customer base. So it is likely the brand will achieve this fastest growing distinction yet
again this quarter.

Virtually all of Sprint's brand metrics have improved year over year. As I have mentioned on previous calls, Sprint
brand metrics, like most want to investigate and purchase consideration, have improved much more quickly among
Sprint customers who have experienced our improved customer service than they have with noncustomers. It is in this
context that I'm pleased to announce that we are net-port positive for both the Sprint brand and on the CDMA platform
for the first time on record. That is, based on our porting data, more customers are switching to Sprint than are
switching from Sprint. An indication of how the brand has strengthened with noncustomers is that port-ins from our
competitors have practically doubled year over year. Based upon Sprint's data, they're up 95%.
Our share of postpaid gross adds improved for the fifth consecutive quarter, and we estimate it's up over 400 basis
points year over year. Year over year, total post paid net add performance improved by almost 700,000, our best third
quarter year over year improvement ever. As I mentioned earlier, our $644,000 total company net adds in a quarter is
our best since 2006.
Please turn to slide seven. Devices are becoming increasingly important in attracting and retaining customers. PCWorld
ranks the Samsung Epic 4G launched in third quarter and the HTC EVO 4G launched in the second as the two best
smartphones on the market, ahead of the iPhone 4 and ahead of other Android device. ZDNet ranks the EVO as the best
smartphone on the market. Each device has a long list of accolades, and smartphones are helping to fuel our
momentum, with 60% of our Sprint handset sales and upgrades being smartphones in the quarter.
Also in the third quarter, Sprint's launched the Samsung Intercept; Sanyo's Innuendo and Vero; the BlackBerry 9330
Curve; the Motorola i1, which is the world's first Nextel Direct Connect smartphone powered by Android; and the
Franklin Wireless U600, which is a 3G/4G USB modem. In prepaid, we launched Motorola's Rambler and Bali,
Samsung's Seek and Intercept and the BlackBerry 8530.
If you turn to slide eight. In prepaid our multi-brand strategy allows us to address multiple segments with specific
offers, distinct brand identities and unique business models. Despite the extremely competitive environment and the
recent integration of prepaid into Sprint's consumer organization, we feel we have momentum. Prepaid net adds of
471,000 are an improvement of almost 300,000 from last quarter with churn improving 29 basis points from Q2 to our
lowest prepaid churn level in almost five years.
We continued to enhance the Boost CDMA lineup with the BlackBerry Curve and first touchscreen QWERTY, the
Samsung Seek. Two weeks ago, we launched the next evolution of Boost, monthly unlimited with shrinkage. This
revolutionary approach rewards customers for on-time payments by shrinking their monthly bills after six, 12 and 18
on-time payments. This is a win-win for Boost and its customers. Lastly, two important brand metrics for Boost, brand
awareness and purchase consideration, both reached all time highs in our most recent study.
Assurance Wireless available in 11 states at end of the quarter, and as we said last quarter, we plan on being in 20 states
by the end of the year. We are relaunching the Virgin Mobile brand. Virgin Mobile launched its Crazy Life national
marketing campaign in July. Virgin Mobile's Beyond Talk launched its first Android device, the Samsung Intercept, in
October, giving it compelling BlackBerry and Android offers. We expect to see a growth in prepaid net adds in the
fourth quarter.
Sprint continues to innovate and lead in the areas of open and simplicity, and we've added another proof point of this
recently with our announcement of Sprint ID, which is on slide nine. Sprint ID is about accessing content. There are so
many apps out there – Google I think just yesterday reported that Android has 100,000 – that mobile users need a
trusted app search and aggregation partner to simplify navigating through this ocean of apps and finding the best and
most relevant apps for their needs.
To launch this revolutionary concept, we've lined up some of the world's best brands like Yahoo!, HSN, Disney, ESPN,
LatCel and eBay. Sprint ID opens a two-way street between content providers and users, and Sprint's open philosophy
enables this, rather than restricts it. ID lets customers download packs of apps, widgets, ring tones and wallpapers,
aggregated by a trusted brand. A customer can have up to five IDs at once, be they personal or business. We announced
three new Sprint ID-enabled Android devices, the Samsung Transform, the Sanyo Zio and the LG Optimus S, priced at
under 150, 100 and under $50, respectively. Many content providers will also be new distribution partners for us.

Improving our environment continues to be a top Sprint priority. If you go to slide 10, you'll see that Newsweek ranks
Sprint number six nationally among the 100 greatest companies, the only telecom company in the top 50, as a matter of
fact the only one in the top 95. Sprint also placed first among all technology companies for actual environmental
impact, which measures 750 performance metrics. Out of the 500 companies researched, only one scored higher in this
measure.
We recently launched a certified pre-owned device program to give wireless phones second life. This program not only
allows customers to get one of today's devices at a great value, but it also helps Sprint to achieve our aggressive reuse
and recycling goals. All Sprint-certified preowned devices are thoroughly inspected, tested and if necessary
remanufactured according to original equipment manufacturer new unit specifications, and they come with a 30-day
return policy. Devices available include the BlackBerry Tour, the Samsung Reclaim in green and the Sanyo 2700 in
pink and blue. PC Magazine awarded the Samsung Restore and the LG Remarq its GreenTech seal, joining the
Samsung Reclaim, which was also named the world's greenest cell phone by Call Finder.
Many on this call are investors so you may be interested to know that in August Sprint was chosen one of the 20 most
responsible companies in the U.S. by GovernanceMetrics International out of 4,100 companies evaluated. The overall
ratings are based on six broad categories: board accountability, financial disclosure and internal controls, shareholder
rights, remuneration, market for control and corporate behavior.
Leading in 4G has been an important element of our strategy this year. In the third quarter, we launched 19 4G markets,
including Jacksonville, Boston, Providence, Orlando, Minneapolis/St. Paul and Pittsburgh, and fourth markets include
New York, L.A. and San Francisco. For some time, Sprint has been in discussions with Clearwire regarding the
financial status of its ongoing operations as well as Sprint potentially providing new financing. We expect those
discussions to continue as we review alternatives with Clearwire. There is no assurance that the discussions will result
in any transaction with Clearwire, and we will provide no additional comments on this matter.
Also, as I mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, we intend through the network modernization plan to enhance
service quality and coverage, create network flexibility, reduce operating costs and improve environmental
sustainability. The plan focuses on upgrading the existing EVDO network and providing technology flexibility for 4G.
Results of trial activities have shown positive gains in coverage and performance in line with expectations. We expect
that improved coverage and next generation backhaul solutions will enable Sprint to reduce roaming and access costs.
The deployment of multi-mode equipment allows Sprint to more feasibly consider new technologies, using available
spectrum bands and reduce future deployment costs. Under the network plan, if we choose, we can reallocate a portion
of available iDEN 800 megahertz spectrum to provision CDMA services, giving customers the benefit of enhanced and
building coverage associated with the 800 megahertz band. The implementation of the network modernization plan
should further Sprint's reputation as a leader in environmental responsibility through improvements and physical
footprint, power consumption and cooling requirements. We will provide more details on the overall plan when vendor
selection is complete later this year.
So in conclusion, although our momentum continues as we have achieved a number of all time best for two quarters in
a row, we realize we have much progress still to make. We are in a hyper competitive industry with strong capable
competitors so making continued progress is hard work, but we intend to persevere. I will now turn it over to our Chief
Financial Officer, Bob Brust, who will discuss our financial performance.
Robert H. Brust, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. Moving to slide 11, we are pleased with the continued stabilization of
revenue on both the sequential and year over year basis. Total quarterly revenues grew year over year for the first time
in more than three years. This improvement was a result of acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2009 and higher
equipment and prepaid service revenues, partially offset by lower wireline and postpaid service revenues.

Total quarterly revenues improved sequentially primarily due to higher equipment revenue. Wireless service revenues,
which include retail, wholesale and affiliate revenues were also relatively stable sequentially and year over year. The
reduction in postpaid subscriber losses and the continued growth in prepaid subscribers have been the key drivers in
stabilization – stabilizing revenue. In the third quarter of 2009, Sprint lost 545,000 wireless subscribers, and this year in
the third quarter we gained 644,000 total wireless subscribers. This year over year improvement of almost 1.2 million
met subscriber additions has had a meaningful impact on our revenue results. Revenue improvement continues to be a
primary focus for the company.
Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was 1.339 billion, down 162 million sequentially and down 167 million
from a year ago. Adjusted OIBDA margins declined 200 basis points sequentially. Adjusted OIBDA declined
sequentially primarily due to higher retail gross adds and upgrades, which drove higher subsidy and selling expenses.
Both postpaid and prepaid gross adds increased by more than 10%, as compared to the second quarter.
Although we incur cost to bring new customers on to our network, it is money well spent. As we have said, an
important factor in turning around the company's financial performance is growing our customer base and as a result
improving revenue.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect that postpaid gross adds will improve sequentially, driving higher
associated subsidy and selling expense. Cost of service was higher sequentially due largely to the effects of seasonality,
including higher roaming, service and repair and cell site utility expenses. Postpaid ARPU remains stable sequentially
at $55. The mix of subscribers in our postpaid customer base who own a smartphone continues to grow, which along
with Any Mobile, Anytime help drive adoption of database bundled plans.
However, the positive impact of higher monthly recurring charges was offset by lower usage based charges, including
overage. Prepaid ARPU was essentially flat. Looking forward, overall prepaid ARPU will be impacted by – in the short
term by shifts in mix of our prepaid subscriber base along with our brands.
Wireline contribution to adjusted OIBDA was relatively stable sequentially as the revenue decline was mostly offset by
a decline in cost of service. Revenue was lower primarily due to lower voice volume and adjustments associated with
carrier disputes impacting IP. The improvement in cost of service was primarily driven by lower voice volume and a
slight improvement in switched access rates. We expect pressure on wireline revenue and OIBDA in the fourth quarter
driven primarily by continued lower voice volume.
Moving to slide 13, we generated 384 million of free cash flow in the third quarter. This was down from 709 million in
the second quarter, primarily due to a reduction in cash flow from operations, which includes higher interest payments,
which is typical for the third quarter. Through the first three quarters of 2010, we have generated a net total of 1.6
billion free cash flow. We expect to continue to generate a meaningful level of positive cash flow in the fourth quarter.
We ended the quarter with 4.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. As we discussed during our second quarter earnings
call, we have repaid the 750 million note that came due in June of 2010. This was our only note maturity due in 2010.
Looking ahead at debt maturities, we have 1.65 billion maturing in January of 2011 and 2.75 billion in 2012. We expect
to pay the 2011 and 2012 maturities as scheduled. We expect to end 2010 with a strong cash balance in preparation for
our first quarter 2011 maturity payment. Our goal continues to be to maintain an average cash balance of approximately
$4 billion.
Capital expenditures were 462 million in the third quarter compared to 437 million in the second quarter and 431
million in the third quarter of 2009. Capital investment in 2010 has focused on wireless quality, coverage and capacity
to maintain competitive positions and data services and network quality. Our total cell sites including CDMA and
iDEN is approximately 68,000, reflecting the additions from the iPCS acquisition. We still expect that full year 2010
capital spending will be up to $2 billion.
In summary, our priorities remain constant. In 2010 our focus is on stabilizing revenue. Next year if our subscriber
results continue to improve, we expect to start seeing revenue growth. We have made progress on our key objectives
through the first three quarters of 2010. We still have a lot more work to do on the turnaround, but we are encouraged
by how far we have come.

Now I will turn it back to Yijing for questions.
Yijing Brentano, Vice President – Investor Relations
Thanks, Bob. In just a minute, Carrie will instruct listeners on how to queue up for the question-and-answer session. I
want to point out that you may access an audio replay or webcast of our presentation on www.sprint.com/investors. We
will now open the lines for your questions. Carrie, please instruct our participants.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from John Hodulik [UBS Securities LLC].
<Q - John Hodulik>: Okay, thanks. Good morning. Dan, could you talk a little bit about trends in the iDEN business?
It looks like the adds there fell off a bit after some stability here in the third quarter. So some commentary on what's
happening on that side? And then as we look forward, obviously there's a lot of speculation about AT&T losing
exclusivity on the iPhone. Can you give us a sense of how you think the market changes if that happens, and would you
foresee maybe pressure on gross add share or higher churn if in fact in the first quarter say Verizon, which is the real
speculation, gets the iPhone?
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks, John. First, you're right, subs are declining on the iDEN network,
and that's as I mentioned earlier on the call, we're doing I think a lot for our customers on iDEN. They're being
provided with the best call quality, lowest blocking rates that they've ever had. We continue to launch new devices, I'm
talking on the postpaid side. And on the prepaid side, what you're seeing is with the launch of Boost Unlimited on
CDMA, with some attractive and more attractively priced CDMA devices, an increasing number of prepaid customers
that are looking at Boost or choosing CDMA over iDEN. So we're really focusing on iDEN on keeping churn down,
and actually churn is beginning to approach CDMA levels of churn on postpaid. So we're doing a better job on churn
on iDEN.
What we're not doing though is we have limited advertising and marketing dollars. We're spending very little on iDEN
going after new customers because if you think of your marketing spend as a zero sum game, we're going to get a better
return on that investment putting that on the Sprint brand than on the Nextel brand.
So you are seeing, if you will, a decline in both postpaid and prepaid customers on the iDEN network, but we're
focusing on providing them with great service. And what it's allowing us to do is, if you will, kind of farm or use some
of that 800 megahertz spectrum, which we are trialing and testing now, potentially on CDMA to provide better
in-building and service quality on our CDMA service. So there's very valuable spectrum that we can get good
utilization out of. And as I mentioned also from a device point of view, we launched the first Android handset on iDEN
in the third quarter.
Secondly, with respect to the iPhone, I just – it's hard to speculate on that. We'll just have to see what happens, and
quite frankly, of course, all the carriers are thinking about 2011 and the implications, but I just don't want to speculate
on it.
<Q - John Hodulik>: Okay. Thanks.

<Q - Michael Rollins>: Hi, good morning. Dan, you talked a bit about the improvement in the porting ratios and the
share of gross adds. Can you talk a little bit more of how you would weight that between devices versus rate plans that's
driving that? And then can you give us a sense, I know you talked about smartphones as a percent of upgrades or
handset sales, but can you give us a sense of what the totality of the penetration is in the base and how you see that
moving over the next 12 months? Thanks.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Michael, let me take them backwards. I think your second question was
with respect to smartphones in the base. So 60% of our new sales, if you will, of phones both gross adds and upgrades,
60% were smartphones this quarter, which brings us to about 45% of our base being smartphones, if that answers your
question.
The second question had to do with I think what is driving our improvements in SoGA and port ratios and what have
you between rate plans and devices. I'd say it's really both of them. We've improved our device lineup very
significantly, and one of the very key trends in our industry has been each year that devices are becoming a more and
more important part of the marketing plan and what customers base their decisions on.
As a matter of fact, it's probably becoming the most important overall factor, and it was not that case just a couple years
ago. But clearly, the rate plans are important and very importantly from a port out point of view because if customers
are on a good rate plan and they like the nature of the rate plan, the simplicity of the rate plan, the value of it, they're
much less likely to leave.
So our focus is on devices, the network, the quality of the network, both 3G and 4G, first, 4G is important, and
improved customer experience because as you also heard on the call was that our brand metrics continue to improve,
but they're up sharply among our existing customers. So that's helping with churn. So net net, for us, we believe they're
both important devices and rate plans, but as time goes on devices are becoming even more important than rate plans.
<Q - Michael Rollins>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question will come from David Benard. I'm sorry, David Barden [Bank of America Merrill Lynch].
<Q - David Barden>: Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could, please. Bob, maybe the first
question is on ARPU, could you dig in a little bit further into this loss of overage that seems to be impacting ARPU? I
guess as I look at it, year over year you've lost, say, 1 million lower ARPU iDEN customers, you've added higher
ARPU CDMA customers, the vast majority of upgrades in gross adds are smartphones, which are higher ARPU
relative to the base. So it seems strange that we haven't been able to see more of that come through, and I'm wondering
if it's because older customers are repricing at lower plans. If you could dig in to that a little bit more, it would be great.
And then second, maybe Dan, not necessarily on the Clearwire directly, but Clearwire has been throwing out a lot of
options to show people that there are many strategies that they have. I think the sense is that Sprint has only one
strategy right now, which is Clearwire, which may or may not be true. What is Sprint's backup plan if Clearwire's build
just stops in the first part of 2011, and you don't have a broad 4G strategy for 2011 and 2012? Thanks.
<A - Robert H. Brust, Chief Financial Officer>: David, on the ARPU, there's several things working in there. We
have – the rate is stabilizing with the 4G contribution and the extra charge we put on that. We have a shift toward more
bundled rate plans going on. And the overage – and our overage has been declining. So all those combinations are
keeping it kind of stable.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, and Dave, nice try, even though I said I wasn't going to comment
further on the matter. But suffice it to say, we're obviously actively involved in discussions with Clearwire and – but
we do have alternatives that we would consider, but I certainly don't want to suggest that that is our primary focus, but
we always work to have alternatives.

<Q - David Barden>: Sorry, I had to try. But Bob, could I just follow up real quick, Bob on that ARPU? I guess are
you saying that these forces are in intention and that irrespective of the smartphone upgrades and the iDEN going away,
right now flattish ARPU is really the picture we should expect?
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Dave, this is me, Dan again. So far what you're seeing is, if you will, the
higher monthly recurring charges more or less offset by the, if you will, the loss of the overages, and they've been more
or less canceling each other out. Over time with momentum we have in smartphones and the $10 premium that we're
charging for certain heavy use smartphones, I think over time you could expect that ARPU will begin to tick up. But so
far, if you will, typically you have the people that price down, do it more quickly. So so far you've had more or less of a
cancel – the two cancel each other out. You have higher MRCs, monthly recurring charges on average, fewer fees and
overages, and of course that's reflected on the positive side in churn, in churn improvements, because customers don't
like overages. And if you take – if you just extrapolate those trends over time, you should expect to begin to see ARPU
move up. I'm not going to tell you when yet, but you should expect to see those begin to tick up going forward.
<Q - David Barden>: Thanks a lot. I really appreciate it, Dan.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Take care, Dave.

Your next question will come from Jason Armstrong [Goldman Sachs & Co.].
<Q - Jason Armstrong>: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Couple of questions, both related to the gross addition
trajectory and that sort of continuing to move up into next quarter. The first is with normal seasonality, which would
suggest a down tick in churn, it should mean positive net adds or within reach in 4Q. Wondering how you would think
through how likely that is? And then second, as it relates to gross adds continuing to move up and then a continued
large device upgrade percentage in your base, it seems like no real relief on the horizon, at least in the near term for
wireless margin. So how should we think through your balancing efforts on postpaid and sort of improving the
trajectory there relative to what's happening on the margin line?
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we've provided all the guidance that we're going to provide with
respect to Q4, and you'll see, if you will, in our new kind of guidance language or forecast language for 4Q, that you
could expect an improvement in both postpaid, prepaid and total net add performance sequentially in Q4 versus Q3.
But I won't elaborate more than that. But clearly we're working to improve those numbers.
With respect to upgrades, and I think you're getting at subsidies and what have you. That is kind of the challenge in our
industry where smartphones, and this is related to the last question, give us benefits in ARPU and churn, but of course
also have increased subsidy, so increased CPGA and then increased cost of service that go with them. And so far the
benefits have outstripped the down side.
We are working very closely and hard with our suppliers to continue to give us better priced phones, and we work very
hard on the mix, and that's why actually our cost for the devices was better this quarter than it was in previous quarters,
mainly because we've been able to work very effectively on not only device pricing, but device mix.
That being said, in terms of margins, if you look at the margins in our business, the biggest issue for us from a margin
point of view is the cost of services associated with running two networks. And it will take us, I mentioned it on – near
the end of my comments on the earnings call, we have a network modernization plan out there that we're currently
evaluating. We're going to decide and we haven't yet who we're choosing, what the economics are, how quickly we
deploy that or what have you. But it takes a while to implement that so you wouldn't start to see the significant benefits
of that probably occurring until 2012 or so.
So that's the biggest opportunity we have, if you will, on the margin side, is our activity on the network.
<Q - Jason Armstrong>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question will come from Brett Feldman [Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.].
<Q - Brett Feldman>: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I actually just want to follow up on those last comments
about network modernization. You've talked about a lot of different objectives here, improved performance of the
CDMA network, some cost reductions over time. I was hoping, I know you're not ready to give all the details yet, but
you can maybe just give us the order of magnitude, what bigger priorities are, is it more of a network performance
project, is it more of a cost management project? And then how does iDEN fit into all that?
<A - Robert Azzi>: This is Bob Azzi, I'm the head of network here. Just to comment on that, I would characterize it as
really comes together, the modernization of the network will help us to both reduce our cost and give us the technology,
flexibility so it does comes together in a technology platform that we're looking at.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, this is Dan. As I've said earlier, our network performance is really
very, very strong. So we actually see our networks currently as a competitive advantage, not a disadvantage. But – and
the alternative on the cost side, because we're running two networks instead of one network, we see our costs of
running our networks as a disadvantage.
So in terms of overall priorities in terms of us doing this, it is the primary driver is cost reduction and is economic
improvement, but it has added benefits, if you will, the icing on the cake, in terms of also giving us superior network
performance that makes it easier for us to more effectively use multimode technology. For example, and I mentioned
using the 800 megahertz band for CDMA, as well and do that cost effectively. So the biggest driver is to improve our
cost position, and it has added performance benefits that come along with it because of the way technology has
improved over the past few years.
<Q - Brett Feldman>: And so you've said, the big cost disadvantage is because you have two networks, does that
mean that whenever this project ends, which could go for a few years, you consolidate it down to one platform?
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: That's correct, that's the plan, one overall platform. That doesn't mean one
air interface. Okay, and I want to make sure that – or one spectrum band, you'll have multiple spectrum bands, but it
would in essence it would give us the opportunity to put, if you will, multiple air interfaces, and if you will, frequency
bands on the same cell site and share common backhaul, share the same towers and what have you, which gives us a lot
of economic benefit. So you should think of it as one – the way we think about it is yes, we would go from multiple
networks to one network.
<Q - Brett Feldman>: Great. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Sure.

Your next question will come from Timothy Horan [Oppenheimer Securities].
<Q - Timothy Horan>: Thanks, guys, and good morning. Good job on the quarter. Two questions, if you don't mind.
One on, Dan, can you maybe talk a little bit about LTE, and when do you think your competitors are going to have
decent coverage and decent handsets? And kind of secondly, and somewhat related to that, are you kind of against or
for – just maybe your thoughts on maybe doing joint 4G builds? I know you talked about the network being the biggest
part of your cost, but if someone like Elite or PCS or T-Mobile or others wanted to do a 4G build with you, would you
be for or against that? Thanks.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Tim. Well, you'll have to ask our competitors about their progress
with respect to coverage and handsets, but, yeah, I think coverage will come ahead of handsets, particularly with
respect to Verizon. I think they've said that. So we are going to try to maximize our time-to-market advantage, and
you're right to ask the question about both because you could have the same number of pops, but if you don't have the

device portfolio, it doesn't do you that much good. And so our real strength is the fact that we have a more mature
ecosystem in terms of devices and handsets. And as I mentioned earlier on the call, the EVO and Epic are out there, and
they're getting tremendous reviews both for 3G and 4G so that is a strength.
Secondly, we're always open to looking at anything that provides a good positive return for our shareholders, and so we
are not averse to looking at any joint initiatives that would make economic sense. Doesn't say we'll do them, won't say
we won't do them, but we would evaluate any opportunity that came forward.
<Q - Timothy Horan>: Very, very helpful. But just on the EVO, Epic, do you think you will – clearly you have a great
advantage there, do you this could last for12 months, two years, your best guess on that timeframe?
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I wish. It's hard to say. Our expectation is that we'll – Verizon will
get some decent handsets out there in 2011 to compete with us in 4G. So again our – we'll be in our second generation
of handsets in 2011. We'll continue to improve and expand our 4G handset portfolio in 2011. So I think it'll be for a
while we will have an advantage in terms of the selection of 4G handsets. I won't say how long, but Verizon is a very
capable competitor, and they are investing heavily in this area, so we know they'll be on our heels pretty quickly.

Your next question will come from Simon Flannery [Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc.].
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Okay. Thanks very much. Good morning. Bob, in terms of fourth quarter, one of the things
that you reiterated was Clearwire intention to turn on up to 120 million pops. How does that affect your network
expense in terms of payments for people like in New York City who have an EVO and are currently operating
primarily on 3G, but will start using the 4G network? Is that material delta sequentially? Any color you could give us
there? And also, in the release you noted that Clearwire results were not yet finalized. Is there any – sort of anything
more you can tell us behind that, anything we should be looking out for there? And then finally, Dan, if you have
updated thoughts on tiered data pricing, that would be great. Thank you.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Okay, three questions there. One is that would you expect in Q4 as we
turn up these additional 4G markets to see kind of a material change associated with – we'll call it more 4G usage
versus 3G usage, and the answer there would be no. There clearly is – there are some payments that go to Clearwire
with respect of 4G usage of these devices, but that's – so there is some, but what we would call materiality, I would say
no.
The – you asked two more questions, one was I think you wanted me to try to preannounce Clearwire earnings or
results. Was that...?
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Well, there was just – you had a discussion in the release that you didn't have last quarter. I
just wanted to understand what was driving that? Well, has anything changed versus last quarter, or is that...
<A - Yijing Brentano, Vice President – Investor Relations>: Simon, I'll take that question. So every quarter we
review our Safe Harbor statements and make updates and changes, if necessary. Although the timing and procedures
relating to the receipt of Clearwire's financial information remains the same as previous periods, we added the language
on the Clearwire results this quarter because Clearwire has become a more material part of our business.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Okay. That's helpful, Yijing. Thank you.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: You had – I don't think you're allowed to, but I think, Simon, you had a
third question.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: It was on tiered data pricing, Dan. Thanks.

<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Oh, tiered data pricing. Yeah, we continue to evaluate it. And the key will
be looking at usage characteristics, so I've been asked this question before. There clearly is an advantage to having, if
you will, an unlimited or headache free simple pricing customers like it, and they'll pay a premium for it. But we don't
want to lose segments of the market because our – because we don't have price points in other parts of the, if you will,
the continuum of data use. So it's something that we just continue to monitor.
It helped us not only improve churn, but lower our costs and improve the overall, if you will, care and retail experience
by two years ago we eliminated 85% of our A plan combinations, and that simplicity really helps the business. So there
are a lot of advantages to having, if you will, a simple rate plan structure. But again, there's a lot of increased data
usage, and we want to make sure that we're competitive and effective out there in the marketplace, so I will not rule out
tiered data pricing.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Sure.
Operator
Your next question will come from Jonathan Chaplin [Credit Suisse].
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Thanks. Two quick questions, if I may. I'm wondering if you could remind us of the details
of your 800 megahertz spectrum position, and where you are in the rebounding position? I can't remember if that
affects the 800 megahertz or not? And then getting into the details of repurposing that spectrum, how much do you
need to reserve for the number of subscribers that you have left on the iDEN network, and how much does that free up
for use on CDMA? And is the repurposing of that spectrum something you can do relatively soon before you go
through the whole network transformation process, or does it have to wait for the network transformation process
before you can start reusing it? Thanks.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: This is Dan. Jonathan, the first part of the question had to do with – was it
the rebanding and the economics there? Well, we had a letter of credit reduction in the third quarter, actually two of
them, that were a total of 255 million. So our letter of credit is now at 1.33 billion, which is down from the original 2.5,
and we've incurred about 2.7 billion of costs so far. So there's an outstanding letter of credit out there at 1.33 billion,
but that's down 255 this quarter. And the rebanding process is likely to continue even beyond 2012. So this is – the
process will take some time.
With respect to your second question. Yes, the network modernization project is a very, very important part of utilizing
the 800 frequency for CDMA. It makes sense to do that as part of the project, and the other thing that goes along with it
is new CDMA handsets that are also capable of operating at those lower 800 megahertz frequencies that our existing
base of handsets are not. It's not a big change, it's a fairly minor one, but it's still something we need to seed new
devices into the marketplace, so it's not, if you will, it's not something that we will do immediately, so there are two
elements in essence that we're really waiting for before we do it in, what we'll call, a meaningful fashion.
And I think you had one last question. I'm not sure, there was one question -
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Yeah, just how much total 800 megahertz spectrum you have, and whether that's affected by
rebanding process?
<A - Robert Azzi>: This is Bob Azzi. Basically after reband's complete, we'll have 14 megahertz across the markets.
I'll also mention that in a number of the markets that we do – also have some holdings at 900 megahertz that we also
use for the iDEN customer base.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Got it. So are you able to do two paired 3.5 megahertz channels – one pair for CDMA and
one for iDEN in that 14 megahertz? Is that how it will ultimately work?

<A - Robert Azzi>: What our early part of the plan in markets where we have completed the rebanding process, we
think we can get one CDMA carrier deployed for voice, which is what we're looking at to help with the performance
improvement, and as Dan mentioned the handset chipsets have to come along with that to enable that.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: And it's putting in that CDMA carrier that enables you to reduce the 20,000 cell sites that
you're hoping to take out over time?
<A - Robert Azzi>: I don't think you can draw that extension correctly. I just want to emphasize we're focused on the
first steps of the plan right now, and then in the future we'll evaluate how we rationalize that across the entire network.

Your next question will come from Ric Prentiss [Raymond James & Associates].
<Q - Ric Prentiss>: Yeah, actually, piggyback on some of the questions. Obviously a lot of interest in the network
modernization. You mentioned the 4.7 billion in cash, the debt maturities coming up. As you think about a network
modernization plan, could be 2 billion, could be 3 billion, if you think of how many base stations you're going to touch.
How many years might that play out, that capital spending given your cash balance, the debt maturities, and, Dan, I
think you said 2012 before you see some meaningful improvement in margins. Are we thinking about a two-year plan,
a five-year plan?
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: I'd say three to four.
<Q - Ric Prentiss>: Okay.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Kind of in that range, and it could potentially be longer. We'll evaluate
based upon our cash generation and cash needs, and we still haven't gotten to that point yet how quickly we will do this
and implement it. So we have a choice of doing it more quickly or taking more time, and we – and that's something that
we'll evaluate later. So we have not reached a conclusion in that regard just like we haven't picked the vendors, but
think of four years as a rough ballpark.
<Q - Ric Prentiss>: Yeah, some people were I think suggesting that maybe it was an immediate need of cash that
might have to be all spent next year, and it seems like the balance sheet could handle a multiyear project pretty easily.
<A - Robert H. Brust, Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, Ric, it's Bob. Yeah, I think it can. In the last few years we've
been generating close to 2 billion a year in cash, and 2012 is a peak and the 2750 [2.75 billion] in 2012 is a highlight,
and then the debt retirements go down a bit. So we should be able to manage this thing with good cash flow.
<Q - Ric Prentiss>: Sure, and then LightSquared, been a lot of buzz in the press and other places about a new entrant
for a wholesale network. What are your thoughts about another network coming into being?
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we – this is Dan. We won't comment specifically on LightSquared,
and I think you'll just need to talk to them.

<Q - David Dixon>: Thanks, and good morning. Dan, congrats on the good positive operating momentum, I'm clearly
looking forward to details on the margin expansion from the network modernization and making that 900 look a lot
more like the 700 that Verizon and AT&T paid so much for. But just a few quick questions. Number one on CapEx and
the outlook there, we're seeing a very high level of 3G network usage from these 4G customers where you see good
momentum. Can you talk about the extent to which you can focus on better network density in 2011? Would be the first
question. And then just on the network modernization, again, you pointed to 2012 in getting some benefits there.
Should I be thinking about three to four years as the fastest timeframe you think it would possible to rebuild the 38,000
strong CDMA network to take advantage of the new technology? And then just a quick follow up on the prepaid.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: David, let me see if I can answer your questions. There is I think – there's
definitely going to be increasing tonnage, if you will, on both the 3G, as well as, if you will, per the previous question,
usage of 4G going forward. So as we've been doing this year, we've been spending our capital to improve the capacity
and coverage and service with respect to 3G, and you can – and you should expect to see that. You had a question,
though, with respect to network density, and I'm not sure what you meant by that.
<Q - David Dixon>: On the 4G side, Dan, I guess I've been surprised by some customer feedback that the 3G usage
has actually been a lot higher relative to 4G, and that could just be Clearwire is early out of the gate here, and the
network density is not that great in the areas that they have launched in. So I was just curious as to whether you'll have
a bias on coverage versus improved network density in 2011? That seems to be just a key driver of the value
proposition for Sprint.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: This is something that we continue to discuss with Clearwire. The beauty
of dual mode devices are that, as you mentioned, you get 4G where 4G is there, and you can fall back to pretty darn
good 3G service where 3G is available. So 3G usage on the multimode devices is still fairly high, and you have to pick
the time when you launch a market and then as you well know over time our customers should expect that local
coverage will improve, very much like the earlier days of PCS that when service roamed on analog in addition to
digital. It's no different. So over time you will begin to see those coverage holes fill in, and if you will, 3G provides a
very good safety net. In early days of rolling this out, you're going to see fairly robust 3G usage.
<Q - David Dixon>: Okay.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: You also had a question about is three to four years the fastest? No, not
necessarily. You mean the fastest that it could be done? Technically, but we look at a lot of factors, including operating
risk, financial, cash, all those things that I just think it's – four is probably a good midpoint, if you will, to think about in
terms of how long we would take to roll this out.
<Q - David Dixon>: I'm just hearing very good feedback from other carriers in terms of how much benefit you get on
the roaming expense reduction and the power gains there. So encouraged to see that move as fast as it can. Just a quick
follow up then on the prepaid, Dan. We're seeing a significant pricing differential between postpaid mobile broadband
and prepaid mobile broadband, I think it's 60 versus 40. With prepaid very strong in the quarter, is that coming from a
significant migration, do you think, from postpaid to prepaid, and how do you think about aligning pricing going
forward on the mobile broadband side?
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Well, the migration from postpaid to prepaid has been very small.
<Q - David Dixon>: Okay.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: So
<Q - David Dixon>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Okay, your final question will come from James Ratcliffe [Barclays Capital, Inc.].
<Q - James Ratcliffe>: Good morning, thanks for taking the question. You mentioned that about 10% of postpaid subs
had upgraded their handsets in the quarter. Can you talk about how that compares year on year, and also talk about how
much – how many of those were real upgrades from Sprint's perspective, as in they generate incremental ARPU, is
somebody going from a feature phone to a smartphone? And how many of those were essentially a handset refresh at a
similar price point?
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we're looking – yeah the upgrade percentage is up slightly year over
year. We got folks looking to see what the percentage was a year ago, but our recollection is that it's up slightly. And
then there was a very detailed question, which I think is more than we provide with respect to handsets. Let me – here,
I'm – we're rifling through right here. Let's see what we got. Okay. So it was 9.4% in Q3, up 24 basis points year over
year. Yeah.
<Q - James Ratcliffe>: And I'm just trying to get an idea of the degree to which this upgrade activity is boosting
revenue versus having primarily retention effect of people getting new handsets and hence not churning.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think the key of this is really one that focuses on churn and churn
reduction. Are you talking about equipment revenue or ARPU because I don't think it has a material impact on MRC,
this upgrade activity. It's really more getting customers to sign a new contract.
<Q - James Ratcliffe>: Great. And just one thing on the new Boost plan. Given that this – as I understand, doesn't
affect customers retroactively. It's not that if you've been around for 18 months, you get an automatic price reduction.
We would expect to see a churn benefit from shrinkage before you see the ARPU impact. Would that be correct?
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: You expect to see a long term benefit with churn.
<Q - James Ratcliffe>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Dan Hesse, Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you.
