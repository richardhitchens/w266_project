Now during this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current
expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors including those listed on slide three
and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not
intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Let me begin today's call by highlighting a few events that have occurred since last quarter's call. In clinical news at the
ASCO GI meeting earlier this month the detailed data were presented for RAINBOW, the second positive Phase 3
ramucirumab trial to show increased overall survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer. We were pleased with
how these data were received by the medical community and we look forward to submitting the data to regulators later
this year. We were disappointed that the Phase 3 studies for edivoxetine, which was being studied as an adjunctive
therapy for patients with major depressive disorder, did not achieve their primary end points.
On the regulatory front, Q4 capped off a busy year as we completed three more submissions and received a label
expansion. We submitted our new insulin glargine product in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim to regulatory
authorities in both the United States and Japan. We also submitted a marketing authorization application for insulin
lispro U200 to the European Medicines Agency. And we received approval to update the U.S. Cialis label to include
the use of once daily Cialis five milligrams with finasteride to improve urinary symptoms in patients with benign
prostatic hyperplasia.
In business development we entered into collaboration agreement with Pfizer to jointly develop and commercialize
tanezumab for the potential treatment of osteoarthritis pain, chronic low back pain and cancer pain. And earlier this
month we announced the acquisition of a CGRP antibody in Phase 2 for migraine prevention from Arteaus
Therapeutics. We're very excited about the clinical data underpinning this decision and look forward to publishing them
in a leading medical journal.
We also entered the final year of what we have called years YZ with the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta in
December. Cymbalta generated more than $5 billion in worldwide sales last year making it one of the most
commercially successful neuroscience brands in our industry's history and one of only 20 brands, including Zyprexa, to
exceed $5 billion in sales in a single year. While we had not originally intended to pursue an authorized generic for
Cymbalta, we did recently enter into an AG agreement with Prasco to provide a limited quantity of duloxetine. This
will have a minimal positive impact on our 2014 revenue.
Finally, during Q4, we executed share repurchases totaling $500 million under our recently authorized $5 billion share
repurchase program. For the full-year, we distributed nearly $4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases.
Now let's discuss our financial performance for the quarter and the full year 2013. I'll provide comments about our
GAAP results and then discuss a few non-GAAP measures to provide some additional insight into the underlying
trends in our business.
On slide six, you can see that revenue in Q4 2013 was nearly $6 billion or 2% below Q4 2012. We're pleased with the
double-digit growth for Humalog, Cialis, Forteo, Strattera, and Evista and the Trajenta revenue more than doubled.
This strong revenue performance nearly offset lower U.S. Cymbalta sales. Excluding Cymbalta in the U.S., the rest of
our worldwide revenue grew nearly 9%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 2.9 percentage points driven
by the loss of Cymbalta's U.S. exclusivity and by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold
partially offset by higher prices.
This quarter, foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold had a negative impact on our gross margin.
However, in Q4 of 2012, foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold provided a benefit to our gross margin.
Excluding this FX effect from both 2012 and 2013, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined from 78.5% to 77.0%
or 1.5 percentage points. As in past quarters we've included a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent
for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect.

Non-GAAP measures are shown on slide seven. Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, was
flat versus Q4 of 2012. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses were down 1% while R&D was up 1%. The
reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to the restructuring of our U.S. commercial
organization that occurred in mid-2013, lower marketing expenses for Cymbalta in the U.S. and the favorable impact of
foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased marketing spend on other products.
The growth in R&D expenses was driven by both research and clinical development activity, partially offset by lower
milestone payments. As mentioned on our 2014 guidance call, we expect the late stage clinical trial cost to decline
substantially this year. Other income and expense was net income of $9 million in Q4 2013 compared to a net expense
of $52 million in the fourth quarter 2012. This difference is primarily due to milestone payments totaling $40 million
received from Boehringer Ingelheim for the submissions of our insulin glargine product in the United States and Japan.
Our tax rate was 20.5%, a decrease of 1.8 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to
the lapse of the R&D tax credit in 2012. At the bottom line, net income declined 16%. The smaller decrease in earnings
per share at 13% reflects the benefit of share repurchases.
Ilissa?
Ilissa Rassner
Thanks, Phil. Let me highlight a few full-year results shown on slide eight. Revenue increased 2% driven by growth of
Humalog, Trajenta, Alimta, Forteo, Cymbalta, Strattera and Humulin. Total operating expenses in 2013 decreased 1%
driven by lower selling and marketing expenses partially offset by a 5% increase in R&D expenses. Finally, net income
increased 19% and EPS increased 22%.
The dynamics in our full year results reflect the execution of our strategy for managing one of the industry's most
challenging series of patent expirations, driving strong performance in our growth areas and in our marketed brands
that retain patent protection, while increasing productivity across our business to fund the R&D necessary to fuel our
future growth. Our fourth quarter results remind us that 2014 is the most financially challenging year in this YZ period.
We're prepared for this challenge and are positioned to return to growth and expand margins in 2015 and beyond.
Slide nine provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported
earnings are available in today's earnings press release.
Moving to slide 10, you can see the total revenue decline of 2% in Q4 2013, shown in the yellow box on the middle of
the page, was driven by a negative volume impact of 5% and a negative foreign exchange impact of 2%, partially offset
by a favorable price impact of 4%. By geography, you'll notice that U.S. volume decreased 17%. This is due to the loss
of exclusivity for Cymbalta. Excluding Cymbalta, U.S. pharma volume increased more than 5%.
In Australia, Canada and Europe, or ACE, you'll see a negative 5% price impact. This quarter's price decline in ACE
was slightly higher than prior quarters since we are no longer recognizing amortization of the upfront payment by
Daiichi Sankyo for Evista rights. Favorable adjustments in a number of countries in Q4 2012 also led to a negative
year-on-year comparison. Excluding these items, the price decline in ACE was consistent with prior quarter's declines.
In Japan we had another quarter of very strong volume growth, up 17%, driven primarily by Evista, Forteo, Trajenta,
Strattera, Zyprexa and Cymbalta. That strong volume growth was again offset by the weakening of the yen. We expect
this robust growth to continue in 2014 as many of these products have several years of exclusivity remaining.
Turning to emerging markets, we are pleased with the revenue growth of 7% in the face of a 4% negative impact from
foreign exchange. Volume growth was a robust 13%, driven by strong performance in many countries in Latin and
South America, the Middle East and Africa. China volume grew 7%. Elanco animal health delivered revenue growth of
4%. Excluding FX, Elanco grew 6% in performance terms. This performance growth was driven by higher prices for
both food and companion animal products as well as by volume growth for food animal products. This was partially
offset by a volume decline for companion animal products. Overall we continue to be pleased with Elanco's

performance and are well positioned to continue to outperform the industry.
Slide 11 shows the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2013 results. For both Q4 and full-year 2013, FX
had a negative effect on revenue growth. In terms of cost of goods sold, we saw a smaller benefit from the FX effect on
international inventory sold in 2013 versus 2012. As a result, foreign exchange had a substantial negative effect on
growth and operating income and earnings per share.
Now let me turn the call over to Derica.
Derica W. Rice
Thanks Ilissa. Slide 12 shows our pipeline as of January 23. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with
green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing attrition. You'll notice that we've removed liprotamase from
the pipeline. Given our corporate investment priorities, Lilly will not be pursuing further development of this molecule.
We began Phase 2 testing of a tau imaging agent that is being developed by our Avid Radiopharmaceuticals subsidiary.
We started Phase 1 testing for five assets, and as Phil mentioned earlier, we added tanezumab to our Phase 3 portfolio
through a collaboration with Pfizer. Finally, we terminated Phase 3 development of edivoxetine and discontinued
development of three Phase 2 assets and one Phase 1 asset.
With a number of encouraging data readouts in 2013, data assets in Phase 3, four assets under regulatory review and
more submissions possible this year, we're confident in our ability to return to growth post 2014. I would also like to
point out that last month we completed enrollment in ACCELERATE, the Phase 3 trial evaluating evacetrapib in
patients with established atherosclerosis at high risk for experiencing a cardiovascular event. We successfully expedited
this trial enrolling 12,000 patients in just over 12 months. As a result, we have accelerated the last patient visit for this
study to January of 2016. This is a great achievement by our evacetrapib team and we believe it speaks to the
significant unmet patient need.
Based on lowering of LDL alone, we believe it is possible to achieve the primary MACE endpoint with significant
statistical power. We're also encouraged by the pharmacokinetic profile of evacetrapib as we've observed no clinically
meaningful blood levels of the drug at four to six weeks after discontinuation. We continue to be optimistic about the
potential for this molecule to reduce CV events in the patient population being studied.
Also, just last week, results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine from the EXPEDITION and
EXPEDITION 2 studies, evaluating solanezumab in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. You may
recall that in a pre-specified secondary analysis of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, pooled across both studies,
we saw a 34% reduction in cognitive decline as measured by AVAS-Cog (14) and we saw an 18% reduction in
functional decline as measured by ADCS-IADL.
We're now conducting a study called EXPEDITION 3 targeted specifically at patients that we believe are most likely to
benefit from treatment with solanezumab; patients with mild Alzheimer's disease who test positive for the presence of
amyloid pathology. In August of last year, the first patients were dosed in the study and we continue to target study
completion by the end of 2016. Currently, there are no treatments for Alzheimer's that impact the underlying disease,
and we remain encouraged by the solanezumab data.
While we understand investor interest will be focused on near-term launches in our diabetes and oncology businesses,
with mid-term launch opportunities coming from our autoimmune portfolio, we do not want you to lose sight of these
important opportunities for potential first-in-class medicines later this decade.
Next, let me provide a recap of how key events played out in 2013, remind you of our key events for 2014, and quickly
review our 2014 financial guidance. Now as has become customary when we roll out our full year financial guidance,
we provide you a list of key events for the year. And we update this list quarterly so you can track our progress. As
illustrated by the green check marks on slide 13, you can see that we made significant advances in our pipeline in 2013.
We had positive data readouts for five Phase 3 assets and completed regulatory submissions for four while continuing

to expect the necitumumab submission to be completed by the end of this year.
We initiated the Phase 3 study for solanezumab in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. We defended Alimta's
method-of-use patent in a district court in Indianapolis, and as Phil mentioned, we've entered the final year of years YZ
with the expiration of Cymbalta's U.S. patent.
2013 was a very productive year and we expect 2014 to be another busy year with significant pipeline activity and the
potential for multiple product launches. While I will not go through each item of slide 14, we're excited about the
opportunities we have to continue to advance our pipeline and to share data that will not only help investors better
judge our growth potential, but also convey why we view this year as a new beginning in the next phase of Lilly's rich
history.
We have the potential to initiate Phase 3 studies for two assets, our CDK4/6 inhibitor for cancer and our anti-sclerostin
antibody for osteoporosis. With respect to Phase 3 data, we expect either internal data readouts leading to top line press
releases, or external detailed data disclosures for six of the eight Phase 3 assets and for all four of the assets that are
under regulatory review. We also expect regulatory action for each of those four assets.
With respect to Alimta's method-of-use patent, we anticipate a ruling in the first half of this year. Now as a reminder,
regardless of the district court decision, we would expect one or more appeals to be made to the court of appeals for the
Federal Circuit before this litigation is resolved. And finally, we'll lose patent protection for Evista in the U.S. in March
and data package exclusivity for Cymbalta will expire in Europe in the second half of this year, although we do not
expect generic duloxetine to enter the European market until 2015.
Now moving on to our financial guidance for 2014, we are reconfirming the guidance – the 2014 guidance that was
issued earlier this month. If you are looking for additional color commentary on our 2014 guidance, please refer to
today's press release as well as the Investor section of lilly.com where you'll find the slides and audio from our January
7 guidance call.
Slide 16 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2013 and the associated growth rates from
these numbers to our 2014 guidance. In summary, we're pleased with the progress we made in 2013 implementing our
three strategic priorities. One, replenishing and advancing our pipeline; two, driving strong performance of our
marketed brands in key growth areas; and three, increasing productivity and reducing our cost structure. Our 2013
financial results were strong. Eight of our products exceeded $1 billion in annual sales. Japan and China delivered
double digit volume growth and Elanco continued to exceed overall industry growth. As Phil stated earlier in the call,
excluding Cymbalta in the U.S., our worldwide revenue grew a robust 9% in Q4. This strong performance combined
with our discipline in managing costs generated nearly $6 billion of operating cash flow covering capital expenditures
of $1 billion, our dividend of $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion of share repurchases.
As we turn to this year, we anticipate a number of clinical trial readouts, data presentations and regulatory submissions.
Most important, we also expect to launch multiple products with more to follow in the coming years allowing Lilly to
return to growth and expand margins post 2014.
So as I said on our guidance call earlier this month, far from seeing 2014 at the low point in our journey through one of
the industry's most challenging patent cliffs, we see this year as an inflection point leading to a bright future. We
continue to believe that our innovation strategy is the right one to benefit patients and create value for our shareholders.
We look forward to providing more updates as we continue to execute this strategy. This concludes our prepared
remarks and now we'll take your questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.
<Q - Stephen M. Scala>: Thank you. I have three questions. First, the R&D as a percent of sales in Q4 is the highest
it's been in at least a decade and higher than the YZ guidance and 2014 guidance. So what were the particular dynamics
around this spend in Q4? Secondly, assuming that Sanofi does sue Lilly in the next few days over the filing of the
insulin glargine biosimilar, do you believe that they will enjoy the full 30 months, or does Lilly believe a quicker
resolution can be gained? And then lastly, your comment about the blood levels of evacetrapib four to six weeks after a
discontinuation I guess was meant to contrast it with anacetrapib's very long half life. Other than some theoretical
concern about long half lives, what specifically should we be concerned with with anacetrapib? Thank you.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Steve, thanks for the questions. So for the R&D percent we'll have Derica provide comment
there. I'll go ahead and comment on the Sanofi question. Maybe we'll have Jan comment for the evacetrapib
accumulation comment from the call text. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Sure. Hi, Steve. Good morning. Hey, when we look at our Q4 spend we're very pleased with
how we came in. As it relates to R&D, that spend was driven by additional investments in our research as well as some
clinical development. And we did have the opportunity to make some incremental investments in the fourth quarter
both in R&D as well as in SG&A and some of that was also in preparation for the upcoming launches that we anticipate
later this year in 2014.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: And then Steve, this is Phil. For your question on Sanofi and whether – should they sue us
they would enjoy the full benefit of the 30-month stay. At this point it's premature to speculate on how that may play
out. We have, as is required, notified Sanofi of our acceptance of our filing with the FDA and that's where things stand
as of today. So there may be more developments in the future, but it'd be premature to comment at this time. Jan?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: Regarding the half-lives, we see this more as a general comment here that most medicines
on the market today of the category small molecules usually have a short half life, which is actually what you want
should there be any unforeseen side effects. And always when you do large Phase 3 clinical trials, this is an unknown
until you have all the data. So I think you should see this just as a very unusual situation that you have a small molecule
agent with this very long half life that anacetrapib has, and it remains to be seen now that if there are any side effects,
what is the consequences.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Thank you, Jan. Keliegh, next caller please.

We'll go to the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Oh, hi. It's Mark. Can you hear me? Sorry about that.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Yeah, we can.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Okay. Sorry about that. Hey, I just wanted to ask quick question on ramucirumab. The
second line lung cancer trial that's ongoing, our understanding is that a lot of those patients are Avastin naive in that
trial. Is that something that you could help us – that you could confirm or deny possibly? And then, what is the
hypothesis that ram may have a better risk benefit in the squamous population than Avastin? And then finally on
AWARD-6, is non-purity enough to maximize the potential of that product? And most importantly, congratulations to
Phil and Derica on your recognition in the [ph] II poll (25:18).
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Thanks, Mark. We aren't quite to the level of being inducted into the hall of fame yet, but
thanks for the shout. Hey, for the ramucirumab question, second line lung, Travis, you want to take a shot at that? And
then to Travis or Jan, if you want to comment maybe on the hypothesis of why ramucirumab may or may not be better
than Avastin in the squamous population. And then I'll handle the question that you had, Mark, on that non-inferiority
for dulaglutide.

<A - Travis Coy>: So, Mark, for REVEL which is our second line lung cancer trial with ramucirumab plus docetaxel, I
think you asked, and I'm going to make sure I get this right, if a lot of the patients are Avastin naive, so you're getting
to the point where we have allowed for some patients to be treated with Avastin. I would classify that as a small
number that – of patients that will be treated with Avastin in the first line.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. And any commentary on the hypothesis of why we may be better in squamous
relative to Avastin, Jan? Any thoughts on the two molecules?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: Again, we need to see the final data. And I can just refer to, as we have said before, that ram
and Avastin have different mechanisms of action. And ram does not only – interferes in a way then with the receptor
activation but it's also internalized as the receptor, whilst Avastin is only blocking one of the angiogenesis mediators.
But in the end, we need to see the data.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Yeah, and as we've talked about in the past, we've been very pleased that we saw
monotherapy efficacy in advanced gastric cancer, and then obviously reinforced with the combination efficacy that we
saw in that similar setting. But again, until we have the data from the other tumor types, it'd probably be premature to
comment whether the differences that Jan articulated will lead to either tolerability, safety or efficacy differences. And
we have no direct head-to-head as well, as a reminder.
For the non-inferiority for the AWARD-6 trial, this is a trial that is set up with the intent of showing non-inferiority.
We have received a number of investor questions and analysts' questions over the last month or so around whether
we're attempting to show non-inferiority or whether what we're really hoping and attempting to show is superiority.
And it is to show non-inferiority versus the highest dose in a forced titration trial of Victoza. There have been two other
competitor molecules that have run similar trials and have failed to show non-inferiority. We would definitely look at
showing non-inferiority to the high dose of Victoza as being a win and achieving our goals for that study. If we do
achieve non-inferiority we certainly will test for superiority, but it would not be our expectation that that would be a
high likelihood occurrence given the profiles of the two molecules as we know them.
<A - John C. Lechleiter>: I think the other – this is John Lechleiter – I think the other thing is just the presentation of
the product, the once weekly format, the straightforward nature of the injection, the injection device which many of our
investors were able to see for themselves when we had our meeting here in October. So I think having solid
non-inferiority data across the whole broad spectrum of comparators coupled with the product itself I think should give
us a leg up.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: And one of the main reasons for doing the study, Mark, was essentially from a pricing
reimbursement and access perspective. You might do your own research on price levels but essentially you've got a
price level in the marketplace, sort of base price level defined by BYDUREON, Byetta and the 1.2 milligram dose of
Victoza which means that the 1.8 actually carries to 50, 50% premium to that. So showing non-inferiority to that
particular dose we believe would place us in a good stead as we have those discussions with payers downstream.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Thank you.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: You're welcome. Keliegh, next caller, please.

We'll go to the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much. Two questions. First is on the CDK4/6 program. Can you just
talk a little bit more about the timelines in breast cancer here? I guess specifically once you start the Phase 3, how
quickly do you think you can enroll and see outcomes from your study? And while we're talking about that, can you
just also elaborate a little bit more on the impact you think an early Pfizer filing approval, if that happened, would have
on the competitive dynamics in this space?

The second question I had was on diabetes. We've seen some of these national formularies moving to a single covered
product in any given category, not just Tier 2 or 3, but a single product. Can you just give us what percent of market in
your view is impacted by those national formularies? And once a provider selects a preferred product, how difficult is it
going to be or would it be to displace that product once someone's gone through the effort of actually moving over in a
particular account, et cetera? I just want to understand competitive dynamics going forward as the trend plays through.
Thanks very much.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Thanks, Chris. So CDK4/6, you want to go ahead and start us off Travis?
<A - Travis Coy>: Yeah, so, Chris, unfortunately I can't directly answer your question because we have not yet
announced which tumors we'd be pursuing for Phase 3 development but do hope to – as I mentioned on the guidance
call in early January, I do hope to get you further data from both lung and breast from our kind of Phase 1b cohort
expansion that we performed as part of that trial in the first half of this year as well as announce which tumors we do
intend to take forward in Phase 3 in the first half of this year.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: And then on the diabetes questions that you had, Chris, so I don't think we have a percent of
covered lives that would be on national formulary for example, with someone like ESI, but it is only a portion of their
business for example. I guess maybe a better way to answer your question would be to point out that these more highly
controlled formularies are a minority of the business in the U.S. I think the best evidence for that is that you can look at
the last two, three years as you've seen some of these larger plans switch to sole source for one of the two insulins,
you've seen shares moderate maybe by a couple of percentage points in the overall market share for the mealtime
insulins. So again, these are sizable swings but it's not like you're having the majority of the market moving at any one
point in time.
In terms of switching, there certainly are difficulties in switching. I think payers from our experience don't do this
lightly. And I think they'd be unlikely over time to be switching every two or three years from one product to another.
We continue to think that having multiple products available in a class is in the best interest of patients and actually we
think long-term probably in the best interest of payers as well. So they can continue to have a competitive dynamic and
not have a significant amount of inconvenience for patients that they're trying to get into their plans as they make these
kinds of decisions. So we'll continue to, as we have in the past, argue for dual access among the various products that
we are involved in selling. And where that's possible, that's great. If not, then we'll have to make the decisions that we
need to make to have our products available to patients here in the U.S. market.

That will come from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. John, this is a question for you. You guys have been kind of quiet on the M&A front
whereas we've seen tremendous amounts of M&A across other sectors in healthcare. And I'm just wondering if you can
comment on your appetite for M&A. Lilly's been in rumors recently to be interested in an oncology company. Just talk
about the importance of M&A to achieving your goals and what specific areas you'd be interested in. And at the same
time, and your discussion about business development is – maybe if you could throw in there your views on Elanco and
how you see that business going forward if you would consider, as some of your competitors have done, spinning that
business out. Thanks.
<A - John C. Lechleiter>: Okay. Thanks, Jami, for the question. On the pharma side, we continue to have no appetite
for large scale M&A in the pharma business. If we were to undertake a smaller kinds of acquisitions, I think the best
way to think about that is, they would have to compliment or strengthen areas of focus, our current therapeutic areas of
focus, or provide us with additional coverage or leverage in key geographies. With respect to Elanco, I think we've said
that we intend to be buyers and not sellers in the animal health space. We've done more or less one or two acquisitions,
smaller acquisitions every year for the past five or six years. We've grown this business nicely over this period through

a combination actually of inorganic moves and organic growth. We're going be – continue to be interested in M&A in
the animal health area that helps us increase our coverage in the area of vaccines and also provide us with a greater
presence in some of the key emerging markets.
I will say obviously we completed our largest M&A in our history about five years ago. And based on the data we've
seen for ramucirumab and necitumumab that seems to be playing out quite well. And I'm also pleased that as we began
to exit this YZ period, we do so with a very strong balance sheet.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Thanks John. Keliegh, next caller, please.

We'll go to the line of Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: I have a few. Thanks, John, for that very clear description of M&A. If we were to think, for
John Lechleiter, if we were to think of 2014 as a year of [ph] decliffisation (35:15), which hopefully sets you up for
some nice growth for several years, based on sort of singles and doubles as the Street sees them, do you think there are
any other key shareholder value drivers that investors don't fully appreciate that perhaps are clear in your mind? My
other question is on ram. I know you're ready to launch ram in gastric as quickly after it happens. But do you think the
system's ready to provide access for docs to use the product in a broader patient population as is probably the case in
your market research? And then AWARD-6, what's the most granular timing you can offer? Phil, I'm sure some folks
will ask that after the call. Thanks.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Sure. So, John, you want to start out with the first question? Maybe Travis, answer the
question on ramucirumab, and I'll take the AWARD-6 timing question?
<A - John C. Lechleiter>: Okay, Gregg. I think first of all, while we intend to get back on a growth trajectory through
the launch of new products, I think that the fourth quarter with the 9% underlying growth in those products not affected
by – essentially other than the Cymbalta U.S. situation, I think augurs well for solid growth from this basket of
currently marketed products that we have. That's going be important to sort of underpin our launches in the years
ahead. We continue to do very well in Japan. I think our volume growth in Japan for the year was 13%. We're now
squarely in the top 20 in Japan. We continue to, on an annual basis to more or less lead that marketing growth across all
of our major competitors overall pharma and local Japanese companies.
In China, despite a slowdown we saw 12% revenue growth in China for the year. I continue to believe that emerging
markets represent a good investment for Lilly. And keep in mind emerging markets are a relatively smaller piece of
Lilly than they are many other companies. I think typically our larger competitors have about 20% of revenue in
emerging markets. I think we're closer to about 12%. I look at that as a key opportunity for growth.
We have a great business in Latin America, for example. We're expanding our presence in other countries where
traditionally we'd not had a presence there. So I think that's another area of interest. We talked about Elanco already.
We're very bullish on Elanco's prospects. We see good positive synergies between Elanco and Lilly. And yet we
believe Elanco has the operating independence that it needs to compete with new competitors that are reshaping
themselves. I think in terms of value creation, so we're launching a cancer drug hopefully this year and two drugs in
type II diabetes. Those are launching the infrastructures that are well built out. And so we've called that out to investors
but I think that's important to keep in mind.
The other piece is just the work we've done on infrastructure. This is a different company today than the company of
the last decade. We've had to prepare for this very, very difficult period, and we've made some choices. We haven't
wasted the crisis, as the old saying goes. So, we're more agile. We're leaner. I think we're better operators today. And I
believe that will help – that will pay off in terms of success of these launches that lie up ahead of us.

<A - Travis Coy>: Yeah, thanks, Gregg. With respect to your question on ramucirumab, obviously we're very pleased
that we now have two positive Phase 3 trials for gastric cancer. Look forward to receiving the regulatory action for the
REGARD submission in the U.S. by Q2 of this year, and then look forward to submitting the RAINBOW data to the
U.S. in the first half of this year. Outside of gastric cancer, clearly we're looking forward to getting the data from the
three ongoing trials that we have in second line lung, second line liver and second line metastatic colorectal cancer.
We'll look to use that data and obviously take that data onboard and expand that into potentially into further
development opportunities for ram. So we're very pleased with the process we have with ramucirumab and look
forward to getting those three data points on lung, liver and colorectal later this year.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: And I would think, Gregg, the strength of the data will likely also dictate not only
physician's interest in prescribing but also kind of access in the speed of access that we might be able to achieve. For
AWARD-6 timing, we would look to press release the top line results of this study. Although this is not sort of a
pivotal study for our registration submissions to regulators, we recognize that this trial is of high interest to the
investment community. So we do intend to have a top line press release, whatever the outcome is, and we would expect
from a timing perspective that that would be released, would be issuing here in the first quarter of the year and
hopefully have a chance if timing lines up, to present that data at a medical meeting in the middle the part of the year.

We'll go to the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes. Thanks very much. I have a couple of questions, please. First, maybe Derica you could
just talk about any wholesaler inventory changes of note in the fourth quarter and how you finished the year. And then
second, with respect to Alimta in the E.U., could you please discuss what we should expect from the appellate court
patent decision in terms of timing in 2014? And maybe you could just frame it for us, and I'm forgetting exactly which
countries this decision will apply to, but if you could discuss that. And I think that covers it. Thank you.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great Dave, thank you very much. Derica, on the wholesaler inventory?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Hi, Dave. Good morning. We did have in the U.S. some wholesaler inventory build. One other
phenomenon we did see also was that while there was building at the wholesaler level, we believe that there was a
depletion of inventory at the retail level. So long-term, we believe this year it'll work itself out and we're not concerned
about that build as we think about our 2014 outlook.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. And then on Alimta in the E.U., Dave, real quick summary of the landscape there. So
there's one action which you didn't ask about specifically but I do want to comment on which is the European Patent
Office where the patent itself had been challenged. You may recall that the initial hearing judgment went in Lilly's
favor, and that has now been appealed to the Board of Interferences within the European Patent Office. We still have no
date for that hearing. Separately from the proceeding with the European Patent Office, there are two countries that have
ongoing legal proceedings. The first is Germany, where I believe there's a trial that could come as early as March of
this year, and then the UK which is in April.
In the future, I think there will be a single European patent court to hear and decide cases more broadly across the
European Union. That's not the case right now, so the cases that would be heard in Germany and the UK would
explicitly apply to those markets, and then other countries based on those rulings would have to make their own
determination.
Keliegh...okay.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Just one quick follow-up. Could you just give us a framework for what percentage of the ex
U.S. Alimta sales come from the E.U.?
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Sure. I'll see if we can grab that here relatively quickly from the... secret book.

<Q - David R. Risinger>: The secret book.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Yeah. It's actually not too secret. You have this detail. If you've not been following us this
was a little bit quietly but in the October call – Q3 call, you may have seen that we expanded the disclosures for
product sales, breaking out international sales by the ACE region which is Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan and
emerging markets to respond to some requests that we had had to provide much more clarity around product sales, in
particular for Japan and emerging markets. Hopefully you find that of interest. I'm looking actually at the public book
now rather than the secret book. So in the fourth quarter, our international total Alimta sales were about $394 million.
About $235 million of that, Dave, came from the ACE region, the vast majority of which would have been coming
from Europe itself. And we had about another $90 million roughly coming from Japan and almost $70 million from the
emerging markets.

We'll go next to the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you. A couple of questions. On necitumumab, how confident are you that the
drug is approvable in lung now that you have positive results in hand, I think topline last fall? And what's the
development program from here? If you met with positive lung results you'd be pushing into broader development, but
I haven't heard you yet articulate what's next. Are you going to hold off doing anything until you see whether the drug
gets approved in lung? And second question on your two in-forms – novel basal and insulin glargine. Wondering if you
can characterize what you think the bigger commercial opportunity would be with either of those drugs when you look
out over say the next five years.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great, Tim. Thanks for the question. So in terms of the confidence in necitumumab being
approvable and then also thoughts on the development plan from here, maybe we'll start with Travis and Jan, if you
have any thoughts you'd like to add and then I'll comment on the comment you had on the opportunity with the two
basal insulins.
<A - Travis Coy>: Yeah, Tim. So it's Travis. I would say we were pleased with the top line results of improving
overall survival in frontline squamous non small cell lung cancer. Clearly squamous non small lung cancer has been
one of those more difficult diseases to treat say vis-à-vis non-squam. At this time, we are pleased with the risk benefit
profile we have and look forward to getting those more detailed detail in front of you at ASCO. With respect to next
steps, still under evaluation as to what next steps may look like for necitumumab development. So hopefully we'll have
more details to share later on that this year.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: And then, Tim, in terms of the two insulins, so with the insulin glargine product we see
ourselves very well positioned and one of the few companies that's well positioned to have success with this kind of
opportunity given the expertise we have in the space, the ongoing commitment to developing devices over time, strong
relationships that we have with physicians. We believe this is a very important opportunity for us to really begin to
establish a foothold in the basal insulin segment which we've really not been participating in up until this point. The
commercial opportunity for the novel basal insulin could be very substantial but it really will depend upon that clinical
profile that we see in the Phase 3 trials. There were some very encouraging signs that we saw in Phase 2 as we shared
with you at ADA and in subsequent meetings with the profiles that we saw for reduction in HBA 1C, the weight
profile, reduction in mealtime insulin usage relative to the current standard of care of basal insulin which, if these are
confirmed – if multiple of these are confirmed in the Phase 3 trials, could lead that product to have a very substantial
opportunity.

We've also been very clear that if this product does not differentiate substantially from Lantus it's probably more likely
than not that it would not be launched and not be a viable product and therefore our efforts would be focused really on
the insulin glargine product solely. So again, until we see the data it's very difficult to know. We do have trials for the
novel basal insulin that began to wrap up late last year with one of them; a number of them then over Q1, Q2 and Q3 of
this year. We would hope to have enough of those trials in-house probably by the middle part of the year to be able to
issue a top line press release updating all of you on the progress to date with those trials. So encouraged and anxious for
those outcomes. Stay tuned for a top line later this year.

We'll go to the line of John Boris with SunTrust Robinson. Please go ahead.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the results. Just on ramucirumab and
your filing in Japan, is it possible just to get an update on the timing of any additional work that needs to go on there
and the timing for the filing? And then secondly, a question for Jan just on the CDK4/6. There's a lot of pre-clinical
data out there, but what are the main features or advantages and benefits of your CDK relative to the other compounds
when you evaluate them and consider taking – when you consider evaluating to take it into Phase 3 development?
Thanks.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great, thanks, John. Travis, you want to start?
<A - Travis Coy>: Yeah, thanks, John. We do have a bit of an update versus the guidance I provided earlier this month
on the Japanese filing for ramucirumab, which again is to remind folks based on the RAINBOW data where we had
about a third of the patients were from Asian countries. So we look to be able to file that submission by the end of this
year.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Jan?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: Okay. So regarding CDK4/6 as you know, this is a very exciting area. And what we have
seen on our compound and in the initial clinical trials shows [indiscernible] (49:20) single agent activity which wasn't
really I think what Pfizer emphasized for their molecules. So here we see a potential efficiency benefit. But furthermore
we can do continuous dosing without interruption based on our safety profile. And there the Pfizer molecule had issues
and has to have intermittent dosing. And we believe that potentially to have a continuous coverage can gain efficacy.

timing of when those might occur now just that might lead to the trial or gain some data earlier than the 2016 timeframe
you mentioned? And the other one just on the autoimmune side. This might come up yet today but in terms of
baricitinib, just a status of how that, the Phase 2B study's going there. And if you could also talk about how you are
looking at making a decision there to move it into Phase 3. Is it separate from waiting to see the data on [indiscernible]
(50:33)? Or is there some – are you going to look to see how those stand against each other just given that bari's
partnered obviously with Incyte? Thanks.

We'll go to the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes. Good morning. You talked a little bit about the emerging markets. Can you talk about
some of the countries where you are making investments? And second, China seemed to slow in the fourth quarter, but
it did well throughout the year. So I was just curious is there anything – is there a new trend going on, was there
something that happened in the fourth quarter specifically? And if so, has it carried over into January? And then when
you answered the question about the biosimilar for Lantus before, I wasn't sure whether – did you confirm that you've
actually filed a Paragraph IV and notified the branded company? And then third just on diabetes, how do you see this
market playing out with respect to the SGLT2s and the DPP-4s? And are you hearing anything behind the scenes on
how INVOKANA is doing? And is the SGLT2s moving in front of DPP-4s as far as therapy? Thanks.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Mark. We'll have Derica answer the first question about emerging markets or
where we're investing and what we're seeing in terms of the growth in the fourth quarter, and then I'll take your diabetes
questions.
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Sure. Mark, in terms of the emerging markets as John indicated earlier, clearly China is a key
beachhead, at least for Lilly, within the grouping of emerging markets. But other markets such as Brazil, Mexico,
Korea, Russia, Turkey as well as India are key footprints for us as we think about leveraging some of the key
therapeutic areas that are doing well in those markets today which are diabetes and oncology, which obviously are core
to what we do. So we continue to see emerging markets as a strong opportunity for us.
And regard to your particular question around China itself, overall, we have seen the China market growth slowing.
Okay. So that is a fact that we're picking up. But it's still very robust when you compare it relative to the rest of the
world. So we don't see backing off our investment and our focus in that market. Another factor we believe is affecting
the growth in that market, at least in 2013, was the anti-corruption scandal that was going on there and was really
affecting primarily many of the multi-national big pharma companies there. Hopefully that will begin to subside as we
were closing out 2013, and we're not anticipating any significant lingering impact in 2014.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: And then, Mark, on your question for the insulin glargine product and the Paragraph IV
certification notification to Sanofi, we can't give specific dates, but in terms of process our 505(b)(2) filing did then
also include a Paragraph IV certification. Once it was clear to us that FDA had accepted our filing for review, that then
triggered our 20-day window to provide notice to Sanofi. And then once we provide notice to them, they have the
45-day period upon which they can initiate a suit. I think it's safe to assume that by the time we issued our press release
on December 20, saying that the FDA had accepted the filing for review, that it would have been around that kind of
timeframe that we would have made that communication to Sanofi. So if you're trying to figure out where we are in the
process, that may help you to titrate that timeframe down a little bit.
For the SGLT2, we've been actually quite pleased to see the kind of uptake that INVOKANA has experienced in the
U.S. marketplace in particular. There was a lot of discussion prior to the approval and launch of that product that many

observers were thinking this product class was not going have a significant adoption by physicians. So I think we're
pleased as observers who could be coming relatively soon with one of our own and also potentially the first to have a
combination product of a DPP-4 with an SGLT2. But there seems to be pretty good acceptance for this mechanism and
the efficacy, tolerability, safety profile that at least this first entrant carries. So we're looking forward to coming into the
marketplace ourselves as well. The DPP-4 market growth has slowed in part due to the uptake of canagliflozin. We do
expect long term that with the underlying demographics and market dynamics that you'll continue to see robust growth
in both of these areas of the oral diabetes class. So we're looking forward to participating in both these classes going
forward.

We'll go to the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. Following up on the SGLT-2s, are there
any updates on the implementing factoring issues you discussed on your last call? And when can we expect a
resolution? And also, you don't have the [indiscernible] (56:31) Phase 3 trials listed as external readouts. I'm wondering
if that's for competitive reasons or whether it's up to your partner? Thank you.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. So I'll take your questions, Alex. This is Phil. Make that the second one first. We
actually had many of those trials presented at ADA last year. That was sort of the big coming out party, if you will, for
the data from that Phase 3 program. Not all of the trials were presented there. So as we go through 2014, I'm sure we'll
have additional data presentations. But again, the bulk of that data was, in fact, presented at ADA last year. In terms of
the timing on the manufacturing issues, the re-inspection that BI will be having pursuant to their warning letter, there
are no updates at this point in time. As we mention on the guidance call, there is a re-inspection scheduled for the first
quarter, and we also, coming up in the not too distant future, have the potential action date for the submission that we
have for empagliflozin. So we will keep you guys appraised as the situation evolves, but there are no updates from
earlier this month.
Keliegh, next caller please.

We'll go to the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Oh, thanks very much. So I have a few questions. First, regarding peglispro, do you
have any new data either from Phase 3 or other ongoing studies in-house? And if so, do these data provide any greater
comfort around the liver safety of peglispro? Second on necitumumab, did the SQUIRE study include any pre-specified
bio-marker evaluations? And if so, could you just disclose what these pre-specified analyses were? Third on CDK4/6,
could you remind us the specific expansion cohorts that we'll see more data on this year? And maybe remind us the
percent of lung cancer patients that have KRAS mutant status? And then the last question is finally, can you just update
us on your plans for your TGF-beta in liver cancer, given some of the seemingly promising data that you presented at
ASCO GI I believe? Thanks.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Okay. We were furiously writing that down here so we'll see if we've got all these. So let me
start out start with the peglispro question. As I mentioned earlier, we have begun to have the first trial essentially wrap
up in that program. We won't provide a running commentary as each single trial comes out, as we've done for example
the with the dulaglutide trials where we waited until we had awards 1,3 and 5 before issuing a top line press release.
We'll be doing the same thing with the studies for the basal insulin peglispro. And then SQUIRE, this was are there
pre-specified biomarkers. I don't know, Travis, if you were able to find anything in our – we need to get back to you on,
Seamus, on the pre-specified biomarker question. I think there were some there but we don't have details with us. So

we'll follow up on that one. The CDK4/6, the expansion cohorts, do you want to comment on what those were Travis?
<A - Travis Coy>: Yeah. Those would be – we did expansion cohorts for a few tumors coming out of that Phase 1b.
Most prominently were breast and lung, but I believe there's a couple others, melanoma and potentially one other that I
need to follow up on, Seamus.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: And there's a question of percent of KRAS mutant. And Seamus, were you asking about that
with regard to colorectal or with regard to lung or what was your...? I missed the tumor type you were asking about.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: More with regard to lung.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Okay. We may need to follow up on that because I don't think we've got that data with us.
Jan, do you have anything on that one?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: No, I think I can just say that we have included the KRAS mutant as one potential
interesting area.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: And then the TGF-beta data presented as part of the recent medical meeting was definitely
very encouraging. The team is working through to what the next steps are for development of that molecule. And I
think I'll probably be later this year that we should hopefully have update for you on those plans.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Thanks, Seamus. Keliegh, next caller please.

We'll go to the line Jeff Holford with Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford, PhD, ACA>: Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just two questions around diabetes. First off if you
could just give us a bit more color on the pricing you've put through, any recent pricing increases across the insulin
portfolio, as well as just a cumulative last 12 month price increases you've had across the portfolio. Also just another
question around the insulin glargine product. I think I'm correct in saying you don't yet have a device that's public or
known of all use that is suitable for administering the basal insulin in terms of number of units that's required. We aren't
able to detect any patent applications for such a device. So maybe if you could just talk about that a little bit, where you
think you are and what's your long-term game plan with devices for the insulin glargine. Thank you.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Okay. So for the price increase piece you have – I don't think we have that with us. We can
follow-up, Jeff, after the call on the recent price increases. There were a couple of different price increases over the
course of 2013. I think the last one in December, but we can follow up with you with the specific numbers for those.
For the presentations we would use for commercialization of the insulin glargine product, we have not been specific on
our plans other than to state that we're definitely looking at multiple options. We also believe that we would be in a
position to commercialize that product upon expiration of the Lantus compound patent in early 2015.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford, PhD, ACA>: Thank you.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: You're welcome. Keliegh, next caller please.

All right. Great. Well, thank you very much for your attention on today's call. We appreciate your interest in Eli Lilly &
Company. Going forward, we'll continue to do what we did today and on our guidance call which is to exhaust the
questions in the queue. Hopefully you'll find that helpful to get your questions answered in a timely manner. We look
forward to interacting with you at upcoming meetings, conferences and keeping you appraised of our progress which
hopefully will be considerable this year in advancing the pipeline and beginning to launch new products to position
ourselves for growth coming out of 2014. Have a great day.
