Simon Ayat
Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings
per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.29. This is the highest earnings per share
for a quarter in the history of Schlumberger. It represents an increase of $0.14 sequentially, and it is $0.25 higher when
compared to the same quarter last year.
As a reminder, last quarter, we completed the wind-down of our operations in Iran and, as a result, this business was
classified as a discontinued operation. All the prior-period amounts have been restated.
Third quarter revenue of $11.6 billion increased 3.8% sequentially, with 7% growth in North America and 3%
international. As you will recall, from a financial reporting standpoint, we do not consolidate the OneSubsea joint
venture. As such, this was the first quarter we did not record any revenue from the Subsea business that we transferred
to the venture. Excluding this effect, revenue grew by over 5%.
Oilfield Services pre-tax operating income increased 9.6% sequentially, while the pre-tax operating margins improved
114 basis points to 21.5%. Sequential highlights by product group were as follows: Reservoir Characterization revenue
of $3.2 billion increased 7.3%, and pre-tax income grew by just over 8%. This resulted in margins improving to 30.4%.
This growth was driven by very strong international performances in both Wireline and Testing Services, most notably
in Russia. Improved vessel utilization at WesternGeco also contributed to the growth.
Drilling Group revenue of $4.4 billion increased 2.8%, and margin improved by 154 basis points to 20.3%. These
increases were largely attributable to the Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO on robust offshore activity.
Production Group revenue of $4 billion increased 2.5%, while pre-tax income increased 13.1%. This resulted in margin
expansion of 165 basis points to 17.6%. Excluding the effects of the transfer of our Subsea business to OneSubsea,
Production Group revenue grew by over 6%. This growth was led by Well Services on a strong recovery, following the
seasonal spring break-up in Canada last quarter. Increased activity for Completion & Artificial Lift as well as continued
increasing profitability in SBM were also significant contributors to the growth.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 22.7% in the third
quarter compared to 23.3% in the previous quarter, reflecting the business mix between North America and
international. The year-to-date effective tax rate for 2013 is 23.2%.
From a cash flow perspective, we have generated approximately $6 billion of cash flow from operation during the first
nine months of this year. This strong cash generation has allowed us to continue to invest in the growth opportunities
while, at the same time, returning over $2.7 billion of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock
repurchases during this period.
Net debt at the end of third quarter was $5.6 billion. This is unchanged from the end of Q2, despite the fact that we
spent $833 million on our stock buyback program during Q3. During the quarter, we spent $953 million on CapEx and
repurchased 10.1 million shares at an average price of $82.61. Total year for 2013 CapEx is still expected to be
approximately $3.9 billion as compared to the $4.7 billion spent in 2012.
And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard
Thank you, Simon. Our third quarter results continue to show good progress, driven by solid performance in both the
international and North American markets. Our strong focus on integration, quality and efficiency remains core to our
execution. And I'm pleased with the response we are seeing from our organization, in addition to the impact the efforts
are having on our results.

Sequentially, revenue grew by 4%, excluding our Subsea business which, in Q3, is included in the OneSubsea JV,
while margins expanded by 114 basis points to yield a 10% growth in pre-tax operating income.
Compared to the same quarter last year, pre-tax operating income was up 20%. New technology sales, coupled with
further market share gains, contributed strongly to the quarter's results. And this is also reflected in our revenue
indicator, which improved again sequentially.
The size and breadth of our operations and the quality of our execution allowed us to once again show widespread
consistency in terms of financial performance, with all four operating areas posting operating margins north of 20%.
In addition and for the second quarter in a row, we posted sequential incremental margins over 50%, while free cash
flow progressed from the already-solid levels of Q2 to reach $1.5 billion, driven by improving asset utilizations and
tight management of working capital.
Our international business continued to strengthen in the third quarter, with year-over-year revenue growth of 12% and
margin expansion of 134 basis points, to reach 23%. Sequential revenue growth was 3%, dampened by operational
delays in some regions but, for active management and disciplined execution, allowed us to generate 73% incremental
margins on this growth.
In spite of the operational delays experienced in Q3, we have not seen any structural changes to customer plans. And
we continue to maintain a positive outlook for our international business. In terms of pricing, we are not seeing any
signs of an inflection point. However, the current operating environment, with highly competitive pricing on basic
services and slow-but-steady activity growth where we can get a premium for new technology and for the quality of our
execution, suits us very well, as it plays to our strengths and allows us to continue to generate superior financial results.
In Latin America, revenue was up 1% sequentially, while margins were flat at 20.6%. The sequential results were
driven by strong performance throughout the area, with the exception of Mexico and Brazil, where continuing
challenges tempered growth. While we see the current headwinds reducing somewhat in 2014, we expect the situation
for our overall business in the region to remain more or less unchanged in the fourth quarter.
On a year-over-year basis and in spite of the ongoing challenges, revenues were up 4%, while margins expanded 273
basis points. In Mexico, revenue was down sequentially, driven by the completion of contracts in the north and lower
product sales offshore, which were only partly offset by the ramp-up of activity in the south. In spite of the challenges
we have faced in Mexico this year, we remain optimistic on the longer-term outlook for this market. And we are
actively positioning ourselves for the future opportunities.
In Brazil, revenue was also lower sequentially, due to the start-up of new contracts with Petrobas, as well as due to
lower activity for both independent and international customers. Based on the latest customer plans, we expect our
activity to remain flat in the country in the fourth quarter.
Elsewhere in Latin America, our business is progressing well, driven by Ecuador, where the Shushufindi project
continues to perform better than planned; by Argentina, where we are actively involved in the Vaca Muerta shale work;
and by Venezuela, where we are still ramping up activity following the signing of the payment agreement in the second
quarter.
In the Middle East & Asia, results were particularly strong, with sequential revenue growth of 5%, while margins
increased 151 basis points to 26%. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 25%, while margins were up by 330
basis points. In the Middle East, sequential growth was again solid in Saudi Arabia and Iraq, while the highest growth
rate was seen in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, where we also have very strong market positions.
We are currently in the process of transferring in additional people and equipment to Saudi Arabia to keep pace with
the additional work that we are taking on, while in the United Arab Emirates, we have just completed a large
mobilization linked to a recent major contract win.
Asia also posted strong sequential results, headed up by China, where conventional and tight cap activities on land were
the main drivers. We also signed our first SBM project in China during the quarter, and the team that will manage this

tight gas project in the Ordos basin will be on the ground in Q4.
Elsewhere in Asia, Indonesia and Malaysia also showed strong growth in the third quarter, driven by offshore
exploration and development work, while activity in Australia was flat sequentially.
In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue was up 2% sequentially, and margins increased 189 basis points. On a
year-over-year basis, revenues increased 7%, while margins were up 83 basis points. Russia was, again, a major driver
for our performance, posting a record quarter, with strong sequential activity growth as well as excellent incremental
margins. Our wide footprint in the region provides a solid foundation for our business, which is essential for addressing
such a large and diverse market.
The sequential results were driven by Russia land and Sakhalin on high exploration and development drilling. And,
going forward we continue to see Russia as one of our fastest-growing markets.
In the North Sea, sequential growth was driven by strong WesternGeco seismic activity and solid drilling activity,
Norway, while our UK business was impacted by summer rig maintenance. In North Africa, we had another
challenging quarter in terms of top line growth, due to operational delays in Algeria and continued security challenges
and lower rig activity in Libya.
In sub-Saharan Africa, activity was mixed as a result of project delays, linked to the influx of new rigs to the region.
Still, the overall activity outlook remains robust, as the surge of rigs into the market continues and as customers firm-up
exploration programs in frontier countries.
In North America, we had a very strong quarter, with revenue up 7% sequentially, to set an all-time high, and with
margins expanding by 57 basis points to reach 20.3%. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 9% and margins
were up 176 basis points. In the land market, the U.S. rig count remains flat sequentially, while the seasonal recovery in
Canada was more or less on par with last year.
The downwards pricing pressure continued in most product lines in the third quarter, including pressure pumping,
although at a slowing rate. Looking at our land performance, I'm very pleased with the quality and efficiency of our
execution as well as with the teamwork within our organization, which is a key driver for our results.
We have come a long way since we started the transformation of our North America land business three years ago, to
the point that we are now setting the pace in North America land, just as we do in the rest of the world, in terms of both
new technology deployment as well as financial results.
As an illustration of this, we activated four additional hydraulic fracturing fleets in U.S. land during the third quarter,
following a number of recent contract wins. As a result, our third quarter stage count increased by 7% sequentially.
Looking at the North America offshore markets, we also posted solid sequential growth, driven by new technology
sales and the quality of our execution. Offshore Eastern Canada, we successfully completed an isometric survey in
early September. And activity continued to be strong in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, with minimal impact from the
hurricane season so far this year.
Let's turn to technology where I will give you an update on our ongoing progress in the shale markets in North
America. Over the past 12 months, we have continued to actively promote our shale reservoir workflow to the market,
with a strong focus on optimizing both well locations as well as completion design. As part of these efforts, we have
introduced a data consortium business model where multiple customers with neighboring acreage can contribute
reservoir and production data and then co-fund field and well studies as well as the construction of 3D reservoir models
for the shale plays.
In return, each customer receives all the findings and conclusions from the consortium studies, in addition to the
reservoir model covering their acreage. We have so far conducted three such studies with very interesting findings and
conclusions. And these studies, together with our technologies and workflows, has helped to significantly improve the
well performance for the participating customers.

One major conclusion we have confirmed is that in order to optimize production, recovery and costs of the shale
developments, there is a clear need to shift focus from the level of a stage down to the level of the individual
perforation clusters that make up a stage.
The reason for this is that the studies, including production logs, show that in traditional completions on average
between 30 and 70% of the perforation clusters do not contribute to production. This means that we are not effectively
addressing the available shale reservoir throughout the entire length of a stage and that we generally over-fracture a
subset of the perforation clusters. Based on these findings, we are actively working on a number of technologies that
target this opportunity.
During the third quarter, we started field testing one of these new technologies, a novel solids-based diversion
technology. The diversion pill is added to the fracturing fluid at various times during the pumping of a stage, and this
effectively seals off the clusters that are currently taking frac fluid. This allows us to access the perforation clusters that
have yet to be properly fractured.
This new diversion technology has two primary applications. First, in improving production and recovery by ensuring
that more perforation clusters are accessed within a traditional stage; and second, in lowering completion costs by
increasing the length of a stage, thereby reducing the number of frac plugs installed and subsequently milled in the
well.
Diversion technologies are not new to the fracturing market. They have been around in the industry for a while, in
various forms, however, so far without showing tangible or consistent results. The novelty of our approach is in the
robust design and engineering of the diversion pill and the fact that field test results so far are showing very promising
results.
We plan to continue our field testing of this technology in the coming quarters. And in addition, we will also evaluate
the technology as a potential way to re-fracture existing wells that are under-performing in terms of production. In
parallel with our growing new technology penetration of the North America shale market, we have been gaining market
share in hydraulic fracturing in recent quarters at what we consider acceptable incremental margins.
These market share gains led us to activate the four additional frac fleets I referred to earlier in my comments. In terms
of the equipment, the four new fleets were mobilized from pumps made available from our existing fleets that are in
operation, due to steadily improving asset utilization and, hence, represents a zero net capacity addition to our field
operations.
This significant achievement is a result of ongoing R&D work, focused on improving the reliability, extending the
maintenance intervals and reducing the maintenance costs of our hydraulic fracturing fleet. The strategy driving these
R&D efforts has been to improve the design of the consumable part of our pump, rather than building a new pump that
requires additional capital investment. These innovations have already helped to improve reliability and reduced the
maintenance costs of our asset base.
Currently, only a subset of our fleet has been upgraded. But we expect that through our normal maintenance schedule,
we will have the entire fleet upgraded by the end of 2014. This upgrade will be fully covered through our ongoing
operating costs and involves no capital investments.
Let's now turn to the macro environment where we, in recent months, have seen a number of positive signs in the world
economy. The Eurozone is now out of its longest recession on record. The U.S. continues to show favorable trends, in
spite of the fiscal debate. And the most recent data from China suggests a lower risk of a significant slowdown.
Overall, these factors are offsetting lower growth expectations in some of the emerging economies. These trends are
currently expected to continue in 2014, translating into both a higher GDP growth rate and increasing global oil
demand compared to 2013.
On the supply side, spare capacity, including the shut-in production in Libya, remains stable at around 4.5 million
barrels per day. And even with an unlikely increase of Iranian crude exports in 2014, spare capacity will likely remain
in the range of 5 million barrels per day in the coming year. At this stage, we therefore expect continued support for

brand crude prices around $100 per barrel going into 2014.
However, the makeup of the risk premium is likely to shift somewhat, with lower supply uncertainty and potentially
lower geopolitical risk, offset by more resilient demand and lower macroeconomic concerns.
The international gas market is expected to remain stable, supported by strong demand in Asia, while in the U.S.,
resilient production levels and strong competition with coal indicates that a recovery in dry gas drilling activity
continues to be pushed out in time.
In terms of E&P spend, the second half of this year is unfolding in line with expectations. Visibility of 2014 is still
limited, as our customers are in their planning process. But at this stage, we foresee a continuation of the overall trends
seen in 2013, which should yield another year of steady activity growth.
In this environment, our entire organization continues to focus on both new technology sales and the quality and
efficiency of our execution. In parallel with our ongoing operations, we are actively pursuing our internal
transformation programs, focused on leveraging the size of our operations and the breadth of our offering, and with the
clear goal of further elevating our performance in terms of top line growth, margin expansion and cash generation.
That concludes my remarks. I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.
Malcolm Theobald
Thank you, Paal. John, we'll now open the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator instructions] We do ask, in your times, if you'd please limit yourself to one question and one
follow-up. First we go to James West with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Hey. Good morning, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning, James.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: So, Paal, clearly good, continuous, strong momentum in the international marks – and I
know you touched on kind of how the year should end up here and gave some broad guidance for 2014. I was hoping
could you dig in a little bit further on 2014 and just give us your view of – we had – obviously, we're going to have
strong growth this year, probably low double-digit growth internationally on E&P spending. Do you think that's going
to be steady, more of the same? Is it going to accelerate, or is there potential for some slowdown in the E&P spending?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, as I mentioned, James, in my prepared remarks, I think it's still early to comment on
specific numbers on what the international growth is going to be next year. But as I said, from where we stand today, I
think a continuation of the trends that we've seen this year is our most likely bet. That means reasonable growth in the
spend levels but that the market dynamics that we play in will continue to see steady activity growth but competitive
basic pricing. But as long as we can get a premium for new technology on the quality of our execution, we are
comfortable that we can continue to generate solid incremental margins without a inflection in the pricing.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Understood. Okay. And then just a quick follow-up for me on the international markets.
You mentioned Russia as one that looks to be good for 2014. What other kind of key large markets are you looking at
to drive this growth?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well I would probably name the same five as I've been talking about throughout this year. So
that's basically Russia, sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East, with a particular focus on both Saudi Arabia and Iraq. But the
UAE, we are also gained significant share in recent quarters. And I see the UAE also to be a strong growth driver in

2014. And then, in addition, China and Australia as we talked about, again, this year.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay. Great. Thanks, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.
Operator
And next we go to the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Yes. Good morning, Paal. So, Paal, I was just curious, your thoughts around the North American
market and your ability, as you said, to utilize your efficiencies to increase the number of frac crews operating. Was
wondering, what's your concept in terms of the implication? You already have 20% excess capacity of equipment, and
if you're getting more efficient in utilizing your existing assets in the marketplace, you think it takes a lot longer for the
supply/demand lines to cross with respect to frac?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well I can only speak for us. But I would say that we still have upside in terms of the
operational efficiency of how we conduct our business, which we show with the activation – or basically creation of
four additional fleets out of the existing asset base that is currently in operation. So yes, at least for us, I would say that
in general, it would take us most likely longer to consume the over-capacity we have, unless we gain significant share
to the point that we choose to activate some of the fleets that we have in the idle asset program as well. But as of now,
we are continuing to focus in on the operational efficiency of the assets we have in operation. And if we can get decent
incremental margins on additional work that we potentially take on, we will primarily look to create fleets out of assets
currently in operation before we look to the idle asset program.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: So from your standpoint, then, if I were to – and if I understand what you're saying correctly is
that irrespective of the excess capacity in the marketplace that may exist – that may continue to exist, given your
internal drivers, you feel very confident about your ability to get margin improvement?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well in the pressure pumping business, not dramatically, right, because pricing is actually still
going down. But as long as we can offset that with new technology and operational efficiency, there is potential to get
some improvement in margins in pressure pumping. But obviously, what helps our margins as well is the strong
offshore business and also a good drilling and characterization business on land, where the pricing pressures have been
less than what we've seen in the pressure pumping.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. Great. And then my follow-up question would be, in the context of the level of optimism
that you expressed in your commentary here on the call and in the written commentary, how do you feel about the
progression from an earnings standpoint? I think the Street has tended to get out in front of itself a little bit too much
and put you guys in a tough position where you had to talk numbers down. How do you feel about the earnings
progression as it sits right now as you head into 2013 and, even more importantly, into 2014?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well if we start looking at Q4 first, as you know, we do not give guidance. But I would say a
couple of things about the fourth quarter. Firstly, that the fundamentals of our business remains intact going into Q4.
But there are some seasonal effects that I think everyone should factor in. On the negative side of these effects is that
we are likely to – or we will see seasonal slowdown in some of our highest-growth markets this year, such as Russia
and China, which will have an impact. We'll see the normal seasonal slowdown in marine seismic. And we also expect
to see some impact from the holiday season in North America. While on the positive side, we have the year-end
product sales, which will offset some of this. But overall, if I look at where the current consensus for Q4 is now, I
would say it's about right.
Now looking into 2014, obviously, very early to look at specific EPS targets, other than that, again, the fundamentals of
our business remain strong. And our overall target is going to be to continue to deliver double-digit growth in earnings
per share, and that will be for the fourth year in a row.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question's from David Anderson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Anderson>: Thanks. So, Paal, you've been highlighting the new efficiency and reliability efforts that
you've been implementing throughout the organization. I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit about how this
has already attributed to margin improvement? Specifically just looking at Europe, Africa, CIS margins the last two
years have gone from mid-teens to low 20%s now. Middle East margins has kind of took a step up. Could you talk a
little bit about how much of that was due to these – these efficiency efforts that you have in place? And how much is
left in there, do you think, over the next couple of years?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well I would say that the progression we have shown in these operating areas over the past
year is partly down to very strong management focus on managing both working capital and costs in general so that on
basic activity growth, without pricing, we can generate quite significant incremental margins. So our transformation
programs are looking at some structural changes to how we are set up and how we conduct and run our business.
I would say that there's not a significant part of these structural changes that have taken place so far. So a lot of what
we are doing now is just managing with particular focus on driving both cash flow and incremental margins and that,
over time, we will see more of the impact of these structural changes as part of the transformation. So there's little
structural changes impact on our results as of yet.
<Q - David Anderson>: So in other words, even without pricing, you should still see margins continue to improve in
the eastern hemisphere?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well that's what we want to work towards. Yes.
<Q - David Anderson>: Right. Okay. On the U.S. side, I was just curious, you talked a lot about the technology and
particularly on the perforation clusters. I think in the release, you had talked about Whiting. I was just curious if you
could kind of compare and contrast the E&Ps versus the majors in the resource plays that you're working in? Seems to
us like the E&Ps are a lot closer towards the true development phase, whereas the majors are a little bit further behind.
I'm just curious in terms of the technology that you're talking about. Are we talking more of your customer base on the
E&P side? Or are the majors sitting back watching and then will implement this later? How do you see this playing
out?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well I think, generally, we talk to all our customers about these things. So I don't see a huge
difference between what the independents do and what the IOCs do in this market space, right? I mean it's all about the
acreage, the challenges and the main focus and priorities that they have. So we are openly discussing the whole range
of capabilities and new ideas and innovations that we have with all our customers. And I can't really separate, I would
say, who is doing what. I think they're all eager to look at what can be done better. And the way they implement things
obviously varies, depending on what their priorities are.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. Thank you.

And next we go to Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Thank you. Good morning. Back to your margins, Paal, for a second, and your internal
transformation. So I was struck by the fact that sort of the breadth and sweep of the internal transformation with regard
to structural change, which you're trying to prosecute. And I mean this is the second consecutive quarter that you
generated incremental margins in excess of 50%. And yet you say, thus far, that has very little to do with the internal

transformation that you're trying to prosecute?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: In general, yes. We are always doing pilots. We are trying things out at a small scale in various
places around the world, but that's – and it's still in its early phase. So yeah, there has not been significant structural
changes as to how we operate our international business. Obviously, in North America, we started our transformation
about three years ago. So a significant part of the structural changes have already taken place there. But in the
international business, no, there has not been any significant impact of structural changes yet.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Okay. And I think you mentioned that one of your objectives along with these internal
transformational initiatives was to get back to prior-cycle peak consolidated operating margins which, I think, were
something like 26% or 27%, thereabouts. You're at 20% today on a consolidated basis. Over what timeframe should we
expect that evolution to take place, roughly?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I'm not going to give you a timeframe here. I mean we have a horizon of these
transformation objectives of plus/minus five years. Exactly when we're going to hit – or if we're going to hit these
targets is too early to say. But we set out quite an ambitious target, and that is to get back to previous-cycle operating
margins. And I'm still optimistic and relatively confident that we're going to get there.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Okay. And last one for me. Recently, Total came out at its Analyst Day and announced a fairly
significant reduction in capital spending over the next two years and we've so talked about this before. I mean the [ph]
IOCs in deepwater (34:16), NOCs are cash flow constrained and – on the one hand and opportunity rich on the other
hand. So two questions in that particular regard. One, the outlook for seismic; and two, the outlook for deepwater
capital spending in terms of rate of change going forward.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well that's a lot of questions wrapped into one, but I'll start off with the seismic. So maybe I
say a little bit about our seismic results in Q3 and then on the outlook. And then we can go onto the next part of your
question, right? But Q3 results for us were solid. Multi-client was down a bit, about 9% sequentially, which was line in
with our expectations. In marine, we had a good quarter, as expected, fully booked, good pricing from the new
technology. But really no further traction on basic pricing. And also, on land, we have a very good quarter. We have
restructured our land business over the past year, focusing now entirely now on our – on [ph] unique (35:16), deployed
in Middle East and North Africa. And we are now generating very solid operating margins on land, which is a long
time since we've done it.
Now in terms of the outlook for seismic, as you can see from our disclosure, our backlog is now at $856 million, which
is down 12% year over year. But this backlogging includes all four parts of our business; the marine, the land, the data
processing and the multi-client. So actually, the main driver for the year-over-year drop in the backlog is actually land.
And that's basically due to the fact that we have downsized our business and focusing more narrowly on [ph] unique
(35:52) and Middle East and North Africa.
So the marine backlog was slightly up year-over-year, but the visibility on Q1, Q2 is lower than what we have at the
same stage last year. It doesn't mean that there are not service out there, but our customers are now in their planning
cycle. And they have been reluctant to make early commitments as to the service that they have on the table.
So I would say that we basically expect to gain to further visibility on marine seismic activity during the fourth quarter,
so there is a bit of uncertainty over that as of now. But I can't really conclude what that's going to mean for next year.
So overall, the outlook for seismic, for data processing land and multi-client looks solid, with some lower visibility on
marine.
Now in terms of deepwater, we're still quite, I would say, bullish and optimistic on deepwater. There are a number of
new rigs coming into the market in Q4 and also going into 2014. And that's going to drive deepwater spend in 2014. So
we're still optimistic on deepwater.

Our next question's from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Yeah. Thanks for that. Paal, I wonder whether you could elaborate a little bit more on what you
said on efficiencies in the North America pressure pumping market. Your pitch sounded a little bit increased
productivity from the well in reducing the number of [ph] status (37:16) needed. It sounded pretty much like the picture
on introduction of HiWAY a little while back. Is there something more than HiWAY gaining foothold?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah. I think HiWAY's one – is one technology that obviously has applications in the market.
As I've been saying over the past year or so, we continue to work on other technologies as well. So there is – while
HiWAY increases conductivity in the fractures that we create, this new technology I talked about today, the diversion
technology, has a different objective, which is basically to ensure that we access all the perforation clusters along the
horizontal section, which the industry basically today does not do. So it's another technology which, in conjunction or
in parallel with HiWAY, can help drive production and reduce costs.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay. Thanks for clarifying. Also, on Framo, well, did you account for anything at all this
quarter? Or is it the one-quarter delay on how you report the equity income?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Simon, you...
<A - Simon Ayat>: Ole, Simon here. We reported on one-month lag. But it is – we didn't report anything during this
quarter from Framo. So...
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay. So that should have added a couple of cents?
<A - Simon Ayat>: Quarter to quarter, it's basically in the Q2, we have Framo. And in the third quarter, it is part of the
venture. And it will be reported by the OneSubsea, as they consolidate in Cameron.

Our next question's from Angie Sedita with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Morning. On the North America markets, clearly, your strengths in technology and execution
have led to very impressive efficiencies. And you noted the deployment of additional frac crews in the U.S. Do you
think – on existing equipment and not using capital, which I think is very interesting – do you think you will be able to
continue this in 2014 where, in essence, you're adding additional frac crews into the market without adding any – or
unstacking any capacity or adding any capital?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah. We don't plan to add any capital in 2014, based on where we stand now. So if we – it's
all going to be a function of the amount of work that we will win. And the first priority will be to try to address that
work through the equipment we already have deployed. And beyond that, we are prepared to activate assets from the
idle asset program, if we cannot address the work with the assets already in operation. But I think there's still upside in
terms of the efficiency and utilization of the assets we already have in operation.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Great. Fair enough. As then as a follow-up to that, clearly, you're seeing significant efficiency
gains through execution on the pressure pumping side. Are there other product lines outside of pressure pumping that

are particularly apt to be able to drive additional product efficiencies through execution? Or are there specific regions
that you think you could see more of it as you go into 2014 internationally?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well internationally, we continue to drive efficiency throughout our operations, right? There is
no one item that I think would single out. I think every product line that we have, all 15 of them, have specific
programs and targets where they drive both the efficiency of our workforce as well as the utilization of our assets in all
aspects of our operations. So that's a key part of what you see in terms of the incremental margins that we are
generating in the international market.

And we'll go to Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I just had one question as it relates to your longer-term outlook
on Brazil. I know you hadn't always felt like this would be kind of a transition year in the country. And you remarked
4Q, you see activity flat versus third quarter, which was down. Can you just give us your more longer-term thoughts on
Brazil as a whole and how we should expect about that unfolding for Schlumberger here next year?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah. I would say that our view on 2014 overall in Brazil is that it's going to be another
challenging year. And it's mainly down to the activity levels that we see at this stage, which is relatively flat from
where we stand now. That's a function, obviously, of what Petrobas is planning to do. But also, there is some impact in
this, in lower activity projected for both the Brazilian independents as well as on the IOCs in Brazil in 2014.
2015 is likely to be higher, when the exploration work linked to the last license round is likely to kick in. But the
majority of the activity in Brazil next year for us is going to be centered around Petrobas, who are not looking to
significantly grow activity, at least from what we can see at this stage.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. And for you, you feel like you're pretty well balanced in terms of service and
equipment capacity in Brazil?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yes. We are well set up in Brazil. We have a strong focus on both quality and efficiency and
also introduction of new technology for these long-term contracts. So I'm comfortable with our position and our set-up
in Brazil. It's challenging, but we are executing well.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. That was it for me. I'll turn it back. Thank you.

Our next question's from Michael Lamotte with Guggenheim.
<Q - Michael Kirk Lamotte>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow up, Paal, on the transformation
program and, in particular, ask you about some of the metrics we can be looking at over the next five years. We tend to
focus on top line growth and incremental margins. And obviously, the margins should improve. And you've given some
good guidance there. But if I think about capital efficiency, can you give us some sense as to where you think ratios
such as reinvestment rates, CapEx to revenue, asset turnover, some of the key utilization metrics that might better
reflect the doubling of asset utilization on some of the other elements of program?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah. I mean I would reiterate the main indicators that I gave you during this talk in this
conference in Q3. We are aiming at doubling asset utilization which, by itself, means we should be able to reduce the

CapEx relative to activity in terms of growth going forward. So I'm not going to give you a specific CapEx as a
percentage of revenue, other than that we reduced CapEx in 2013, while we were still growing. And my initial, I would
say, indication for 2014 will be flat to slightly down on CapEx. And that is assuming that we are still going to grow in
2014. So the folks in asset utilization should help us to reduce CapEx relative to growth going forward.
<Q - Michael Kirk Lamotte>: Okay. And then one other point on the financial focus areas. You mentioned
cross-training of the workforce, particularly in remote areas. I'm wondering what that means in terms of new
recruitment and thinking about cross-training of existing employees as opposed to the recruitment program, university
program, et cetera, and overall head count growth.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Right. So we are not looking in the near term to change significantly the level of recruiting
because this whole cross-training and ensuring that we got proper competencies for the people that we do cross-train is
going to take a little bit of time. So in the near term, there's no change or no significant change to the level of recruiting
that we're planning to do.

And we'll go to Brad Handler with Jeffries. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Good morning.
<Q - Brad Handler>: I guess, Paal, in your comments, you've spoken optimistically bullishly about deepwater
development. I understand that, and we're looking at the rigs coming in and perhaps thinking similarly. I guess I'm
curious if you have pause related to a couple of the events that seem to be at least percolating, I guess, I'll say
anecdotally, which is in the Gulf of Mexico, a bit of swapping out of new in place of older rigs, even if they're still
deepwater, even if they're still DP. And then perhaps in West Africa and Angola and Nigeria, what seems like it's a bit
of a backlog in terms of getting some of those new rigs signed and under contract.
So I guess I'm curious for your thoughts about that and if – I imagine you're calibrating that into your comments. But I
guess I'm curious if that gives you pause, if there's an element where you're a little less encouraged, perhaps, because of
those kinds of developments.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well I'm aware that some of the new arrivals that are coming into the market in 2014 still do
not have contracts. But based on what we're hearing from the drilling contractors, they appear confident that these rigs
are going to get contracts by the time they arrive.
To the other point that you're making, maybe some of the older-generation rigs will be replaced by the newer
generation. But either way, we have a positive view on the market. There was significant growth in deepwater drilling
activity in 2011, and we expect the continuation of that trend into 2014.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Fair enough. Okay. An unrelated question. You mentioned in your – the written commentary
about Statoil, a couple of nice, multi-year contracts, I guess, on the fluid side as well as cementing. I think that there are
one or, if not, more of those contracts still outstanding. I wonder if you could speak to us about the lay of the land
there; if you expect there are some awards that might still come. And if you can at all calibrate if – the implications for
you, given the fact that you've won the ones that you've announced.

And we'll go to Robin Shoemaker with Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Thank you. So, Paal, could you give us a idea now of what percentage of your fracturing
stages are employing the leading-edge technologies such as HiWAY and this recent innovation that you mentioned on
the diversion of perforation clusters? I mean what kind of percentage are we talking about here of total stages fracked?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: So we haven't disclosed what percentage of our stages are done with HiWAY. The only thing I
would say is we have seen continuous growth in HiWAY stages throughout this year. And the year-over-year growth is
very significant as well. So we continue to penetrate the market on HiWAY, but we haven't been disclosing what
percentage of our own stages we are doing HiWAY on.
And on the other technology I referenced, this is a technology that is in field test, so it is very limited what the
deployment is. And it's not yet commercialized. So I would say that this is something that we're trying out. There's still
a fair bit of field testing done before we are potentially going to commercialize it. But I wanted to share with you this
technology because it is interesting, and the early field test results are showing great promise.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Okay. And so staying on that theme, you had mentioned in some of your earlier kind of
outlines of the evolution of HiWAY and other fracking technologies that you could eventually come to a point where
you might not be necessarily providing the fracturing fleets, themselves, but more providing the technology for the
fracking operations. How far have we advanced toward that possible goal? And is it in the foreseeable future?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: What you're referencing is what we call the SPARK model. This is basically where we provide
the fracturing fluid, the engineering, the blending, while we have a third party providing the horsepower. So we have
deployed this business model with a number of customers who are vertically integrated in North America. But the
overall business volume is – I would say is not significant, but it's continued to grow this year from where it was last
year when we introduced it. And similarly, we have also deployed this business model for part of our operations in
China.

North America where HiWAY has had the best penetration? And could you outline which ones are those?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah. I would say the basin where we have had the most success and where the penetration is
the deepest is in the Eagle Ford. So we have a significant number of wells and stages done there over the past couple of
years. And also, I think, a fair bit of data indicating the results that HiWAY can bring, both in terms of higher
production and recovery and lower cost in terms of pumping less proppant.

<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Is it something to do with the geology of the basin or the structure of the formation? Or this
technology's applicable in – or effective in every basin?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, in generally, we believe it's applicable in every basin. I think what you find is that there
are two main applications of HiWAY. One is to increase conductivity, so you thereby increase production and
recovery. And the other one is that you reduce costs because in general, we pump about 40% less proppant per job,
which is a cost saving.
So what we found is that in the Eagle Ford, we have both a significant production and recovery increase, together with
the cost savings. While the production increases, we have not seen the same level of production increases in some of
the other basins, which is partly down to the geology, as you reference it, right?
But in general, we have not seen – we have always seen, I would say, flat or higher production. And we generally
always see lower costs. So it's just a matter of the technology uptake, taking a bit of time when you look at a large
market like North America land.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Sure. And then just on – in terms of your efficiency improvements, how they're having an
impact on the margins. Could you quantify for us what the margin impact has been in North America because of these
efforts? And if you didn't have those efforts where the margins would have been?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well I can't really give you a number on that, right? I mean the efficiency improvements going
all the way back three years to when we started restructuring the land business is obviously a key part of the
performance that we continue to post quarter after quarter. But at the same time, we have a very strong offshore
business, both in the Gulf of Mexico and Eastern Canada. And we have a very strong business in Alaska. So it's a
combination of everything. Where we needed to improve the most, going back three years, was in North America land.
And there's been a significant improvement there. But at the same time, we have continued to progress on our offshore
and high-end business as well.

And we'll go to Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Paal, geographically, in product lines, when your incrementals are through the roof – and
that's fabulous – where geographically and what product lines typically generate the highest incrementals?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well I think if you're talking international market, I think we had great results basically in all
regions. I would say take away Latin America at this stage in terms of incrementals, right? We managed to keep
margins flat in Latin America in a very challenging business environment and mainly driven by the headwinds or
challenges in Brazil and Mexico, while the business in the other countries in Latin America progressed very well. So
the incremental margins were driven by ECA and the Middle East and the Far East.
In terms of product lines, obviously, characterization continues to do well. I mean their incremental margins were not
that high this quarter, but they've been progressing very well year over year and so far this year. But both drilling and
production continues to do very well. So I can't really single out one specific product line internationally, other than
that all of them are doing very well. And together, they come together extremely well.

And we we'll go to Holm Turner (sic) [Turner Holm] (55:45) with RS Platou Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Turner Holm>: Yeah. Hi, guys. Just had a question on the operational delays you had mentioned in this quarter.
It sounds like much of that came in offshore Africa. I was just curious if you could give us a bit more color on that.
Was it delays in new-builds coming out of the yards, or was it more on the operator side? And related to that, do you
think you can get most of that work back in 4Q and, if so, maybe see a bit stronger sequential progression that you
would typically expect seasonally?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well I think the Q3 operational delays was really the sum of all the things you mentioned.
Some of the rig delays coming from the yards. Then you got to commission them and get them started up, and then it's
getting everything ready from the customer side to start operations, right?
So no one thing impacting it, but there was a significant planned influx of rigs. And there were delays with several
aspects of it, which is not uncommon for these type of markets.
In terms of Q4, there will be some improvement in Q4. But I think it's go into Q1, Q2 before everything is ironed out.
<Q - Turner Holm>: Yeah. Okay. All right. And just to change gears a little bit. I was just wondering if you could
comment on the growth in the Arctic market. There's a lot of things going on there. You have Exxon/Rosneft kicking
off a German campaign. In the Kara Sea next year, there's increasing activity in the Norwegian side of the Barents and
talk of doing some work on the Russian side. And of course, there's Cairn in Greenland and also some Alaska work. So
just curious if you can talk about the opportunity in the Arctic in terms of service intensity and sort of your expectation
for how quickly that market can become significant for Schlumberger.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: That's a good question. I think we see Arctic as a interesting market and a good opportunity
going forward. We are, I think, very well positioned to take part in that, in particular, in Russia. We are already
involved in one Arctic project there, [ph] Predazumia (57:39). At the same time, we're also actively pursuing the other
projects that are coming up, both in, like you say, Greenland as well as other places in Russia and North America and
Norway. So in terms of overall impact on activity, I think it's going to take a bit of time before it becomes really
material. But there is a significant potential there that we are going to actively position ourselves to take part in.
<Q - Turner Holm>: Okay. Thanks. And last little thing is your two largest competitors talking about 10% E&P
spending growth next year in North America. Would you echo that sentiment? And if so, just curious if your position in
the Gulf of Mexico would give you the expectation that you might grow a bit faster than whatever the E&P spending
comes in, in North America next year.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah. Like I said earlier in my prepared remarks, I think it's too early to comment on specific
growth numbers for any parts of the world next year, given the fact that our customers are still in their planning cycle. I
am optimistic, though, that we'll see growth in North America in terms of spend next year and potentially higher than
what we saw this year. But beyond that, I'm not ready to give you a number at this stage.
<Q - Turner Holm>: Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. I'll turn it back.
