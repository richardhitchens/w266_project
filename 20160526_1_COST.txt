MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Karen, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I
would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any
background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn today's call over to Mr. Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Galanti, you may begin.
Richard A. Galanti
Thank you, Karen, and good morning to everyone.

actual results, events and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and
uncertainties include but are not limited to those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to
time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of

Last night's press release reported our third quarter and year to date fiscal 2016 operating results for the 12-week and
36-week periods that ended this past May 8. For the quarter, our reported earnings per share came in at $1.24, up 6%
over last year's third quarter earnings per share of $1.17.
In comparing our third quarter results year over year, there are a few items of note. As usual, FX. As compared to a
year ago during the quarter, the foreign currencies in the countries where we operate weakened overall versus the U.S.
dollar, primarily in Canada, Mexico and Korea. This resulted in our foreign earnings in Q3 when converted into U.S.
dollars for reporting purposes being lower by about $15 million or $0.03 a share than they would have been, had the

various foreign exchange rates versus the dollar been flat year over year.
Gross margins; on a reported basis it was higher by 34 basis points. This included a $19 million benefit from
non-recurring legal settlements. This represented seven basis points of margin improvement or about $0.03 a share.
Number three, our co-branded credit card transition in the United States, with the transition to our new co-branded Citi
Visa card next month, co-brand AmEx credit card sign-ups stopped as you know late last calendar year, I think in
October, November. The short-term negative earnings impact of the lost co-brand credit card sign-ups in the quarter –
year over year was about $11 million or $0.02 a share to the negative. We expect to have the new co-brand Visa cards
in the hands of our members by the end of the May, early June. Some of you may have already received them in the
mail, with a go-live transition date of Monday, June 20.
Number four, wages. As I mentioned on second quarter's earnings conference call back in March, in addition to what –
we do a top-of-scale increase each year which we generate, again have done every year, each March. This year we also
increased our bottom-scale hourly rates in the U.S. and Canada which is about 80% of our company. Effective this past
March 14th, we increased our starting wage $1.50 an hour to $13 an hour and $13.50 an hour.
The new bottom-up scale wage increase result in a year-over-year incremental payroll expense of about $6 million or
$0.01 a share in the quarter. We estimate that this will be anywhere from $0.01 to $0.02 a quarter in each of the next
three quarters depending on which way it rounds.
Number five, IT modernization. IT modernization efforts negatively impacted SG&A expenses in Q3 on an
incremental year-over-year basis by about $16 million, which is about five basis points or $0.02 a share to SG&A. I
believe in first and second quarters this year that year-over-year delta of modernization expense was seven basis points
to negative in Q1 and three basis points in Q2, so it looks like it's averaging around five basis points a quarter for the
first three quarters of the year.
LIFO; this year in Q3 we picked up a little bit there from the LIFO credit. We recorded a pre-tax LIFO credit of $13
million in the quarter. Last year it was also deflationary, but as you know, deflation has continued, was $7 million. So
again about a $6 million or $0.01 a share delta there. Those are the items I'd point out.
Turning to our third quarter sales, total reported sales, as you know, were up – as reported was up 2% and our 12-week
reported comp sales figure was flat or 0%. Sales of course were negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation. That
was almost two percentage points impact, about 190 basis points and by the weakening foreign currencies relative to
the dollar that I just mentioned. That was about 145 basis points.
So excluding gas deflation, the flat U.S. comp number we reported would've been a plus 3%. In Canada, the plus 1%
reported Canadian comp would've been a plus 8% in local currency excluding gas deflation and flat FX rates. And the
reported minus 2% other international, excluding gas deflation and excluding flat year-over-year FX, that would've
been a plus 3%. So all told, our reported 0% comp for the quarter; ex-gas and ex-FX, would've been a plus 3%.
In terms of new openings in the quarter, we opened seven locations and also completed one relo. So year to date, for
the first 36 weeks, we've opened a total of 19 new warehouses and three relos. For all of 2016, we have a current plan
of 29 net new locations; a little over two-thirds of them, 21 will be in the U.S., two in Canada, two in Japan and one
each in the UK, Taiwan, Australia and Spain.
This morning I'll also, of course, review with you e-commerce activities, membership trends and renewal rates,
additional discussion about margins and SG&A in the quarter and a couple of other items. So going down the P&L,
again for sales. Sales were up 2% on our report. Total sales were up 2%. Reported comps flat, reported up 3%,
excluding gas and FX. Now the zero flat comp on a reported basis, was a combination of an average transaction
decrease of a little under 3%, at minus 2.7% on a reported basis. And again, ex-gas and ex-FX, the average transaction
increase would've actually been up 0.5%. The average shopping frequency increase was up 3% for the quarter, which is
most of February, all of March, all of April, and a little of May.
In terms of sales comparisons by geography. In the U.S., Texas, Midwest, and Southeast regions were the stronger
ones. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Mexico, Canada, and the UK. In terms of

merchandising categories for the quarter, within food and sundries which was overall flattish year over year, sundries,
foods and meat deli were the leaders. Tobacco, as I think we mentioned a little bit on the April sales call, was negative
in the low-teens as we continue to eliminate tobacco from various locations.
For hardlines, overall in the mid-single digit. The departments with the strongest results were sporting goods, toys,
seasonal, automotive, consumer electronics, and garden patio. I think I'll have to go look at what was down because
those are all pretty big departments within hardlines. Within low to mid-single softline comps, single-digits softline
comps, small electrics, men's apparel, and home furnishings were the standouts. And lastly, in fresh foods, comp sales
overall in the low-single-digits. Produce and deli showed the best results. Of course, we probably had the most
deflation, I think, in the meat, poultry and pork areas. In the U.S., we continue to see deflation in the low-single-digit
range for food and sundries, and as I mentioned fresh foods, and a little in some of the non-foods areas as well, notably
electronics.
Moving down the income statement, membership fees came in dollars were up 6% and up seven basis points as a
percent of sales, coming in up $34 million from $584 million last year to $618 million. Again, FX currencies' exchange
rates impact this number. Without FX, we're assuming flat year over year effects, the $618 million would've been up $7
more million and so the 6% dollar increase year over year would've been up 7%; same number of basis points of course
up seven basis points.
In terms of renewal rates, we continue strong renewal rates, 90%-plus in the U.S. and Canada, 88% worldwide.
Continue increasing penetration to effective membership and I'll talk about that in a second. New member sign-ups in
the quarter company-wide were at 15% year over year, in part driven by strongest sign-ups in our new openings in
Taiwan and Japan, the Asia openings always have outsized new sign-ups. We also had very strong sign-ups in Tulsa,
for that matter. Overall in the U.S., in fact, it was up 15% as well. In terms of number of members at third quarter end,
Gold Star was 36.2 million, up from the 12 weeks earlier at 35.4 million. Primary business, the same at 7.2 million.
Business add-on, the same at 3.5 million at the beginning of the end of quarter. So all told, 46.9 million member
households versus up 800,000 members from 46.1 million at Q2 end. Total cardholders are 85 5 million, up 1.5 million
from 84.0 million of the second quarter.
I mentioned executive memberships. We came in at the end of Q3 with right at 17 million executive members which is
increase of actually 402,000 members over the 12-week period or 33,000 members a week increase in the quarter. I
think that tends to be on the high end of that kind of weekly increase in many of the last recent quarters. Executive
members are approximately 36% of our member base and about two-thirds of our sales, and again continues to improve
its penetration.
In terms of renewal rates, numbers were 94.4% at the end of the quarter. It tweaked down from 94.5%. Gold Star
89.6%, 0.1% down also 89.7%. So total U.S. and Canada 90.4% down from 90.5%. Worldwide at 87.6% at the end of
the quarter, again 0.1% down as well. Within the U.S. and Canada of course, we've seen a bigger tick down than 0.1%
in Canada. That has to do as we anniversary now about 18 months when we initiated the changing credit cards up there,
which was actually everybody having to sign up again. So I think part of that is the auto renewal. Feel a little of that in
the U.S. since we haven't been adding on – accepting applications for the current credit card, co-branded credit card
since past October but pretty much in line with what we thought.
In terms of gross margin, our reported gross margin as I may have mentioned was up 34 basis points, 11.43% this year
versus 11.09% last year. And as usual, I'll ask you to jot down four columns of numbers to provide a little edification
here. The four columns would be Q2 2016, columns one and two are both Q2 2016; these are year-over-year changes in
basis points. First column would be reported figures for margin, second would be without the impact of gas deflation
since that tends to distort the numbers wildly. And then columns three and four would be Q3 2016 both reported and
then column four Q3 2016 without gas deflation.
In terms of the line items, the first line item going across would be core merchandising. So Q2 2016 we reported a plus
five basis point year over year; ex-gas deflation it was minus three basis points. And Q3 reported plus 16 basis points,
and ex-gas minus two basis points. Ancillary, a plus nine basis points and a plus seven basis points, and then columns
three and four plus nine basis points and a plus four basis points; 2% reward, minus one basis point and zero, and in Q3

reported without gas, zero and plus two basis points. LIFO, in the second quarter, plus four basis points, plus four basis
points; in the third quarter, plus two basis points, plus two basis points. Other, zero and zero in the first two columns
and a plus seven basis points in columns three and four, that's those non-recurring legal settlements I talked about
earlier. If you add up those columns, reported in Q2 year over year, we had up 17 basis point margin and up eight basis
points on an ex-gas deflation basis. And again, while we reported a plus 34 basis points, it's a plus 13 basis points
ex-gas deflation.
In terms of the core merchandise component, which again reported plus 16 basis points but minus two basis points, if
you look at the four key categories, which is 80%-plus of our business, food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh
foods, as a percentage of their own sales, they were positive year over year by 16 basis points, with food and sundries,
hardlines, and softlines all being up year over year and fresh foods being slightly down during the quarter, year over
year. Ancillary and other business – and by the way, those numbers exclude the non-recurring items that I mentioned.
Ancillary and other business margins were up nine basis points, up four four basis points without gas. And within the
quarter on their own sales, gas, optical and hearing aids all showed higher gross margins year over year as a percent of
their own sales. I mentioned LIFO already. That was a two basis point benefit year over year. And other, again, the
seven basis point improvement year over year. So on an ex-gas deflation basis, margins were up a few basis points year
over year.
Moving down to expenses, SG&A, on a reported basis we're higher by 33 basis points, coming in at 10.44% compared
to 10.11% a year ago. Again, we'll do the same four columns, Q2 reported and without gas and then Q3 reported and
without gas. Core operations, minus 22 basis points reported year over year – and a minus means higher year over year;
ex-gas in Q2 was a minus 16 basis points. Columns three and four, minus 24 basis points and minus eight basis points.
Central in Q2 was a minus eight basis points and minus seven basis points, Q3 minus six basis points and minus four
basis points. Stock compensation, minus four basis points and minus four basis points and then a minus three basis
points and a minus two basis points. And no quarterly adjustments, so all told we reported year over year in Q2 SG&A
higher by 34 basis points on a reported basis and 27 basis points ex-gas. This quarter, Q3, we reported higher SG&A by
33 basis points, 14 basis points higher ex-gas.
Basically, if you go back to the core operations, or operations ex-gas deflation, the eight basis point year over year
higher, that consisted of higher payroll and benefits year over year, which impacted that minus eight basis points by
minus 12 basis points, so more than the minus eight basis points. These items were somewhat offset by a variety of
other controllable expense items. Q2 is of course always the lowest volume quarter, and of course as we know, sales
were a little weaker for a variety of reasons, including some deflation.
Central expense was higher year over year in the quarter by six basis points, ex-gas by four basis points. IT is the four
basis points on an ex-gas basis. It was minus 500 basis points reported, but essentially ex that, central, I think we did a
pretty good job in the quarter of controlling that. And again, stock compensation expense, no surprise there.
Next on the income statement, pre-opening, a little higher year over year, $18 million for the quarter versus $14 million
a year ago, so up by a basis point. This year in the quarter we had eight openings including one relo. Last year in the
quarter we had four openings, including one relo. Again, some of that is not necessarily related to those specific
openings as it may include some right before the quarter opened as well.
All told, operating income came in at $858 million for the 12-week quarter, up $37 million or up 5% year over year
from last year's $821 million.
Below the operating income line, interest expense, interest expense came in at $30 million this year versus $31 million
a year ago, essentially flat, no surprises there. Interest income and other this year was $7 million, lower by $2 million
versus last year's $9 million.
Actual interest income within interest income and other was essentially similar year over year at about $10 million. The
balance of that delta was year over year, it was the other category coming from small foreign exchange adjustments and
slight year-over-year changes in whatever other is, other earnings, no big surprise there.

Overall, pre-tax income was higher by 4.5% or $36 million, coming in at $835 million, up from $799 million a year
earlier.
Our tax rate was a little lower or better year over year, coming in at 34.2%, down from 35.0% last year in the third
quarter. Basically, this year's third quarter income tax percentage benefited from, again, just a few positive discrete
items in the aggregate going our way, and that's why it was a little lower. Our normalized rate is actually just a shade
over 35% in both of those quarters.
Overall, reported net income of $545 million for the quarter compared to last year's $516 million or up 5.5%.
For a quick rundown of other typical topics, the balance sheet is included in the morning's press release. A couple of
balance sheet info items that you may not see in there: depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $291 million
and $847 million year to date. Accounts payable as a percent of inventories, on a reported basis, it was 99%, a
percentage point lower than a year ago at 100%. That of course includes non-merchandise payables such as
construction payables, same kind of delta. The 99% reported this year would have been an 89% and the 100% would
have been a 90%, so again, right around the same year over year.
Average inventory per warehouse was actually down about $0.5 million or down 4%. About a third of that is FX, so
about – almost exactly a third, $173,000 in $516,000. The rest is pretty much spread across many categories, including
the impact from deflation. And again, you never know exactly what the deflationary cost amounts are. But if you
assume a 1% deflation, you get somewhere about half of that remaining being gas and the rest being just lower
inventories. But again, lower year over year by about $0.5 million.
In Q3 on terms of CapEx, we spent $460 million during the 12-week period. And especially year to date, we're right at
$1.8 billion. I'd estimate for the year we'll come in around $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion compared to fiscal 2015 total
expenditures of $2.4 billion. So up $100 million to $300 million from a year ago based on whatever timing we have left
here and what expenditures remain.
In terms of Costco Online, as you know, we're now in six countries, the U.S., Canada, UK and Mexico, plus the
recently launched countries of Korea and Taiwan. In the quarter, sales and profits are up. Sales were up on a reported
basis 14% in the quarter, up about 15.5% ex-FX. On a comp basis, it'd be 13% and 14% ex-FX.
In terms of expansion, again, I mentioned in the quarter that we're in now, which is a 16-week quarter, we would expect
to open 10 new openings plus one relo. And again, that would put us at 29 net new openings. 33 openings, but four of
those were relos, so 29 overall.
In fiscal 2015 we added 23 net new units on a base of 653. So about 3.5% square footage growth. In 2016, the 29 on
the new base would be about 4.5% square footage growth, slightly above our unit growth. But you tend to open a little
bigger units and you've got the relos as well. New locations by country again, 21 in U.S.; two in Canada; one each in
the UK, Taiwan, Australia and Spain; and two in Japan. As of third quarter end, our total square footage was right
above 100 at 101.7 million square feet.
In terms of stock buybacks. If you recall in Q1, we repurchased $130 million of our common stock. In Q2, $80 million.
Both of those of course were 12-week quarters as well. And in the 12-week third quarter, we purchased $136 million
such that year to date we spent about $346 million with an average price per share of $148.64. If you annualize those
quarters and again, we'll see what we do this quarter, but if you annualize it; we'd be right at $0.5 billion for the year
and we'll see where we come out.
In terms of dividends. As you know, last quarter we raised our quarterly dividend rate year over year to a quarterly
amount of $0.45, I believe that was up from $0.40 for the prior year each quarter. That $1.80 a share annualized
dividend represents the total cost to company of around $790 million.
Before I turn the call back to Karen for Q&A, I want to mention a slight timing change each quarter when we report our
quarterly results. Many of you have asked about the fact that we report earnings the night before, usually around 6
o'clock, Pacific Time. Then you get to wait until the next morning to hear the call.

Beginning with our fourth quarter earnings release, we're going to change the timing of that release in the conference
call such that for the fourth quarter, we'll issue results after the market closes on Thursday, September 29, followed up
shortly thereafter with a live conference call that afternoon and a Q&A session at the end of that call. This new
schedule will be our plan for earnings releases going forward. And I think it will be helpful and certainly in response to
several of your comments out there.
The last quick item. Next week we report the four weeks of calendar May sales. This is the four weeks ending this
coming Sunday, May 29. I mentioned to you that based on how Memorial Day falls year over year. This year Memorial
falls on day one of the June retail calendar month. So this year we have 28 days, next year – versus last year's 27 days.
So that will be a little benefit, again we'll point that out.
June there is really a wash. While you've got a detriment related to Memorial Day, you've got a late pickup on the other
end of June with how July 4 falls. And then finally we'll get through that silliness in July and we'll report July sales.
With that, I'll open up to Q&A and I'll turn it back to you, Karen.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Oliver Chen of Cowen & Company.
<Q - Steven Zaccone>: Hi. Good morning. This is Steven Zaccone on for Oliver Chen. Thanks for taking our
questions. Just two questions from us. Firstly, we wanted to get your take on the health of the customer base for you.
There's been some different trends among retailers reported thus far in earnings. Wanted to just get your sense. Have
you seen any changes in trends or spending habits?
Second question, I just wanted to get your thoughts on progress with some of the third-party partnerships in grocery
delivery. How has growth in those channels performed relative to expectations? And then just thoughts about
expanding into new markets. Thanks very much.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Okay, in terms of the customer, so far so good and we don't see any dramatic change.
Many of you have asked questions or have had some concern about traffic coming down from this 4%-plus number
over seven years. We feel pretty good about where our numbers are. We don't really see a lot of different changes.
Interestingly, when you look at nondiscretionary items like food and sundries versus discretionary items across the
non-foods categories including big-ticket items like furniture and electronics and the like, we've actually had, relatively
speaking, a little more strength in some of those non-food categories. So that, I think, allays some of any concerns that
some people have had. But generally speaking, I'd have to say our customer is still pretty healthy and we're still getting
good renewal rates, notwithstanding a very small impact from some of the credit card transitions. And so we feel pretty
good at this point about that. And certainly I feel good about some of the merchandising stuff we've got going on.
By the way, one of the other data points I've been asked several times in the last few weeks each time we've reported
sales in the last couple of months, is it deflation, is it weakness, is dotcom or whatever. The fact of the matter is if you
look at during the 12-week quarter on a year over year basis, if we just take the average items per unit in the basket
going through the front end, so U.S. only, it was up 1.4%. So we're getting people to buy more items, if you will. The
average basket value is up four-tenths of 1%. The simple implication there is you've got deflation presumably of –
deflationary pressures of about 1%. Now that's a good educated guess. There could be other impacts of sizes. But
typically, we go into bigger sizes, not smaller sizes, bigger pack sizes. So I think overall, there's probably still a little bit
more deflation that we've seen over the last couple of quarters spread to other items in the non-food category as well as
we've seen.
In terms of third-party partnerships, we're pretty agnostic. We have good relationships with Google with regard to
Google Shopping Express. Instacart, of course, is in a – Google is in six large communities in the country, the Bay
Area, the LA area and a few others. And Instacart, I think, is now in well over 15 markets, maybe even 20 markets

where we participate with them. And also, a few of the others out there. In terms of expectations, we didn't know what
to expect. I believe that we generally are the anchor tenant, if you will, in many of these opportunities where there's
more than just Costco items being purchased and sold just to provide to the end consumer. And so we think it's been
good. It's still small relative to – we still want you to come into the warehouse and we're going to still figure out how to
continue to do that. But it's growing nicely and it's certainly, on a small scale, a bit of a help.
In terms of expansion plans, I think you asked about openings. It looks like our goal is still similar next year, about 30.
We'll shoot for something a little over 30 and end up about 30 if history repeats itself. We probably had a few more
relative to that 30 number, a few more in the U.S. this year than we would have anticipated if you had asked me a few
years ago. I think some of that is timing. We've had success in the U.S. And probably the expectation of some of the
markets we've gone into in the last couple of years if you had asked me five years ago would we be going into some of
these markets where we have never been in and our competitors have been in for up to 30 years. We've had success in
those markets, whether it's Mobile or Tulsa or Toledo or Rochester and New Orleans. And so probably there's a few
more in those markets on top of the few that we opened like the whatever-teenth number we have in the Puget Sound or
LA where they're harder to find because we're very specific locations to fill in markets. So I think that's probably one
thing. Looking at the 30 locations next year; and this is a guess, it's probably not two-thirds and not 21 over 29. If I had
to guess, it's probably
<A>: It's a little lower. It's a little less than half.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes, a little less than half, 50% – 52%. And again, that's a guess at this point.
<Q - Steven Zaccone>: Thanks very much.

And your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Hey. Good morning. Simeon Gutman. Richard, the Visa transition besides the timing that
started a little later, anything else to think about? The interchange fees probably start to go down when it happens. But
are there other costs that makes your SG&A or any other line items elevated temporarily?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No, the same old stuff that we talked about in terms of some of those things like having not
signed up new co-brand cards since last October, November. Part of any of these equations are different pockets of
income, including generating new credit card sign-ups. And that's been about 4 million to 5 million a month, which is
easy. It used to be something and now it's nothing until June. Other than that, no, we just got a lot of people on our side
and on the issuer's side doing a lot of work to make sure it goes as smoothly as possible. And we're excited about it. It's
a great reward for our members, improvement-wise. And we'll keep a little of it ourselves in terms of merchant fee
reduction. And really there's not a whole lot...
<A>: Cards are hitting in the...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Cards are hitting right now in fact. They'll continue to hit. When you've got literally over
10 million pieces of mail going out, it's spread over a few week period and I think they just started hitting. So cards
should be in everybody's hands at least a few days to a week before the June 20 D-day here. And we'll be able to tell
you more in late September when we do the fourth quarter earnings call. But again, we're ready to go and we're excited
about it.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: And then the marketing dollars, the in-store kiosks, like you said the mailings; we're not
going to see a blip, good or bad, in the SG&A dollar run rate. There's nothing unusual that should happen as we
sequence there.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Absolutely.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. And then my follow-up – yeah, go ahead. Sorry.

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'm sorry, what was the last piece?
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: My follow-up on gross margin, I think you mentioned that looking at the – I think it was
the gasoline, with the optical business, I think you said it was higher year over year. And if that's the case, can you
explain, I guess, how you're doing it? I thought we were recycling the hump of some of the best-performing gasoline
gross margin quarters a year ago. Maybe it was the mix of optical, but figure that the gas is a bigger input.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It will come in Q4. This quarter was an odd quarter. It was a little bit – it ended up being –
in the first part of the quarter it was better than we expected. And with gas prices going up and down, like going up
right now, it's been a little weaker the last couple of weeks. But it was probably a little stronger near the beginning and
into the middle of the quarter than we had anticipated. And it's generally two things. I think the bigger factor is when
there's daily price changes up and down in the cost of – procurement cost of both us and other gas station operators.
And then when it goes down, we seem to feel that we get a little extra margin, in part because our competitors don't
give as much back as fast as we do. So we still give way more back, but it helps us a little bit. And so I think part of
that new normal, if you will, over the last couple of years in that regard it's probably, on average, a little better.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: You'll see it in Q4, though. I say that today. Day to day sometimes, it changes relative to
what – just when we think we're smart and say things will go out, it goes the other way. But so far I guess it will impact
us in Q4.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: And Q4 being the hump, and then it gets easier after that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay, great.

And your next question comes from line of Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot. Good morning, Richard. My first question relates to margin. Can you just
talk about the degree to which moving food prices, I guess, the deflation issue and/or FX would have contributed to
margin rate in any way?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: FX doesn't – the only thing that FX does is, needless to say, in most other countries, some
of their goods are U.S.-sourced or U.S. dollar payable. In Canada it's substantial, frankly. And we manage that, and we
lock in, in a way, natural hedges during the quarter once the buyers are comfortable with that exchange rate and what
they're going to be able to price it that. But my guess is there's still, when you've got – let me see – here it is. If you
look at, let's say, in Canada year over year in the exchange the Canadian dollar is 17% weaker, incrementally just in the
quarter, 5% weaker from the previous month. So you've got that kind of stuff going on from the previous quarter.
You're going to have probably a little margin pressure there. That notwithstanding the margins are up a little. I think
generally we...
<A>: Those are dollars.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We try to bring down prices when there's deflation, and it probably doesn't impact us as
much because – it impacts us a little sooner than others, and that's pretty much it.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. And then LIFO, I guess, I think it's the seventh consecutive quarter where this has
gone your way. And I know you mark it to the best of your expectations at the end of every quarter. How much of this
is food? And if we think about commodity prices, I know once again this should be zero in a normative environment.
Any sense of whether there's more momentum that could prove helpful to you here?

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't think – again, deflation from the end of the year is down about 0.8% on terms of a
LIFO index, and the other comment I made, it was about 1%. Ask the question again, I was looking at one thing. Go
ahead.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: I guess the question is how much of the movement in LIFO, the ongoing credits relate to
food, and based on commodity prices that you see, any desire to venture a guess as to where LIFO goes next?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Look, we don't know. If you talk to our fresh foods buyers, they're continuing to expect
some deflation. I get different answers from some of the non-foods buyers. Mind you, when we look at fresh foods year
over year, those margins were down slightly, in the low double-digit basis points year over year. So again, not a big
impact there, it's the other categories where it was up a little bit. And so the net of all those four main categories was up
16 basis points. I don't think there's lots of...
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: And then finally, any sense, thinking about the very long run, about how your food market
share moves, if at all, when prices are deflationary and perhaps consumers see some of the prices that they had only
seen at Costco for a long time at other retailers?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: First and foremost, I think we continue to believe that we'll continue to see increasing
penetration of the stuff we sell in fresh foods. Nobody does it like us. The quality levels and the values are awesome.
And some of the things we're doing with global sourcing initiatives and poultry plants and organic – our pounds in beef
are way up. But you've got deflation in beef more than some of the other protein categories.
<A>: We're the first to go down.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: And again, we're the first to go down on some of those items when there is deflation.
So I think our numbers have actually, the deflation in some of the fresh food categories I think mask some of the pound
strength, if you will, or the unit strength that we have, whether it's protein or produce. And I would never be so arrogant
to say that nobody could catch us, but we've got some great things going on in terms of, again, global sourcing,
working with vendor partners and – when you look at our produce today, which is I think a $6 billion business now,
approaching a $6 billion business, which is as big as protein, I don't think many retail food places do those kind of
numbers.
And so I think it has more to do with that than – yes, there's probably going to be a little bit of a macro shift, whatever.
I think what we do and how we do it dwarfs those other impacts.
Now there are other players coming into the market. I think just this week you've got a 365 opening, and you've got
other people coming to town with different health-related, organic-related types of retail formats. We're pretty good at
that stuff too. And again, you've got to like bigger sizes but we're pretty awesome in the fresh area and I think that will
continue to be – should be for us an increased sales penetration area and something that will keep driving our members.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thanks, Richard.

And your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser of UBS.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Thanks a lot for taking my question. Richard, you sized the P&L impact of the credit
card transition at $11 million. Presumably, that's just from lost signups, credit card signups. Are you able to tease out
any impact from spending as a result of this transition? So for example, maybe some of the holders don't know that
they can still use their card and so they put it away and that changes their behavior at all?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: There's always going to be a little confusion. To the extent that we haven't signed up new
co-branded credit card members, I don't think many members – many people coming into sign up for a Costco
membership have walked away because they can't sign up for a new AmEx card. If they have an AmEx card in their

wallet, they can use that one. Now to the extent that they don't have an AmEx card in their wallet, or to the extent that
they – keep in mind, not everybody that signed up for over the last 16 years got it. It was still a credit eligibility
decision that the issuer made, and it will be that way in the future.
The fact of the matter though is that to the extent that they signed up as a member, and again, I don't think it was that
impactful, somebody walking away because they can't get an AmEx card, they have to use a debit card in their wallet
or cash or check. On a macro basis does that impact some of the big ticket items? Yes, it probably does, although our
TV sales have been pretty darn strong. So I could talk out of both sides of my mouth on this one.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: So does that mean that some of the comp slowdown just may be a function of the law of
diminishing returns math taking over?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It could be. Again, the ones we can quantify easily, we look at. We can drive ourselves
crazy. We know that, let's face it, in April sales, we tried to – what we shared with many of you on our audio, it's
everything. It's deflation, it's a little of the AmEx. Maybe it's getting closer to the line of maximizing marginal
whatever. At the end of the day, we're still rolling out gas stations, we're still rolling out for the ancillary businesses,
we're still opening up new warehouses, we're expanding fresh foods as we have over the last several years.
People ask us about what are some of our new areas, and certainly what we do with ticketing in the last – and Executive
Member services. All those things – wine and spirits, I think we've been surprised by that. These are all small things.
They're all needle movers, but small movements. I have always said, there's a lots of little things that help us here.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: My last question is, to the extent that you have already seen some of your existing
AmEx cardholders clip up their card and switch to Visa, and it's having an impact on your sales, do you think that's
going to only intensify as you get closer to the June 20 transition date? So for example, are you seeing even slower
trends in May so far?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: First of all, I don't think anybody has clipped up anything. They still have to use that
co-brand AmEx card through June 19. And nobody can actually use the new card, even if you got it in the mail, until
June 20. That's part of our original agreement with our previous service provider. And that's fine.
So all stuff will happen June 20 and beyond. And rest assured, there's going to be a lot of stuff happening in terms of
our continued communication, of course, to our members. But there's a lot of members out there that don't have an
account. Little over 40% of our U.S. sales were done on AmEx, with, I think, a little over half to two-thirds of that
being on the co-brand card. So people tend to have more Delta points or Starwood points, so they're using a different
one.
Same thing will happen with Visa. Our goal is to get that co-brand card as we did successfully with the AmEx co-brand
card, that to be your top-of-wallet card. We think that there are going to be a lot of things like that drive that, including
the people that op their own blogs independently and others that look at what is currently a 321 is going to be a 4321.
That's huge. And so my personal view is there will be something that's not going to all hit on day one. Let's get through
day one, and transition first. But it will be something that will continue for a couple to several years.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Okay, good luck. Thank you.

<Q - John Heinbockel>: So, Rich, do you think this 30 annual openings, is that sort of – I mean, certainly you have
the people and the capital to do more. Is it real estate bottleneck, or you're comfortable at that level? Can you go solidly
beyond that? And I think internationally outside of North America, as you go into more countries, and you would think

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: First of all, and clearly it's not capital. We have plenty of capital. I would argue we have
too much capital out there. We like it that way. It's people. It is people. Years ago, I didn't appreciate it as much as I do
now. Particularly in these countries, if you think about in Japan, I think there was about an 18-month period a few years
ago where we went from nine units to 20 units in about a year and a half, two years. It's not like we're sending a bunch
of experienced warehouse managers to go open and operate, and be warehouse managers in Japan from different
countries. So you do that a few at the beginning. You may do it occasionally on a onesie basis. But at the end of the
day, you're growing from within and developing those local country people.
And first and foremost from an international standpoint, you've got that. That can be a little bit of a challenge. And then
you've got – these take longer there. There are some countries that I understand are very difficult just because of zoning
and restrictions that are in place, not just in us but any big box, even local company big boxes in the hypermarket area
and the like. So it's going to take a little longer there.
The other thing – so do I think we can go above 30 annual openings? Look, we shoot for low 30s annual openings, and
then next year you shoot for the mid-30s annual openings. And I think you've certainly heard me say that we want to be
around 30 annual openings, and five years from now we should be doing 35 annual openings. Maybe we'll fall a little
short from that, maybe we won't, but we've got more feet on the ground real estate wise in other countries as well as
U.S. than we've ever had.
It does take a little longer, but we also – could we physically open more? Sure. But we like what we do and the way we
do it. And probably we also have a comfort level that is not like we're going to miss out. We are, in our view, the
preferred club out there. And so, when we go into a market, if we take a little longer to get there, people are waiting for
us and it might be a little harder, but the fact of the matter is we feel comfortable how we're doing it.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: And then, as the traffic in the U.S. is moderated right, but back to what maybe you said you
were at a level it couldn't be sustained back to the level it can be. Are there discussions internally that it is just a natural
moderation or – because you talked about within the categories the 16 basis point improvement in margin, there are
things you can do proactively to give more back to the member, and would that do anything to traffic? So that sort of
discussion internally about the balance of earning versus trying to maybe drive traffic a little more, can that be done?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, first of all, first quarter was – and if you haven't seen the slide before, it's reiterated
and put out here internally every day of the year and at our managers' meeting, Jim used to and Craig does now, we are
a top line company. We want to drive sales.
The fact that margins year over year are up on those core categories, up 16 basis points, we're not smart enough to
figure out how we get there all the time. We're always going to drive margin a little bit where we can, but we do it the
right way by getting most of any savings back to the customer. If I look at our pricing competitive stance versus our
direct competitors, the gap has never been wider.
We could make a little more miss, but we don't. At end of the day, we're always looking for ways to do that. When we
do membership, few changes historically, we are always looking to give some of that back. So all those things go into
it, but the end of the day, what helps margins? Private label, fresh food strength, some of the ancillary businesses, all
those things are helping as well.
And again, we feel we don't necessarily – I've got to tell you, we don't look at it and say, hey, frequency came down a
little bit or the comp is a new normal, a little bit lower. We want to do more. And even when we are doing a 4%
shopping streak, how do we hit it higher? Even though that was kind of tough. So we're going to continue to do things
in that direction, and we don't necessarily worry about, oh, that came down a little bit, so we need an extra fee basis
points of margin. That's never the case around here.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: All right. And then lastly, is KS having any kind of real impact that you can see on basket
size? Or not really?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't know. I mean, we keep adding. Well, we subtract and add KS items. So they live
and die by the same metrics. If it's not a great item, we stop it. But there aren't any giant items like toilet paper and

water, those types of things, or disposable diapers several years ago, but there lots of little ones. And I think again, we
would see that continuing to increase penetration, but at a slower rate of growth in the future as well for the same
reasons.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Getting back to your question, I don't think that's a big reason of why the basket size has
changed. If anything, many of those items, it's a lower price point. If we had – if we're doing brand-only and we
brought in the Kirkland next to it, many instances it may be the same because we go to a bigger pack size, and many
instances you've got a lower price point on the same number of units.

And your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich of Evercore ISI.
<Q - Michael Montani>: Hey, guys. This is Mike Montani on for Greg. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask
first of all, Richard, you mentioned that there was obviously a little bit of extra strength maybe in some of the
discretionary versus non-discretionary categories and that was something that gave you comfort that the consumer
hadn't changed that much. Can you provide any updates? Obviously, early on here but like for May results so far, have
you seen sequential improvement in traffic versus even April trend?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We really can't talk anything about May yet. There's no giant surprises either direction, but
at the end of the day – again the comfort level, I think earlier in the call, I was responding to many calls that I received
from both institutional investors and analysts out there about the concern. And again when we look back at it, and we
looked at – you know we reported April sales and we are saying okay well one of the reasons why it came down a little
bit, it was a little weaker. What again gave us comfort – one little data point of comfort was the fact that some of those
discretionary categories are actually doing a little better than one would've thought given the total number and so that's
about as much as I would read to that.
<Q - Michael Montani>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We'll tell you next Wednesday, for May.
<Q - Michael Montani>: And if I could, just to follow up on gas little bit, can you provide the price per gallon for the
quarter? And also the comp gallon trends? And if there was any material impact to EPS that I may have missed?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: The price per gallon was down for the quarter 19.7%. Basically, $2.59 a year ago and
$2.08 this year. What was the last part?
<Q - Michael Montani>: Just asking about, what was the comp gallon percentage change? And then also, was there
any material EPS impact on this quarter? And if you could help us size up exactly what we're up against in next
quarter?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think year to date we're up in the low-single-digits in terms of comp gallons. Again, the
big comparison was, it was a year ago when there were really outsized comp gallons up 7% – 8%. I know in April, I
think a year ago, was 8% in the U.S. And so that was part of that impact of why in our view, sales were a little weaker,
particularly in California in April.
<Q - Michael Montani>: And just the EPS impact, Richard? I'm sorry, on price per gallon?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It was within $0.01 or $0.02; really no change year over year. I think it might have been
$0.01.

And your next question comes from line of Peter Benedict of Robert Baird.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hey, Richard. Thanks for taking the question. One on gas and then another on a different
subject. But just you've been adding 20 to 30 gas stations a year, the last several years. I think your penetration is like
70% across the clubs. How do we see that going forward? Is that pace of growth going to continue? Where do you
think you can get the penetration of gas stations called a few years out?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, in the U.S. we've – first of all, in every new unit we do, where it's possible we put in
a gas station. And we're even doing a few in countries like Japan and Australia, which we hadn't done historically. We
relocated a few units in the U.S. We just moved Hackensack to Teterboro. The Hackensack became, I think, our 11th
business center – 10th or 12th business center. And the new Teterboro one is a big new Costco with the gas station,
with better parking and great. So if we did three or four – I don't have it in front of me – but if we did four relos this
year, my guess at least three of them have gas stations in those three, but we're starting the max that out.
In the U.S., we have at the end of the quarter; we had 420 gas stations out of 481 warehouses. In Canada, 55 gas
stations out of 90 warehouses. I'm guessing in Canada we still have a little bit more room to grow because we started
there later. Again in the UK, we had none a couple of years ago. Now we have four. Japan we have five. Spain, 50% of
them, one of two. And Australia five gas stations out of eight warehouses, I believe. So yeah again, it's not like five
years ago in terms of just adding a bunch of gas stations but it still I think moves the needle a little bit.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe can you take a minute and discuss the senior
management ranks at Costco? There's been some turnover lately. We know Doug. I think his last day may be
tomorrow, I guess. But just talk about what's going on in terms of transition, future transitions and maybe what
changes, if any, these new leaders have kind of implemented. I understand it would be only marginal, but just curious
your thoughts on all that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Look, you're talking about shopping frequency staying at 4% for seven years. People have
stayed for 30 years, including me. So you're having some turnover, of course, over the last few years. You've had
people that are retiring in their early 70s that have worked together starting 55 years ago at FedMart in San Diego. But I
think from a merchandising and operations standpoint, that's been well thought-out.
Let's face it. The first big concern was what's going to happen when Jim leaves. I think while we were comfortable here
internally, I think we've shown and certainly Craig has shown that the transition and the maintaining of the culture has
continued without missing a beat. In merchandising over the last few years, we've took certain categories like what we
used to be with non-foods, which is a combination of hardlines and softlines, and Dennis Knapp, who was a senior
executive over that. And since retired, we promoted two people and broken out hardlines and softlines.
In operations, we've made several promotions and changes of people again. Typically, low-tenured people like they've
only been here 20 to 25 years that are going from VP to Senior VP levels on a – I think we've got about 16 senior VPs
of operations in the U.S. geographically. And now in terms of Doug, Doug as you know, has been head of U.S.
Merchandising and certainly involved in a lot of merchandising beyond that as well. Doug's great. He's leaving for no
negative issues both internally or with himself, and we're all kind of jealous. He's more on the younger side of the
senior management team. Craig has a plan, but he's looking at a few things, and over the next few months we'll be
announcing how that changes. But we've got good people in place and we don't think that there's an issue at all there.
In Asia, Richard Chang, who goes back to the Price Club days probably 25-plus years ago, who has ran operations for
Taiwan, was promoted to Senior VP of Asia. And we've brought some new people in there as well, new people
meaning existing Costco people, of course, from the U.S. And so I think we feel pretty good about the change. It sped
up because it was at zero. In the last couple years, it's been a few, a couple, and now it's a few and a few more, and I
think we're pretty well positioned for that. I don't see a big change in what we do and how we do it.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, great. Thanks, Richard.

And your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul of Nomura.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more around some of the
geographic trends that you're seeing and just update us on your thoughts around the trends in California.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think we pointed out California last month for April because it was – while U.S. overall
again was a little weaker than it had been, it was really California. California is about a third of our U.S. company
operations, and it's probably a little bit more penetrated gas-wise. And again, a year ago we had gallon comps which
not only drives gasoline but more importantly drives people in the parking lot and 52 or 53 of every 100 come into
shop. And so that was where we saw a bit of a distortion. California versus the rest of the U.S. I believe there was a – I
don't have the number in front of me, but to get to a 1%, the other U.S. was a 2% and California was a minus 1%. I'm
off by a little bit there but it was that kind of direction. And so that was a little unusual.
Again, I can't predict what that means for the future, but other than that there are some markets where – I think the
positive that we see is we've been successful in some of these new medium-sized markets. We had the most new
signups, I believe, in many years in terms of a new market, a new medium-sized market in Tulsa just a few weeks ago.
Through opening day, we had more signups than we've had. I'm not talking about Asia. That's a whole different story in
terms of signup levels. And so again things look pretty good. I don't know if there's a lot of geographic changes other
than the thing we called out on California. I personally believe a lot of that related to some of the gas issues.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Okay. And I saw that you're doing – what is it – a pickup truck with GMC in terms of a – and are
you getting other vendors that are coming to you to look for marketing opportunities given the success of the business?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure. In the car business, I think last year just in the U.S. we did just under 0.5 million new
cars. We've always done – when car manufacturers have come out with something new, we could do by putting one of
those cars in front of our trucks in front of each of our locations and doing some type of extra amount of incentive, we
can drive a ridiculously large percentage of those six weeks of sales in that car or truck. In this case, we toyed with the
idea for several years and talked to auto manufacturers about doing a KS vehicle, a great value, with all the bells and
whistles and even better value than you get as a Costco member or as a Costco Executive member. I know we had
started and stopped a couple of times with a couple of different manufacturers. We're pleased with it. We think the
manufacturers are, the dealers are, and I'm sure there probably will be more in the future, but we'll see.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Great, thank you very much.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We back those with other products, too. We just keep bringing it to a different level. Why
don't we take two more questions?

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Hey, good morning, Richard. I just wanted to clarify a few things, if you don't mind. First, on
the new member sign-ups, I think you said up 15%. Certainly, international store openings have a lot to do with that but
you're also seeing success in the U.S. If you can, maybe just give us a little bit more detail around what's driving that.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't know what driving it. We do a pretty good job of getting people in the door.
Opening in some of these new markets helps. It's just been overall strong. If the U.S. is 15% and the whole company is
15%, where was it down, it was up relative to the 15% of course in the end in places like Taiwan, and Spain of course
was huge, but it's huge on a base of one. And then it was a little lower in Canada, where we had very few new
openings, and Mexico same thing. Mexico last year, we had a huge opening on a base of about 34 or 35 units, a huge
opening which had outsized numbers. So we're comparing against that with no new openings this year. Same thing in
Canada, we had a huge opening in a location there a year ago in that quarter versus none.

<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Got it. And then on core merchandise margins, I just wanted to make sure. The 16 basis point
gain you're referring to, that's kind of the core, the true core merchandise margins on the four categories that compares
to the 11 basis points. Is that correct? And then also, you made a comment earlier in the call regarding AUR. Is your
view of total store deflation around 1%?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: If I look at my LIFO index, we don't know exactly. If I look at my LIFO index which is
70% of our inventory, it's a U.S. accounting principle. From the beginning of the year to now, that's about a percentage
point, 0.9%. If I look at just the total, for the U.S. front-end registers, number of items in a basket was up year over year
1.4 percentage points. The average basket was up 0.4 percentage points, so a 1.0 percentage point delta there. That
again I think just affirms that roughly 1% deflationary number on average. But it's educated art, not a complete science
there. And yes, the margin in 2016 is on its own sales, each of those four categories – by each of those four categories
sales.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Great, thank you and good luck.

And your last question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Thanks for getting me in at the end here. Richard, can you
remind us where you are on the IT modernization investment program, kind of when some of those pressures may start
to ease? And secondarily, are there any other investment bubbles we should be kind of mindful of as we think about the
next two years to three years?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: So IT is one of the gift that keeps on giving. We started about three-and-a-half years, four
years ago. As we look at it today, we might take four or so years to do the big chunks of this, we'll take six years as we
thought it would cost – exit cost 1.5x to 2x or whatever it is, which is typical. Our guess that it will still be slightly
detrimental in fiscal 2017, and actually technically it may even flatten, improve a little in 2017 but you got a 53-week
year. So there's a little cheat there. But generally speaking, that's up a little in 2017, maybe up a little in 2018 or flat,
maybe down a little. We don't know yet. But we're starting to get to that inflection point and my guess is that inflection
point will come sometime towards the end of 2017 or into 2018. Keep in mind, these numbers don't assume anything.
This is necessity, first and foremost. We believe it will help us in different ways, in many ways and there'll be other
things we'll add to it, but the bulk of it of course is getting behind us, and we'll go from there.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Okay. And any other incremental expenses that we should be mindful of? Like you finished one
program, and typically there's another one kind of waiting, or lurking right behind it.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't think there's anything big out there that ways. I mean we just did the bottom-up
scale increase which is a little unusual, not a big number. But it's $0.06 or so a year. There's no giant changes coming to
healthcare. We still give great health medical and dental and vision benefits to everybody. If we increase sales
penetration outside of the U.S., certain structural expenses help us. Healthcare in the U.S. is easily 20 basis points to 60
basis points as a percent of sale higher than every other country in the world. And so just by doing more elsewhere, that
will help that number a little bit. Same thing with labor costs. We pay similarly great labor wages relative to whatever
in-country norms are, but certainly the numbers in the U.S. and Canada are higher than some other countries. And so
those things will help us a little bit. I don't think – there's nothing huge going on out there. I don't think we have any big
shocks to the system.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Excellent, all right. Thanks a lot, guys.
Richard A. Galanti
Thank you, guys. We'll be around. Have a good day.
