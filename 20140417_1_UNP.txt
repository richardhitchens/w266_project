Greetings. Welcome to the Union Pacific first quarter 2014 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a
listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]
As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's
website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr.
Koraleski. You may now begin.
John J. Koraleski
Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. With
me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Lance Fritz, President
and Chief Operating Officer and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, we're pleased to report that
Union Pacific achieved first quarter earnings of $2.38 per share, an increase of 17% compared to for the first quarter of
2013 and another all-time first quarter record. Total volumes were up 5% and the increase was broad-based. We saw
growth in five of our six business groups with particular strength in agricultural shipments, industrial products and coal.
The volume growth combined with solid core pricing and the continued focus on safety, service and efficiency drove a
two-point improvement in our operating ratio to a record 67.1% for the quarter. As you all know, this winter was one
for the record books, especially in the upper Midwest, so we're proud of the efforts of the men and women of Union
Pacific who worked tirelessly to serve our customers despite these weather challenges and helped us to achieve a solid
start to the year. So with that, let's get into it. I'll turn it over to Eric.
Eric L. Butler
Thanks, Jack, and good morning. In the first quarter, volume was up 5% compared to 2013, as solid demand made up
for the challenging weather conditions in much of the country. We had strong gains in agricultural products, industrial
Products and Coal. We also saw volume growth in intermodal and automotive and in chemicals, we were able to offset
declines in crude oil with gains in other commodities to end up even with last year's strong first quarter results.
Core price improved 2%, which was partially offset by unfavorable mix and lower fuel prices to produce a 1%
improvement in average revenue per car. Add in our volume growth and we increased freight revenue by 6% to a first
quarter record of $5.3 billion. Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products volume grew
13%, which combined with a 3% improvement in average revenue per car, drove revenue growth up 16%.
We continue to see strong demand for grain, with car loadings up 39% driven by last year's strong harvest. The biggest
gains were in grain exports to China and Mexico and wheat exports to the Gulf and lower corn prices drove increased
demand for domestic feed grains. Grain products volume was up 5%, driven by an 11% increase in ethanol shipments
as refineries replenish low ethanol inventories.
Shipments of DDGs grew 38% driven by strong export demand, primarily from China. Food and refrigerated shipments
were down 3% for the quarter, as the winter weather impacted cycle times for equipment serving the produce and
frozen food markets. Partially offsetting those declines were gains in import beer, where volume grew 3%. Automotive
volume grew 2%, though average revenue per car was down 2% resulting in flat revenue for the quarter. I'll talk more
about the average revenue per car decline in a moment.
First, finished vehicle shipments declined 3% as winter weather impacted shipments and we had a couple of plants with
unscheduled shutdowns. While automotive production was strong in the quarter, the severe winter weather contributed
to year-over-year sales declines in January and February. Sales rebounded strongly in March, up 5.6%, thanks to
improved weather and dealer incentives. We expect our finished vehicle shipments to rebound as the rail the network
recovers from the challenging weather.
On the parts side, volume increased 9% with strong production and over-the-road conversions driving gains. The
decrease I mentioned earlier in average revenue per car reflects a change in the way we handle per diem revenue on

Intermodal containers used by our customers for auto parts. As a result, in 2014, the per diem revenue is included in
other revenue instead of automotive commodity revenue.
Chemicals volume was flat for the quarter with revenue up 2% on a 3% increase in average revenue per car. Industrial
chemicals volume was up 7% driven by strength in end user markets, such as shale related drilling, paper products and
deicing materials. Fertilizer shipments were up 7% for the quarter on strong export potash demand. And crude oil
volume declined 18% compared to the first quarter of last year with price spreads negatively impacting volume.
Partially offsetting the decline was an increase in Niobrara shipments to the Gulf coast.
Turning now to coal, revenue increased 3% in the first quarter on a 7% increase in volume. The average revenue per
car declined 4% driven by mix and lower fuel prices. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was up 2% as demand
from the cold winter weather and higher natural gas prices offset our previously reported contract loss. Colorado Utah
coal tonnage was up 13% benefiting from the increased domestic demand as well as gains in west coast exports. We
continue to see strength from other coal-producing regions where tonnage was up 25% for the quarter.
In our industrial products business, a 9% increase in volume and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car
produced revenue growth up 10%. Non-metallic minerals volume was up 18% for the quarter. We continue to see
strong demand for frack sand and shale-related drilling, which was up 22% over last year. Aggregate and cement
demand were strong particularly in Texas and California, driving construction shipments up 10% for the first quarter.
And our government and waste shipments were up 23% driven by a waste customer adding short haul shipments in
January and February. Additionally, the winter weather increased demand for salt, while shipments were up 28%
compared to the first quarter last year. Intermodal revenue was up 4% in the first quarter, driven by a 3% volume gain
and a 1% improvement in average revenue per unit. Domestic intermodal volume was up 8% in the quarter, driven by
strength from our traditional IMC customers, new motor carrier customers and demand for new premium service
offerings. Headwinds from severe winter weather were offset by business development and highway conversions. Our
international intermodal volumes declined 1% against a strong comparison from the first quarter of 2013. The winter
weather impacted consumer demand and imports to the west coast ports were down nearly 3% for the first few months
of the year.
Let's take a look at how we see our business shaping up for the rest of 2014. Our current outlook is for the economy to
strengthen modestly this year. Last year's strong crops should provide opportunity for ag products in the second quarter
with anticipated strength in both domestic and export grain markets. The 2014 crop yields will be dependent on the
weather. For food and refrigerated, we expect growth in import beer, but the drought in California could create a
headwind for tomato paste and canned goods. Automotive market fundamentals remain strong with demand for new
vehicles, easy access to financing, low interest rates and low fuel prices all expected to drive increased sales.
We should see finished vehicle volume rebound in the second quarter as we continue to recover from the winter
weather. Most of our chemicals market should remain solid throughout 2014. Crude-by-rail will continue to be
impacted by spreads, a growing Gulf crude supply, and increased pipeline capacity.
Lower inventories will continue to be a driver for our coal business in the second quarter. Weather conditions this
summer will influence how things shape up for the full year. Industrial products should continue to benefit from share
related activity with increased drilling supporting growth in frack sand and pipe shipments. Housing starts were off to a
slow start in 2014, but they are still projected to exceed 1 million units, which we anticipate will drive demand for
lumber shipments. We think the strength in construction products will continue.
Highway conversions and new product offerings should continue to drive growth in domestic intermodal. International
intermodal should benefit from a continued improving economy and strengthening housing market. For the full year,
our strong value proposition and diverse franchise will again support business development efforts across our broad
portfolio of business. Assuming the economy cooperates, we expect to deliver profitable revenue growth yet again in
2014 driven by continued volume growth and core pricing gains. With that, I'll turn it over to Lance

Lance M. Fritz
Thanks, Eric, and good morning. I'll start with our safety performance, which is the foundation of our operations. The
first quarter 2014 reportable personal injury rate improved 3% versus 2013, progress achieved through our
comprehensive safety strategy.
The number of severe injuries during the quarter declined to a record low, reflecting our work to reduce the risk of
critical incidents, our team's commitment to the Courage to Care, and the maturation of our Total Safety Culture.
Moving to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our first quarter reportable rate finished up 7% versus the quarterly
record set in 2013. However the absolute number of incidents including those that do not meet the regulatory reportable
threshold decreased to record lows in each of the three months of this year. Looking forward, we expect continued
improvement from investments that harden our infrastructure, expand advanced defect detection technology, and
enhance our ability to find and address risk. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved slightly versus
2013.
Driver behavior continues to be a critical element. To make continued progress, we're focused on improving or closing
high-risk crossings and reinforcing public awareness. Severe winter weather conditions were a headwind to our safety
performance during the quarter, most notably where our employees faced the brunt of below zero temperatures and
record snow fall. Even so, the team did a tremendous job addressing the risks.
In addition to impacting safety, the most severe winter weather we've faced in quite a few years materially impacted
our first quarter network performance. The impact was most evident in the upper Midwest and at interchange points
with other carriers, particularly in Chicago. Extremely cold temperatures and significant snowfall disrupted operations
by limiting train size, curtailing switching activity, reducing the ability to mobilize crews to crew change locations,
elongating equipment cycles and reducing fuel efficiency. Our dedicated employees did a great job battling difficult
conditions while maintaining open channels of communication with customers and our interchange partners as we
managed through the challenge.
We responded by leveraging the unique value of Union Pacific's franchise. We adjusted transportation plans to use
alternative switching yards and gateways. We realigned resources to where they were needed most and employed the
use of our surge capacity. This included increasing our active locomotive fleet by about 600 units since last fall and
increasing our active TE&Y workforce by roughly 550 since January. While we mitigated a fair amount of winter's
impact, our service performance fell short of our expectations, and we are working hard to achieve a rapid and full
recovery.
And while that recovery is now underway, most of our first quarter operating performance metrics reflect the winter's
impact. Velocity declined 7% as adverse conditions generated an 80% increase in the number of days with major
service interruptions. These interruptions temporarily reduced operating capacity during the quarter, particularly in the
northern region.
The interruptions and subsequent limits on network capacity also drove a decline in our service delivery index, a
measure which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments. On a brighter note, we were able to
maintain local service within a decent range, registering a 93.1% Industry Spot & Pull. This metric which measures the
delivery or pulling of a car to or from a customer, also reflects the tighter service commitments we introduced this year.
In addition to surge resources, infrastructure investments have also improved our ability to recover after incidents,
reducing their impact on the network. For 2014, we plan to invest around $3.9 billion, which is up about $300 million
from our 2013 spend. We're purchasing 200 locomotives this year compared to 100 locomotive last year, in part due to
future volume growth assumptions as well as our Tier 4 emissions strategy. We continue to invest in capacity across
our network, including new capacity in the upper Midwest and in the South, that support expected growth.
And speaking of unit volume growth, for the first time in several years, we saw solid and relatively balanced regional
volume growth. While severe weather impacted our ability to fully leverage that volume, we were still able to realize
meaningful productivity gains. For example, the increase in regional TE&Y employees was less than our unit growth,

despite the surge of crews we deployed in the north. Freight car dwell was up 12% in the quarter, driven by a 36%
weather-related increase in the northern region. On a more positive note, we held locomotive productivity flat in the
face of the headwinds. Our longer term trend of improving locomotive reliability, coupled with effective utilization
plans should register continued gains going forward.
Overall, we generated reasonable productivity improvement as our men and women applied their expertise to improve
safety, service, and efficiency, using the UP way. Our primary focus was serving our customers and keeping our
employees safe during difficult operating conditions. The net result was a 2-percentage-point improvement in operating
ratio, something our team is very proud of achieving in a very difficult quarter.
In summary, our full year operating outlook for 2014 remains positive. We are confident we're on a path to restoring
operations back to normal. We're focused on reducing variability in the network to drive service improvements and
we've made progress during the past few weeks. We will continue to work closely with our interchange partners, as our
recovery, and that of the entire rail industry is [ph] conditioned (14:50) upon interchange fluidity.
And as performance improves, and as demand dictates, we'll adjust our resource levels accordingly, including moving
locomotives back into storage. We expect to generate record safety results on our way to an incident-free environment.
As network performance improves and we utilize resources more efficiently, our ability to leverage unit growth to
generate solid productivity will improve and we will continue to make smart capital investments that generate attractive
returns, by increasing capacity in high-volume corridors, while also supporting our safety, service, and productivity
initiatives.
As a result, we'll provide customers with a value proposition that supports growth with high levels of service. All
combined, it translates into increased returns for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.
Robert M. Knight
Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our first quarter results. Operating revenue grew 7% to an
all time record of more than $5.6 billion, driven by strong volume growth and solid core pricing. Operating expense
totaled nearly $3.8 billion, increasing 3% over last year. Expenses include about $35 million or roughly $0.05 per share
of costs associated with the severe weather conditions in the quarter. Operating income grew 14% to more than $1.8
billion, hitting a best-ever mark for the first quarter.
Below the line, other income totaled $38 million, down 5% from 2013. Interest expense of $133 million was up 4%
compared to the previous year, primarily driven by new debt issuances at the beginning of 2014.
Income tax expense increased to $671 million, driven primarily by higher pre-tax earnings. Net income grew 14%
versus 2013, while the outstanding share balance declined 3%, as a result of our continued share repurchase activity.
These results combined to produce a best-ever first quarter earnings of $2.38 per share, up 17% versus 2013.
Turning to our top line, freight revenue grew 6% to a first quarter record of just under $5.3 billion, driven primarily by
5% volume growth. Lower fuel prices and business mix each drove about a half point decline in our average revenue
per car. Growth in our grain and frack sands volumes were positive mix drivers, but were more than offset by negative
mix in automotive and coal. Eric just pointed out the increases in lower ARC auto parts versus the decrease in finished
vehicle volumes which accounts for the negative mix in automotive. As for coal, we did see the benefit of higher ARC
volumes, including our prior year re-priced legacy business. However, this was more than offset by increases in lower
ARC, shorter haul movements.
Increased intermodal and waste shipments also contributed to the negative mix. Core pricing gains totaled slightly over
2%, continuing our pricing strategy of outpacing inflation. Slide 21 provides more detail on our core pricing trends in
2014.

As you recall, 2014 is a legacy light year, so we will not see the 1.5 points of legacy benefit which we saw in 2013.
We're also seeing the impact of lower inflation on that portion of our business that is tied to inflation escalators
primarily ALEF. The table at the bottom of the slide takes a closer look at the quarterly ALEF escalator. As you can
see, it rebounded only slightly from negative territory in the fourth quarter last year.
While pricing is never easy, we continue to see solid core pricing gains above inflation on the business that we can
touch in the marketplace today. Keep in mind also that the positive mix impact of new business, or business returning
to the Union Pacific franchise, is reflected in our margin gains, but it is not added to our core price calculation.
We continue to be as focused as ever on pricing to market at rates that earn a fair and re-investable return. Moving on
to the expense side, slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense which increased 3%
compared to 2013.
Higher volumes, inflation, and weather were the primary drivers, offset by productivity realized by leveraging the
volume growth. Total TE&Y increased slightly, though not at the same rate as our volume growth. However this
increase was more than offset by a decrease in the employees associated with capital projects for the quarter when
compared to 2013.
For the remainder of the year, we would expect to see compensation and benefits expense to grow, but this will be
largely dependent on how volume plays out. In addition, we still expect to see labor inflation come in under 2% for the
full year.
Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $921 million, up 2% when compared to 2013, driven primarily by higher
GTMs associated with increased volumes. Our fuel consumption rate was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis,
with the weather having some negative impact.
Total fuel expense was tempered by a 3% year-over-year decline in average diesel fuel prices. Moving on to the other
expense categories, purchased services and materials expense increased 9% to $607 million due to volume-related
subsidiary contract expenses, higher locomotive and freight car material costs and crude transportation and lodging
costs. Depreciation expense was $464 million, up 7% compared to 2013, consistent with our prior guidance.
Looking ahead, we now expect depreciation to be up 7% to 8% this year. Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two
expense categories, equipment and other rents expense totaled $312 million, which was flat when compared to 2013.
Higher freight car rental expenses was offset by lower container lease costs. Other expenses came in at $226 million,
down $11 million versus last year.
Higher utility expense was more than offset by a year-over-year improvement in our freight and equipment damage
costs as well as lower environmental and personal injury expenses. For 2013, we expect the other expense line to
increase between 5% and 10% for the full year, excluding any unusual items. Turning to our operating ratio
performance, pricing the business at reinvestable levels and moving it safely and efficiently continues to drive results.
We achieved a record first quarter operating ratio of 67.1%, improving 2 points when compared to 2013. Longer term,
we remain committed to achieving an operating ratio below 65% before 2017.
We also remain committed to achieving strong cash generation and improving overall financial returns. Turning now to
our cash flow, in the first quarter, cash from operations increased to almost $1.8 billion. You'll recall that we expect a
headwind of about $400 million this year due to tax payments associated with prior year's bonus depreciation.
These payments will be reflected in subsequent quarters. We invested about $900 million this quarter in cash capital
investments and also returned $363 million in dividend payments to our shareholders. Also, in keeping our
commitment to achieve a dividend payout range of 30% to 35%, we increased our declared dividend per share by 32%
on a year-over-year basis. Taking a look at the balance sheet, we issued $1 billion of new debt in January, bringing our
adjusted debt balance to $13.3 billion at quarter end.
This takes our adjusted debt to cap ratio to 38.4%, up from 37.6% at year-end '13. We remain committed to achieving
an adjusted debt-to-cap ratio of approximately 40%, and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.5 by year-end.

We feel our current cash outlook positions us well to execute our cash allocation strategy. Our record profitability and
strong cash generation enable us to continue to fund our strong capital program and grow shareholder returns.
In addition, we continue to make opportunistic share repurchases which play an important role in our balanced
approach to cash allocation. As you may recall, our new repurchase authorization of up to 60 million shares over a
4-year time period went into effect January 1st of this year.
Under this new authority, we bought back 3.8 million shares totaling $683 million in the first quarter. This brings our
cumulative share repurchases since 2007 to 110 million shares, combining dividend payments and share repurchases,
we returned over $1 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter. It represents roughly a 45% increase over 2013,
clearly demonstrating our commitment to increasing shareholder value.
So that's a recap of the first quarter results. As we look to the remainder of the year, a favorable economy and some
help from the weather will combine with our commitment on core pricing above inflation and our ongoing productivity
initiatives to produce continued margin improvement and record financial results.
With that, I'll turn it back to Jack.
John J. Koraleski
Okay, thanks, Rob. As we put this winter behind us, we're off to a good start for the year. As always, there's going to be
some challenges ahead, but we also see opportunity. In the weeks ahead, we'll be focused on restoring the fluidity of
our network after the winter slow down. We're absolutely committed to pursuing the excellent service our customers
expect and deserve. It's a cornerstone of our ongoing success.
Our value proposition to our customers depends on it. Strong service goes hand in hand with improvements in network
and asset utilization that are so critical to our future. Another potential challenge for the entire industry is the uncertain
regulatory environment, which is being played out in Washington, D.C., Canada, and Mexico. We're watching things
closely on all fronts, making sure that regulators truly understand the importance of a healthy, growing rail industry.
We're also watching the weather and the economy very closely. There's still a lot of year ahead of us, so we'll have to
see how the summer burn plays out for coal demand and how the 2014 crops will fare, everything from planting
through harvest. As far as the economy goes, a lot can change between now and the end of the year, but at this point,
we're seeing some signs of gradual economic improvement and we're encouraged by the opportunities it presents. With
the power and the potential of the Union Pacific franchise, we'll leverage these opportunities to drive record financial
performance and shareholder returns this year and in the years to come.
So with that, let's get started and open it up for your questions.

<Q - Scott H. Group>: So wanted to just first ask about the yields particularly on the auto and coal side. So if I'm
understanding this right, as finished vehicles start to grow again as weather gets better, should we start thinking about
auto yields growing again? And then on the coal side, with yields down 4% year over year, they were just so strong in
the first quarter last year, up 16%, was there anything unusual like any liquidated damages last year that you didn't have
this year that's driving that, because I'm just not sure how to model coal yields going forward?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Okay, Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, well, Scott, let me talk about the autos first. As Eric mentioned in his comments, there
was a process change that affected some per diem treatment on containers that basically accounts for all of the decline
in the autos' ARC. On top of then, as he also pointed out, the mix shift of fewer finished vehicles and more auto parts
also had an impact on ARC, so we don't give guidance on what the mix is going to look like or what the ARC is going
to look like by commodity line and we don't do it by the way as a company but directionally, yes. If we see growth in
finished vehicles outpacing growth in auto parts you would expect that trend to move in that direction. We're not giving
that specific guidance, but you're thinking about it right.
On the coal, our coal ARC was down 4%. Roughly half of that was driven by mix. I mean, your traditional mix that
you might see, a greater movement of shorter haul coal moves and less shipments of the higher in some cases re-priced
coal business. And the other half was made up of lower fuel prices drove lower average per car on the ARC line, and
year over year, you're exactly right, there was a small, as you recall, we pointed out, it was roughly $15 million of
liquidated damages last year that did not repeat this year that at this point, I don't see that trend continuing throughout
the year. So that had a little bit of an impact on our coal ARC line as well. And that piece was about 1.5%, if you will,
of the – 1.5% of the 4% decline.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just wanted to take a shot at the long-term margin
guidance. So, if I look historically at the first quarter OR and then the full year OR, the full year typically is about 3
points to 4 points better than the first quarter and you had weather in 1Q. So it feels like we're on a run rate this year
around 64% for the OR, and that's just so much, so different than the sub-65% in 2017 so I'm not sure if the long-term
guidance is just really stale or is there something that you're telling us that we need to be thinking about or worried
about the next three quarters that's going to dramatically change the trajectory of margins?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Hey, Scott, our guidance is below 65% before 2017, not in 2017. Rob, why don't you fill in
the blanks on that.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. Scott, we hope you're right. There's a lot of things that have to play out. We certainly
hope that the economy cooperates. Fuel prices as you've heard us speak many times can have an impact directly on the
margins and the operating ratios, so as we've said all along on this financial improvement journey over the last decade.
We're not looking at the sub-65% as an end point and we are not going to slow down. We're going to get there safely
and efficiently as we can. And if all the stars align and the economy cooperates and we move in the direction that we
hope everything happens, we'll get there as soon as we can, but our best look at this point in time is that looks to us like
it's some time before 2017.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Thanks, good morning. Maybe just a quick question on the volume pace as you came out of
the first quarter, things obviously ramping up. It seems like there was probably some pent-up demand here that's carried
into the second quarter. How do we think about how long that lasts and maybe the pace of activity here? How much is
sort of still yet to be moved that wants to be moved? And kind of when can you catch up, do you think?

<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah, and I think you're exactly right, Chris. I think as we move towards the end of the
quarter, we were catching up from some of the issues in the early quarter but our volume outlook is still fairly decent
for the year, so Eric, you want to answer?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, Chris, as Jack said, clearly this is some catch-up, particularly when you think about the
difficulties that the winter had on the automotive business and then even coal utilities, there was a strong coal burn and
so there's catch-up there. You can also think about our grain business and the grain harvest, there's a natural processing
in the first quarter shipping the record corn harvest that we had in the fourth quarter, but like Jack said, I'm pretty
optimistic about a slowly strengthening economy for the balance of the year, a slowly strengthening economy across
our book of business. We'll have positive impacts, plus, we continue to have a strong value proposition, and so we're
optimistic for the balance of the year.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: That's great. That's very helpful. And on the coal side, when you think about the inventories
of the utilities that you're serving relative to those length of haul differences that I think showed up here in the first
quarter, how should we think about that? Is there any imbalance there where it might suggest you have stronger
volumes continuing to those shorter length of haul utilities? Any color you could give there would be helpful.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, I would say there's no balance in and out. Inventories are quite low, as you probably
know, they're about 21 days below what would be considered normal, so they're quite low. But there's no imbalance
between short and long haul that would have a mix change for the future.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning and great job working through the weather. Just a follow-up on the
short haul freight that you've gained. It seems like a lot impacting the mix. Can you talk if there's any long-term impact
on margins? And really is this long-term business? Or is this because some competitors are having infrastructure issues
and as they fix that, some of that reverts back to a different network? Or is this more permanent business in nature?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: It really kind of depends on the individual markets, Ken. For instance, the short-haul move
that Eric referenced on the waste product is a customer of ours that just historically last year had moved for 9 months,
and this year, really picked up volume in the first, so that's kind of an ongoing issue for us.
Rob, you want to hit any more of the --
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Ken, I would just say your question is hitting right on the reason why you've heard
me many, many, many times say we're not giving guidance on average revenue per car because mix is always a part of
the business. And when you look at as diverse as our franchise is and as diverse as all our commodity groups are, mix
is rather normal but as you also are questioning in terms of the margin, just because something has a short-haul lower
average revenue per car doesn't mean it has a lower margin.
So we're not afraid of that at all. We're pricing and moving the business as efficiently as we can driving our margins,
which in fact, we've done. We did that in the first quarter even with this negative mix impact. So mix will always be a
part of our business, but we're focused on improving our margins regardless of length of haul.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah, as Rob said, if we can get our reinvestibility threshold met, we're happy to take the
business
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: That's great insight, thanks. Just a follow-up on the locomotive side and I guess demand
side overall, as you noted, demand creeping in a little bit on a gradual improvement. If we start seeing a faster pace of
improvement, what's your thoughts on your ability to handle it, to take the capacity access locomotives, your
infrastructure's ability to handle it. Maybe it's a Lance question in terms of scalability of the infrastructure and available

capacity.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Absolutely, Lance?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure. So Ken, we feel pretty good about fluidly handling the volume that Eric's bringing on to
the network. If you think about where we are right now, the first quarter was what, 179,000 7-day car loads. We've
publicly said we think our network can handle 195,000-plus with a very good excellent service product, so we're
looking forward to that volume. Of course, it's dependent to some degree on exactly where it shows up but we've you
know we've been putting capacity into the network in anticipation of that and we feel pretty good about handling the
volume.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: And our first quarter was pretty balanced, so we like that.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: And similarly, access to locomotives to handle that, is that infrastructure still available?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: It is, if you think about how many locomotives we have left in surge right now, it's a little
over 300. And that's bearing in mind that we brought in, what was it, 600 locomotives since the fall, with a large
portion of those not driven by volume, but instead driven by trying to overcome winter's impact. So we've got surge
resources that will be able to handle it.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: So, as we spin up volume and operating stats improve, we'll actually be sucking some power
out of the network and putting it back in storage.

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Hi there, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Rob, I wanted to ask you about pricing.
When we see this inflation metric start to rise a bit, is it logical to think that the core pricing headline starts to rise as
well? Is it as simple as that? Or is there another element there that we have to keep in mind?
<A – [004KG6-E]Rob Knight – Union Pacific Corp.> I mean, that part of the business that is tied to the ALIF and there
are timing differences, as you've heard us comment many times. They're not all the same. Those contracts and those
pieces of our business that are tied to the ALIF have different timeframes of when they trigger, so you take that into
consideration. But directionally if ALIF, if inflation increases as ALIF, in fact, reflects that, that part of business that is
tied to ALIF will increase, yes.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Right, and then as we look to next year is a legacy, it's got more legacy in it, right? So, as we
look to next year, this should have a pretty good directional trend?
<A – [004KG6-E]Rob Knight – Union Pacific Corp.> Yeah, next year, Bill, as you've heard us say several times, we've
got roughly $300 million of revenue is tends to be front-end of business that we will compete for in the marketplace
but, it's about $300 million of legacy revenue next year.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Great. And then on inflation, I think in the past you've talked about seeking to offset it with
productivity. But if it's going to run this low, is there a chance that our productivity actually causes our – so not the cost
related to the volume growth but rather just the fixed cost base and the productivity, can that actually cause this cost
number to go down?
<A – [004KG6-E]Rob Knight – Union Pacific Corp.> Lance might make a comment on this as well, but I would say
potentially. Again, what you're referring to Bill as you know, is we've set the price of the business to market, achieve a
successful above-inflation sort of pricing environment and then in addition to that, offset and we challenge ourselves to

offset all, but if we hit 50% of offsetting inflation through productivity, that's a great model and to your point, and in a
lower inflationary environment and a positive volume environment, that gives us more options to do as well as we can
on that.
<A – [07BCF8-E]Lance Fritz – Union Pacific Corp.> That's perfect. Rob is absolutely right. Mirroring what Rob says

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl from Cowen & Co. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Good morning guys. It's been well publicized that your western competitor has had some major,
major service issues and it seems like you guys probably got some freight from them. How much did that really stress
the system in the first quarter when you throw on top the winter weather and everything else?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Jason, if you look at our issues in the first quarter it was 99% winter. The additional volume
and whatever we've taken on either of our own bringing on to the network or anything that might have been diverted on
a temporary or permanent basis, basically just would have been handled easily by our resources, our infrastructure, the
investments we've made in the past. So it did not – the additional business did not stress our network. It was just really
the impact of winter weather and the impact that it had not only on Union Pacific, but broad-based throughout the
industry on our interchange partners.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. And, Jack, this is a broader question. I asked this on another call the other day. We've had
issues with Chicago as an interchange in the rail network the entire time I've been an analyst. I mean, obviously it was
greatly exacerbated this quarter with winter weather. And I know there's been projects around like the Create project to
try to improve that but what's really just holding the rail industry back from all getting together and really just trying to
fix this interchange once and for all, because it seems like this is something that would benefit six of the seven Class 1s
going forward?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah, my perspective on that, Jason, is Create still is a blueprint for how we can
significantly improve the throughput in the Chicago area. But each railroad has its own issues that it's dealing with, as
well, and so in our world, we're making investments, we're planning, we're working together. Having the centralized
operating control group in Chicago helped to mitigate some of the winter weather, but there's lessons learned here and
I'm sure that as we come out of this first quarter experience, we'll learn from that, the industry will learn from that.
We've spent a lot of time working with our interchange partners on throughput in volumes and things like that. How
can we handle things more fluidly? Our ability to divert to different gateways, depending on the individual interchange
partner, those kinds of things.
So I think there will be lessons learned from this. But I still fundamentally think the investment and the strategy
identified in Create holds a lot of potential for us. Lance, what do you think?
<A – [07BCF8-E]Lance Fritz – Union Pacific Corp.> Yeah, absolutely, Jack. And there's something that the
participants in Create have been public about, and that is since the start of Create, we've taken a half a day out of the
time it takes for a car to transfer through Chicago side to side, end to end, which is real progress. That's down by about
one-third.
And this year's winter was epic, and in the absence of Create and the Chicago planning group and the coordination that
the interchange railroads undertook, it would have been a much worse outcome. Clearly lessons learned, but it was
effective.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: And Lance, where do you think that number can come to? You said it's down by a third. [ph]
Can you get (42:44) down by another third?

terms of reducing the time it takes cars to traverse.

Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Hey, good morning, gentlemen.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Wanted to focus on the rail cost escalator chart that was in Rob's section of the presentation,
and if you look back at the trailing four quarters, that's pretty tempered inflation, and I would have thought with the
labor cost escalation built into your contracts that certainly over time, you would have seen more than an average of
less than 1%, which I think it probably works out to be there. Anything that's going on there that we're missing? And
how would you expect that to continue over the next four quarters?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, John, I think you're going to see it continue to be low for the next four quarters and
you recall that our labor inflation, which as you know the way the ALIF works, it's a market basket of inputs from the
industry, but the labor inflation for us we called out, we think it's going to be less than 2% this year. So that's a big
piece of what's in there.
And so it is driving, it has been, for quite some time now, the reduction in that ALIF number. So it lines up and over
time, it does what it's intended to do. From quarter to quarter, there might be some timing issues, but it's done its job
over a multi-quarter, multi-year period.
<Q - Robert M. Knight>: Okay, and then maybe just a follow-on, on the timing of the restoration of complete fluidity
in and around Chicago and in the northern end of the network, one of the executives giving testimony at the STB last
week suggested that Chicago should be back to normal completely within four to six weeks. Is that in keeping with
kind of your expectations? And will there be any meaningful impact on the EPS line during that restoration period?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Hey, Lance, why don't you handle the outlook?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yep, okay, John. So we are very encouraged by what we see happening on our network right
now. We're confident that some time in the second quarter we will be back to normal. We're working to make that as
soon as possible and in terms of Chicago interchange, that's a difficult question for me to answer because it's dependent
on how quickly the networks of interchange railroads come up to speed. What we see right now is real solid
improvement as we've exited winter.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah, so we're hoping it won't be a material, you won't see a lot of it in the second quarter
from a cost perspective, but it really depends on how it plays itself out.

<A - John J. Koraleski>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Rob, with regard to incremental margins, as I'm taking a step back and listening to what I
heard on the call, it's clearly – mix worked against you guys. There was a lot of incremental costs associated with
winter weather which meant the network probably wasn't running as fluidly as it could and constrained train lengths.
Should I think about the Q1 64% incremental margins as being a low for the year and expanding from there?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Rob, as you know, we don't give that level of guidance but as you've heard me say many
times, for us to get from where we are today to our sub-65% and we're not going to slow down to get there at any
particular time, we'll get there as efficiently as we can, assumes we're going to get a 50% kind of number on
incremental margins from here to there. There can be lumpiness from quarter to quarter depending on volumes,
weather, fuel prices and other issues, so we'll keep doing as well as we can but we – I've shied away from giving
specific quarterly guidance on that incremental margin number, other than to get to our sub-65%, we've got to continue
to make good progress
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Okay, that's fair but we should think about the network running more fluidly and that should
obviously help overall operational performance, I would imagine.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: That would be a plus, absolutely. And then we'll see how volume actually plays out.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: That's fair. And I'm not sure if this question should be directed toward Lance or toward
Eric. I noticed in the network productivity section, one of the slides you guys were calling out about 4% volume growth
in the north. And as recently as a couple quarters, that had been down on a year over year basis. Clearly, your primary
competitor in the west has been having a lot of challenges in that region. It looks like the TE&Y head count increased
about 6% year over year.
Is this 6% growth with regard to expectations for future volume growth or just handling current traffic? And on a side
note of that, can you give us a sense if you guys are seeing incremental competitive wins in the north, what type of
traffic that's coming on, if it's coming on the manifest network or unit train network?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: I think what you saw in the TE&Y buildup of 6%, Rob, was basically the impact of winter
where we flooded the northern region with extra labor to help us work our way through the winter process, and it's not
necessarily a reflection of what's happening in the north on an ongoing basis. Lance, you want to – is that okay? Are
you good with that?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, that's perfect. Yeah.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: And then the other thing is when you think about our northern region, think about that's
where the grain is, that's where frack sand is. Intermodal is sitting there and also our coal business. And so, those were
all some fairly decent volume gains just intrinsic in the business itself.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Appreciate the color. So sounds like more unit train there. Thanks.

export coal as the export coal opportunities strengthen in the future, but I think if you think about it going forward,
Southern Powder River Basin growth will probably outpace Colorado/Utah growth going forward in terms of upside
opportunity.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay and is it fair to say that the SPRB has a longer length of haul?
<A – [0CG3D8-E]Eric Butler – Union Pacific Corp.> It depends on origin destination pair, but that's probably not an
unreasonable expectation, but it depends on the origin-destination pair.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Got it, okay. And then just, I had a couple of questions on the frack sand business. You
mentioned that volumes were up over 20% in the quarter, so I was wondering if you'd talk a little bit about the
sustainability of this pace of growth over the next couple of years, as new mines continue to come online in Wisconsin?
And then, could you give us a sense of how much of the frack business you are originating and terminating on your
own lines? And maybe what shales you're delivering the most frack to?
<A – [0CG3D8-E]Eric Butler – Union Pacific Corp.> Yeah, so we're very excited about our frack sand franchise. We
think we have the premiere origination franchise and we think a significant portion of the new mines that are coming
online in the Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois region actually are coming on our franchise or at least access to our
franchise, so we're pretty optimistic about the longevity and outlook from that standpoint.
At the end of the day, it's really going to be drilling that really drives the consumption of frack sand and the drilling
trends, in terms of longer mines, longer drilling, deeper drilling, deeper horizontal, more fracking, all pointing to
significant continued growth in frack sand consumption. One of the interesting trends in Texas, in particular, for
Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Basin, I think in January, I don't know if the February-March numbers have come out,
but in January, Texas hit an all time record of production of oil in terms of records going back to the early 1980s. So as
long as those drilling trends continue, you'll see the frack sand demand continue and we have the premiere frack sand
franchise.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay. And I would imagine that has a pretty good length of haul from Wisconsin to Texas,
is that correct?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: It traverses north-south. It's not as long as some east-west moves, but it's a pretty good part of
our franchise.

Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yeah, good morning, gentlemen, and congrats on a relatively good quarter here.
Rob, I wanted to come back to the discussion on pricing, because I feel like there's a lot of maybe misunderstanding
around the core pricing gains.
Obviously you had higher levels of gains last year, but actually we're seeing better margin expansion this quarter. Can
you just expand on your comment about how the new and incremental business is not necessarily captured in your
metrics?
<A – [004KG6-E]Rob Knight – Union Pacific Corp.> Yes. You've heard me say this many times, but the way we
calculate price at Union Pacific is how much price did we yield in a particular time period against our entire book of
business. I'm very proud of the way we calculate it, because it's the most conservative way of looking at it. What I
pointed out is that so what that means then, if we bring on a new piece of business or business that we haven't had for
over a year, let's say, that business might come on at great margins, of course, because we're focused on bringing it on
at the right margins, at the market level pricing, but it wouldn't show up in new price. It wouldn't show up in a year
over year calculation of price.

So you're exactly right, when we point out that our pricing was up 2% and you know all the headwinds we face, low
legacy, number light and the ALEF impact. The reason we're able to expand our margins is we were able to leverage
the business, leverage the new volumes that came on, and as new business came on, we are confident we're pricing it
right, but it doesn't show up in the pricing number but it shows up in our margins.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Right and that's what we should really be focused on to see how you're delivering
on the pricing front, right?
<A – [004KG6-E]Rob Knight – Union Pacific Corp.> Well, yeah. Clearly, pricing is a tool along with productivity and
other things that we do, but at the end of the day, margin expansion is clearly the ultimate driver or the ultimate answer.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: All right, thank you. And hopefully, I can just get one follow-up in here for Lance.
Lance, I think you did state that the network is designed for 190,000-195,000 units, I believe. That's about 5% from
where you've been running the last few weeks. Does that signal we need a lot more CapEx going forward? Or are there
any structural constraints in the network that make it tough to get to 200,000?
<A – [07BCF8-E]Lance Fritz – Union Pacific Corp.> No, Brandon, what we typically say is 195,000, 200,000, seven
days, we could handle fluidly. And we say that because in 2006, we peaked at a number about like that, a very different
service product at that time and since then, we've improved processes. We've invested capital. We have more surge
capacity and that's what gives us that confidence level. From the point of view of handling the volume that Eric's team
is bringing on right now and for the rest of the year, absent some acute areas where maybe we've got a very specific
capacity constraint, we feel very good about being able to satisfy that with a high service product.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Thank you.

Our next is from the line of Bascome Majors, Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Bascome Majors>: Good morning, guys. There's a lot of regulatory balls in the air at the STB particularly
relative to just a few months ago. And you also mentioned some things developing in Canada and Mexico earlier in
your comments. I'm just hoping if you look at all of these at once, could you help frame what in your mind is the
greatest long-term concern for you and perhaps additionally, what's more immediate you're looking at today that could
impact you fairly soon?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: That's a fairly broad question. And so we treat each of those as a very serious issue and we
look at them very carefully and closely. So we're watching what's happening with the NIT League proposals, the
service hearings, the Canadian-directed agricultural shipments, the Mexico reform. So, in each of those cases, we have
teams of people looking and working very hard to ensure, as I said in my opening remarks, that everyone understands
the importance of having a viable, growing, and healthy rail system that's paid for by private investment and not
taxpayer dollars.
So, while we consider each one of those to be a very serious and concerning development, it also gives us the
opportunity to position all of the great things that not only Union Pacific, but the entire rail industry has done, by the
constant reinvestment and investment of capital dollars to build the transportation infrastructure in this country, and
actually throughout North America that there is today.
So, we take them all one by one. If you look at, you know, the new discussion around revenue adequacy, it's going to
be an opportunity for us to point out the benefits of what's happened so far, the investments that's been made, the
importance of having decisions if we're going to change things to recognize replacement costs, those kinds of things.
The service hearings, I think, went well. I think it positioned us well to tell the story of how even though it was a
difficult quarter for the industry, the capital investment made it a lot better than it probably would have been if it had
happened 5 or 10 years ago. In Mexico, we've been working very hard to make sure the government understands the

importance and the development and the volumes that have improved since we took on our concession in partnership
with the FXC and that if they look at the throughput and the development of transportation within the country, it has
certainly helped to grow the Mexico economy. If you look at all the investment from the automotive industry and
things like that.
So we look at these at these as every one of them while it's a serious issue, if it were to go awry, it gives us a great
opportunity to talk about all the good things that have happened, and so we're not afraid of them. We're willing to step
up to the plate and participate in each and every one of them to make sure our story gets told

Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess my first question here is for Lance. With all the
difficulty you had in the winter weather, you still managed to keep your head count under good control here and didn't
really need to resource up significantly to add any redundancy, so that's quite impressive. But I'm just wondering, is
that reflective of what could have been a lower head count if you didn't have the weather? And how should we look at
your head count as you go through the year and the year this year?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: So, Walter, we think about head count resourcing for the volume that shows up where it shows
up, so that we can maintain an excellent service product. I won't look backwards and guess at what it would have been
if winter hadn't happened. Going forward, the right way to think about our head count is exactly as Rob states: with
productivity, we should be able to keep head count growth lower than volume growth. And I feel pretty confident we're
going to be able to do that
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay, so there was nothing that distorted that in the first quarter that you're going to
significantly drop head count now in the second quarter or anything like that?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: That's correct.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. The second question now, as you alluded to in a number of different ways on your ag
business, a lot of volatility, you mentioned weather, you mentioned related to that, the significant drought from last
year, the unpredictability of that.
If we look at the current trends in the first quarter car loads, it seems to be off to a very good start, not only on a comp
basis an easy comp basis, but also on an absolute basis. And I'm just curious if as we model this out in future years
given how important the ag business is, when we look back at historical average levels, be it on carload or overall crop
size, is there any reason why your carload volumes would be any different from an average run rate level historically?
Or is that how we should look at it? Might we need to revert our 2015 ag estimates downwards to reflect perhaps a very
healthy 2014 haul?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, so, Walter, as you recall, last year, or 2012 going into 2013, there was the drought which
significantly impacted our volumes last year, the same time first quarter. So if you look at year over year, the fact that
there was a record corn harvest, the harvest started in October, and the volumes are moving through the first quarter of
this year, clearly is the primary driver behind the volumes that we're seeing.
There was some, as we said, stress in the grain network on our competitors, so there was some small portion of
incremental volumes we had assisting the market due to that, and those challenges that they had, but again, that's
rounding. The bigger issue was the record corn harvest, a pretty good bean harvest, pretty good wheat harvest, and in
terms of going forward in the future, again, the weather will determine, the yields will determine the production and
that will determine the volumes that move during the harvest season.

<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. If I could sneak one last one in here on the regulatory standpoint, I heard all your
commentary. Perhaps you could give us to the extent you know it the next few catalysts for any potential changes or
regulatory, in other words, are we going to stay within the confines of the STB and their actions? Or could there be any
other occurrences that might impact the STBs, any changes the STB might make on the regulatory front?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: At this point in time, as we look at it, the regulatory model is based on railroads being
allowed to earn their rate of return, and be revenue-adequate, and we don't see a lot on the legislative front. There is the
railroad antitrust bill that has been introduced but has seen no action, and so we haven't really seen a lot on the
regulatory front, other than what's happening in the STB and actually as we look at the STB hearings, they're taking a
very measured and thoughtful approach to it, so we're in good shape.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay, that's encouraging. Thank you very much. That's all my questions.

Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks, and good morning. We've been hearing a lot lately about a tightening truckload
environment, and you would imagine this should bode well for intermodal pricing as we progress throughout the year.
Do you think you will be in a position to get better intermodal pricing in 2014 versus what you've seen in the past few
years?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: As we say, we continue to price through the market, and we are continually focused on taking
advantage of strong demand. As you mentioned, the CSA is having an impact on trucking capacity. It had an impact in
the winter because of the safety concerns. There probably were – was some trucking capacity that self-selected
themselves out of taking trips during the most difficult portion of the winter weather, because of the concern of the risk
with the CSA.
But we continue to think that the intermodal opportunity is strong. Trucking capacity is tightening, and we continue to
think that that's a good outlook for our book of business.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay, thanks, Eric. And maybe as a follow-up to that, how much flexibility do you have to move
pricing in Intermodal? Have you already established your rate for this year? Or do you have the ability to raise rates
throughout 2014, if the market and demand continues to move higher?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: As we've talked in the past, a portion of our business is in different segments, some in long-term
contracts, some in one-year contracts that rotate or come up throughout the year, some in instruments that you could
change on a relatively frequent basis. Our Intermodal business has that same kind of profile and as we have
opportunities based on demand and market prices, we'll take them.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay, great. I appreciate the time.

<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Yes, thanks. I think my question is for Eric. Eric, your comments remain quite positive on
a 2014 economy and I want to ask you about Chemicals in particular, given the sea change in U.S. natural gas

<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, I think we've said several times in the past that with the relatively low natural gas prices,
futures are still, I think, around $4.50, or something like that, you're seeing a lot of plastics development coming on, a
number of different plants that have been announced for expansion. Think we've said in the past in previous earnings
releases that most of those will come on 2016, 2017, but we continue to see strong upside opportunity from that.
Our fertilizer business, we continue to see a strong upside opportunity in our fertilizer business, so fertilizers, plastics,
industrial chems, we think are long-term positive outlooks.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks, Eric. And I guess just a quick follow-up on the Mexico discussion. Given this
business is handed off to your U.S. assets rather than your own operations in Mexico, and I recall the Ferromex
ownership stake, can you comment on how you believe your franchise would actually be affected if the bill proposed
became law? Is this just a bad precedent for other jurisdictions or would this in itself have material impact to UP?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: I think overall if you look at our franchise, the Union Pacific franchise, the business that's
moving into and out of Mexico, it's not going to really change materially our ability to deliver goods both to the border
and also to take them from the border and deliver them throughout the U.S. Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: I would just – Keith, you've heard us say this before, but our interest in this is we don't want
to see something that erodes commerce in Mexico. And we think one of the unintended consequences of the potential
bill is that it would create less commerce in Mexico, because we, as you know, are the only railroad that crosses with
six border crossings in and out of Mexico. So we'd just like to see commerce continue to grow and volumes continue to
want to cross the border both ways and we're ready to handle it.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Yeah, agreed. Seems like a big step backwards from recent progress. Thank you.

The next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey, good morning. Just two quick questions maybe on the growth outlook. Eric, the
intermodal weeklies are looking pretty strong right now. How much of that is the Santa Teresa opening versus maybe
some just straight organic conversion versus share take?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So, we did open our Santa Teresa facility in April 1 of this year and we think that will be a
strong lever for us for that market. That market, I think we've talked publicly that that new ramp has about a 250,000
lift capacity. If you think about it, our domestic intermodal business is 1.6 million units, so we are seeing a strong
growth with our products and services across the board. Certainly the new product offerings from Santa Teresa will add
to that, but we're seeing strong growth across the board.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: So should we think that that Santa Teresa, the opening of that terminal is going to
continue this growth kind of through the year and it laps? Or is this more – I guess I'm trying to figure out if the current
strength is more of a temporary thing that should ebb as the weather sort of eases up and other rail service improves or
if we should be expecting these upper single digit growth in intermodal going forward?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, so the current strength is the strength that we're seeing across our book of business. When
a ramp opens up, there's a gradual ramp-up and there's going to be a gradual ramp-up in Santa Teresa. The current
strength in our intermodal business is depending on growing the – slowly growing economy and our value proposition
and that's an across-the-board opportunity for our book of business.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Great. And then maybe just as a separate question, are you guys seeing any
development of terminals for handling heavy crude-by-rail, either in the western specifically, like California refineries,
or down in Texas on your network?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yes, we have spoken before, there are a number of different terminals that are under
development, both on the West Coast and to an extent also in the Gulf Coast. We're working actively and part of our

strategy is to strengthen our franchise. We cannot direct when and where crude oil will flow. That's determined by
spreads, but our franchise wants to – we will ensure we have a franchise to land it when and where it wants to flow
long-term.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Would you think that those western refineries might have perhaps a little bit of a cost
advantage via rail relative to the Gulf?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Not really sure what you're asking. When you say cost advantage, you mean lower rail cost?
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Yeah, lower distance to move from western Canada down to the western -
<A - Eric L. Butler>: It will be market-based and we'll price to take advantage of the value of our franchise, whether
it's going to the west coast or to the Gulf coast.

Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Good morning guys. I think a question for Lance. If I look at cars online, cars online
are, call it 10 to 12% above trough levels of last year. As we think about volume growth accelerating and kind of the
cross-current of the network normalizing into the third quarter, how should we think about the asset requirements of the
network going forward? Can we continue to think about cars online falling, as they were through all of last year? Or
should we think about those 2013 levels as the trough and now that we do see volume growth accelerate that, that
growth number should lag but we won't quite pierce and fall below the best levels realized last year. Can you provide
some perspective there?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure, Ben. As I look at car inventory on our railroad right now, the large majority of the growth
year over year is about winter impact. And I'm expecting that portion of inventory to ultimately bleed off, as we're able
to interchange it off to other carriers, or ultimately get it to a customer on our own railroad.
There is some amount of that growth that's driven by unit volume growth and what I really look at and care about is car
productivity, as opposed to the absolute inventory number. The absolute inventory number is important to me as an
overall indicator but what we really try to drive is good utilization of the cars that are on us.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Don Broughton of Avondale Partners. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: Good morning, everyone. Real quick, you talked about wage inflation, looking at the
comp-to-benefit line, obviously wage inflation 2%, what are the other puts and takes? Performance bonuses we hope
you earn? Pension tailwinds? What else is going to be pushing and/or pulling that line in 2014?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Don, on that line, a big offset, if you will, to wage inflation has been the pension
expense, the pension side of the equation, and that's been the reason why I say that our labor (sic) [inflation] (1:14:23)
line for the full year expected to be below 2%.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: Okay, fantastic. So the wage inflation actually is higher than that. It's just that the actual
line (sic) [labor inflation] (1:14:31) itself will be coming in at under 2%.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: That's correct (sic) [the labor inflation line for the year is expected to be below 2%]

question.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much. It's been a long call. Most of my questions have been answered. Just
kind of one quick one on the locomotive CapEx you spoke about. With the Tier 4 locomotive standards, this is the first
time, I think, we're using exhaust gas recirculation to meet the standards and the experience of the truckers with this
was we ended up with more expensive engines that were not as efficient. What are your thoughts on the locomotives
post the Tier 4 standard? And does this change the economics for you in terms of thinking about natural gas as an
alternative fuel in the long run for the locomotive fleet?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Lance?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure, so first thing to note is we have a couple of Tier 4 test units that are on us, wired up, so
that we can fully understand with the OEM involved what the economics and what really the overall performance
metrics of those units look like. It is not certain what efficiency impact a Tier 4 locomotive is going to have in relation
to a Tier 3. I know the OEMs are working very hard to make fuel consumption rates roughly equivalent, and so there's
more to follow there, and in terms of will a Delta in that make a fundamental difference in the L & G economics, the
answer is that's probably a minor impact. The major impact is utilization, infrastructure costs and a couple other
elements.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Okay. Well, Lance, thanks so much. Guys, congratulations.

Our next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Zagrean,
your line is open for questions.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Hi. Thank you. My first question relates to pricing. Could you clarify for us how much of your
book is specifically tied to ALIF or another inflation cost measure? And how much is able to take advantage of
improving demand fundamentals, for example, in intermodal?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, I mean, roughly a quarter of our business is tied to an escalator, ALIF being the major
driver of the escalations that we use. I would also then add to that, Eric responded earlier to the intermodal question of
what capability does he have to take pricing up throughout the year. And we've got a mix of long-term contracts. We've
got a mix of short-term contracts. We've got a mix of annual quotes, if you will, so we look to take advantage and move
price to market whenever we can. We don't give specific guidance by commodity as to how much we can touch within
a particular timeframe but across our entire book of business, we look to price to market where we have the
opportunity.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: And would you be able to comment what verticals offer most opportunity this year in your
opinion?

<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: All right, thank you. And then my second question relates to crude-by-rail opportunities,
specifically tied to the Permian. Would you be able to share with us what kind of growth or infrastructure development
projects you are looking for there to enable you to take advantage of production growth? And what kind of
commitments you are looking for in the supply chain to commit your capital to developing that area?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, as we've said previously, the Permian Basin has great coverage, pipeline coverage, and
that's where most of the production growth has taken place in the state of Texas. So if you look at our crude-by-rail
volumes from the Permian, they actually have decreased significantly. We've said that in the past. And they're really
nominal, and going forward, there may be some spot opportunities for crude-by-rail in the Permian, but the Permian
has great pipeline coverage and we don't expect that to be a driver of any crude-by-rail volumes going into the future. It
is a driver of our drilling materials volumes, like frack sand and pipe.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: So you're not contemplating maybe laying some new rail into California refineries? Or that's
more science fiction than feasible future?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, so we are, as I mentioned before, looking at strengthening the destination franchise for
crude-by-rail into California. At this point in time, we – the market is suggesting a lot of that will be sourced from
Canada or the Bakken. There are those in the market who believe that Permian will go to California. If that happens,
we'll be prepared for it, but I think the market today is suggesting the majority of crude-by-rail in California will come
from Canada or the Bakken.
