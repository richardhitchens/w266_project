Thanks, Jerry. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I hope you've all had a chance
to review our third quarter earnings release and financial results. The results directly illustrate the continuation of our
strong operational and financial momentum and enabled us to increase our financial outlook for 2013.
The focus and efforts of our Lockheed Martin team continue to position the corporation for delivery of solutions to
customers and value to shareholders. I offer my congratulations and appreciation to all of our employees, and
especially to those employees directly affected by the government shutdown, for their outstanding achievements and
performance while operating in a challenging and dynamic environment.
While there were numerous financial accomplishments in the quarter that Bruce will outline in his comments, I want to
offer my thoughts on key strategic achievements this quarter. From my perspective, beyond the program execution and
financial results that remain exceptional, other accomplishments can be seen in three key strategic areas. These areas
are backlog expansion, international growth, and cash generation.
We have continued to describe our portfolio as the best positioned in the sector with unique and direct alignment to
many of the essential programs identified by customers as they satisfy their national security requirements. Many of our
programs have provided these solutions to customers over several decades, because they are proven and they are cost
effective.
A direct validation of this alignment and positioning of our programs to customers' needs is visible with our
achievement of increasing levels of annual backlog for the past three years, ending with over $82 billion in backlog at
year end 2012, while operating in a challenging global and domestic economic environment. This quarter, our portfolio
alignment and product offerings resulted in $15 billion in new orders and expansion of our backlog to nearly $79
billion.
We continue to execute on the forecast we outlined to you at the beginning of the year, that our backlog expansion
would resume in the third quarter. Looking forward, the new business pipeline remains robust with significant domestic
and international awards expected later this year on many of our legacy programs.
With the establishment of a continuing resolution for fiscal year 2014 in place through January 15, we remain on the
path previously outlined to you to further expand our backlog in the fourth quarter to a year-end estimate of at least $80
billion. Our ability to continue the expansion of our backlog is strategically important, as it helps solidify our business
and provides visibility into our future financial outlook. Our strong backlog, consisting of multiple years of prior fiscal
appropriations driven by our longer cycle production programs, provides a level of financial stability and strategic
differentiation in this era of potential government budget uncertainty.
Another area within which we achieved significant strategic progress this quarter was in the international business
arena. As you recall, we have a stated goal to expand our international sales content to at least 20% of revenues in the
next few years. To achieve this goal, we have moved aggressively to build upon our longstanding in-country presence
and further strengthen relationships with international countries around the world through partnerships, in-country
production and establishment of in-country joint technology offices. All of these actions are essential to enable
expansion of international work for the corporation.
Financial benefits to the corporation are increased sales, cash flow, and earnings contribution. Benefits to our
customers are increased factory loading and our ability to improve cost to a higher production throughput. Specific
events furthering our international expansion were seen across multiple business areas this quarter and included
finalization of the multi-billion dollar award from the United Arab Emirates for our THAAD missile defense system.
This was a significant strategic event with the UAE serving as the inaugural international customer for the THAAD
system. Demand for this proven system is only growing and has been expressed by numerous countries from the Asia
Pacific region to the Middle East.
Additionally, finalization of our LRIP six and seven contracts on the F-35 program contained a growing component of
international work, with inclusion of new aircraft awards for Australia, Italy, Norway, and the United Kingdom.

Looking forward into 2014, Japan and Israel are scheduled to finalize new orders, which would further expand our
international backlog. Additional international work can be seen on the near horizon with the Netherland's
announcement of its first order to procure joint strike fighters for its national defense. We look forward to providing
these revolutionary aircraft to one of our key strategic partner countries.
Finally, we were pleased that South Korea plans to reopen the competition for their future fighter program potentially
providing us a new customer opportunity for our fifth generation F-35 fighter and further growth in international
activity. Our international work is expected to grow and help mitigate domestic pressures in 2014 with growth visible
and achievable due to our backlog of existing work. Our international expansion is broad based, is happening now and
we feel increasingly confident about our achievement of our stated goal of at least 20% in the near future.
Let me turn to cash flow. Our ability to deliver consistently strong cash flows continues to be a strategic differentiator
for our corporation. The importance of cash is embedded in our corporate DNA. I was pleased that we were again able
to increase our 2013 cash flow outlook this quarter. Our strong and increasing cash flow enabled us to invest prudently
in the future of the corporation in areas such as capital expenditures and research and development while also providing
the ability to pursue our cash deployment strategy for returns to shareholders in the areas of increasing dividends and
share repurchases. We continue to strongly believe in the return of value to shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases.
As I look forward, our future cash flows are expected to be aided by increasing levels of customer advances from
growing international work and recovery of our $8 billion in prior year's pension contributions. We feel very good
about our future cash and the potential for continued strong and increasing cash flows that will position the corporation
to differentiate from competitors.
Before turning the call over to Bruce to cover financials, I wanted to briefly speak about government budgets. Last
week, agreement was reached to implement a continuing resolution to fund FY 2014 government expenditures through
January 15, 2014. This action enabled federal agencies to return to work and eliminated the partial government
shutdown.
The agreement also extended the nation's debt limit authority until February 7, 2014, avoiding a default that could have
occurred last week. Additionally, Congress agreed to conduct conference committee discussions on FY 2014 budget
levels and cost elements with a goal for completion of a budget agreement by December 13, 2013.
These actions are a step forward as they enable resumption of full government and contractor operations during the
periods outlined. A resumption of normal work is the best path forward to eliminate disruptions to operations, enable
cost affordability and savings initiatives to progress and provide critical equipment and services to our customers.
There is still much budget work to be done by Congress to address the debt ceiling before February 7, and determine
the level of funding for the entire 2014 fiscal year before the continuing resolution expires next January. We continue
to urge Congress and the Administration to focus on long-term solutions to confront the difficult fiscal issues facing our
country and avoid a repeat of the disruption that the nation recently experienced.
As part of those solutions, we also ask that they address and revise the across-the-board budget reduction policy
required under the current sequestration law. This non-strategic allocation of budget reductions is not good for our
nation or our national security strategy. With the closure of government fiscal year 2013, we can now determine that
budget reduction actions implemented under sequestration will result in a limited impact to our portfolio of programs in
2013 with impact seen primarily on our shorter cycle business.
Our original estimate of $825 million in potential reduction to revenues was significantly muted due to our large
backlog of work remaining unaffected by FY 2013 budget cuts. This enabled us to refine our revenue outlook for
calendar year 2013 to a new guidance value of approximately $45 billion, better than we projected on our July earnings
call.
As we look forward into 2014, clearly there is no shortage of possible government budget outcomes. These outcomes
range from full implementation of sequestration cuts required under the Budget Control Act to less severe scenarios.

These multiple scenarios are challenging to predict; however, with our anticipated strong year-end backlog I spoke to
earlier aided by growing international revenues unaffected by U.S. Government budget actions, we are expecting to see
mitigation of financial impacts on our corporation.
Accordingly, we are providing initial trend analysis for 2014 that projects our revenues to be only slightly below 2013
levels.
I'll now ask Bruce to go through some of the details of our 2013 financial performance and 2014 trend analysis and
then we'll open up the line for your questions.
Bruce L. Tanner
Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments please follow along with
the web charts that we included with our earnings release today.
Let's start with chart three and an overview of the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $11.3 billion, down from last year
but slightly ahead of our expectations. Segment operating margin continued to be very strong at 12.8% and this strong
performance contributed to a 16% increase in earnings per share to $2.57 from continuing operations.
We generated $900 million in cash from operations after a $750 million pension contribution. We continue to reward
our shareholders with almost $1 billion of cash returned through the repurchase of nearly 5 million shares along with
our quarterly dividend payment.
As expected, we received $15 billion in orders in the quarter, which brings our backlog to just under $79 billion. And
finally, due to our operating performance, we increased our 2013 outlook for segment operating profit, earnings per
share and cash from operations.
Chart four shows our sales and segment operating margin for the third quarter this year versus last year. Our sales were
4% lower than last year, but ahead of our expectations after sequestration was enacted. Segment operating margin
increased 70 basis points over the third quarter of last year to 12.8%, continuing the strong performance we've achieved
thus far this year. We'll show the breadth of the margin improvement on chart five, which shows our third quarter
segment operating margins for each of the five business areas compared with last year's results.
Segment margins were higher or comparable in four of the five business areas. Improvements in Missiles and Fire
Control resulted from improved performance across a number of programs, most notably in air and missile defense
programs such as PAC-3 and THAAD and fire control programs such as the LANTIRN and Sniper programs.
Improvements in Mission Systems and Training were also broad-based with the largest improvement coming from our
radar programs.
Margins in Aeronautics and IS&GS were slightly higher or comparable, while our margin in Space Systems remained
strong but was 60 basis points lower than the third quarter of last year. Last year's results were the highest level ever
experienced in Space Systems and included significantly higher earnings from our United Launch Alliance and United
Space Alliance joint ventures, the latter due to wind down activities in 2012.
Turning to chart six, we'll discuss our earnings per share. EPS from continuing operations in the quarter was 16%
higher than a year ago at $2.57 per share, driven primarily by improved margins and a lower FAS/CAS adjustment this
year. On a pension adjusted basis, our EPS grew to $2.80 per share in the quarter.
On chart seven, we'll discuss our cash from operations in the quarter. We continued to have excellent cash generation
with $900 million in the quarter. Although that is lower than last year's level, we made a $750 million pension
contribution this year, while no contribution was made in the third quarter of last year. We've completed our planned
funding of pension plans in 2013 and consistent with our historical practices, we'll evaluate making additional
contributions to our pension trust at year-end, but only to the extent that these contributions will not impact our ability
to generate $4.3 billion in cash from operations.

Turning to chart eight, we'll discuss our cash return to shareholders in the quarter. We returned almost $1 billion to
shareholders this quarter through share repurchases and dividends. The level of share repurchases was more than
double what we did in the third quarter of last year, and brings the total cash returned so far this year to more than $2.6
billion.
Moving to chart nine, we'll look at our backlog and book-to-bill ratio since last year. Consistent with the quarterly
backlog profile we provided at the beginning of the year, our backlog grew to just under $79 billion this quarter,
achieving a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.3. We continue to expect that backlog will increase further in the fourth
quarter, and end the year above the $80 billion level.
On chart 10, we provide our updated guidance. As we said on the last call, the effects of sequestration were not as great
this year as we'd initially modeled them to be. And we now feel comfortable in saying our sales for the year are
anticipated to be around the $45 billion level. Reflecting our strong operational performance throughout this year, we're
increasing our forecasted segment operating profit by $125 million. Partially offsetting improvements in our segment
operating performance is an increase in our unallocated expenses for severance charges related to a reduction in force
announced last week in our MST business area, and a net increase in expenses for our deferred compensation plans.
The net increase in operating earnings results in an increase to our earnings per share guidance of $0.20, to $9.40 to
$9.70 per share. And finally, we increased our expectations for cash from operations by $100 million to equal or better
than $4.3 billion.
Chart 11 shows our updated outlook for both sales and segment profit by business area and ties to the guidance updates
from the previous chart. On chart 12 we provide our initial view of our expectations for 2014. We believe sales next
year will be only slightly below the 2013 level with growth in our Aeronautics business area offsetting reductions in
our IS&GS and Space Systems business areas, while both Missiles and Fire Control and Mission Systems and Training
are expected to be relatively comparable to their 2013 levels. And we expect our segment operating margins to be
lower than this year's record level, but above the 11.5% level in total as we experience the dilutive effect of F-35
production growth in Aeronautics as we described for several quarters, along with the absence of several non-recurring
benefits in the other business areas this year.
We expect our FAS/CAS pension adjustment will provide income of $150 million in 2014 after several years of
reducing our reported earnings. Our assumptions that less of the favorable adjustment are a 75-basis-point increase on
the discount rate of 4.75%, a low single-digit return on assets in 2013 and a $1 billion – excuse me, $1 billion in
pension funding in 2014.
Finally, we have our summary on chart 13. We've had outstanding performance all during 2013, and we expect that to
continue and result in a very solid year, particularly in this dynamic environment. With our current portfolio as well as
our enhanced focus on international expansion, we like our strategic positioning heading into the next few years. We
provided outstanding value to shareholders this year from both a total shareholder return perspective as well as with
cash returned to shareholders. And while we're providing high-level trend information today, we'll provide our usual
detailed guidance during the January call.
With that, we're ready for your questions, Stephanie?

<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Marillyn and Bruce, I was wondering if you could just walk us through the assumptions with
your major programs that are embedded in your outlook for 2014 just so we have some of the building blocks and can
kind of track progress as we go along.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, Jason, I'll give you a high-level view and if Marillyn has something to add, I'll throw in
a couple of other – or she can throw in a couple of topics as well. So maybe just starting with the biggest business area,
Aeronautics, probably the topic that you'd be curious about is the aircraft quantity changes say from this year to next
year. So, think of the F-35 quantities; we're going to finish the year probably around 36 aircraft deliveries or so. We
expect that to grow somewhat next year to maybe 38, maybe a couple more than that, but somewhere in that range.
Our F-16 deliveries this year are 13 aircraft. That's expected to grow perhaps to about 15 aircraft next year. C-130Js, I
think we're going to do about 24 to 25. There's one that's kind of on the bubble delivering this year or next year. If it
happens this year, it'll be 25. Even if that happens this year, we still think we'll stay steady at about the 24 aircraft level
next year and C-5s, this one is ramping up between 2013 and 2014. We're going to deliver somewhere between, I'll say
five to as many as eight this year. But in any event, we think we'll grow that number to 10 aircraft next year and the
reason we're a little hesitant on giving the numbers for 2013 is because of some of the activities that led to the de-book
this quarter relative to some of the over and above work that we're experiencing in those aircraft that could cause delay
of some of those deliveries this year.
If I think around the other business areas, you should think we're seeing a slight reduction in quantities of some of our
air and missile products associated with the PAC-3 program. But that's more than offset in Missiles and Fire Control by
increases in the THAAD production quantities; think of that both domestically as well as with the recently completed
UAE international order.
We have no commercial satellites or commercial launches next year in our Space Systems business. We expect to have,
obviously, no large programs that jump out on our IS&GS business area. But we expect to see a continued downward
trend within IS&GS probably somewhere in the – think of that as the high-single-digit range level between 2013 and
2014. So that probably covers a bunch of programs, Jason. There may be others you want to hear about, and if so,
others can ask on the call when we go down to further questions.

Our next question comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Morning, Rich.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher>: Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Morning.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: I was interested – it's kind of a two-part question on your comments, Marillyn, at the
opening and on the 4Q bookings chart on chart nine. One, should we kind of infer that there's very little risk from the
government shutdown on 4Q bookings in terms of what the government's going to want to contract? And then as a
second part, I found it interesting that you had enough confidence in your outlook to talk about 2014 trends. Could you
discuss what's driving your confidence in your outlook, just especially given where the Congress and the
Administration are? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Rich, I'll give a shot at both of those and we'll see if Marillyn has some color
commentary to provide beyond that. So fourth quarter orders, we do feel very comfortable in stating what we said
relative to expectations that we'll grow backlog between now and the end of the year. And in particular the reason that

we feel that way is there are really very few competitive awards expected to occur in the fourth quarter and we have
really no reliance on new start programs in the quarter either. And just as importantly, while we're operating in a
continuing resolution environment, we believe all the awards that we're expecting to receive in the quarter can be
awarded under the continuing resolution.
So just to maybe name a couple of them that we expect that will lead to the year-end backlog numbers we talked, the
most significant awards are occurring in our Space Systems business, so think of that as the SBIRS spacecraft 5 and 6
contract definitization by the end of the year, the annual – in this case the FY 2014 annual installment of the fleet
ballistic missile award. We expect to receive a pretty significant contract extension on the Orion program within
NASA. And as I go – so those are probably the most significant, all of which are in space. If I go to other business
areas, we're expecting things like the normal sort of FY 2014 award of the C-5 modernization aircraft this year. We
should close hopefully on the FY 2013 contract to finalize or definitize the C-130 deliveries for the U.S. Government.
And then we've got just a whole slew of sort of what I would call the numerous funding from fiscal year 2014 funds
becoming available for things like JASSMs, PAC-3s, sustainment contrast across multiple business areas. So again, we
feel pretty good about all those happening; again, not anything that I would say is in a competitive award that could be
pushed out or that we could lose in the fourth quarter that would diminish those numbers.
So, I think it's just a really good visibility as we go into 2014 as well. I think you asked about the 2014 guidance and
maybe expressed some surprise that we were at the levels we are. So maybe at a high level, I'll just talk about what
we're seeing in 2014. As Marillyn said, we do expect sales to be slightly lower than 2013. And you should think of that
as we are going to see growth in Aeronautics. That's primarily coming from the F-35 production program as well as the
C-5M delivery growth numbers that I talked about earlier. And that's offsetting reductions, and as I said IS&GS and
Space. And Missiles and Fire Control and MST again are fairly comparable.
Margins, again, we expect to remain above 11.5% and I've talked in quarters past about what I like to refer to as sort of
the algebra effect of the F-35s where we get higher volume on the F-35 program at lower margins than the overall
margins of aeronautics and that has the effect of lowering margins in Aero overall. Missiles and Fire Control and
IS&GS, I would think, are going to be relatively comparable to 2013 whereas Space and MST, probably a little lower
than where we experienced this year, but still very strong relative to recent history in both those business areas. And
this is due to a number of non-recurring events – positive events that occurred in 2013. Space also has the lower equity
earnings expectation in 2014 compared to 2013.
So, Rich, maybe just to sum up, 2014, I would say, from a margin perspective looks very similar to 2013 when we
began the year just without sort of performance improvements that we experienced throughout 2013 that we've yet to
obviously experience in 2014. Maybe one last note on 2014, you should see the tax rate in 2014 increase a little bit over
2013. You'll recall we actually had two tranches, if you will, of R&D tax credit in the year 2013. So probably more
than you wanted to know there, Rich, but hopefully that covers your question.

<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Morning.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I am interested in understanding the trends in IS&T a little bit better. If you look – and I
guess I would put that in conjunction with the comments that you made around sequestration in that sequestration – the
impact this year was a little bit less than you had thought. What I'm trying to get at is, is this largely a timing issue or
have some other things happened that has kind of strengthened the picture this year? And then, how does that link to

IS&T, which you've said will be weaker next year, and does it play into the civil, the defense, or the Intel portions of it?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: So, Doug, I would just say to that point, when we gave some insight earlier in the year
about what we expected on the impact of sequestration, it really was looking across all of our businesses. We did
recognize that our shorter cycle business like IS&GS would have a more significant near-term impact, but that was just
modeling that Bruce and his team did just to kind of take a look at what was the outlook for the year of things that
could be impacted. We have not seen that impact. And so it wasn't really just because of IS&GS. IS&GS is – because it
has a large IT infrastructure work and support in the information technology area, has been impacted because that's an
area that the government can cut back on pretty readily.
It is, as I said, it is a shorter cycle business. Where we see growth there – potential growth for us is in the cyber security
arena. But that's a – it's a fairly new area for us. So, we'll continue to see some offset of growth there. Bruce, I don't
know if you want to add some other...?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, maybe just, I think you asked a question about where we're seeing that maybe by the
LOBs for civil, defense and intelligence. So, we're actually seeing a little bit of growth in our defense business and a lot
of that's because we've won – going back to Marillyn's comment, we've won several sort of cyber activities from
competitors, sort of – what we refer to as playing offense, if you will, in that arena that we've been successful on. And
that's one of the reasons why the defense business is growing this year over last year.
As we look next year, there's not as many of those sorts of competitions coming up. I believe all three lines of business,
civil, defense and intelligence, in next year's numbers as we sit here today, Doug, we're expecting to reduce compared
to 2013. And I think that's just sort of the combination of two things, one that is what – and I've always said when
you're the largest provider of IT services to the Federal Government for 18 straight years now, I believe, that when the
Federal Government's budget goes down, you're likely to go down as well.
We expect that to happen again in 2014. And the other side of that is I'll say we have, within the numbers that I talked,
within the ranges that I talked and the trend information, sort of considered an ongoing sequestration level impact this
year as well. So, the combination of those two events is what we see happening within IS&GS.
I always like to close that by saying at some point, IT spending has to increase. You cannot continually reduce IT
spending for the Federal Government and expect to provide the services that the population expects, and at some point
it will turn the other way.

Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q>: Hi, good morning. This is actually [ph] Elizabeth (32:25) in for Ron today.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Elizabeth.
<Q>: Hi. We see – we've actually seen Boeing really emphasize recently their Partnering for Success program where
they're trying to get 15% out of their suppliers and we were just wondering, with all the cash that you're returning to
shareholders and the DoD under so much pressure, at what point do you think the DoD sort of tries to implement its
own Partnering for Success and take 15% from the defense contractors?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Well, I'll let Marillyn tell you from her perspective, Elizabeth. I don't think we've ever
stopped trying to do what we think makes sense economically and from an affordability perspective with our supply
chain. And we maybe have a little different view of this than some in that we think the real ability to influence the
supply chain starts actually with the designs that we come up with and how we can make those more affordable to build
and sustain going forward.
So, it's not something that we woke up overnight and realized that we had to cut the elements of our supply chain to
become affordable. We're – probably two-thirds of our cost of sales today are in the supply chain. If we are going to be

affordable, it's going to have to include our supply chain and always has, and that's a focus that we do today. We have, I
would argue, very good relationships with our supply chain. We have annual sessions where we meet with them.
Actually, Marillyn has spoken to that group en masse to show the emphasis that we place on our supply chain and
expectation is not just of affordability, but of quality, of schedule timeliness and the like. So this is something that
we've put in place for quite some time that is not a new item for us.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: I would add to that, Elizabeth, I think if you're asking, is our customer treating us as their
supplier in a fashion that they were going to put some – push on us to be more affordable, they have been. I mean that
is a – they have been very clear that is a top priority for them. They're dealing with very significant budget constraints
and increasing global security demands. So they're challenged. And across our industry, they have pressed for us all to
be more affordable in solutions that we provide them and in how we manage our business. It's not something that is
new to us.
We've been very proactive as leaders in the industry to drive down our cost and we have taken actions to reduce our
footprint. We've had to take some painful actions in reducing our workforce at times to adjust to the business base. We
are investing in technology to provide them with a more affordable product. So we take the weight out or we make it –
overall total cost lower. A lot of things that we're doing to support our customers' drive for affordability.
And at the same time, they offer incentive provisions to get a cost savings, because it is so critically important to them.
So in some of our contracts, we have those types of incentives to encourage us to continue to drive cost down. So as
Bruce said, we manage our supply chain; it's an ongoing effort on our part to make sure that we get the best value from
them in terms of cost, schedule, quality and at the same time, we want to provide our customer with the most affordable
solutions and the most technically capable solutions for what their needs are.

Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thanks so much and great performance again.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Thank you, Cai.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Thank you.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: So, I have a two-part question. First, you talked about sales being down modestly next year.
Could you talk about international, if that's growing, what sort of growth do you see in international and what are the
key drivers? And secondly DoD, as it looks at the fiscal 2015 budget, has some priority programs and some bill-payer
programs – potential bill-payer programs. Included in those are C-130, C-5 and LCS. Maybe you could comment on
your thoughts as to whether those programs, you think, are at risk in the FY 2015 budget. Thanks.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: So on the international growth side, we certainly continue to see growth in F-35. In fact,
over the next five years close to half of the orders will be international deliveries for the F-35 as we move forward. On
C-130J, there continues to be a demand for the C-130J and we continue to sell F-16s around the world. We see growth
in those areas. Missile defense is another very important element for us in our international growth. Bruce talked about
THAAD and PAC-3 and of course we have our operations for Aegis Ashore. And then, we do see other opportunities
for us as we look forward into the – in the satellite, commercial satellite arena and cyber security and our IT arena for
growth in the sale – in international growth. On the F-15 priorities, you mentioned C-130, LCS and C-5. All of those
are part of the strategic management review that was done by the U.S. Government. They are high-priority programs
and in addition to those, I think missile defense continues to be a high-priority program.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: And the other thing I would add, Cai, is I was a little surprised to hear C-130 mentioned in
that comment. We're one of the few programs in the DoD that's, actually is being considered for a multiyear program to
buy an additional 79 aircraft for a couple of the services right now. I think that's got strong support. It obviously has a
reduced – or an affordability aspect to it versus buying them on individual fiscal years that has, I think, been well

Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, David. Are you on mute?
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey there.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Morning.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning, Marillyn. Wanted to ask you about back on sequestration. So, when you
stated in the release that you receive all impacts known associated with sequestration, just so I'm clear, that – you're
assuming inherently in that that sequestration as it relates to fiscal 2014 comes through as we know it now, it's another
$15 billion to $20 billion cut off of the total DoD budget. And then the last part of my question, maybe if you could
walk us through, Bruce, I think back in January, or maybe it was in April, you put together that slide that showed us in
terms of the total revenues that would be impacted by sequestration, I think you were saying something like 20%. What
does that number move to in 2014?
So in other words, how much of your – what proportion do you think of your revenues will actually be impacted by
sequestration in 2014? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Okay, thank you, David. It's a good question. So, let me give you maybe a long windy
answer on the sequestration impacts for next year and I think I'll cover hopefully both of your questions in this answer.
If not, again, maybe you can come back on and ask the question again.
So we still think sequestration and how that impacts 2014 is broken up from our business area perspective into sort of
the long-cycle businesses and short cycle. We always refer to Aeronautics and Space, for instance, as long-cycle
businesses. But there are also large parts of Missiles and Fire Control and Mission Systems and Training that are also
really considered to be long-cycle businesses as well.
So, you should think of those as, in my words, being relatively insulated from the effects of sequestration in FY 2014
because most of their calendar year 2014 sales are from prior fiscal year funded activities, or prior fiscal year funded
backlog. That also says there's not probably as much upside if sequestration improves over what our expectations are
either in those long-cycle businesses.
Our short-cycle businesses, and primary one being the IS&GS, but it has smaller parts of Missiles and Fire Control and
Mission Systems and Training as well. We've baked some pretty good reductions into the numbers that we're expecting
relative to the guidance – or excuse me, the trend information we provided to the slightly less than 2013 sales. Those
reductions are planned in that outlook already and we think that pretty much captures what we think will happen under
a sequestration environment under a lot of different scenarios that we can think off. And the reason for that is, while we
say they're short-cycle businesses, each one of those businesses, IS&GS, the services part of MFC, the services part of
MST have backlog from prior year funding that's actually greater than one-time sales in each case.
So, though it's not as along or it's not as significant in terms of the backlog as the long-cycle business, and there is
definitely more current year awards to current year sales going on in those business areas, it is more insulated than
perhaps you might think. And I think we experienced that ourselves when we tried to do the modeling at the start of
this year, that we actually have more insulation, in my words, than maybe we would've otherwise thought we'd had at
the start of the year. There's also the aspect next year that we don't want to lose track, back to, I guess, Cai's question.
We do expect international growth to occur next year both in terms of absolute dollars as well as on a percent of sales
basis. So that helps to mitigate any downside we're seeing from the sequestration impact as well.

And finally, at least as we've looked at it, we think there is minimal, if really any reliance on 2013 unobligated funds,
balance that's left outstanding at the end of the fiscal year to become 2014 sales for Lockheed Martin. So, if those funds
were to evaporate, if those funds were to be used to offset FY 2014 sequestration reductions, we think, again, we are
again, insulated from that aspect as well. So, hopefully that covers the two questions you had there, David.

Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi, good morning, everybody.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Morning.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher>: Morning, Noah.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: I guess I'm trying to figure out how to parse – to me revenue being down slightly is a positive
surprise given what the budget's doing and that you're the bellwether in defense. And I hear you saying, and I know that
you have well positioned favored programs, and I also hear you saying and know that it's a long-cycle business. I guess
I'm trying to sort of quantify or parse out how much of each of those two items it really is in 2014? Because if it's
almost entirely just favored programs, that would suggest you could move back to actually growing sooner than later if
sequestration is the last cut, whereas if it's long – if it's more being long cycle than it is favored programs, that would
suggest you actually have several more years of not really being able to grow the top line even if sequestration as the
last cut.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, so, interesting question, Noah, and I'll see if I can parse my answer to the way you
parsed your questions. As we look into 2014, I think one of the things that may surprise some folks going forward is
that we're actually probably seeing more growth in the F-35 program and next year, the number that we are trending
towards is slightly less than $45 billion next year, than maybe a lot of people would have expected.
So, just in big numbers, an F-35 is going to be 15% or 16% of the sales in the corporation in 2013 and F-35 jointly
between the development program and the production program. But all the growth coming from the production
program is probably going to grow some 15% year-over-year from 13% to 14%. So I think that's one of those
programs, Noah, that I would characterize as both long cycle and the right priority. I think the prioritization has been
demonstrated continually throughout the past year, both domestically and internationally, with the support that we're
getting on the program and obviously by definition, I guess it's a long cycle program.
I think we've got other programs of that same ilk. The C-130, I mentioned was the multiyear, the air missile defense
programs where they're both long cycle and high priority; LCS is another one that I'd fall in that category. So I'll tell
you, and I'll let Marillyn opine here also on it because I know she feels strongly about this. But we've said all along we
think that we have the best portfolio in the business. We think we have the opportunity to sell that portfolio
internationally, which helps to mitigate or mute the impacts of the domestic reductions. And so I don't think that the
scenario you describe, where we would expect to see growth, depending on how sequestration plays out in 2014 is
unrealistic at all.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Yeah, I would just agree with what Bruce has outlined for you. We've talked, as you said
yourself, we have a well-positioned portfolio of programs and as Bruce outlined, where we see the growth
opportunities in 2014, if there is an impact from sequestration, as we – if there's a full impact from sequestration we've
walked through for you where the impact would be on the shorter cycle businesses. If we don't see that same significant
level, we should expect to have some offset there and then the longer cycle businesses we're on – we do see growth,
continued growth in the area of Missile Defense and the F-35 and even F-16 upgrades and a number of other
opportunities on C-130J's internationally as well as the multiyear program.

Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Couple of green eyeshade type questions for you, Bruce. Just on the margins, maybe it would
help if you quantified a little bit the two items that you say might pressure segment margins next year. How much
pressure do you see on the F-35 becoming a bigger part of the mix? Because you're at 12.8% year-to-date on segment
margins, and it just seems like 11.5%, there's a lot of room to come in ahead of 11.5% even given some of the
pressures.
And the second part of that is just on MST in particular, you highlighted radar programs as being a big driver of upside
BAC adjustments in the quarter. Are you getting into a situation there where you could for a few quarters get some
upside just given the opportunities on those contracts or is this truly do you think not sustainable? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, thanks, Joe. So let's see, the F-35 in the reference to what's happening with the F-35
growth and its impact on Aeronautics' margin. First off, I know you're looking at the 12.8%, but I think if you – that's
where we ended the quarter. I think that's the highest quarter we've ever had in the history of the corporation. If you go
to the full year, I think we're looking – if you go to the midpoint of guidance, probably in the 12.3% to 12.4% range.
So,
I'm not going to debate to whether that's going down or up relative to 11.5%. It obviously is, but it may not be from the
12.8% that you're starting from.
The other thing I tried to emphasize was, on a previous question was that the 11.5% that we're talking about actually
looks a lot like where we started the year 2013. I forgot what our guidance was when we started the year, but it was
somewhere in the 11.6% or 11.7% if I recall. It kind of feels like a similar level to me as where we started in 2013.
Most years we have had positive performance improvements throughout the year that have enabled us to have benefit.
We don't count on those happening every year when we provide the initial guidance. But I think our track record for
most years would say that's been where we've been successful.
So as I look at Aeronautics, I would expect that reduction to occur; I mean from a margin perspective 2013 versus 2014
they're going to – I think if you go to the midpoint, they're probably in the 11.4%ish range and I would think that we'll
still see somewhere in 11% margins even with the dilutive effect of the F-35 and C-5 increases in Aeronautics.
The point I tried to make in my prepared remarks was that in particular within MST we had, I believe in the second
quarter, that was the highest margin in the history of MST. And we had a few contractual resolutions there that we did
describe in both the press release and the Q that you should think of being $75ish million or so. On top of that we have
had very good performance. You mentioned the radar programs; those are very good.
I think that's a business that kind of stays in the 11%ish range on a kind of a go-forward basis. And then you didn't ask
about it, but the one I mentioned previously was the Space Systems company with the joint venture and equity
earnings. We've had some high equity earnings this year really associated with launch-related activities. Those are
expected to come down a little bit next year. Could we see the same experience with some performance out of ULA
next year as we saw this year? Yes. But are we planning on that with our guidance? Not at this point in time.
So, Space Systems, I'm very pleased with the margins there. And again this is probably the highest year in the history
of Space. I think that's a business that probably stays in the 12% range going into next year. So, as we sit here today,
we're not at all displeased with where we expect the margins to go next year and I'd say we have the same sorts of
opportunities to increase those margins next year as we did this year.

<Q - Robert Stallard>: Good morning.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher>: Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Rob.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: On the F-35 on the most recent contract you signed, I was wondering if you can give us some
color on how the contractual terms might have changed and how your discussions with the customer have progressed –
the U.S. Government customer?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: So let's see, Rob, I guess the first thing is we negotiated Lot 6 and 7 combined if you will.
They're separate contracts, but we did do them all essentially concurrently and we did so in about six months' time
versus Lot 5 where we probably took about 18 months. So I think we're on a good path there. As far as contractually
speaking, we do have essentially a fixed price contract, and I'd say essentially because there is a little bit of potential
share on under run there, between the government and ourselves. There's no share on the overrun. So think of a fixed
price in that regard.
And I'm trying to think, Rob, I think off the top of my head, I think most other terms and conditions that we negotiated
with Lot 5 carried over. And so I'm looking at Marillyn here. She was very engaged in Lot 5 – carried over into Lot 6
and 7. I don't think we had much to speak of that changed of anything there. So, I'll probably leave it at that.

had – we've been engaged on the Aegis system for the past 42 years. So we had deep understanding of that program

of direct commercial contracts planned in the 2014 timeframe that would sort of bring typical advance payments with
them. Most of our international growth next year comes in the form of foreign military sales contracts. So I wouldn't
expect to see the same sorts of advances that we've had in the past that result in our advance balance growing on the
balance sheet there.
Working capital wise, I think we're going to see some improvement there as we go through the production and we
obviously have some withhold associated with the business system rule for things like the Earned Value Management
System that have been made pretty public that we expect to finalize and that will improve the working capital position
associated with those.
I think from a thinking or planning perspective, you should think of next year's number, I think, being higher than the
level of cash that we're going to generate in 2013. I know I said in the – either in a response to question or in my
prepared remarks, we talked about the potential for looking in the fourth quarter at additional pension contributions.
Even with that, I said we would stay above the $4.3 billion level in 2013 and I think we'll be north of that in 2014.

And our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yeah, good morning, Bruce.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Marillyn.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: The question I've got is two parts. Last year's ending funded backlog was $55 billion versus
the $82 billion that you quote. Given that the funding is less assured these days, what do you figure the funded backlog
will end this year? And then my second one is, I know you've given some color to try and mitigate why sales are only
down a few percent next year. But just conceptually, I mean you'll be down 4% to 5% this year. And next year the
budget's worst, the sequestration impact is worse, so maybe a little more clarity on why you think you'll actually
decline less next year than this year. Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: So, George, good questions as usual. So I'm doing this a little off the top of my head, U.S.
funded backlog at the end of last year, funded at the end of this year and maybe embedded in your question was, don't
you have more risk, the difference between funded and unfunded. I think the key distinction there is what's obligated
versus necessarily what's funded. The real issue from a sequestration perspective is taking those unobligated funds.
And those are the ones that are really at risk. That's the reason I made the comments before about, again why we think
we have in 2014 a pretty good handle on what our revenue's going to be, as we don't have that reliance on the
unobligated funds turning into sales in 2014. I don't particularly see an issue with the funded backlog balance at the end
of this year. I think it will be comparable on an either percentage basis or an absolute basis to where we ended last year
– rough comps on a percentage basis relative to the ending backlog amount.
So I don't think that's an issue that I'm particularly concerned about as we sit here today. Going forward you asked
about why – my paraphrase, why we feel comfortable with saying we're going to be relatively comparable to the 2013
sales, even though it appears the budget is going down more. You're absolutely right with that.
Going back to the question I think Noah asked, it is a function of our portfolio; it's the things that I talked about when I
described the sequestration impacts. We do expect international sales to grow both on a percentage basis and on an
absolute dollar basis. We have – our single largest program, the F-35, as I said is expected to grow 15%. We have other
growth in particular in air and missile defense products of – in Missiles and Fire Control. And so for all the reasons that
I went around the horn earlier by each business area, we feel pretty good about that.

The things that I would think could change that dramatically, George, from what we're expecting to see now is if sort of
obligated, under-contract programs were terminated or partially terminated. And if that were to happen sort of all bets
are off. But that's not a scenario that we're counting on or guiding towards at all when we give our trend information for
2014.

Stephanie, I think we're maybe a minute past the hour here. So I'm going to maybe turn it back over to Marillyn for her
final thoughts.
Marillyn A. Hewson
Thanks, Jerry. As we conclude today, I believe our third quarter results and increased guidance illustrate the solid
position and performance of the corporation to provide solutions to customers and value to shareholders. In an
uncertain budget environment, our strong backlog of work, our solid balance sheet, a robust cash generation and the
exceptional execution of our employees will continue to propel our corporation forward. I'm confident in our future
because of the outstanding performance, innovation and integrity of our workforce, as we support our customers and
their essential missions.
Thanks again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you in our next earnings call in
January. Stephanie, that concludes our call today.
Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect and have a
wonderful day.
