our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements.
Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, but involve a
number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially.
We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. We request that you review the reconciliations to GAAP statements
provided with our earnings news release and today's slides, which are posted on our website.
Our agenda today will start with Ed providing his perspective on the company's performance and the advancement of
our strategic initiatives. Then Nick will review our fourth quarter and full year financial results and 2017 guidance.
Third, Jim will discuss our Agriculture business. We will then take your questions.
With that introduction, It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ed.
Edward D. Breen
Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today I would like to talk about the important progress we made on
our strategic priorities in 2016 and explain why that sets us up so well for 2017 and beyond. As you know, heading into
2016, we targeted certain fundamental metrics that we believe are the right measures of our performance going
forward. Thanks to a lot of hard work throughout DuPont, we improved on all of them.
Company-wide gross margins improved by 60 basis points. Operating costs declined 11%, including a 41% decline in
corporate costs. Operating earnings per share grew 21%. Segment operating margins improved by about 200 basis
points, with increases in all reportable segments. Capital spending declined 27%, and free cash flow improved by $1.6
billion. These improvements were enabled by our leaner, more accountable organizational structure.
We also strengthened our business by improving our focus on the customer and better meeting their needs. For
example, in our seeds business, we moved the southern U.S. and parts of Brazil to an agency sales model. Timing of
seed deliveries primarily related to the southern U.S. route-to-market change pushed about $200 million in sales into
2017. That was clearly the right thing to do. The enhancements to our overall route-to-marketed Ag have improved
customer relationships and strengthened our competitive position. We introduced nearly 1,600 new products into the
marketplace this year.
A good example is our Leptra corn hybrid. We introduced these seeds in Brazil and in one year, they counted for more
than half of our corn sales in the country. Another example is our new lineup of bioactive products serving industries
that range from food and grain processing to household products. In addition, we developed new applications of
existing products, like leveraging Tyvek for a roofing application, which provides moisture protection and installer
safety.
By continuing to invest in R&D and product development, we aim to turn volume gains like those we had throughout
most of this year into sustainable top line growth. In addition to strengthening our position in the marketplace, we
delivered solid results against our strategic priorities, which have made DuPont stronger, more focused, more effective
and efficient.
The first strategic priority was delivering $730 million in year-over-year cost savings, and we surpassed our goal for
2016 by $20 million. We did it without disrupting our businesses.
The second priority was disciplined and productive capital spending. For the year, our CapEx totaled $1 billion, down
$375 million, or 27%, excluding Chemours. Capital spending now is back in line with depreciation and amortization,
and we intend to keep it that way. At the same time, we are fully funding compelling growth projects with solid returns.
An example is the $100 million-plus we approved last year for probiotics production facility expansions in New York
and Wisconsin.
The third priority was working capital performance. We set a goal to improve our working capital by $1 billion over
the medium term. Our free cash flow this year rose by $1.6 billion. Within that total, business working capital

contributed nearly $500 million of the improvement, and we will continue to build on this success. We will continue to
focus on productivity as well, including our production facilities. Plant efficiency and productivity can unlock
significant shareholder value, as I mentioned during the last earnings call.
This past fall, Nick and I visited a host of plant sites around the world, and what we saw confirmed what we suspected.
We have a terrific opportunity to improve throughput rates and our uptime performance to best-in-class levels. These
improvements will benefit our customers, our margins and our returns on capital. It won't happen overnight as it can
take two to three years to implement changes like this and see the benefits.
And finally, I'll close with an update on our planned merger with Dow. While our interactions with regulators and any
discussions of proposed remedies must remain confidential, I can tell you that we continue to work constructively with
authorities in all relevant jurisdictions to secure the necessary approvals to close the merger, which we expect to occur
in the first half of 2017. We are very excited about what this merger will mean for shareholders, for employees and for
all our stakeholders.
With that, now let me turn it over to Nick.
Nicholas C. Fanandakis
Thank you, Ed. Good day, everyone. Beginning with slide 3, we delivered fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.51
per share versus $0.27 per share in the prior year. For the full year, operating earnings totaled $3.35 per share, an
increase of 21% from the prior year. Results for the quarter and the full year reflected disciplined focus on cost savings
against a challenging macro environment.
Consolidated net sales for the quarter of $5.2 billion were down 2% versus prior year. Local price declined by 2%,
while currency benefited sales by 1%. Volume declined 1% as growth in Performance Materials, Electronics &
Communications and Industrial Biosciences was more than offset by declines in the Agriculture, primarily due to the
southern U.S. route-to-market change. Excluding the timing change in Ag, consolidated net sales would have increased
2%.
For the full year, sales of $24.6 billion decreased 2%. Local pricing currency each lowered sales by 1%. From a
regional perspective, we saw organic growth in developing markets in both the quarter and the full year, driven
primarily by increased demand in Asia Pacific. Sales in developing markets represented 34% of total company sales.
Turning now to slide 4. Segment results drove the year-over-year improvement in fourth quarter operating earnings,
contributing $0.14 to the quarter, including a $0.04 benefit from currency. Continued execution on cost savings as well
as improved demand in most of our segments drove the growth in segment operating earnings.
Lower net corporate and interest expenses added $0.06 to earnings in the quarter. Corporate expenses on an operating
earnings basis declined 45% in the quarter versus prior year as a result of our 2016 cost savings program.
Exchange gains and losses contributed $0.05 per share to the quarter's results. The benefit is primarily due to the
absence of a currency devaluation in Argentina in 2015, which negatively impacted prior-year results. A higher tax rate
lowered operating EPS by $0.01 in the quarter due to the geographic mix of our earnings.
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter segment operating earnings analysis on slide 5. Segment operating earnings
increased $150 million or 27% in the quarter versus last year, with operating margin expansion of 305 basis points.
Nutrition & Health results increased $50 million. Growth in sweeteners and probiotics was offset by declines in protein
solutions, resulting in volumes flat versus prior year. Cost savings and a $27 million gain on the sale of an asset drove
the operating earnings improvement year-over-year. Operating margins in this segment improved 615 basis points.
Performance Materials operating earnings increased $47 million. Volume growth continued in the quarter with a 7%
increase, driven by demand in global automotive markets. Operating margins in the segment expanded by 275 basis
points year-over-year.

Electronics & Communications operating earnings increased $11 million. This segment saw a 6% volume gain in the
quarter due to increased demand in Solamet paste. New product introductions resulted in share gains in Solamet
year-over-year. Operating margins improved by 115 basis points in the quarter.
Protection Solutions and Industrial Biosciences each experienced declines in operating earnings in the quarter. Jim will
speak to Agriculture performance later, and I direct you to the materials we posted on the website today for further
details on segment results.
While not depicted on the slide, I would also like to highlight that for the full year, segment operating earnings
increased 9%, resulting in operating margin expansion of about 200 basis points, with growth in each of our reportable
segments.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on slide 6. Free cash flow improved about $1.6 billion year-over-year, with
about $1 billion of the improvement coming from higher cash flow from operations and $600 million from lower
CapEx. Of the $1 billion improvement in cash flow from operations, more than half was attributable to higher earnings.
The remainder of the increase was due to lower tax payments and improvements in business working capital, partially
offset by payments under the 2016 restructuring plan. The businesses continue to drive to best-in-class in working
capital with an overall reduction of about $500 million in the year. Excluding Chemours, our capital expenditures
decreased by $375 million or 27% versus the prior year. We ended the year at $1 billion in CapEx in the line with our
guidance.
In total, the absence of Chemours contributed $400 million of the overall improvement in free cash flow. We ended
2016 with net debt of $2.6 billion, flat versus prior year. Year-end cash balances totaled about $6 billion. For the year,
we completed $916 million in share repurchases under the 2016 program. We retired about 13 million shares at an
average price of $69.61. Average diluted shares outstanding for the full year were about $877 million and about $872
million for the fourth quarter.
On slide 7, for the full year, we delivered $750 million in operating costs reductions, exceeding our commitment of
$730 million under the 2016 plan. Operating costs declined 11% year-over-year on an operating earnings basis. SG&A
costs declined about $540 million or 12%, with most of the decline related to G&A costs. Our corporate costs
decreased about $230 million or 41% for the year. Corporate costs as a percent of sales declined to 1.4% versus 2.3% in
the prior year.
Turning now to slide 8, I'd like to review our assumptions regarding our key markets and the broader economy in 2017.
The U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against most currencies and is expected to be a headwind for us again in 2017.
For the first quarter, the impact of currency will be about $0.01 headwind, given the stronger dollar versus the euro and
most emerging market currencies, to be offset by weaknesses versus the Brazilian real. We expect global growth of
2.7% and global industrial production to increase 2.4% in 2017. The U.S. is expected to improve versus prior year, but
we remain cautious amid economic uncertainty and the stronger dollar. Europe's growth outlook continues to be weak
with economic and political uncertainty. China's slowing continues from the shift of industrial production to services
and consumer segments.
According to the IHS, global auto growth is expected to slow in the 2017, with 1% growth year-over-year. Jim will
speak to our assumptions for 2017 in the Ag market.
With this backdrop, let's turn now to slide 9. As Ed said, we expect the merger to close in the first half of 2017, pending
regulatory approval. Accordingly, we are providing guidance only for the first quarter of the year. We expect first
quarter sales to be about even with prior year, and operating earnings to increase about 8% versus prior year, driven by
benefits from cost savings and the impact of the change in timing for seed deliveries primarily related to the southern
U.S. route-to-market change in Agriculture.
These benefits are anticipated to be partially offset by the expected reduction in planted corn acres in the U.S. We
expect our tax rate – base tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%, an increase from 2016 due to the geographic mix
of earnings. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be in line with annual depreciation and amortization.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim to provide an overview of the results for Agriculture. Jim?
James C. Collins, Jr.
Thanks, Nick, and hello, everyone. I'll provide a review of our full year results, give an update on our performance this
year opposite our three strategic priorities, and share our expectations for the first quarter.
Now throughout 2016, our Ag business executed well in a tough environment and delivered results which were above
the guidance that we provided. Full year sales declined 3%, driven by 2% lower currency and 1% lower volume. Now
full year sales were negatively impacted by the timing of seed sales primarily related to the southern route-to-market
change in the fourth quarter. If we exclude the change in timing of fourth quarter seed sales, our full year sales would
have decreased by 1%. Our year-over-year operating earnings rose 7%, driven by lower costs, partially offset by lower
volume and the negative impact of currency. Operating earnings margin expanded for the year by about 170 basis
points.
Now moving to our performance on our strategic priorities for 2016, which were, first, to achieve our cost reductions
and earnings commitments; second, to deliver on our new product pipeline; and third, plan for the synergy delivery and
ensure the readiness for the new Ag business.
Now our results exceeded expectations in 2016, even in light of the route-to-market change, which has strengthened
our business by extending our advantaged go-to-market strategy to the southern U.S. We also extended this winning
strategy in the Brazilian market. Our strong results were enabled by advancements from our innovation pipeline.
In North America corn, our newest classes of genetics demonstrated strong harvest performance, and products released
in the last two years accounted for more than half of our volume. Led by the launch of Leptra, we grew volume nearly
70% in the Brazil summer season and enabled a multi-point share gain.
In soybeans, our T Series comprised greater than 80% of our lineup in North America, and we launched our first
varieties developed with the AYT 4.0, an advanced proprietary soybean breeding approach focused on increasing yield.
Within crop protection, Rynaxypyr insecticide delivered sales growth in the Asia Pacific, Europe and North America,
and our Zorvec fungicide launch went better than planned.
Lastly, we finalized our integration plans this past year with recent activity focused primarily on ensuring that we
deliver our commitment of $1.3 billion in post-merger cost synergies. We strongly believe that bringing our successful
seed and crop protection businesses together as DowDuPont and becoming one Ag division will increase our ability to
innovate, meet customer needs and deliver returns for our shareholders.
Now turning to the outlook for 2017, we expect the economic environment in the ag sector to remain challenging, with
commodity prices under pressure due to record yields and crop production. As farmers look to relative economics
between crop alternatives, we expect them to favor soybeans over corn in North America, which is generally less
favorable to our overall earnings.
Our order book in North America is tracking with our expectations and is consistent with the projected planted acre
shift to soybeans. In crop protection, we expect the industry decline to ease in 2017, but continue to be negatively
impacted by high inventory levels, a strong dollar and the continued penetration of insect-resistant soybeans.
This season, we are expanding our launch of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans and anticipate FeXapan, our
over-the-top dicamba application, to be approved in time for spring planting. We expect to continued Leptra
penetration in Brazil as we continue one of the fastest ramp-ups in our history. We are planning a limited commercial
introduction of Pioneer brand Qrome products for the 2017 U.S. growing season.
Now this will allow select growers to begin to benefit from this new corn technology and will allow customers to see
and understand the value of these elite new products in their local geographies. We are also expanding our A-Series
soybeans in North America, which are the highest yielding line of soybeans in our history. Within the digital ag

program, growers received value from Encirca Services on more than 2 million paid acres in 2016, and we expect this
to approximately double in 2017.
Now our approach stands apart from competitors in that our nitrogen, fertility and seeding solutions can deliver
measurable profit gains for our customers, enabling a premium value offering. For example, in over 120 nitrogen
service trials, Encirca beat the standard grower practice 74% of the time, with an average yield increase of six bushels
per acre using an average of 9 pounds less nitrogen per acre. In crop protection, we will launch Vessarya, expanding
our portfolio of fungicides to Asian soybean rust and will continue the highly successful launch of Zorvec.
Turning to the first quarter of 2017, we expect the Ag segment sales to be up low single digits percent over 2016, and
operating earnings to be up in the mid single digits percent range, as favorable impacts from the shift in timing of seed
deliveries and pricing are partially offset by the anticipated corn to soybean acreage shift in North America. Within
crop protection, we anticipate expanded availability of our carbamate products, Vydate and Lannate, and earnings
growth as volume increases and we complete the wind-down of activities at our LaPorte facility.
As farm margins continue to tighten, the need for high yields becomes even more imperative. And we are confident
that our portfolio can address this need through our pipeline of new genetics, unique trait combinations, and innovative
crop protection solutions. In 2016, we executed on significant cost reductions, which enabled DuPont Agriculture to
perform well in current conditions and positions us to emerge stronger when markets improve.
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to you, Greg.

<Q - Jonas Oxgaard>: Nice beat there, always good to start the year with going strong.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Thank you.
<A - Edward D. Breen>: Thank you.
<Q - Jonas Oxgaard>: So on the merger, I know you're constrained with what you can and cannot say, but is it mainly
Ag that we are worried about? And if you don't mind, maybe just in more general terms on how do you address the
concern on innovation that the European Commission has raised?
<A - Edward D. Breen>: Yeah, Jonas, let me make a couple comments on it that I think we can obviously say publicly
and there's many things we can't say publicly with the negotiations we've been in. But the main concern is in the crop
protection area, and that's where we've been focused on a remedy package. And the way to resolve the question on
innovation is not just some product but also some R&D resources that go with the product. And that's how you address
that part of the concern.

And our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Good morning. Ed, with the merger now pushed back probably to Q2, has the
ultimate three-way separation also been pushed back from maybe mid 2018 to maybe late 2018?
<A - Edward D. Breen>: Yeah, David, the spins will happen within 18 months of the time we do the merge. So the 18
months won't change. We've got a very detailed timeline between Dow and DuPont to achieve that. When we first
came out, we said 18 to 24 months, but we're highly confident we can pull it off within the 18-month window. And
clearly, we're doing actions now, pre-merge, that just continue to build that confidence because we have more time,
especially around legal entity work and IT-type work which are the long poles in the tent.
Operator
Our next question is from Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Thank you very much. Over the last several quarters, you've clearly done a solid job
on both cutting costs as well as dramatically improving procurement. As you've now had the opportunity to further drill
down into some of the opportunities, can you just offer some further perspective on any new or simply enhanced
opportunities you've uncovered over the past year or so, and how that visibility could lead towards further
improvements within the combined entity? Thank you.
<A - Edward D. Breen>: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. I would say, look, we're always going to stay focused
on cost efforts and being lean and mean, as I like to say. And clearly, we'll ramp those activities up with the merger
with Dow, in the $3 billion program, which by the way I'll say is the floor, not the ceiling on what we're working
towards. So clearly, there'll be a lot of effort in that area that we're focused on and continuing to line up our actions
there. But I would go – there's really two areas I'm very interested in personally with the senior team that I think are our
next big opportunities.
One, I alluded to actually in our prepared remarks and on the last earnings call, it's the capacity release and
reliability-centric focus in our manufacturing footprint. We've asked and are working with all our facilities to come up
with their entitlement program, and we're really focused on the big ones. And the big facilities happen to mostly fall
into what will be the specialty products company, but there are more big complex facilities like where we make Tyvek,
for instance. And we're really convinced now that we have great upside opportunity in the hundreds of millions of
dollars to have improvement there. So that's a big focus going forward. We just started focusing on that in the last four
months or so.
The other area that we've really got to focus on, I think we can gain good momentum, is a shift in our R&D throughput.
And the background of that, I think, is important. The percentage products that were replacement products was a higher
mix in the portfolio in recent years than what I would call growth R&D projects, and we're shifting that mix to more
growth projects with good returns behind them.
That doesn't happen in one year, and by the way, the production facility thing doesn't happen in one year either. But if
we can continue to make a shift in that area over the next few years, we can affect the top line of the company
organically and improve the gross margin line nicely, which we did this year. We had some good wins to get the gross
margins up 60 basis points, but that's where the two big opportunities are past cost actions.
Operator
And our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Thanks very much. It sounds like in your negotiations with the EU, the EU either wants
you to spend more on R&D or divest more assets. Do their requests or the way you see regulatory evolving, does that
mean that your $3 billion in cost savings is now reduced or altered? And in terms of the delay in the merger, is the

delay related solely to the EU extra 10 days? In other words, as a base case, the merger should close May 1? Or is it
more complicated than that and a date closer to June 30 is more reasonable?
<A - Edward D. Breen>: Yeah. Jeff, just the first part of your question, we had hearings very recently with the
European Union, and we've showed them – just going back to your comment about sort of innovation and R&D spend
– that we are not reducing at all the scientists that work on discovery and new product development. One of the key
reasons, obviously, we like the merger here is to create an ag company that has more R&D resources for new product
development.
So where we would make some reductions, in areas like regulatory approval type stuff where you don't need two of that
and the footprint, which is very local around the whole globe in the Ag business, so we've been through that in a lot of
detail.
We did ask for a 10-day extension because we've been in detailed negotiations. It's a lot of paperwork that needs to get
done. And we're just letting you know that, yes, it could be just 10 days into March 14, but we've still got to wrap up all
the other jurisdictions, and some of them tend to wait until you get a couple of the big ones out of the way. So by the
time that follows on and you get that all finished up, my gut is we're in the second quarter, and that's why we guided
where we did.

And our next question's from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Vincent S. Andrews>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Jim, could you give a little bit more detail on the seed
order book and maybe just what you're seeing out in the marketplace from a competitive perspective around pricing in
both corn and soybeans versus your expectations, and remind us what your price card looked like coming into this year
and your performance against that? Thanks.
<A - James C. Collins, Jr.>: Yeah, great. Thanks for the question. Taking a look at the order book, it would show
consistent with what we're seeing out of USDA around a shift in corn acres to soybean acres. So we're feeling that shift
as we start out the year. Our soybean business and soybean acres are also up consistent with that shift, and I think we're
probably even up slightly there as a result of some what I think was pretty impressive product performance that we saw
last fall at harvest. So we're picking a little of that up.
Unfortunately, we'll see a little bit of a timing issue there. We'll tend to see more of our revenue and earnings from the
soybean business land in the second quarter. Just kind of the timing way soybean shipments occur versus corn. So
overall, we think about pricing in especially North America corn card prices, as we've talked about before, are about
flat. Our route-to-market gives us good visibility of that pricing.
We ought to get some benefit from a stronger mix as we continue to rotate out to hybrids. And we've talked about in
the past last year as much as 50% of our lineup was being replaced by newer genetics. That number will continue to
grow now as we've got good traction on that. And overall, if I step away from just – and before I leave North America,
it's still going to be a competitive market, and we know that we've got to be ready to respond if necessary.
If I back away from just North America and I think about pricing just overall, globally, I'd say overall, generally
favorable. We're going to pick up mixed benefit from Leptra, continued penetration in Brazil. We had 70% growth in
our business in Brazil last year and a big chunk of that was Leptra, so the mix effect of more of that genetics coming
into the portfolio.
And then we'll be launching Roundup Ready 2 Xtend, so we've ought to feel some benefits there. I mentioned corn
genetics, and even a little bit attributed to that route-to-market change as we get better visibility of what's going on in
the marketplace.

Our next question is from John Roberts from UBS.
<Q - John Roberts>: Good morning. The Ag business is seasonally low in the U.S. in the December quarter, so was
the minus 4% volume you posted for the U.S. and Canadian region, was that roughly flat to slightly negative for the
non-Ag business? Again, given Ag is probably seasonally low.
<A - James C. Collins, Jr.>: Yeah, so you're right. If you look at that fourth quarter volume response, it is related to
our seed business. It's that route-to-market change in some of the seasonal delivery timing. Globally, that performance,
also still related to our soybean performance in Brazil, we continue to struggle there. We're looking forward to having
the Intacta offering going forward, especially this last quarter. Intacta affected crop protection volumes as well a little
bit there. But if I compare fourth quarter volumes in the seed business versus crop protection, you're right, crop
protection would have been up year-over-year in the fourth quarter, had a pretty strong run. And most of that was North
America and Asia. Good performance in insecticides in Asia Pacific.
<A - Edward D. Breen>: Yeah, and maybe just to add on to that, because you asked about the rest of DuPont, without
that route-to-market change in the fourth quarter, DuPont organically would have been up 2% on sales. So the other
segments were – I won't go through each one – but they were either kind of flat to up some on the organic. But it would
have put us on a positive, so that shift is what did that in the fourth quarter.
By the way, let me just address – Jeff, I apologize, you asked a few-part question there. And I think it's important to
highlight that we're still very committed to the $3 billion in cost savings being the floor. We've always taken into
account there were going to be remedies. We always took into account the remedies would probably be in the area that
I highlighted to you. So we're very confident in that number with the remedy package.

Our next question is from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.
<Q - Steve Byrne>: Yes. Thank you. We're hearing concerns out of the channel about the restrictions on this label that
Monsanto's dicamba formulation has, with respect to wind speed and rain and buffer and so forth, question would be,
are you expecting something similar for FeXapan or could it be something more favorable? And how does all of this
play into the opportunity for what might be an approval on the Enlist package that Dow is developing?
<A - James C. Collins, Jr.>: Yeah, thanks, Steve. Clearly we're watching that situation as well. We've collaborated as
a technology partner with Monsanto as we're in-licensing those traits. We had good visibility of our product
performance this past year. We think those buffers are appropriate given early days and new technology. We modeled
our FeXapan product registration as an exact mirror image of Monsanto's registration, so very likely will have exactly
the same buffer requirements -downwind buffer requirements that they do.
And I'd also say we're targeting customers that we work with, that we know are great stewards of our products and will
work with us on those stewardship requirements as well. So we're putting an extra layer of help and support out in the
marketplace to answer questions and make sure we're ready to respond.
But overall, we're excited about the technology and it's a brand-new tool that growers are going to have to control
what's becoming a pretty tough issue out there with resistance management. And as far as Enlist goes, I really can't
comment on any of the specifics associated with that. You'll have to talk to my Dow colleagues.

<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Yes. Good morning. Another question on Ag. Back in 2013, you had signed the deal with
Monsanto around the Roundup Ready 2 and Xtend licensing, some other things in that. Am I right and that I understand
because that was a paid-up license, as you start to grow into Roundup Ready 2 and Xtend this year, the profit on that
should be extremely high because there is no incremental cost year-over-year in 2017 versus 2016, or 2018 versus
2017, but now the revenue starts to flow through? Can you just walk through the dynamics of how that license will play
out from a profitability standpoint?
<A - James C. Collins, Jr.>: Yeah, thanks. Under those agreements, DuPont Pioneer made a series of upfront
payments, and there were some variable-based royalty payments associated with that. So beginning in 2018, the
paid-up portion of that will essentially be complete. And beginning in 2018, DuPont Pioneer will continue to pay some
royalties on a per unit basis. The way that works is the royalties that we paid begin to be recorded as we start to sell the
units going forward. So we have this essentially – our expense is essentially a way to kind of flatten out the impact. So,
no, you should see really no change in the net profitability of the business going forward as a result of those payments.

And our next question's from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Laurence, your line is open.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Good morning. Can you please flesh out the comments about the emerging market
headwinds and maybe give a forced ranking of the headwinds that you're facing outside of the ag sector.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Hey, Laurence. This is Nick. When you look across the world, Brazil obviously is still
in a recessionary sort of environment. So issues there and instability there, political instability as well. In India, you're
looking at the demonetization move, although we haven't seen significant impact from that move yet on our businesses,
there is still the question of where that's going to lead to. In China, we continue to see the, although signs of
stabilization, you do still see the movement from the industrial into the service consumer side which has impact. The
overall PV market and the impact that may have largely in the developing regions with the growth rates slowing there,
those are some of the concerns and reasons why we were somewhat cautious when we looked at the developing
markets.

Our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.
<Q - Don Carson>: ... is Jim, a question on crop protection. Your release indicated that your sales were up 9% in the
quarter. Just wondering what they were up for the year as a whole. And you mentioned rather cautious comments on
the market outlook for crop protection in 2017, do you expect your sales to be up? And then finally, if you can just tell
us how Rynaxypyr's been doing?
<A - James C. Collins, Jr.>: Thanks, Don. You're right. Our fourth quarter performance was up, and as I said before,
that was related to some strengthening that we saw in North America as well as our insecticide performance in Asia
Pacific. Overall for the year, we were down mid single digits for the full year. And that's really reflecting the
headwinds that we had early on in the year, as Nick mentioned, Brazil, the impact of Intacta on our Rynaxypyr sales
and then just overall concerns about channel inventories down there.
But as we talk about 2017, we really see kind of the industry decline easing. And we have upsides on some new
product launches. We've got Vessarya out there starting in 2017. We'll pick up the good sales as we continue to launch
Zorvec globally and Cyazypyr. We're still in the early stages of launching Cyazypyr.
And we have always talked about, globally, if we exclude Brazil, Rynaxypyr volumes have continued to look pretty
strong for us eight years now, seven years into the global launch of that we've seen year-over-year. I think about 2017
going forward, I'd say we're probably going to be a return to overall global volume growth of Rynaxypyr, Brazil
included. So we'll be back on that trend line for continued performance of that whole product portfolio.

And our next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Good morning, gentlemen, and congrats on the quarter, and to Nick, a begrudging congrats.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Thanks, Frank. One more to go.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Yes, go Falcons. As I look at your capital expenditure spending, I think at the beginning of the
year, you were looking at $1.1 billion, which was materially down from the year prior. Obviously, you came in at
around $1 billion, so even lower. So I was wondering if you could talk about what sort of things did you forego in
terms of the spending, and how should we think about the breakdown between growth CapEx versus maintenance
CapEx versus CapEx to – you spent a fair amount of time on the call improving your manufacturing productivity, how
should we think about DuPont in that vein in 2017?
<A - Edward D. Breen>: Thanks for your question, Frank. And I'm rooting for the Falcons also, by the way, just to get
Nick a little heated up. But the CapEx in 2017 will be very similar, up slightly, probably about $1.1 billion is what
we've kind of targeted with all the businesses. We've literally – we did this last year, we've gone project by project
through all of them. And we've really clipped areas where we're very – at least I'm questionable on the returns we're
going to get from the program. So we're spending money and very significantly where we know we're going to have
really good returns. Probiotics is one we mentioned on the earnings call. We approved $100 million spend there in the
next two years. It's going to significantly increase our capacity and throughput in that area, that business is growing
very significantly.
We just announced the other week a major CapEx program, Experimental Station here in Delaware. But when you look
at the payback of it, it's very significant because it's a consolidation of a lot of disparate footprints and all that into a
really high tech environment for our employees. So we'll spend where we really know we have that capability. And I'll
let Nick kind of give you a little bit on the – what I call the CapEx spend for maintenance versus growth and all that.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah, Frank. So when you look at the – aligned with what everything Ed just said,
and if you look going forward here, having our CapEx aligned with our D&A kind of number yearly number is what
one could anticipate. One of the other biggest drops is along the pre-commercial side, saw a decline there. The beta
now being obviously in place was part of that. When you look at the maintain dollars, about 40% of our CapEx is in the
run and maintain side, the rest would be on the grow and improve side of the house.

And our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes. Hi. Good morning.
<A - Edward D. Breen>: Morning.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: If the border adjustment tax goes through with the new administration, how do you think that
impacts DuPont overall?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: So – well, that's yet to be determined, but there's a couple of elements of it that if they
tag along would obviously be beneficial to DuPont. If we get the repatriation piece of that coming along with it, that
would have very favorable impact. I think you're aware, P.J., that the biggest part of our cash on the balance sheet is
outside of the U.S. and so that would have favorable impact on liberating additional dollars to be spent, whether it be
on CapEx, M&A, or returning value to the shareholders through share buybacks or dividends.

When you look at the strictly on the border of the exports/imports, I think it's going to be slightly favorable for us from
a export side versus the import side. But obviously, we have to wait and see the details around that as it becomes more
solidified, if it actually goes through.

Our next question is from Alex Yefremov from Instinet.
<Q - Aleksey Yefremov>: Good morning. Thank you. Could you provide some idea of free cash flow bridge for 2017,
maybe the biggest items, restructuring costs, CapEx, taxes, working capital, et cetera?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah, when you look at our free cash flow numbers and you see the large
improvement we had of the $1.6 billion, a piece of that is the Chemours no longer being a part of the numbers. That's
about $400 million of the $1.6 billion. So now you're at a $1.2 billion improvement in free cash flow. We saw the
reduction in CapEx that we just mentioned. That's about roughly $400 million reduction in CapEx. You saw an
improvement in working capital. If you look at the business working capital numbers, you had improvement of about
$500 million largely seen in inventory as well as accounts payable. Accounts receivable was flat to slightly up from a
working capital standpoint. Those were the major improvements as you look at the working – free cash flow.
<A - Edward D. Breen>: In 2017, I think you touched on that also, as I mentioned, CapEx will be about equal to
depreciation and amortization. But I'd kind of plan in that $1.1 billion area, so kind of similar to this year. And I would
expect improvement next year in working capital, as Nick said, business working capital was a $500 million
improvement, and we know we have at least a billion-dollar opportunity there as we've mentioned before. So with the
programs in place and the focus we have, we should see continued improvement there through 2017.

And our next question is from James Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson.
<Q - James Sheehan>: Morning. Could you talk about any areas of your crop protection portfolio that you would
consider nonstrategic, post merger? And regarding any of those, would you expect to possibly divest something prior to
the close of the merger? Thank you.
<A - Edward D. Breen>: Well, let me answer the second part. The first part, I think we've got to stay away from just
because of confidentiality of our conversations. But what we would do is with a remedy package, we would have
obviously very quickly be talking to other companies that could purchase that package and try to have that all keyed up
very quickly. And the issue, we know who the companies are, it's a handful or two of companies that would be very
interested, and we would move very quickly on accomplishing that.

Our next question is from Mark Connelly from CLSA.
<Q - Nils-Bertil Wallin>: Good morning. This is Nils Wallin sitting in for Mark. A question on auto builds. You'd
mentioned the IHS outlook, but I was curious what DuPont's view was on auto builds for 2017. And overall, what's
your sensitivity to a 1% increase or decrease in auto production?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: So our numbers are aligned with the IHS numbers. We're also estimating the 1% sort
of number. And when you look at the sensitivity piece of that, about a third of our sales within the DPM business are
related to the automotive industry. In 2016, if you look at the results versus the IHS, we were pretty much in line or
slightly above what their numbers were saying. So as we look at 2017, we use those same projections.

And our next question is from sandy from Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research.
<Q - Sandy H. Klugman>: Thank you. Good morning. You touched on this a bit, but given that your soy portfolio has
become increasingly competitive, will the earnings headwind from a shift to soy acreage from corn be less pronounced
than in prior years? And then how much volume growth do you see for Leptra in 2017, and what kind of tailwind
should we expect to see from lower seed production costs, given decreased use of winter nurseries?
<A - James C. Collins, Jr.>: Well, so you're right, we will see some of those shifts going into 2017. If I think about
Leptra for a moment, we saw 70% growth in that market, and a majority of that growth was attributed to Leptra. You're
exactly right as well as we look forward, the use of winter nurseries, we've now gotten a good bead on our ability to
produce what we need for that market. So you'll remember in that [Suprenia] season prior to that, we sold out
completely. We essentially sold everything we had for summer, but we've now got nice supplies coming in for 2017.
So we will benefit. It's still a little early to call, still a long way to go for that summer season at the end of 2017 just
how big that penetration is going to be.
And then I mentioned earlier in soybeans, we've seen some nice improvements in our portfolio as we looked at product
performance trials at the end of 2016 and some performance that we had out in the field as our T Series continues to
penetrate. And we'll pick up, I believe, some share in soybeans as we go into next year's market as well as, as acres
come back. And that A-Series launch for us will be really critical there.
<A - Gregory R. Friedman>: Last question.
Operator
And our final question's from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ryan Berney>: Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. I apologize. He had to hop to another call. Just
another quick question around the cash flow. I think you've been pretty upfront around the D&A levels, keeping the
CapEx near there. And it also seems that Dow is coming towards the later innings of its spending cycle. Have you had
any conversations with them around how you view cash flow priorities kind of ahead of and then after the merger and
maybe rank ordering those?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: No, I mean, that's still something that would be separate between the two companies.
But I think you can look at the track record of both companies in that regard. You can see what Dow's track record has
been around dividend issuances and DuPont's track record of 435 consecutive dividends or in that range. You can see
what we've done around share buybacks independently this year, and those are pretty much aligned as well. So I think
the message would be that the actions we're taking would indicate the path forward, but we haven't had any discussions
around aligned agreements in that regard.
Gregory R. Friedman
Well, this now concludes our call. We thank you for joining us today, and we thank you for your interest in DuPont.
