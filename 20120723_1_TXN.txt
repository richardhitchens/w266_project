MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. At this time I would
like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, Kevin March,
TI's CFO, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at TI.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live
over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available to the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to
differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor Statement
contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete
description. Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for September 11. At that time, we expect
to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate.

Let me start with the market environment. Revenue in the second quarter landed in the middle of our guidance range
with sequential growth of 7%. Orders grew and backlog expanded, although at a slower pace overall than in the first
quarter. Also there was a clear down shift in our order momentum in the month of June. Even though we believe
inventory of TI products is low at our OEM customers and distributors, both are reluctant to place new orders and
commit to backlog given the uncertainty in the overall economic environment.
This, combined with lead times that are largely below six weeks, has resulted in our window of backlog coverage
narrowing. Although backlog for July and August has filled in consistent with a typical third quarter, at this point our
visibility is somewhat reduced for the month of September. This could reflect a range of reasons and potential
outcomes. On the one hand, customers could be anticipating their own businesses to slow. On the other hand,
customers may simply be waiting until the last minute to place orders given short lead times.
Regardless, as a result of this increased uncertainty, we are being more cautious ourselves in planning for the third
quarter and are currently expecting a below seasonal quarter with revenue at the middle of our guidance range projected
to be about even with the second quarter. If customer demand builds as the quarter progresses, we are well positioned
with short lead times, strong inventory, and available manufacturing capacity to support a higher level of shipments.
Let me now walk through the second quarter's results. Revenue of $3.34 billion declined 4% from a year ago and grew
7% sequentially. Analog revenue grew 13% from a year ago and was up 7% sequentially. The growth from a year ago
was due to the acquisition of National Semiconductor and therefore the inclusion of Silicon Valley Analog revenue in
the second quarter that wasn't included a year ago. The sequential growth was primarily driven by growth in Power
Management.
Embedded Processing revenue declined 15% from a year ago with both communications infrastructure and catalog
products down. Sequentially, Embedded Processing grew 8% primarily driven by strong growth in communications
infrastructure. Wireless revenue declined 39% from a year ago, primarily due to lower baseband revenue. Sequentially,
wireless revenue declined 8% due to lower OMAP revenue. Baseband revenue ticked up a few million dollars to $90
million in the quarter, although we expect to step down to about $50 million in the third quarter as we continue to wind
down this product line.
Our Other segment revenue declined 4% from a year ago and grew 16% sequentially. From a year ago, revenue
declined due to the expiration of our transitional supply agreements from previously acquired factories in Japan and
China. Sequentially, revenue growth was driven by higher demand for DLP products as well as the seasonal increase in
calculators.
In distribution, resale sequential growth of 7% matched the pace of TI's overall revenue growth. Distributors reduced
inventory levels by a day and are holding a little less than 6.5 weeks of inventory. Most are waiting until there are clear
signs of higher end demand before they are willing to carry more.
Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.
Kevin P. March
Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone.
As I have done in the past couple of quarters, let me start by walking through some of the charges in the quarter that
were included in our reported results. Acquisition charges in the second quarter were $104 million. In the prior quarter,
total acquisition related charges were $174 million, consisting of $153 million in acquisition charges and $21 million in
costs of revenue. In addition, we also had restructuring charges of $13 million in the second quarter compared with $10
million in the first quarter In total, the EPS impact of these charges was $0.06 in the second quarter compared with
$0.10 in the first quarter.
Gross profit of $1.65 billion was 49.5% of revenue and increased 8% sequentially. Recall that in the first quarter we
benefited from about $65 million of insurance proceeds that helped gross profit and gross margin. Operating expenses

of $936 million declined about 4% from the first quarter. At 28% of revenue, operating expenses have moved back into
the 20% to 30% range that we target over the course of a cycle. Our second quarter results included a cumulative
adjustment for a revision in our annual tax rate as well as a $10 million discrete tax benefit.
Net income in the first quarter was $446 million or $0.38 per share on a GAAP basis before charges. Again, in the EPS
calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to any unvested restricted
stock units on which we pay dividend equivalents. In the second quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the
EPS calculation was $8 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you'll likely calculate EPS to be $0.01 higher than
we have reported.
Let me make a few comments on our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $675 million, up
$226 million from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $146 million in the quarter, up $43 million from the
prior quarter. I should note that year-to-date, capital spending has been about 4% of revenue as we benefit from having
pulled ahead fab spending through opportunistic purchases over the past few years.
We used cash to repay an additional $200 million of our outstanding commercial paper in the quarter, bringing the
remaining balance of this obligation down to $500 million. We also retired $375 million of maturing debt that we
assumed in the acquisition of National Semiconductor. We used $300 million in the quarter to repurchase 9.6 million
shares of TI common stock and paid dividends of $195 million.
We increased our inventory by $32 million in the quarter, although inventory days declined to 101. Orders of $3.41
billion in the quarter increased $174 million or 5% sequentially. TI's book-to-bill ratio was 1.02 in the quarter.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.21 billion to $3.47 billion in the third quarter. At the
middle of this range, revenue would be about even with the second quarter. We expect earnings per share to be in the
range of $0.34 to $0.42. We expect the third quarter EPS results will be negatively affected by about $0.07 of
acquisition and restructuring charges assuming the company's marginal tax rate of 35%.
For the year, our estimate for R&D expense has been reduced to $1.9 billion from our previous estimate of $2 billion.
Our estimate for capital expenditures is unchanged at $700 million and our estimate for depreciation is also unchanged
at $1 billion. Our estimated effective tax rate has been reduced to 26%, down from our prior estimate of 28%.
In summary, although our financial results for the second quarter were consistent with our expectations, our visibility
into the third quarter's demand has been reduced. We remain focused on strengthening our long-term position in
Analog and Embedded Processing while also staying responsive to the twists and turns of near-term demand.
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible
an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you
an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll first go to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Hey, Ron. Thanks so much for the chance to ask a question. I appreciate it. In terms of the
utilization rates that you're expecting as you go through the third quarter, I guess that would be the first question.

And the follow-up just so I can go away after that, is there ever a cost benefit analysis that would make sense to shutter
some of the strategic capacity? In other words, if the expectation is that it's going to stay dormant for an extended
period of time, would it make sense to shutter it and then bring it back on line when the utilization has picked up?
Thanks very much.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Kevin?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Jim, let me just start on the utilization in the third quarter. I think implicitly we don't normally
forecast that, but implicitly with the revenue guidance being flat and inventory being at desired levels of about 101 days
right now, I don't expect our utilization level to be going up at this stage and in fact might even decline a little bit as we
go into the quarter.
As to the second question on the cost benefit of shutting down the strategic capacity, you may recall that back in
January we did announce the closure of two older factories that from a cost benefit standpoint, the economics of
upgrading or trying to improve those factories to compete with some of the newer factories we brought online just
didn't pay. So the decision was to go ahead and wind the operations in those factories down. That's one factory in
Houston, which we expect to close by the middle of next year, and another factory in Hiji, Japan, which we expect to
close by the end of next year.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Okay. Thank you for your questions, Jim. And we'll go to the next caller, operator.
Operator
Next we'll go to Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, just looking at the outlook, so flat
revenue guidance, EPS up a little bit, sounded like you said utilization down, which might imply that gross margins
may be down a little bit. So is the EPS savings here all OpEx, or is some of it gross margins, or is it a split between the
two? Could you give us maybe some color on the drivers between gross margins and OpEx into Q3?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Stacy, just for correction purpose, at the middle of our guidance range, our revenue is flat and
our EPS is also flat at $0.38 on a GAAP basis.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Pro forma it sounds a little higher though, right?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Yeah, because we have an extra – inside of that flat GAAP EPS, the charges will – think of it
more rounding up to $0.07 as opposed to rounding down to $0.06...
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Got it.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: In the quarter. Do you have any other...?
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: I guess on that first question then, does that imply gross margin and OpEx kind of flattish
to Q2?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Kevin?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Stacy, I think what – when you build your models and make the adjustments for the
various things we were just talking with Ron about, I think you'll see that gross margins are probably going to be a little
bit better. We'll have a bit of a better mix we would expect in 3Q. Recall the seasonality of our calculator business, for
example, third quarter tends to be the strongest quarter. That has fairly good margins. As Ron mentioned, we'll see the
baseband drop to probably about $50 million coming off of $90 million last quarter. And so the remaining revenue that
will fill in that gap has slightly higher margins. So between those things, I think you will see the margins probably up a
little bit quarter-over-quarter.

<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Got it. That's helpful. And for my follow-up, so you mentioned I guess limited visibility
in September in regard to your customers. What kind of September outlook do you actually have baked in right now to
your flat guidance? And where could this go if we had a normal September as we seem to have like a normal July and
August for orders right now?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Well, Stacy, normal seasonality for us in third quarter is to be up – on average seasonality is to
be up 6% quarter-over-quarter. So one could say that if in fact September fills out in a more normal fashion, we might
see growth rates approaching that sort of number, but as Ron mentioned and as we've been talking about in the press
release, given the profile of the backlog that our customers are scheduled on us, we clearly have less demand scheduled
in September right now than we would normally have at this stage in the quarter, and that has caused us to be cautious
on our guidance because it's really not apparent to us why that is the case. Again, is it because customers fear their end
demand? Or in fact do they just have increased confidence that if their demand goes up, we have adequate inventory
that we can meet short lead times?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Okay, Stacy, thank you for your questions. Let's go to the next caller.
Operator
Our next question comes from Sumit Dhanda with International Strategy & Investment Group.
<Q - Sumit Dhanda>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Just a follow up on that last point, Kevin or Ron. Could you tell us
exactly what your lead times are? In other words, if you did have – if you did end up seeing that pickup for September,
what sort of a last date by which customers need to place orders so it actually impacts your revenues in the third
quarter?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Sumit, I guess one way to think about it is, I think we mentioned that the vast majority of our
products have lead times less than six weeks, so that would say certainly – and, you know, some of that goes all the
way down to zero if we have in-stock inventory. But certainly that would indicate that by the time we get to our
mid-quarter update in September, we'll have certainly better visibility as to what the month of September should be
looking like at that point.
Do you have a follow-on?
<Q - Sumit Dhanda>: Yes, I did. And then just along the same lines, any – clearly June orders were significantly
weaker than you might have expected. Has there been any pickup or stabilization in July? And then was there any
difference in the profile of orders you got, for example, from the distributors versus your OEMs ex your wireless
OEMs? Thanks.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: I'll answer the first part, and, Kevin, I'll let you handle the second part if you remember it. In
terms of July, the rate of new orders in July really, Sumit, is consistent with what we saw in the month of June. So we
haven't really seen a pickup, but we also haven't seen a further slowdown. So our guidance does comprehend those
order trends.
<A - Kevin P. March>: And Sumit as it relates to say the distribution channel for example, what we saw in the second
quarter was distribution – distributor resales actually increased quarter-over-quarter to about the same rate as TI total
sales. So that was consistent. And their inventory dropped about a day, so they continued to hold very lean levels of
inventory, which suggests to us that similar to our OEM customers, they're holding only as much inventory as they feel
they need to have for relatively short windows of time, 6.5 weeks as I mentioned.
So it goes back to what Ron was saying earlier. Our customers across the board seem to be carrying very lean
inventories, expecting us to be able to meet very short lead times, which we presently have available, and so we should
have better insight as to what their final demand will be for third quarter when we get to the mid-quarter update.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Okay, thank you, Sumit. Let's go to the next caller, please.

The next caller comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Good afternoon, guys. Just quickly on the Wireless profitability for the June quarter, I would
have thought that with a better mix of baseband that Op Profit would have been a little bit better. So I'm wondering if
you can help me understand what's going on there. Importantly, ex-baseband, what's the break even Op Profit – revenue
you need to see for breakeven Op Profit kind of in the OMAP and connectivity?
<A - Kevin P. March>: John, the biggest thing driving the profitability or quite frankly the lack of profitability right
now in Wireless is the revenue. This is a revenue dependent business that we talked about for a while. There is a large
R&D build going on inside that segment as they develop new products for the end markets they're aiming at, and it
really has been one that requires more revenue than it obviously has today to absorb that much R&D. It has clearly got
our attention and is something we're looking closely into.
As it relates to a breakeven number, I would just remind you that back in fourth quarter that revenues that that segment
turned in was actually about breakeven at that point in time if you adjusted for baseband. So that's probably your best
reference point. I won't try to forecast going forward. As you probably well know from our conversations here in the
recent past, we're looking at the opportunities for that business to expand product offerings into the embedded
processing space, and that clearly will have a different profile of needs as we get all that planning worked out.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: So, Kevin, just to make sure I heard right, you're saying fourth quarter of last year, the
non-baseband part of Wireless turned a profit, a small profit, and that would be the closest proxy?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Right.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Very good. Do you have a follow on, John?
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Yeah, Ron, just quickly, you talk about baseband being down to $50 million in the September
quarter. Just relative to your kind of midpoint of flat revenue, are there any broader revenue buckets that are
outperforming or underperforming that you can talk to, or is everything coming in kind of flattish?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: I would say for the most part flattish, and we don't break the guidance down too much by
product area. But as Kevin mentioned, you know, clearly there's a seasonal trend where our calculator business tends to
grow third quarter compared to second quarter, so we would expect that of course to occur and be – and probably
largely offset the decline in baseband. And then outside of that, you know, certainly collectively flattish, but generally
flattish by product area as well.
Okay, John. Thank you for your questions. We'll move to the next caller.
Operator
Our next caller is Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris B. Danely>: Hi. Thanks, guys. Just to follow up a little bit on the Wireless group, are the R&D cuts in the
second half, are those all aimed at Wireless? And then is there some sort of timeline to where we can tell, say, if
Wireless isn't profitable by Q1 of next year, that, you know, there could be some changes there? And what are the
options if Wireless does not become profitable within a two, three quarter time period of changing the business?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Chris, I don't think anybody said anything about cuts in the second half. I think what we
talked about was that we are looking at how to best align the resources to meet the change in market opportunities we
see for those products, especially in the embedded processing space. And that can include also reallocating resources to
other areas where we have better growth opportunities. And I don't have any numbers for you with specificity as to
what a breakeven or how much time that might take and so on. That will all come with time as we decide what the
appropriate actions are, if any.

<A - Ron Slaymaker>: I think one of the things you're referencing, Chris, was just the fact that we lowered the
guidance. And think of that more as anticipated growth that we had planned overall in R&D will not be in the plan or
won't be occurring now, and for the most part, if we hold second half quarterly run rates consistent with where we were
in second quarter, then, you know, we would probably be rounding down to that $1.9 billion guidance that we gave for
the full year.
Do you have a follow on, Chris?
<Q - Chris B. Danely>: Real quick on SVA, it was flat and the rest of your Analog was up. Is there anything going on
there, and do you have any outlook on SVA versus sort of the core TI Analog for the second half or at least Q3?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Yeah, there is some stuff going on with respect to SVA, but it really ties more to fourth quarter
and first quarter. You'll recall in those quarters we were talking about that we had made some distributor changes. I
think in the fourth quarter, we had eliminated one of their traditional distributors and then brought on – brought them
on to additional distributors that had previously supported TI in the first quarter, which resulted in some just inventory
adjustments in the channel.
So think about first quarter for SVA benefited from some channel fill with inventory, and therefore the comparisons is
a little more complex or unfavorable than going into second quarter. So really that's the only difference. If you look
from a resale perspective, SVA resales were very consistent with what you saw or what we described for the rest of TI.
So, again, it's just more noise associated with the changes fourth quarter and first quarter with respect to distributors.
And Kevin, was there an additional part of the question? Okay. Very good.
Thank you, Chris, and we'll move to the next caller.
Operator
Our next caller comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
<Q - Tore E. Svanberg>: Thank you, guys. The first question is during the mid-quarter update, you talked about
wireless infrastructure or coms infrastructure and automotive actually holding up. Could you elaborate a bit on that
comment now, the way you see things now? And is there any market at all that could potentially be up sequentially in
the September quarter?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Sure, I can talk about the coms infrastructure. I think automotive we ended up just from a
sequential standpoint with second quarter being down slightly. So that shifted a little bit during the month of June from
our prior expectations. But coms infrastructure had very strong sequential growth in the second quarter. And it's really
more of what we described previously, which is in the North America market, there is a very aggressive build
continuing to take place as carriers just try to stay up with consumer demand for data. And so with everybody having
smartphones and tablets consuming lots of data, the carrier is under a lot of pressure just to be able to stay up with that
demand. Given the strength of our position across almost all of the equipment manufacturers, we're a prime beneficiary
of that.
So again, it's – you can say that LTE is starting to come into play a little bit, but really this is mostly being driven by
3G, really WCDMA builds here in the North America market. We see that trend on a secular basis continuing going
forward, although once we get really toward the end of this year, you'll see more of the carrier spend start to shift to
small cell. Macro doesn't go away, of course, because those base stations are still required. But on the other hand, a
bigger part of the carrier spending will likely begin to shift towards small cell where we have an extremely strong
position with our system on a chip and we look forward to that. But again that will start here in the North America
market. I think it's already begun in some markets like Korea. It will start here in North America late this year and
really we think will ramp nicely from there.

So, again, a good secular trend for us there ongoing. I think in the automotive space, the only thing I would say is I
think that market as you might expect with economic uncertainty, consumers expressing more concern on where they
spend their money, especially on large purchases like automotive. We're starting to see some of that as well as, I
assume, other players will as well. Do you have a follow-on, Tore?
<Q - Tore E. Svanberg>: Yeah, just for Kevin, the R&D coming down a little bit for the year, is that sort of as a
response to the environment, or have you seen some consolidation programs? Just trying to understand where that's
coming from.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Tore, that's a little bit of a response to the environment, but it's also on a lowered outlook.
Some variable compensation, for example, will be less than it otherwise would have been. So I'd say it's a combination
of some temporary and kind of permanent adjustments. The permanent if you will is that the expected variable
compensation will be a little bit less than we'd previously planned. And some of the permanent is just realigning some
of the programs that we had underway.
<Q - Tore E. Svanberg>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Thank you, Tore. Next caller, please.
Operator
Next we'll go to Glen Yeung with Citi.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: Thanks for letting us ask the question. Can I just ask a little bit about the order linearity
between June and July? Because it sounds like June was very bad, but July is back to normal seasonal. And my
suspicion is that's probably more about June than July. And so in your response, can you also describe what exactly
happened in June?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Let me make sure that you didn't misunderstand what I said before, Glen. July in terms of new
orders coming in really is about the same level that we saw in June.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: Okay.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: So it hasn't picked up, nor has it slowed down. What I did say is that our backlog coverage,
meaning orders that are scheduled to ship in the month of July, looks pretty typical. But in terms of new orders, they
fell from May to June, and July is running at about the same, just call it daily run rate that we saw for the month of June
overall.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: Okay.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: So not a change one direction or the other, but again it's the combination of what we saw in the
month of June as well as what we have seen month to date in July that has led us to give the sub seasonal guidance that
we provided.
Do you have a follow-on, Glen?
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: Sort of as part of that, what exactly did you see in June? Was there any sort of pattern in
terms of geographies getting weak or end markets getting weak, or was it just everything across the board?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: I would say pretty broad based. I mean, there were some markets that shifted maybe a bit more
than others. I don't know so much from an order standpoint. Maybe this is a little different twist on your question, but
from a revenue standpoint, probably – let me just kind of walk through the region – regional results. The North
American market from a sequential growth standpoint was strongest, followed by Asia, followed by Japan, and then
Europe actually was the only region that was down a little bit.

At mid-quarter update, I believe I described that at that point we were expecting some growth out of Europe. So at least
from a revenue standpoint, there was a little bit more of a down shift in Europe. Probably no real surprise there. I don't
know, Kevin, is there anything that jumps to your mind from a product line standpoint or from an end market
standpoint? I would describe it as more broad based, Glen, as opposed to any particular area of weakness that was
pronounced.
<A - Kevin P. March>: I'd agree. If you look across the whole quarter, you can probably say most of the end markets
were up a bit. Auto and TV were down a bit, as Ron mentioned earlier. And the industrial space is probably about flat
on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and that's kind of the mix we saw in the major markets.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: So, Glen, I think you're describing that as 1A and 1B on your question list, and you still have
number two coming, so if you're still there, do you have another question?
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: It's a very, very simple one. Do you happen to know what utilization rates were in the June
quarter?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: The answer to that is also very simple: Yes. But we do not disclose specifically what our
utilization is. I think Kevin said it's – our utilization overall was up slightly second quarter compared with first quarter.
Similarly the utilization – the underutilization charges were therefore down a little bit, but frankly as we got into the
month of June and saw orders fall off, we changed our loadings. We pulled back on our loadings, and as a result, the
underutilization expense did not fall quite as much as we had expected, which you see in a gross margin, which frankly
was not quite as strong as we had expected in the quarter as well.
Okay, Glen. Thank you for your questions. We'll move to the next caller.

Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Joseph Moore>: Thank you. Just to keep pushing on this Wireless question a little bit. In the fourth quarter of last
year, you had a big high profile tablet win that helped OMAP business and I have that business down – ex-baseband, I
have Wireless down a couple hundred million from the last couple quarters, I may be wrong on those numbers, but do
you have the types of OMAP opportunities in the next two or three quarters that can get you back to that level? Or is
this more kind of waiting for the Embedded business to fill in those gaps to get back to that level?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, clearly in the tablet space, we have other customer wins
that you can assume will be ramping into production using new products, new OMAP products from TI before the end
of the year. And just where those go in terms of actual success in the marketplace is still to be determined, but clearly
there's opportunity there. And at the same time, you know, as you have heard us say now for several quarters, we're not
resting waiting for the tablets or smartphone space to carry us. We are rapidly pursuing opportunities in the embedded
space and more horizontal opportunities outside of smartphones and tablets. And those are showing good traction as
well. But there's clearly opportunity for growth in smartphones and tablets as well.
Do you have a follow-on, Joe?
<Q - Joseph Moore>: Sure. Thank you. The Windows 8 on OMAP in the wake of kind of Microsoft Surface coming
out with their own Windows 8 tablets on a competitors ARM chip, what's your customer's interest in continuing to
pursue that market, and is that still a big – or is it a big investment for you guys?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: It is an area that we're pursuing. We have Win RT ported over to our OMAP architecture, and
we think that will have opportunities not just in the tablet space but also in some of the embedded – embedded
opportunities that we're pursuing as well. So, you know, a lot of those embedded opportunities are going to be looking
for high level operating systems to run on our applications processor. And the fact that we have the broadest coverage
of any applications processor in terms of high level operating systems that are ported and running on our chip is
differentiation for TI and opens a lot of doors for us.

So in terms of the customer enthusiasm, I can't speak for the customers other than to say, you know, we are still – we

Our next question comes from Patrick Wang with Evercore Partners.
<Q - Patrick Wang>: Great. Thanks for getting me on the call. Just first question, you know, you talked about Europe
softening since you gave the mid-quarter update. I'm curious – you know – you've seen a stabilization in that area, and
what's your latest read on that?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: I'm not following your question. We have seen a stabilization in Europe you're saying?
<Q - Patrick Wang>: Yeah, I'm curious, when you said, you know, relative to your mid-quarter update the one
geography that seemed to have softened a bit that wasn't necessarily surprising was Europe. And I'm just curious, with
your more typical month of July if things have stabilized there and you guys are looking for more constructive type of
trends going forward. Or is that still an area where it's still softening?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Patrick, I'd say it's probably too early to tell. Recall that in Europe it's customary that many of
the businesses there take mass vacations during the summer months, especially in August. So typically you actually
don't see much resumption of meaningful demand in the third quarter from Europe until you get to the end of August.
So it's probably too early for us to comment on that just yet.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Do you have a follow on, Patrick?
<Q - Patrick Wang>: Yeah, I do. It's really about gross margins. If we look at gross margins going forward here, it
sounds like you guys are guiding margins up slightly here in the third quarter. But as we look into the back half into
next year, what are some of the structural things we should be thinking about in terms of getting the margins back into
the low to mid-50s?
<A - Kevin P. March>: I think the most apparent one is revenue growth. We've been talking about we did bring on
quite a bit of capacity during the last couple of years that we bought for literally pennies on the dollar. And even though
it's inexpensive, nonetheless it does still contribute to our underutilization charges in the quarters. So clearly the most
meaningful way for us to improve gross margin is to simply continue growing our revenues so that we can absorb that
underutilization and it will fall through to gross margin.
In addition to that, we'll just see a continuation of improvement of mix. As we talked about earlier, baseband will drop
to about $50 million in we think the third quarter. We still expect that to wind down to essentially zero as we begin
2013. That will be replaced, our revenue that replaces that tends to have higher gross margins. So there will be a little
bit of mix inside there, but I think the biggest driver to point to is revenue growth to absorb the underutilization.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Okay. Thank you, Patrick.
<Q - Patrick Wang>: Appreciate it.

<Q - Doug Freedman>: Great. Thanks for fitting me in, guys. And in the past, Ron, you guys have been able to offer
some color on what's going on in the PC market, specifically the disk drive market. There was a lot of movement this
quarter. Can you give us an update on what you're seeing right now?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Sure. I guess what I would say is we saw some growth in disk drives in the second quarter, and
that – you know, there probably was still some residual recovery from the Thailand flooding, but certainly going out of
second quarter, we think that is now fully recovered. Our view overall is that hard disk drive TAM appears to be
softening somewhat, and that very well could just be, you know, the mix of the types of computing platforms that are
shipping and many of those not using hard disk drives. They're using solid state memory at this point. I think other than
that, I think I described at the mid-quarter that we had seen some mixed signals in the PC space between maybe some
of what we were seeing with Analog products, battery management, etcetera, and what we were seeing with hard disk
drive. And I'd say that still held through the end of the quarter.
Do you have a follow on, Doug?
<Q - Doug Freedman>: Yes. If you could, could you guys give us an update on how the progress of your recent or not
so recent acquisitions, the CICLON, Luminary. I know you've commented on Silicon Valley Analog already. If you
could give us – go back a little further and just highlight how well those businesses are working within your portfolio.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Doug, you may recall and if others were listening CICLON was supporting the power strategy
inside Analog, and I'd say by all indications that has turned out to be quite an effective acquisition and contributing
nicely to the growth in the power space.
Luminary was an acquisition that went into our Embedded Processing side of the house and really gave us a capability
in the 32-bit microcontrollers that we previously didn't have a strong footprint in. And we're learning a lot in that space.
We've got a lot more – a lot more opportunity, a lot more growth to do there. But clearly that brought a lot of
knowledge to us and filled in some gaps that we didn't previously have in-house.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Okay, Doug, thank you, and we'll move to the next caller, please.

Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about underutilization charges. Especially what is –
is that mostly a cash charge? Is that a noncash charge? And would there necessarily be an uptick in gross margins if
you were to just conceptually say shutter 5 or 10% or whatever of capacity? So the question is really what is really the
cash drag from these underutilization charges?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Vivek, the underutilization charges, there's probably a little bit of cash in there, but these are
mostly noncash. You're talking about assets that are depreciated and not being used. These are mostly non-cash. There's
going to be some cash because you're keeping of course underloaded clean rooms open, so you're still using utilities
and some gases and so on to keep those going. But that's minimal.
As it relates to opportunities, when we described in January that we were closing two of our older factories, the one in
Houston and the one in Hiji, Japan, what we talked about is once those factories were closed, they should save us about
$100 million in costs on an annual basis once that's done. So that's by the end of 2013. So those are the kind of numbers
that you can think about in this area.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Do you have a follow on, Vivek?
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Yes, thanks, Ron. I'm wondering why your operating margins on the Embedded side is light. Is it
mix? Is it more because of the wireless infrastructure business not doing so well? Because your Analog margins seem
to have recovered somewhat to the mid-20s, but the Embedded operating margins are down substantially year-on-year.

<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, what you've got going on, year-on-year you've got revenues down also if I recall. Let's
take a look here real quick. Yeah, revenues down about 15% year-over-year. So you've got underlying just R&D and
support costs that are still there and revenues down. So that's going to take your margins down. But in the quarter itself,
there's probably a bit below what we had expected, and really that's being driven by some new product startup and
some inventory scrappage that occurred in that segment in the second quarter.

The next question comes from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.
<Q - Craig A. Ellis>: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I'll just pick up on that last question. If we look at
Embedded Processing profitability going forward, how should we think about the rate of growth of profitability or the
rate of growth in revenues – whatever you achieve – or are there any projects coming up?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Craig, I think you were – you were fading out there a bit, but I think you were asking
questions about how to think about the rate of growth in Embedded Processing?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Embedded Processing rate of growth of profitability versus revenue going forward.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Right, okay. Similar to Analog, we would expect the Embedded Processing space to grow
kind of at historical average, which would be probably in the 8% kind of range over time. In fact, if you take a look
inside the embedded processing and where we're aimed at, the 16-bit and 32-bit, those are growing a bit faster than the
8-bit portion of Embedded Processing. So you might see something compounded a little bit faster than that over time
just from a market standpoint. And of course our stated objectives are to grow faster than our markets, so we put the
resources down to do that.
Clearly with the operating expenses inside that segment being, all things being equal, being fairly stable, any growth of
revenue should fall through pretty quickly and improve profitability. So you would expect growth in revenue to occur
at a certain pace; growth in profitability would occur at a faster pace just because it's falling through without too much
incremental operating expenditure.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Do you have a follow on, Craig?
<Q - Craig A. Ellis>: Yes. Thanks for that, Ron. On the follow up, we talked a lot about reduction in R&D expense for
this year. What about selling, general, and administrative? Should we expect that to be lower than the figure you were
looking at in the first half of the year?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, on the general and administrative costs, we already have actions underway that we
talked about when we acquired and closed on the National Semiconductor acquisition. You may recall that we talked
about by the end of the first year of the acquisitions, that's going to be sometime in the fourth quarter, that we will be
removing redundant costs between the two companies such that we should have about $100 million of annualized
savings after the end of the first year.
We're actually making pretty good progress on that front. You may or may not be aware, but back when we closed on
the National acquisition, we put some pro forma P&Ls out on the Investor Relations website that you're welcome to go
take a look at that helps you see what the two companies would have looked like had they historically been combined.
And if you go take a look at those, I think you'll find it somewhat insightful to just take a look at 2Q 2011 and compare
that to our most recent quarter and you'll see that we're already beginning to see some of the cost synergies of those, of
the merger of the two companies coming together showing up in those results.
<Q - Craig A. Ellis>: Okay, Craig. And Kevin do you happen to have a number on how that SG&A compares year on
year?

Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross Clark Seymore>: ...me ask a question. Just one quick clarification from what you just said, Kevin, the $22
million ahead of where you were before. Is that fair to then say you have $3 million more and then you're at your $100
million total with the synergies?
<A - Kevin P. March>: We would expect to get the rest of it over the next few months, yes, Ross. And really what's
coming down there, as you recall, on our way there we're having to spend a little to save a little, so to speak. In other
words, just integrating the IT system just caused us to take on incremental cost just to get there. But I think it's pretty
safe to say that we can see on the radar that we'll deliver that $100 million of annualized savings by the end of the year.
<Q - Ross Clark Seymore>: Great. And then I guess as my hopefully first main question, just on the disti inventory
side of things, what's your assumption for what the channel does inventory wise in your third quarter guidance?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Ross, we may have some assumptions, but we don't publicize those just given – you know,
distributors will do what they feel they need to do based on their own views of customer demand. But, you know,
usually we'll try to provide some insight at mid-quarter update, but not this early as to what we expect those trends to
be.
So that will be your first question and then you still get another one. Go ahead.
<Q - Ross Clark Seymore>: Thank you. You're in a generous mood. Calculators you mentioned is a positive outlier
for the third quarter. Could you give us an idea how big was that in the second quarter? Did it go up its typical
whatever it was, $75 million, and how much does it typically rise in the third quarter?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: It was pretty typical. And I'm trying to remember what typical is. Hang on a second.
<A - Kevin P. March>: It did increase about $70 million or so second versus first, and it customarily goes up pretty
close to the amount of decrease that we're going to see in baseband in second to third. Baseband was about $90 million
in second, and we expect it to drop to about $50 million. That's not that far off from what we typically see the
calculator business go up in second to third.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: $30 million to $40 million type of increase in calculators typically.
All right. Ross, thanks for your questions. We'll move to the next caller, please.

Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna.
<Q - Chris Caso>: Hi. Thank you. Just want to just take a step back with respect to the third quarter guidance. And
typically if we look in the third quarter and we're seeing a sub seasonal third quarter, it's typically because there's some
inventory to burn in the channel. When you look at the seasonal businesses, I'd imagine that there's still some seasonal
build that's going on that's just more muted than normal. If we were to get toward the low end of your guidance, that
would actually imply a bit of a seasonal decline, sequential decline. Could you help me to get there? What potentially
could drive that? Is there still some inventory burn going on in the channel? Perhaps there's something going on with
pricing or some of maybe the non-seasonal market segments?

<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Chris, I'd make a couple of points. I mean, I think inventories are low already, so this is not a
case where, you know, in second quarter a lot of inventory was built, and now there's potential need to replenish. That's
not the situation that we see. We think what happened in second quarter, the growth that came about was not inventory
replenishment but was simply customers, for the most part, no longer reducing inventory, and so therefore our
shipments necessarily needed to start moving back up to the rate at which the customers were producing their own
products. So not inventory build, but rather the end of inventory depletion. And you can see, as we said, the distribution
channel at – even at 6.5 weeks of inventory, which it's been for the last couple of – last few quarters – was low already,
and yet they did manage to take it down another day as we mentioned in the second quarter.
So, again, I think our third quarter scenario, I don't think the downside case or the lower end of the range case has to do
with inventory burning. I think it has more to do with if the macro environment weakens and customers take their own
production rates down or down from what they are currently expecting, that could come into play. And of course the
upper end of the range just would reflect that customers that today haven't filled in the September orders – you know,
just hadn't placed those orders yet because they didn't need to based on where lead times were. And so that would drive
the upside case. You know, the middle of the range case is kind of what we see in our backlog now and not making a
lot of assumptions that we get additional fill-in during the month of September. So hopefully that helps. Do you have a
follow-on, Chris?
<Q - Chris Caso>: Yeah, sure. Just as a follow up on that then, embedded in your guidance assuming the midpoint of
the range then, is it fair to assume sort of customer inventory and distributor inventory would be relatively flat
quarter-over-quarter in dollars?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Boy. It's kind of what I was saying before. I don't know that we – I guess to some degree that
may be the case in that we're not seeing signs of – in the form of backlog, signs of a ramp during the month of
September that you might – would more typically expect just given the upcoming holidays. So I guess you would say at
the middle of the range there's probably the assumption of flattish inventory, but I don't know that we put a lot of
assumptions about customer and distributor inventory into that guidance more so than just thinking about overall
demand.
Okay, Chris. Thank you for your questions, and we'll move to the next caller.

We'll go next to Tristan Gerra with Baird.
<Q - Tristan Gerra>: Hi. Good afternoon. Could you talk about OMAP as a percentage of Wireless in the quarter, and
what was the magnitude of the sequential decline and whether you expect some rebound in Q3?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Well, OMAP I think first half overall is running about 60% of the non-baseband revenue. So in
other words, OMAP plus connectivity is kind of a 40% – a 60%-40% split with OMAP being 60% of that revenue and
40% being connectivity. So from there, you can probably get pretty close in terms of what those trends were. But
clearly the decline was driven from OMAP. Connectivity was down, but I would describe down a small amount
compared to OMAP. Do you have a follow on, Tristan?
<Q - Tristan Gerra>: Sure. Could you give us an update on your pricing strategy for SVA in terms of your target of
getting back to the core growth that you have in your Analog business?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: You said for SVA?
<Q - Tristan Gerra>: For your Silicon Valley Analog, yeah.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: So I think their pricing strategy is going to be consistent with TI's own pricing strategy in the
catalog spaces like High Performance Analog and some of the – a good part of the Power product line, which is we
want to be competitive in terms of pricing, but at the same time, those markets, you tend to sell into – not always, but a

lot of relatively low volume applications where the focus from the customer perspective is much more on the product
specification, the performance characteristics of the product, as opposed to price. These products in general tend to be
relatively low priced products, meaning less than a dollar type of ASP. And so as a percentage of the customers' bill of
material, it represents a pretty small amount.
So customers for these products tend not to be hypersensitive on price. They're more focused on getting the right type
of product. And I think with the strength of the product line and portfolio that SVA has, the product – the focus is much
more on getting the word out, getting the support out to a much broader range of customers, and making sure of course
we're competitive on price. We're certainly not going to go out and try to position the product line so that it's not
competitive.
And frankly that was part of the issue in terms of that revenue growth before, was reaching for higher levels of gross
margin. Sometimes the pricing out of National was not competitive in the marketplace, and you saw their market share
loss as a result. You know, the strategy shift is just make sure you're competitive, but again make sure we're winning
products based on performance and support considerations as opposed to pricing.

Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura.
<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Thanks. Hey, Ron, just looking at your sales guidance this quarter, it seems a little bit worse
than what some other companies have reported thus far in July. If I look at Intel, they guided up 6%, which is a couple
points worse than what they normally do in Q3. Xilinx, if you look at their core business being down a couple percent,
that's also maybe one or two points worse than what they normally do in Q3. Your third quarter flat, I think is about 6
to 7 points below what you normally do. So I'm just kind of curious what is it about this environment that's hurting you
guys a little bit more?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Romit, my guess – first of all Intel probably has a different type of seasonal pattern. They
certainly are much more narrower in terms of their end market exposure. So I'm not sure that we can do much of direct
comparison there. And then I think similarly, Xilinx, if we were just looking at our coms infrastructure trends, they
might be different than what we see for overall, and clearly they're going to have a much stronger part of their mix tied
to coms infrastructure. So I think of all the companies – at least the ones that you have named, our exposure is probably
much broader than any of them.
And the second point is, you know, we really are operating in a more uncertain environment. And as we said, this is a
question not of the backlog is painting a very clear story and it's a negative story; this is more a question of we don't
have all the backlog visibility that we would normally have, and so in that type of environment – and I think a lot of
from what I have seen from other companies, that is not unique to TI and I suspect there's probably just different means
by which different management teams will choose to extrapolate what they see going forward. And so I don't – you
know, we have given you what we have given you. We explained the basis for it and what we have done. And I guess I
just need to let you sort it out in terms of how that compares to our other semiconductor peers. Okay. Do you have a
follow on, Romit?
<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Yeah, does the fact that Q3 being 6 to 7 points below seasonal, does that have any bearing on
how you guys think about the December and the March quarters?
<A - Kevin P. March>: No, too early for that at this time, Romit. I'd also add just to remind you that there's still – one
of the things – even if we did have a seasonal growth, we still have the unwind of baseband going on. So that's a $40
million sequential headwind 2 to 3Q. So if you adjust for that, it might not be down quite as sharply as you say,
although they're still down versus what a seasonal number might suggest. That seasonal number of 6% is actually
ex-baseband and refitted for the inclusion of National.

<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: Okay. Romit. Let me also just say, you know, as we said before, if this market wants to lift on
us versus the guidance we provided for Q3 or frankly even going into Q4, you know, we have inventory position, we
have manufacturing capacity. You know, I think you'll find our ability to flex up and support higher level demand
should it arrive, that flexibility is pretty high. So we really don't need to overly stress about what the outlook in Q4 will
look like. We'll work it as it comes toward us.
Okay, Romit. Thank you for your questions, and operator I think we have time for one additional caller.
Operator
Okay. Our final question will come from David Wong with Wells Fargo.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Thank you very much. You talked about in the past about how with Silicon Valley Analog,
you've got a bigger sales team and more field presence. Are you seeing any effect of this on design wins for the Silicon
Valley Analog products? And if so, do you expect the growth of the SVA division to actually accelerate past your other
Analog divisions at some point in the future?
<A - Ron Slaymaker>: I think that's a reasonable expectation, David. As you are implying in your question, right now
it's more measured in customer interest and in design wins. And those then will be precursors to actual revenue growth
that will occur later. But we've long said our assumptions coming into this acquisition was that the share losses that
National had experienced pre-acquisition likely would continue into the first year of the acquisition, and then we would
hope to have the revenue stabilized and running consistent with the market. And then for the next year and then in year
three basically have it trending faster than the market consistent with our own Analog growth.
So that would imply over the next couple years you could see a faster acceleration in SVA growth compared to TI's
own revenue just as it's coming kind of from a hole to moving consistent with our own revenue growth. And I'll also
say those assumptions that I just talked about were what we built into our financial returns and financial assessment on
the acquisition. Our internal goals of course are much more aggressive than that. And we're confident at this point that
just based on traction with customers, interest with customers, the design in rates, that we're going to be able to do
better than that. But we'll report it as it comes. Do you have a follow-on, David?
<Q - David M. Wong>: Yes. Your EPS guidance, does that assume any improvement in gross margin in the
September quarter? And if so, is this mix related, or is there some other factor that helps margin?
<A - Kevin P. March>: David, we mentioned early on in the call that there's some improvement inside there given that
really the EPS is about flat quarter-over-quarter, revenue is about flat quarter-over-quarter at the midpoint. So there's a
little bit of improvement in there because we'll see the wind-down of baseband at lower margin being replaced by the
calculator business at higher margin.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, David. Thanks for your questions, and thanks all of you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our
website. Good evening.
