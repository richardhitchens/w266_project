Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, a solid finish to the first
quarter with earnings per share of $1.32 and 5% organic sales growth.
Earnings were a little bit better than what we expected, driven by the higher organic sales. Segment operating profit
was up 9%, reflecting improvement in all five segments, and operating margins expanded by 90 basis points to 15.4%.
So a good start to the year which gives us confidence to increase the bottom end of our EPS guidance range. We now
expect 2014 earnings per share of $6.65 to $6.85, that's growth of 7% to 10% and an increase from our prior guidance
of $6.55 to $6.85.
Okay, turning to Slide 2. Organic sales grew 5% in the quarter with growth in all five segments. As the momentum
coming out of the fourth quarter of 2013 continued, in the commercial businesses we saw 7% growth in the Americas,
helped by the ongoing U.S. economic recovery, and we continue to see signs of improvement in Europe where organic
sales were up 3% in the quarter. The commercial businesses also saw 7% growth in Asia, led by China where sales
were up 14%, more than offsetting some softness in other parts of the region.
Looking at Aerospace, continued weakness in defense, where sales were down 2%, was more than offset by strong
growth in commercial OE and aftermarket where overall sales increased 8%.
Looking at orders now on page 3, overall, order trends remain positive for the majority of the portfolio. Just as a
reminder, we'll talk to orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. First in our commercial businesses, we
continue to see traction in North America. Despite some weather-related impacts at the beginning of the year, the
outlook for housing and commercial construction markets remain encouraging. North America residential HVAC
orders were up 19% versus last year as the housing market continues to improve and distributors stock for the summer
season.
The Architectural Billing Index, or the ABI, trends are positive and we see that coming through in our orders at Otis
where new equipment was up 39%. North American commercial HVAC orders were down 4% in the quarter, reflecting
an uneven demand for large engineered systems, although we continue to expect that business to grow for the full-year
2014.
In Europe, the economic environment is trending positively, albeit slowly. Euro zone PMI expanded for the ninth
consecutive month and economic sentiment is at the highest levels since about mid-2011. Unemployment continues to
be near all-time highs and deflation remains a concern.
At UTC, CCS [Climate, Controls and Security] commercial HVAC equipment and Fire & Security product orders grew
15% and 10% respectively, while Otis new equipment and CCS commercial refrigeration orders were each down about
2%.
Okay. On China, while reports recently suggest a property market slowdown in parts of the country, we continue to see
solid demand in housing and infrastructure in the first quarter. Otis new equipment orders were up 25% in the first
quarter with several large infrastructure project orders coming in the quarter. CCS commercial HVAC was up 10%, and
fire product orders were up mid-single digits. So our building and industrial systems businesses continue to be
well-positioned, building on the strength we saw in 2013.
Moving to Aerospace. With increasing air traffic and airline profits projected to be almost $19 billion this year, we
continue to see solid conversions of OE backlogs and good growth in our commercial aftermarket businesses. At Pratt
& Whitney, commercial spare orders were up 11% while at UTC Aerospace Systems spares orders were up 9%, so
good broad-based orders growth across the portfolio. We'll keep a close eye on China and the other emerging markets
and continue to look for signs of further progress in Europe where order rates and macroeconomic trends broadly
support our assumptions for organic growth as we move through the year.
Okay, let's go take a look at the first quarter specifically now on slide 4. Total reported sales increased 2%, as 5%
organic growth was partially offset by headwinds from net divestitures and FX. On the FX side, the benefits from the
euro were more than offset by headwinds in other currencies. Segment operating profit grew 9% and operating margins
increased 90 basis points, including the benefit, of course, from pension.

CCS saw solid drop-through and continues to drive cost reduction. Our operating profit grew 15% leading to margin
expansion of 200 basis points. Aerospace Systems and Pratt & Whitney expanded markets by 170 and 80 basis points
respectively, each on the higher commercial aftermarket, benefits from cost reduction actions as well as pension.
Earnings per share $1.32, that's down 5% as segment operating profit growth of 9% was more than offset by $0.20 of
net restructuring headwinds in the quarter. Recall that in the first quarter of 2013, we had $0.11 of net gains, while we
saw $0.09 of net restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2014 as we invested in cost reduction initiatives and ahead
of some expected gains around the middle of the year. Absent the impact of gains and restructuring in both this year
and last year, earnings per share were up 10%.
Free cash flow in the quarter was 83% of net income. Capital expenditures were $333 million. That's up 13% versus
last year as we continue to invest for the ramp up in commercial Aerospace. And working capital grew by $521 million
in the quarter, driven primarily by an inventory build to support sales growth in the year. We also acquired $335
million of stock under our share repurchase program and we expect to buy back a similar amount here in the second
quarter.
I'm going to stop there for now. I'll be back to talk more about the full year but first let me turn it over to Jay to walk
you through the business unit results.
Jay Malave
Thank, Greg.
Turning to page 5, Otis sales improved 7% at constant currency in the quarter, with new equipment sales up mid-teens
including solid growth from all areas, most notably, double digit growth in China, the Americas, Eastern Europe and
the Middle East. Service sales were up slightly.
Operating profit was up 1% at constant currency. The positive impact from higher sales volume was partially offset by
continued pricing pressure and carryover costs associated with the North America factory transformation.
New equipment orders were up 11%, with double digit growth in China and North America. EMEA orders were down
low single digit. With a strong order book and near-term completion of the factory transformation in North America,
Otis expects to see improving performance as the year progresses.
Guidance for the full year remains unchanged with profit expected to increase $100 million to $150 million of
mid-single digit sales growth.
On slide 6, Climate, Controls & Security increased profits 15% in the quarter on flat sales, resulting in another's sharp
increase in margins, up 200 basis points from prior year to 15.1%. Organic sales were up 3% in the quarter, benefiting
from product and marketing investments.
On a regional basis, the Americas business was up mid-single digit, driven by 21% growth in the residential HVAC
business, some of which was due to earlier stocking by distributors for the cooling season from what we experienced
last year. Europe is turning the corner and was up slightly, led by growth in commercial HVAC. China was up high
single digit, while Asia overall was flat, driven by softness in other Asian countries, and Transicold was up 7%.
Profit growth in the quarter was driven by strong conversion on organic sales as well as restructuring and net
productivity gains driven by ACE and Operational Excellence. Orders for global commercial HVAC equipment were
up low single digit. Orders for global Fire & Security products were up high single digit, partially offset by a decline in
the Fire & Security field businesses.
Transicold orders, which tend to be more choppy, were down high teens. With sound results in the first quarter, we
continue to expect profit growth of $225 million to $250 million on mid-single-digit organic sales growth at CCS.

Turning to Aerospace on slide 7. At Pratt & Whitney, organic sales were up 4% in the first quarter as commercial sales
growth across the businesses more than offset declines in military. Including the divestiture of Power Systems, sales
were down 2%. Large commercial aftermarket sales were up 10% over last year's first quarter which was the weakest
of 2013.
Operating profit was up 4% driven by higher organic sales, lower pension costs and restructuring savings which more
than offset headwinds from adverse large commercial OE mix, the Power Systems divestiture and the absence of last
year's contract closeout and partnership settlement benefits. For the full-year, we continue to expect Pratt & Whitney's
operating profit to be up $175 million to $200 million on low single-digit sales growth.
UTC Aerospace Systems delivered a solid quarter with 17% profit growth on 6% higher sales. Sales growth was driven
by higher commercial volumes with OEM up high single digit and aftermarket up 10%. Overall military sales were
down low single digit, with military OEM flattish and military aftermarket down mid-single digit.
Year-on-year profit growth was driven by higher commercial aftermarket volumes, continued synergy traction, pension
tailwinds and higher income from licensing agreements, partially offset by headwinds from higher engineering spend
and new program OE growth.
Operating margins expanded 170 basis points to 17.3%. Orders for commercial spares grew 9% on a year-over-year
basis with strength in both parts and provisioning. For the year, we continue to expect profit growth of $300 million to
$350 million by mid to high-single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems.
Turning to Sikorsky on slide 9, operating profit grew 8% on 9% higher sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a
total of 48 aircraft including 36 based on military platforms and 12 commercial. The sales increase was driven by
higher international military and commercial OE volumes.
Operating profit growth was driven by higher sales volume and net favorable contract performance adjustments in our
military business, partially offset by unfavorable aircraft and aftermarket mix.
During the first quarter, Sikorsky, the Turkish government and key Turkish aerospace suppliers signed a licensing and
manufacturing agreement for 109 multi-mission aircraft to be used by the Turkish government.
For the full year, we continue to expect flattish operating profit on high-single-digit organic sales growth.
With that, let me turn it to Greg for wrap up.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay thanks, Jay. So a solid start to the year and we continue to achieve significant milestones on our programs and
secure key wins for the future.
At Pratt & Whitney, IAE [International Aero Engines] reached a new production milestone in February when it shipped
its 6000th V2500 engine. We also continue to see strong demand for the GTF engine, with new engine offerings wins
at ANA and Tiger Air and additional orders in the regional jet market on both the Embraer E2 and the C-Series
platform. Customers truly see the advantage of our engine and have placed firm and option orders for over 5,300
engines to date.
And on the military side, the Republic of Korea announced its selection of the JSF as its next-generation fighter jet.
Korea's commitment to purchase 40 F-35A conventional takeoff and landing aircraft will bring expected international
deliveries to over 700 aircraft.
At Aerospace Systems, the segment recently announced a long-term agreement with Lufthansa Technik for
maintenance, repair, overhaul services for aircraft interiors, products, sensors and integrated systems on the Boeing 787
aircraft. We also recently extended our C.A.R.E. program with Singapore Airlines which provides repair services and
asset management to the airline's expanded fleet of Boeing 777 aircraft.

Also in the quarter, Sikorsky announced the entry into service of the S-76D. As Jay mentioned, Sikorsky also signed
agreements with the Turkish government to supply 109 T-70 helicopters which are variants of Sikorsky's S70i
international Blackhawk. On the U.S. government side, prospects for the combat rescue helicopter and the VXX
presidential helicopter program remains positive, with firm decisions expected around the middle of this year.
Okay let's talk about CMH for just a second. We continue to make progress on the CMH program and we've recently
executed a second Principles of Agreement with the Canadian government which now defines a final configuration for
the aircraft as well as a phased delivery schedule which allows for the retirement of the Canadian Sea King helicopters
beginning in 2015. We also now expect that the final cost of the aircraft will be significantly higher than previously
estimated as a result of additional requirements, retrofit costs and extension of the program schedule.
We continue to negotiate the financial impact of these program changes with the Canadian government but we would
expect to record a charge this year associated with the acquisition contract upon the completion of definitive
agreements. We expect the charge will be largely offset by other one-time gains and beneficial items during the year.
We'll provide an update later in the quarter as we work to finalize the agreements and complete our analysis of the total
program cost.
At BIS, our Building and Industrial Systems, we had a very strong first quarter with combined organic sales growth of
5%. The integration activities continue to progress well, and the CCS and Otis teams continue to look for ways to serve
our customers more efficiently and offer integrated, high-value systems. We're pleased with the continued CCS
momentum, the return of profit growth at Otis and the overall growth prospects for the business.
And we continue to win orders in key emerging markets. Otis's 25% order growth in China included large orders for
the Shenzhen and Chengdu metros, and CCS was awarded major maintenance contracts for the fire safety and HVAC
systems of the new Cathay Pacific Cargo Terminal in Hong Kong. We continue to expect the combined capabilities of
CCS and Otis in the new Building and Industrial System organization to further accelerate top line growth.
So just as you heard from the presidents in March, each of the businesses is well-positioned in our core markets, and
continued innovation will allow us to drive long-term organic growth.
Okay, taking a look at the rest of 2014, no real changes from what we told you last month. The compares get tougher as
we move through the year but order trends and end markets are essentially in line with our expectations so far. Of
course, as we've seen with recent developments in the Ukraine, things can change quickly, but as I sit here today, we
remain confident in our updated guidance range of $6.65 to $6.85 with a path toward the high end on sales of about $64
billion. And we continue to expect quarterly earnings per share growth of about 9% to 10% per quarter, absent the
impact of gains and restructuring for the remainder of the year.
We continue to invest in restructuring. With visibility to some additional gains and good payback restructuring projects
across the business, we now expect to spend about $375 million on restructuring this year, all offset by one-time gains.
In the first quarter we spent $125 million and we would expect the spend to be relatively level-loaded for the rest of the
year. The gains, however, should come largely in the second quarter.
Strong cash generation remains a hallmark of UTC and although pressured by the increase in CapEx and working
capital in 2014, we continue to target free cash flow equal to net income for the year. We're going to maintain our
placeholders $1 billion for each of share repurchase, debt pay down and M&A activities.
Looking ahead, we remain focused on growth and execution in 2014. We're well-positioned in our end markets and
we'll continue to leverage our industry-leading franchises and global scale. The UTC portfolio is poised to take
advantage of the commercial aerospace growth and urbanization megatrends over the next decade.
So with that, let's stop and open up the call for questions. Stephanie?

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Julian.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Good morning. I just had a question on Otis. So I guess in Q1 you had organic sales
growth in line with the full-year target of 6%. The EBIT was flat though. So I guess what's giving you the confidence
that with the given organic growth run rate for the rest of the year you can get the EBIT up? Is it just the U.S. factory
location costs were again a very big headwind in Q1 and that drops out or is there something in the mix that you're
expecting?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: There's a couple of pieces here, Julian. I think the Florence factory transformation was a
headwind but a small, small headwind this quarter, I think less than $10 million, so it drove a little bit of headwind.
Really the biggest issue was continued pricing pressure that we saw around the portfolio and if you think about it,
where the growth came in the quarter, we had 16% growth in OE and only 1% growth in the service business. So it is
the pricing pressure around OE that is really pushing margins down a little bit and causing us to see, I would say, tepid
growth on the Op profit side here in the first quarter. But it will get better during the course of the year.
We expect service to improve, we'll come down the cost curve on the new equipment and we'll get cost reduction in the
factories and we'll see some of the benefits from the integration of BIS. So all of those things give us confidence we're
still on track for $125 million to $150 million of profit growth at Otis for the year.
<A - Jay Malave>: $100 million to $150 million.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: $100 million to $150 million. Thank you, Jay.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Great. Thanks. And then in I guess BIS overall, you were targeting, I think, around
mid-single digit growth for the year. You did 7% growth in Q1. What's your sense on the sort of nonresidential markets
in North America specifically? Is that trending in line or have you seen kind of choppiness there through the last year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: There's really I would say two different stories in North American non-res. Clearly on the
Otis side, we've seen very, very solid growth in the commercial construction side of the business. And again, that's
being driven by the ABI above 50 here for most of last year and really solid momentum in the commercial building
space.
On the CCS side, specifically on the Carrier side, I think Jay mentioned a little tougher compare there on the orders for
the Carrier commercial business and down about 4%. But keep in mind I think a little different business there. That is
primarily 80% a retrofit business and only about 20% relates to new building construction. So we are seeing traction, I
think, on new buildings.
I'd also point out that the Otis new equipment business fell much more dramatically than the Carrier commercial
business during the last downturn so I still think we'll see growth in commercial business at Carrier for the year, slight
growth, and we expect the order trend momentum at Otis to continue as well.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a couple of quick ones. One with respect to the pricing pressure at Otis, I wondered if
you might kind of give us some color there. Has that intensified or eased at all? What's been the – your sense on that
this quarter versus what you talked about last year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I wouldn't say there's any trend change. We continue to see pricing pressure in most of the
markets for new equipment. As you can imagine, China remains the most competitive of all of the new markets. We're
continuing to see pricing pressure there. North America, a little bit better. We've got new products that have come out
that have – we've done very well in terms of market penetration. Pricing looks to have stabilized, at least in North
America. In Europe, well it's Europe. I mean, it's a tough, tough market. So I wouldn't say we've seen an inflection here
but I don't think we've seen any improvement in pricing.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay, great. And on the military front with respect to the down 2% number, you quantified
the numbers in UTAS but I wondered if you might speak to the declines you called out at Pratt and then at Sikorsky
given obviously what should be a pretty tough aftermarket compare there.
<A - Jay Malave>: Sure, Carter. At Pratt & Whitney the military business was down low double digits, the OE
business was down high teens and the aftermarket business was down low single digits. At Sikorsky, the military
business, the OE was up as well as the aftermarket. The OE was up on the back of the international deliveries, the
higher international deliveries, the aftermarket was up, as I said during my remarks, that there was performance
adjustments, contract adjustments, that impact profit as well as impact sales, so that business including that was up
around 10%.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: If you exclude the adjustment, what would the growth rate have been?
<A - Jay Malave>: It would have been more, I think, flattish.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay, all right. Thanks for the color, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Okay, Carter.
Operator
Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Could you speak a little bit more to Pratt spares? I guess first of all on the mix, the V versus
the legacy 4000, 2000 and then just thinking about the year, the comps get a lot tougher starting this quarter. So do you
expect to be up as we – and I know you're not going to give quarterly guidance for this one line item but maybe more
on the profile?
<A - Jay Malave>: Let me start with some of the data points. On orders the PW4000 and V2500 were both up. The
PW2000 was down, but if you recall in the fourth quarter we had a significant amount of orders for the PW2000 for
delivery in 2014, so the book-to-bill on the 2000 was well above – around 1.5.
As far as going forward, as far as what we see it's really not much of a change from our expectations for mid-single
digit growth for the year. As Greg mentioned during his remarks, traffic is still flowing well, airline profitability is still
strong. We are seeing a little bit of higher content per shop visit as we start the year, but again these things change. So
really no significant change to our expectations for the full-year at this point.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay, and then just secondly on Transicold, sales up nicely but orders down quite a bit. Baltic
Dry Index is down pretty significantly in Q1. So this is a pretty quick turn business so when you think about profile,
particularly margin profile for CCS the rest of year, how does this have an impact?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Clearly I think we've got some headwind going into Q2 at CCS. I think container was down
more than 50% in orders in the first quarter, but again sales were up big. So your point is it's a very short cycle
business. We still see the trend for refrigerated transport on a positive basis, up probably 3% to 4% this year.
So it's lumpy in the orders and I wouldn't panic about the Transicold as we sit here in April. I think it was a year ago we
went six months without orders in the container business and then all of a sudden it was gangbusters. So we should
really focus on the longer-term prospects. I think we're well-positioned with great products as well as a continuing
expanding market.
<A - Jay Malave>: Joe, our expectations for the year are not overly aggressive, we're expecting for the total Transicold
business to be up low to mid-single digit, so we're not banking on big growth in that business this year.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. If I might just sneak just one more quick one in. Greg, you have 375 of restructuring to
offset now plus what seems like it could be a couple hundred million or I don't know in the $100 million range plus of
CMH charge. So could you give a little color on the gains that you're expecting to generate?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, no actually I won't, Joe. I'll tell you this. We do see gains out there, adequate gains, to
cover what we think is the range of potential loss on the CMH. And the good news on CMH is with this new contract I
think we get a big chunk of the acquisition cost behind us. We'll be changing the way we account for this, going to a
cost-to-cost basis, so it gets it behind us and we have the flexibility with some things that we've got in the pipeline to be
able to cover most of that cost. So as I think about guidance, $6.65 to $6.85, still very confident even with the CMH
charge.

Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, folks.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Just a couple of things. Just on resi HVAC in the U.S., it's just a little peculiar that people
would be stocking early it seems. Is there something going on there? Were stocks extraordinarily low? Any other color
you could shed on that?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well I think as we talked about most of last year, the dealer stock was relatively low on a
historic basis. If we look at inventories today, it looks like they're up about 20% as we end the first quarter, which is in
line with the 19% growth we saw the U.S. resi business. Again, dealers are preparing for what they think is going to be
a very strong summer season, and despite the weather issues that we saw in the first quarter, I think people are
generally optimistic. Housing starts are trending positively. We'll do over a million. And keep in mind that this is still
an 80% add-on or replacement business. Only 20% really goes to resi new construction. And as the U.S. economy
picks up, I think everybody's got confidence we're going to see a very strong start to the season here. It's early though,
so let's – I don't want to get ahead of ourselves here. We still expect good growth, but clearly not at that 19%, 20% that
we saw in the first quarter.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And also that's kind of tough to really know what's going on with pricing this early in the
season, but what do you see coming out on pricing both in resi HVAC and then commercial HVAC this year?
<A - Jay Malave>: The visibility that we have, Jeff, is a little bit a benefit in pricing on the residential side. I don't
have visibility on the commercial side, but a little bit of an uptick that we saw in the quarter.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. And then finally from me, I just wonder if we could come back to Otis and service. Is
service price also declining or are your comments strictly around OE equipment? And I'm wondering if you're seeing

any firming in service in Europe at all?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Service is still tough in Europe. We're still seeing some price headwind, especially in the
southern markets. I think service was down even in France this time, and again it was offset. It was good in Germany, it
was good in the U.K., it was good in Russia.
I think what's most encouraging as I think about Otis and service, we've been talking about this for several years, is
we're getting really good traction in China. Last year the service business in China was up about 20%, first quarter it
was up almost 20% in service, and last year I think we added about 50 branches or depots for service. We're going to
add another 50 this year. We're getting traction there.
I think, again, this issue of pricing in Europe, again, we think it's going to stabilize as we go throughout the year. We've
seen signs of that, but the future of service for Otis is going to be in China and that's where the growth is going to come
and that's where we're focused right now.

Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - Jay Malave>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Back to Otis, again. In terms of this phasing of the quarters as we go through the year, are
you expecting it to continue to be all the EBIT growth to come in the second half and Q2 to be relatively flat
year-over-year on an EBIT basis?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: That's probably right. You might get a little bit of growth here, but primarily again, as you
think about where the cost reduction is going to come on the factories, where the cost reduction is going to come in
terms of some of the integration activities that BIS is undertaking, we're seeing mostly cost on the front end, and then
you pick up the benefits on the back end.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. Back to CMH. So Greg, are you implying now that the contract, new contract that
we're going to have here, is going to be restructured to the point that you can actually charge off the entire loss that you
were going to see with new deliveries, so we won't have this $14 million per unit hit on a go forward basis?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Let me try and explain this as succinctly as possible. We're going to go to a percentage of
completion accounting, or cost-to-cost. So we will write off about 70% to 75% of the acquisition cost or the losses on
the acquisition contract this year, because we're about 70% to 75% done.
There is some small tailwind in the next couple of years as we complete deliveries, but it's not on the order – it's
nowhere near what we were talking about before, $120 million plus a year, it's substantially lower. On top of that, we
will start to see the benefit of the ISS contract kick in in 2015 and 2016 to offset some of the losses.
So the goal here is to get most of the bad news behind us. I think by adopting this accounting, which we think is
probably a more realistic look in terms of the way the contract's been restructured, gives us the opportunity to do that.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: And just as a last thought, what does this do to the Sikorsky guidance for the year? I think the
flat EBIT number had baked into it that $120 million loss.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, obviously they had $120 million baked in. And we'll run this through the segment
results, so whatever the charge is there. The gains aren't coming at Sikorsky, but the cost certainly will. So as you think
about Sikorsky guidance that we've given, it is ex-CMHP, except for the $120 million that's baked into the forecast.

Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you. Actually I want to follow a little bit more with respect to what David said. I
mean, Greg, if I understand, you've built almost all the helicopters already. So the charge should be, I don't know, $350
million or $400 million, the way to think about it when you affect this accounting?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes. Howard, I'm not going to get into the exact number. The reason is, as I mentioned
earlier on, we renegotiated the scope of the aircraft and so the aircraft will be more expensive because of the increased
requirements of the spec changes that we're making. We've got some retrofit costs that hadn't all been previously
contemplated. So the total cost for the aircraft is going to go up. And as I said, we're 70%, 75% done with the total
acquisition contract so it's a good trade here. I think we're pretty confident that we've got the wherewithal to cover this.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: I mean forever and a day I've been hoping that – I mean, because when you look on the
balance sheet it's over $800 million of sort of capitalized costs, if I'm not mistaken, related to this contract at the
moment.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes it's actually over $1 billion, but who's counting. I mean I guess keep in mind too, we're
still negotiating with the customer on this contract; we're not done yet. So we've got to finish the contract negotiations,
which should be in a couple of weeks. We've got to go through that and do a bottoms-up estimate to complete for the
whole contract. I think when Louis stands up at EPG by the end of May, we should be in a pretty good position to give
you guys a number. And clearly if it happens after that, we'll let everybody know as soon as we do what the impact is
here.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: I appreciate that. That's a big help. The other thing that's important has been that you've been
working to lower cost in a lot of the other businesses. Could you address some of the actions that UTA has done to
drive out its cost? I mean clearly there was some profitability related to pension and spares but you're also trying to
lower the recurring cost of what you're doing to become even more competitive.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: UTA I think you're referring to UT Aerospace Systems as opposed to UT Automotive.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Yes. [Laughter]. You and I have been around too long.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes I think so. There's a couple things. I think as you mentioned, we got some good news
out of pension in the first quarter. We continue to get good news out of cost reduction on the products. We're coming
down the learning curve on the 787. I think we're up to 10 ship sets a month on 787, so driving cost down there. Also,
we continue with some of the synergy savings. We're going to get about $100 million of incremental synergy savings
during the course of the year and there's probably $25 million sitting in the first quarter.
So all of those things that Alain and Dave Gitlin and Mike Dumais talked about a month ago, are all coming to fruition,
really good margin expansion. Obviously the pension is a little bit of a one-timer. We got a big benefit here in the first
quarter, but still underlying good, solid call cost reduction, good execution across the Aerospace Systems business.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then last, I noticed you had about $100 million of divestitures or proceeds from
divestitures. Can you characterize them a little bit and are there some other businesses that continue to keep Nicole
busy?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think actually these were keeping Geraud busy because primarily this was, again this is part
of the whole portfolio rationalization that Geraud has been talking about for last three or four years. And nothing big on
the horizon, a couple small fire security related businesses but nothing significant. I think it was a Guardian business as

Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Sam.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Greg, you mentioned that the majority of the gains are going to be coming in the second
quarter and I know you don't typically like to give any sort of a quarterly run rate. But how should we think about the
size of the gains that are going to exceed the restructuring in the second quarter?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, we talked about $375 million of gains for the year to offset the restructuring. All $375
million will come in the second quarter as it relates to that piece that is covering the restructuring. As far as the gains to
cover the Sikorsky charge, there will be a little bit in the second quarter and then some in the third and fourth.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. And then just going back to some of the comments around Europe, I think Building
and Industrial Systems being up 3%. You've guided Europe to being up slightly and so I'm trying to just think about –
you just talked about Otis service really hasn't improved. So where is that improvement and at what point are you
prepared to talk about Europe perhaps being a little bit better this year than you've had in the outlook?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Probably in December. [Laughter]. So look, I think Europe has been better. Again we've
seen strength in Northern Europe on the new equipment side. I think I mentioned on the service side as well. So good
order traction in Northern Europe. Southern Europe remains a concern. I think orders were down in Spain and Greece
and Italy. So again it's this balance. But I think generally we look at consumer sentiment. It's up across the continent.
Unemployment remains high but things are getting better and I just don't want to declare victory.
I think right now first-quarter positive signs. We look at auto sales are starting to pick up, interest rates remain very
low. All of those indicators are there that we should see a recovery. And so absent, again, something bad happening in
Eastern Europe to upset the apple cart, I think we feel pretty good about the projections that we've got right now.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. And one last question, the $660 million increase in inventory, you said it's supporting
sales growth later in the year. So when we look at the year-end, should we expect inventories to be flat with where they
were at the end of last year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: That is the plan, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Look if inventory is up a little bit I think the issue will probably be at Sikorsky on the CMH
program we continue to add. Pratt's starting to add inventory as they start to ramp up for production on CSeries and on
the A320 neo. So there will be a little bit of inventory growth but the growth that you saw in the first quarter, although
it was across all the businesses, you should see most of that start to come back into cash flow as we go through the
year.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Yeah. Good morning, Greg.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Ron.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Just maybe a follow-on to Howard's question. How should we think about M&A? You hinted
at the Investor Meeting up in Connecticut that you guys like bigger M&A. How should we think about that over the
next 12 to 18 months? Is UTC contemplating doing something? How do we think about it?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, in very simple terms I would say I think there's no big deals this year. As we sit here in
whatever this is, April, the thought of actually consummating a big deal this year is very unlikely, but we continue to
look. And I think there will be some smaller deals, less than probably $1 billion for the total year still, again primarily
in the CCS side of the business or BIS side, and then we'll continue to look for those opportunities of scale. We want to
do things that fit into the core but then also, will capitalize on the global scale.
We're going to continue to buy back shares this year, as we talked about, and if there's an opportunity without M&A,
maybe we'll take share buyback up again towards the end of the year.
But right now, we're focused on this as more of a long-term goal, and pricing is very difficult on the M&A market
today. When we bought Goodrich back in 2011, timing was very, very good. Interest rates remain low, but today,
prices are up, as you know, on the equity side and everybody wants a 30% premium which makes these deals very,
very difficult.
So we're going to continue to look for value, but I have to tell you, with underlying strength of the business with good
organic growth, I'm not in a hurry to spend shareholder money on deals just to grow. We don't need to buy growth.
We'll buy opportunistically, we'll buy for value and we'll buy in the core.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Okay, great. And then just second question, changing gears a little bit. When we think about
the your turbo fan, you're starting to move into a period here when we're not too far away from the A320 neo going into
service. How are you guys going to recognize profitability on those engines? Because my understanding is you're
selling something like 80% of them with power-by-the-hour contracts. So how will it be different? Won't it be different
than what we currently see with the V2500? Or how is that going to go?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. Right now, again, it's a little bit in a state of flux because I think there's a new revenue
recognition standard coming out from the FASB in May – it was supposed to be due out last year – which is going to
cause us to re-look at how we recognize revenue. But as we sit here today we're going to continue to recognize revenue
the way we always have at the commercial engine business which is, as we ship an engine we'll recognize the revenue,
or we'll recognize the loss on the engine when we ship.
We don't have the ability that Rolls-Royce does to smooth earnings over the life of the aftermarket and OE contract
where you can look at a 20-year aftermarket revenue stream and just normalize margins. That's just not allowed under
U.S. GAAP, and it won't be allowed under the new revenue recognition standard, either. Once this new Rev Rec
standard comes out we'll take a look at it. It's not adopted until 2017 which is just coincident with the big ramp-up that
we're going to see in the GTF production. So we've got time. We'll take a look at it and see what the impact is. It will
impact some of the other businesses, because it will force us to go to percentage of completion on some of the military
programs, so the Black Hawk. But again, a little early to worry about that.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Okay, and if I could squeak-in one quick one. It's my understanding in the quarter the China
orders I noticed were up 27%, and in that I think you guys have two big China orders. If you were to exclude the two
major orders out of China, how would we think about...?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: That was about half of the growth came from infrastructure projects, and not just those two,
but broadly speaking, half was infrastructure, half was on the property side.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.

Our next question comes from Rob Stallard with the Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thanks so much. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Rob.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Greg, just a quick aftermarket question. Should we read anything into the slowdown in the
order growth in the first quarter, or is that just the normal timing ahead of the price increase?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: The first quarter is typically the slowest quarter for order growth, as you mentioned we
increased prices, catalog prices, January 1. The catalog gets published, I think, October 1. So we saw a big ramp-up in
fourth quarter orders across the Aero business. So first quarter I think I feel pretty good about it. This is all driven
continued RPM growth. The airlines are flying the airplanes. The airlines are making money, and they're bringing the
engines back to be repaired. We're seeing actually the most encouraging thing is content per shop visit is starting to
trend more positively. So I think it all feels pretty good. We don't expect this trend – we're not going to grow 16% for
the rest of the year, but we still feel very confident in the guidance for spares for the year.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Then secondly, on the share buyback. You obviously were trending ahead of that overall
annual amount in Q1. You said you're going to see the same in Q2. Is there any sort of strategy behind this, or is it just
the availability of cash?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Be there early. The key, of course, is the quicker you buy the shares back, the better the
average share count is for the year, and we've got the cash sitting here. We took advantage of that. We bought back
most of these shares early in the first quarter. We're buying back shares through a 10b-5 program today in the
marketplace. And we'll probably do that again in the third quarter as we try to get ahead of this. As we get to the fourth
quarter what we'll probably spend all the share buyback by the end of the third, if cash looks good and there's no other
big M&A opportunities out there, we'll probably take share buyback up again just like we did last year. I'm not talking
about a big number, but a little bit.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Great. Thanks so much.

Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, thanks so much. So to follow up on CMH, so Greg, was the total expected loss higher
than it had been before as a result of the new contract?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: As I said, Cai, the total cost of the aircraft is going to go up. And you've got new specs, new
specifications from the customer and a little bit higher retrofit costs, and the program is going to last a little bit longer
than the acquisition. So it will go up. But again, I'm not prepared to tell you exactly how much, because quite frankly
we're not done negotiating. I just know as I sit here today, it's going to be higher. And we will clarify all of that.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Right. But before, it kind of looked like roughly 335 if we do the rollout. And for a contract
of this size, it kind of sounds like this total number could be in the area of $500 million to $600 million. And if a
quarter of it is still in front of us, is it unfair to assume that we got another $100 million to $150 million, something in
the order of magnitude in front of us in 2015 and 2016?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Cai, you're getting way ahead of me here. Until we get the contract actually negotiated, until
we know what the total contract value is going to be both the aftermarket and the OE and all the trades are made, before

we get the EAC done, I really can't comment. All I know is the aircraft is going to be more expensive. As I said, we're
70% to 75% done. So again, depending upon what these retrofits look like. I'm going to stay out of the math for today,
and I'll let my boss do that for you hopefully in May.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay. Then just back maybe to the principle, so we basically split this into two contracts,
which is equipment and then aftermarket support so that the aftermarket support portion of this should be profitable. Is
that of right way to think of it?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: As has always been the case, Cai, I think we've always said that the money in this contract,
at least for the last five years, has been the aftermarket contract that provided the shield, if you will, for the losses on
the OE, and that's not going to change.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay. And then a last one, the GTF with kind of the slip on the CSeries, how many units are
we looking for this year? And give us some color on the expected build in unit production maybe in 2015 and 2016?
<A - Jay Malave>: Are you talking deliveries this year, Cai?
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes.
<A - Jay Malave>: Yeah. You're talking small numbers. You're probably in the range of less than 10 shipments this
year. It's small numbers.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: And how does that build in 2015 and 2016?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I was going to say, if you think about the run rate production of somewhere between 36 and
48 aircraft a year, it will build over the next several years. Again, I think we originally planned about 20 aircraft this
year or 20 deliveries this year, it will build next year. But I've got to tell you the real ramp will be starting at the end of
next year on the neo, whereby 2017 we'll be delivering 500-plus engines a year. So CSeries, a very important customer
but the volumes there are going to be very small compared to what we're going to see on the neo.

Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: At CC&S, you guys had $43 million in restructuring cost in the quarter and that's higher
than we've seen in some time. What's the focus of the restructuring at CC&S and what should we expect to see over the
course of the year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: The biggest piece of the restructuring for the quarter was actually a factory that we had
outside of Milan called Villasanta where we made commercial, I'm trying to think of what's the right word for it,
chillers. And again, we've been downsizing that facility for a number of years. We finally in the first quarter here
agreed with the works council there on a plan to close that facility, and again that was a relatively large portion of the
charge. There is some other head count-related actions and some smaller things around the globe but Villasanta is
probably the biggest piece of the restructuring in the first quarter.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: So then going on later in the year we shouldn't see that level, I assume?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: There will be additional restructuring across CCS. Again I think most of the factory actions,
I think, are done. I think what you're going to see is more BIS integration-related activities as we close offices and

<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay and that at UTAS, you said E&D was higher in the quarter and what's driving the
increase right now and how do you look at the E&D trajectory going forward for UTAS?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah it was higher but we're talking a small number, right, less than $10 million of growth
in E&D for the quarter. Really if you think about everything that's on the plate at UTAS, you've got obviously the
A350, the CSeries, the neo, the 777X now, I mean all of these new programs driving requirements. The 787-9. We have
the dash-10 coming up. There's all sorts of fun things to do there and all that's driving a little bit higher engineering
expense. So engineering, we think it's more front-loaded. We think for the full-year, total across the Aero businesses
will be relatively flat but a little bit higher here in the first half.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: So you're not looking at a – sort of as you take the 787-8 up, there's enough work on the
dash-9 and the dash-10 that we shouldn't see this come down very quickly over the next 12 to 18 months. Is that fair?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Again, I think the pipeline is pretty full at the Aero – both at Pratt Whitney and at the
Aerospace Systems Group, I think the engineering pipe is pretty full. Remember, we're going to get done with the
CSeries this year and enter into revenue service hopefully towards the end of the year, early next year. And you've got
the neo, you've got the Mitsubishi Regional Jet. You've got Irkut out there and then you've got the Embraer plane
coming after that. So, engineering spending again, it will come down gradually at Pratt as all these aircraft get certified.
It will be the same kind of profile that you're going to see at the Aerospace Systems business.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Okay.

Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura. Your line is open.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Morning, guys.
<A - Jay Malave>: Good morning.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, Greg. Just maybe a little more on this disconnect between Otis and commercial
HVAC in North America, up 39 on Otis, down four commercial. I hear your point about the retrofit but that's still a
pretty big difference. Is there anything else you see going on in terms of the lag in the market? Or I know you were
coming out with some new applied products. Is there anything going on there? It just seems like probably, even
adjusting for this retrofit point you made, a little bit of a wider gap than you would think.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. I think we continue to see really good traction on the light commercial rooftops. I
think again, where we are lagging and we have lagged for a number of years is on the applied side. To your point, we
have new products in the pipeline, new products coming out that we think will address this as we go through the year.
That's why we're confident again that sales will pick up in the commercial business as we move through the year as we
get these new products out there. But clearly the issue has been on the applied. This is not a new phenomenon. The
small rooftops continue to be very good business for us, good share, but we're a little bit behind on the applied side.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. And then just following up on your point on China service really being the story
for Otis going forward, did you have to take any more additional actions there to kind of gain critical mass? And have
you seen any meaningful shift in the willingness to pay OEs to do the service?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No. I think this is about investing for the future. You've got to continue to add service
technicians, you've got to continue to add infrastructure, offices and depots. Otis has been making investments for the
last two years now. We've added a couple of thousand people into the service workforce over there. This will take time.

You also have to remember, the way we go to market there in China is a little bit different because our biggest business
was at [indiscernible] (55:02) as we go through agents and we don't get the same attachment rate or conversion rate
there. We're working with the agents to make sure that we can capture more of that service revenue and find a win-win
with the agents to capture that going forward. So I think we're getting good traction, it's going to be an investment for
us for a number of years but margins will continue to improve as we get better root density and as we can expand the
footprint there in China.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Thanks, guys.

Our final question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Myles.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Maybe one quick clarification on CMH. Just for 2015 as you look at it in isolation everybody
built in a loss on the delivery of a set of aircraft, is your baseline assumption now that we're in a better position or a
worse position or a neutral position in that regard?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I don't think we're in a worse position, but I really can't tell you exactly where we are. Again
the idea is to get a big chunk of the cost behind us this year to eliminate most of the headwind, but I'm very reluctant,
Myles, to go out there until we get this thing negotiated to give you a final number.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Okay. And then the other clarification or maybe color I wanted was on the F-35. There was a
fan failure and the fix that's ongoing, how is that affecting your deliveries, your progress, your recognition on the
contracts and where is the escape structure from here?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think we're on track for the F135 engines. We had good deliveries in the first quarter. We
continue to come down the cost curve. There was an issue on a test stand. We talked about that. I think again we
understand root cause, working on all that. So again, these things happen. That was an engine that was long cycle
endurance and we are clearly on track with the development of the technical aspects of that engine.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Okay great. Thanks.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. Thanks, Myles.
All right so with that, let me just wrap up. And first of all maybe just a little housekeeping here. First of all, welcome
Casey Forrest to the IR team. Casey's joining us from our financial planning group, so Casey will be on the phone with
you guys later today. I want to thank [ph] Josh Bannis (57:43) for his 3.5 years of service to the IR group here. He's
done a great job. Many of you know him and I hope you wish him well. He's off to get a real job as CFO of our
actuation and prop business over in the U.K. so we wish he and his family well.
So with that, thanks very much for listening and we look forward to hearing from you guys today. Thanks very much.
