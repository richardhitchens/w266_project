Harvey M. Schwartz
Thanks, Heather, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.
Turning to Slide 1, we want to start by reviewing the meaningful enhancements we've made to our balance sheet since
2007. This slide summarizes the significant improvement in our credit profile. We have reduced assets by 18%, our
global liquidity reserve has almost tripled, and our Level 3 assets are down by over 40%. Our funding program has
been significantly enhanced with improved term and increased diversity of our funding sources. Common equity has
grown by more than 80%. You can do the math, leverage has been cut by more than half.
Supporting our strengthened balance sheet is a robust risk management infrastructure. We continue to mark-to-market
the vast majority of our balance sheet on a daily basis. Across the balance sheet, regardless of the risk measure you use,
total size, Level 3 assets, capital or liquidity, we have made a significant transformation. However, we're not
complacent. We're always looking to improve, and we'll continue to refine our approach.
With that as a background, let's dive into each of these areas in more detail. On slide 2 you can see we've significantly
reduced our balance sheet since 2007. Over that period, our financial instruments owned are down 26%. While we
reduced inventory and risk, we maintain a high-velocity balance sheet. As you can see in the chart on the right, 85% of
our market-making inventory turns over in six months or less.
As Liz will discuss later, we also take a very conservative approach to funding the balance sheet and ensuring that term
funding is well in excess of our needs. Balance sheet limits are reviewed regularly as we assess client demand and
manage our risk profile.
Turning to slide 3, here we show the significant improvement in the asset quality of our balance sheet. As of the first
quarter, we had $41 billion of Level 3 assets reflecting only 4.5% of our total assets. Importantly, as Level 3 assets
have declined, we have grown shareholders equity substantially.
Let's move to slide 4. While we've made significant changes to our balance sheet since 2007, the change is more
pronounced when you exclude our lower risk assets. If you back out cash, segregated cash and securities, and
collateralized agreements, we have reduced assets by more than $150 billion to $471 billion. Over that period we grew
total equity by 85%. Importantly, common equity has represented the vast majority of the growth. The reduction in risk,
combined with a significantly higher level of equity, had driven leverage to a record low. Adjusting out lower risk
assets, leverage is down nearly 60% since 2007. Importantly for creditors, new regulatory capital requirements will
constrain industry releveraging in the future.
Moving to slide 5, let's spend a moment on our regulatory capital ratios. The Federal Reserve has approved the firm to
come off the parallel run and therefore starting in the second quarter, our capital ratios are determined under the
transitional provisions of Basel III. As a result, the transitional ratios are not only the most relevant, but also a better
assessment of our risk-based capitalization.
Our transitional ratio benefits from a phase-in of capital deductions, the most significant of which is a $9 billion charge
for our investments in certain funds where we invest alongside clients. Under the Volcker Rule, we are required to
significantly reduce those investments.
On the left side of the slide, we detail that our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio on a transitional basis was 11.3%
using the advanced approach. Under the standardized approach, our transitional ratio was 10.9%. As you can see on the
right-hand side of the slide, our risk-weighted assets under the advanced approach are approximately $600 billion. $355
billion in credit risk, $155 billion in market risk, and $90 billion in operational risk.
Let me make a few brief points on the supplementary leverage ratio. Given that the proposed rule hasn't been finalized
and won't take effect until 2018, to date we have not taken any significant actions. When we have a final rule, there are

multiple options that we can pursue. On the capital side of the equation, we will benefit from a natural tailwind over
time as we comply with the Volcker Rule and reduce the $9 billion capital deduction. With respect to the asset side of
the equation, there are also steps we can take if needed.
For example, as of quarter-end we had over $260 billion of assets associated with secured client financing activities.
These are generally lower-risk collateralized assets. We can ultimately decide if needed to reduce the lower returning
portion within these balances. Regarding a new proposal, our best estimate as of March 31, including our recent $2
billion preferred stock issuance, is 4.3%. If you further incorporate the capital impact of reducing our fund investments
to comply with the Volcker Rule, we estimate it would be 4.9%.
Moving to slide 6, let's spend a moment on stress testing, an important part of risk management at Goldman Sachs. The
firm has a long history of stress testing, which is critical to evaluating the risks that we take. By the late 1990s, the firm
developed currency-focused sovereign stress tests and credit spread-widening stress tests for our major credit books.
These initial stress tests form the foundation of what we do today. Over time, we have continued to expand our use of
stress tests. Our current stress testing processes now cover market, credit, liquidity, and capital-related risks. Recent
regulatory enhancements on stress testing have been an important development for U.S. financial institutions. The
DFAST and CCAR tests are conservative and objective and have done a lot to validate the creditworthiness of the U.S.
financial systems.
I'll now turn it over to Liz who will discuss our liquidity and funding strategy. Liz?
Liz Beshel Robinson
Thanks, Harvey.
As you all know, liquidity risk management is a top priority for Goldman Sachs. Slide 7 is an overview of the pillars of
our liquidity risk management framework. First, we hold material amounts of cash and highly liquid securities to
pre-fund our potential liquidity needs in a stressed environment. We also focus on conservative asset and liability
management to position ourselves appropriately for longer duration stress in the financing markets.
As Harvey mentioned, we have a comprehensive process to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet, and
we finance our assets with liabilities that are conservatively structured in term, maturity spacing and counterparty
diversification. Harvey just discussed our use of stress tests which also underpin both excess liquidity and asset liability
management. We leverage our experienced personnel and robust technology and infrastructure to measure, monitor and
mitigate risk across our various businesses and legal entities.
On slide 8, we show details of the size and composition of our liquidity pool, which we refer to as the global core
excess or GCE. As we have discussed in the past, the most significant portion of our GCE is made up of U.S.
government obligations and overnight cash deposits which are mainly at the Federal Reserve. As you can see, we hold
this pool across both the parent company and our major global subsidiaries to provide appropriate liquidity in all of our
legal entities.
The size of our GCE and its allocation across legal entities is principally driven by an internally developed quantitative
stress test. The MLO, or modeled liquidity outflow, quantifies potential liquidity outflows in a highly stressed scenario.
The MLO is measured on our current exposures on a daily basis at a granular level for each of our material legal
entities.
We have significantly enhanced this model through insights we have gained over the last five years and considerable
investments in technology. For example, we can assess the liquidity impact of market moves on our positions across
several thousand market scenarios, measuring our liquidity sensitivities to single-asset class moves like rates and
equities, or broader multi-asset class market moves. We can also measure the sensitivity of our MLO to various
idiosyncratic and market-wide scenarios, giving us transparency into how our liquidity profile can change under
different scenarios.

We conservatively pre-fund for a number of factors including customer behavior, trading risks and market moves For
example, we pre-fund for contingent collateral outflows related to items such as a two-notch downgrade in our credit
rating.
The detailed analytical work that goes into modeling the MLO helps both my team and the relevant business people
understand the key liquidity drivers and results in coordinated efforts to find solutions that reduce our liquidity risks in
commercially sensible ways. We reinforce best practices by allocating the cost of the GCE to each business unit. By
providing managers with proper tools, we're able to more optimally utilize our liquidity resources.
We currently hold GCE that is well in excess of our internal risk models, reflecting a qualitative management overlay
and the desire to remain conservatively positioned. We are also well-positioned to play offense to the extent client
activity improves. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, while it is not yet finalized, we estimate that we continue
to exceed the fully phased-in requirements.
While our GCE is designed to mitigate a severe near-term liquidity event, our asset liability management framework,
which we begin to cover on slide 9, is designed to appropriately position our balance sheet for longer term stress in the
funding markets. On this slide, we show a high level cut of the assets on our balance sheet and the different types of
liabilities that we use to finance them.
We have an active centralized process to monitor and manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. To
allocate balance sheet limits, we evaluate asset liquidity in normal and stressed environments, business strategy and
expected holding periods, and anticipated returns relative to resource consumption. As we think about the appropriate
funding source for each asset class, we layer in an incremental assessment of asset price transparency, legal entity
liability sources, and the relative cost of financing.
We also look independently at the liability side of our balance sheet to ensure that we conservatively manage our
funding book and avoid significant maturity concentrations. You can see that equity and long-term debt are a
significant source of funding for many of our assets, including less-liquid longer-term positions.
Slide 10 drills down into our core funding sources. Here we show the contribution of funding from our equity and
liabilities, excluding customer payables and trading liabilities. We have a significant component of long-term funding,
with 45% of our core funding coming from equity and long-term unsecured debt. I'll talk more about our long-term
debt program in a minute, but I should note that more than half of our short-term unsecured debt is a current portion of
our long-term debt. We have only $1 billion in commercial paper outstanding.
Deposits have grown over time to become a meaningful contributor at 13%. Deposits include $20 billion of brokered
CDs with a weighted average maturity of 13 years (sic) [3 years]. We are also currently focused on growing our
international deposits, which reached close to $10 billion at the end of the first quarter. So nearly 60% of our core
funding comes from equity, long-term unsecured debt and deposits. As it relates to our $182 billion in secured funding,
roughly half is comprised of funding for GCE-eligible collateral, which reflects high-quality government repo, largely
done for client facilitation.
Before we go into detail on our secured funding, let's discuss our secured funding philosophy on slide 11. We believe
secured financing is an appropriate source of funding for our broker dealers as the underlying collateral provides a
credit mitigant for the counterparty, enhancing its durability, and it provides diversity to our overall funding sources.
Our principles are designed to ensure the following: significant term, counterparty diversification, excess capacity,
pre-funded excess liquidity, and conservative stress testing. As we've explained in the past, we're extremely focused on
the first two points, term and diversification, and I will put some data around that in a moment.
On point 3, we have a longstanding practice of raising secured financing capacity in excess of what we need to finance
our current positions. Excess secured funding represents committed financing that exceeds our current inventory
requirements. In effect, we have put in place committed term financing against a pre-agreed range of acceptable
collateral and concentrations, providing optionality in the assets we can finance over time. This excess funding plays
both a defensive role of being available if other funding rolls off, but it also plays an offensive role to enable us to
pre-fund potential growth in our inventory or customer activity.

On point 4, we raise excess long-term unsecured funding to mitigate secured funding risk. We reserve GCE against our
conservatively modeled risk of secured funding rolling off in the near term. We size that rollover risk using a stress test
called Funding at Risk or FaR. The FaR stress test enables us to conservatively manage our secured funding book by
asset class and across time periods. The simulations take into account our aggregate capacity, trade tenors, counterparty
concentrations, as well as the collateral schedules, role probabilities and fundable inventory. FaR is an incredibly
valuable tool because it supplements metrics such as weighted average maturity and helps ensure the durability of
funding.
We also run stress tests to assess and bound the potential currency deficits for maturity mismatches in our
government-matched book activity, which we refer to as cash gap.
Slide 12 lays out some of the key metrics of our core secured funding book, excluding the funding for GCE-eligible
collateral. First, we focus on maturities, as long contractual maturities provide the greatest stability to the book. Asset
liquidity drives the weighted average maturity for each of the collateral types with much greater term being applied as
assets become less liquid. On the chart, you can see that the weighted average maturity of repo ranges from over 60
days for non-GCE-eligible governments to well over a year for non-investment grade fixed income inventory. The
all-in WAM of our book exceeds 120 days.
We also strive to diversify counterparties in order to reduce our dependence on any individual counterparty or type of
counterparty. As of the first quarter, we've sourced secured funding from more than 150 counterparties. We have well
in excess of 50 counterparties that fund our most liquid inventories, but still more than 25 at the less-liquid end of the
spectrum. In order to achieve this diversification, we have sourced capacity away from the traditional repo product and
have increased our sourcing efforts in the form of secured notes and secured loans. We have also focused on reducing
our reliance on traditional U.S. money market lenders and increased our focus on global corporates.
Turning to slide 13, you can see a snapshot of our long-term unsecured funding activity. We have been an active issuer
so far in 2014 with roughly $12 billion of long-term vanilla unsecured debt raised across a broad range of tenors,
currencies and channels. Additionally, we sold $2 billion in perpetual preferreds last week. While that was
predominantly a capital-oriented transaction, it also provides a long-term funding source for the firm. Our funding
strategy continues to focus on diversification with non-US dollar currency issuances representing 44% of our
year-to-date issuance.
We have also been more focused on staggering our maturities. Because we tend to issue at the beginning of the year,
we have been purposely executing deals with non-round tenors like our 5.5-year Aussie dollar issuance or our 7.7-year
euro bond, resulting in prudently spaced maturities. As you can see over the last three years, we have roughly matched
our maturities with new issuance. We expect that this issuance pattern will continue in the absence of a material shift in
the size or composition of our balance sheet.
As it relates to orderly liquidation authority, while minimum debt requirements are not yet proposed, we believe that
we are conservatively positioned with bail-in capital at the capacity of the holding company of roughly 36% of Basel
III risk-weighted assets under the Advanced approach.
In conclusion, as Harvey began this discussion, we feel extremely well-positioned from a credit perspective. We have
taken conscious steps to reduce the risk on our balance sheet, we have grown our capital base materially, we operate
with robust liquidity, and we continue to enhance the term and diversity of our funding. Moreover, the significant
regulations around capital, liquidity and stress testing are meaningful and durable credit enhancements for the industry.
With that, Harvey and I are happy to take your questions.

[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Pri de Silva with CreditSights. Please go ahead.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Yes. A question primarily for Harvey. And what do you think caused the SLR under the new U.S.
methodology or the proposed new methodology to decline to 4.2% from approximately 5% in the previous quarter?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I just want to make sure I heard your question correctly, and thanks for joining us today. I
think you were asking, what is the difference between the finalized rule versus the proposed rule, which is really the
adjustment to the denominator? Is that what you're asking?
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Actually, what's the main driver that caused the proposed SLR to decline to 4.2% from the
previous estimate of 5%?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Right. Okay. That's not – okay. I understand it now. So the new proposal obviously has a
significantly different denominator under the Basel III denominator, and the significant component of the driver is the
treatment of credit derivatives.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Great. Thank you. And a second question is, what steps can Goldman take in order to reduce the
gap between the internal estimate for the pro forma CDS trends there, capital ratios versus the Federal Reserve
estimate?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I just want to make sure again, I apologize, I want to make sure I understand the
question. You're talking about what can we do to get from the 4.2% to the proposed 5%? Is that the question?
<Q - Pri de Silva>: No. In terms of the Fed's stress test...
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Oh, I'm sorry, okay. I wasn't completely clear.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: ...and the gap with where the bank's internal estimates are coming out. What can you do to reduce
the gap?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay. So look – that's a great question. So a couple of things on that. Obviously as I
talked about in my remarks, we – we're huge supporters of stress testing as a methodology for managing risk, and
actually as a method for managing tail risk, it's particularly powerful. And so we've been using stress testing as I
described from the 1990s, and we continue to evolve our processes.
We obviously submitted our results, and we thought our test was quite severe. Our regulator, the Federal Reserve, runs
their own models. In their public discussions, the Federal Reserve has really encouraged people to continue to develop
their own scenarios and not really look to replicate the Federal Reserve scenarios. Now having said that, we'll
obviously communicate with the Federal Reserve over the next several months, but in the end, as you know, as they've
communicated, by design, the Federal Reserve doesn't provide significant transparency around their testing processes.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Yeah.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: But we will, as always, continue to focus on our processes.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Sure. And the last comment I want to make is, the comment that you provided around the secured
funding piece is very useful, especially considering that U.S. regulators may impose additional guidelines around it.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Right. Well, as you know and Liz described, we manage it very conservatively. And so
we appreciate the feedback.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Thank you.

<Q - David MacGown>: Good morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, David. How are you?
<Q - David MacGown>: Well, thank you. A couple questions. I think the first one is probably for Liz and it's around
liquidity. This might be a nomenclature question, but I interpret from your slide 9 that your global core excess is funded
with long-term debt, deposits and equity, but on your slide 12 you make reference to the non-GCE funding book. I
want to make sure we understand precisely how the GCE is funded, and that's particularly important as we gear up for
something perhaps this year on capital charges for secured financing transactions from the Fed.
And related to that, do you have any early comments on how some of the things that, Liz, you've just talked about on
funding and liquidity management might change in light of what we expect to come out of the Fed on SFP? For
example, might it imply a higher mix of long-term debt as part of the funding mechanism in liquidity management?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Okay. So on the first of those questions, I would say the majority of our GCE is funded
with equity and with long-term debt. There are some categories of the GCE that are, in some ways you could argue,
self-funding, so we raised deposits. But when we reserve for the risk of those deposits potentially going out the door as
a result of client actions in a stress scenario, we essentially just don't use those deposits, we put those in cash. So they're
self-funding in that sense. So for certain categories, they're self-funding and the rest would be equity and long-term
debt.
In terms of your second question around regulation, look, I think the main liquidity regulations are still very much in
play. We're still waiting for clarity on both the LCR and the NSFR, and so a little bit too soon to say how those will
create evolution internally. Obviously nothing about the way we run our business is static. We continue to dynamically
change and manage as the world evolves, and so as the rules evolve, our incentives and our actions internally will
evolve accordingly.
But I think it's safe to say, the incentives that are being set in both the LCR and NSFR in many ways really relate to
longer-dated funding. And as I spent a lot of time talking about in my prepared remarks, that is something we have
internally been very focused on for a very long time so there's some consistency there.
<Q - David MacGown>: Thanks, Liz. And, Harvey, we're hearing more reports about competitor attrition. You guys
have referenced the tougher SLR. Maybe it's early days still or maybe middle innings at best, but I wondered if you
could comment at all on any success you might be having in being able to start the pass through wider spreads in some
businesses, whether it be prime brokerage or other areas, to clients.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I'd say it really feels a little bit more early days to me than middle innings, and the
reason I say that is because one of the things that the regulators have done is – which I think is quite thoughtful,
obviously, and we've talked about it a lot – these extended glide paths really give the industry, and by extension,
obviously, the impact on capital markets and lending and activities, they've given the industry, I think, adequate time to
make adjustments. So with a lot of these rules having multiple years to finalization and adoption, I think in some
respects, that also extends out the adjustment factor at best.
I would say at the margin we've seen some things, and certainly in some businesses where people have made
announcements, you might see it more explicitly. We thought we saw maybe a little bit of it in the first quarter in
commodities. Obviously that's been an area where there's been a lot of announcements but I think it's early, and also,
it's hard to see some of this in a lower activity environment like we've had.
<Q - David MacGown>: Thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks.

<Q - Robert Smalley>: Hi. Thanks very much. Thanks for doing the call. A couple of questions. First one might be a
little long, so sorry about this, but Harvey, in the past you've talked about redeploying capital into the franchise
businesses. And when I look at CCAR I see the result of that being trapped capital. You talk about redeploying capital
from other investments. At the same time, the market's the market and can only take so much at any certain time. So it
seems that the choices are either sitting on what you have or redeploying it into businesses that may not generate the
type of returns that you would like them to have. And the reason why I'm asking is, in terms of return on your equity,
while it's not a credit question, the ability to generate and retain earnings is a very important differentiator for Goldman.
How do you see this going forward in a market where there may not be as much opportunity and you have more and
more capital to redeploy?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So it's a really great question. In terms of capital management, I think that the first thing
obviously is we want to ensure that we have more than adequate capital from a safety and standards perspective, and
obviously, so do the regulators and all of our constituents.
I think that the issue around excess capital is an important factor, and obviously there's, from a risk perspective, first
and foremost you want to have more than adequate capital but there's also risk to having excess capital, and I think the
best way to mitigate the risk of having excesses capital is to not sacrifice any discipline around deploying it. And that
has always been our philosophy. It will remain our philosophy. It may mean that in an environment where regulators
allow firms to return capital more slowly that it requires more discipline, but it certainly – I don't think it would be a
good shift to let that pressure encourage people to deploy that capital into risky activities that don't fit the capital
objectives. So I think it's just about discipline at this stage.
Now we're in an environment, and we have been for a while, where, as you have seen across the industry, client
demand has kind of come in fits and starts. And so our bias, obviously, would be to see a big pickup in client demand
and we're well positioned for that. But in the meantime, we'll stay disciplined.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Do you have any specific return targets or on a business line or division basis that you want to
share or that you feel free talking about? Just so we can get an idea of what those hurdles are.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, so we run it dynamically in terms of the hurdles. We haven't talked about any
specific hurdles but I think there's a couple of takeaways. One would be that – and we've talked about this a lot – that
we run the firm as a collective. And so over the last two years we've had a collective ROE of 10.7% and then 11% and
then you saw our return for the first quarter. And while, on an absolute basis we'd like to do better, on a relative basis
they were industry-leading. And the relative return, we think, is quite significant.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Just shifting gears, there was a story out a few days ago about CFTC looking at banks that over
the past couple of months in their overseas operations are moving business to non-guaranteed affiliates. Could you
address that in terms of Goldman's derivatives business, particularly its non-U.S. business? Is that something that you're
looking at? How much of the business is in non-guaranteed affiliates, and ultimately what do you see the risk – what do
you see the rinks are in that, and does it all come back to you anyways?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I didn't see the story, so I can't comment on it specifically. In terms of our strategy and
how we use various legal entities and how we deploy our resources, quite frankly in aggregate across the globe because
obviously we're running a global business, we're going to evolve as our clients evolve. And you've seen us do this in
the past, and I would throw all of this in the category of market structure.
As market structures change and clients demand different resources, whether it's things that at the time seem more
complicated but now seem quite simple in the past like a transition from trading foreign exchange, by voice to
electronic, or the shift now to clearing, all these things are going to be as the market evolves. But the key take-away is,
it's all client activity-driven. And I think that's how you'll see the world evolve.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Okay. I'll send the story over. Thanks very much.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Larry Vitale with Moore Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Larry Vitale>: Thanks. Good morning, Harvey. Good morning – actually it's afternoon. Good afternoon, Harvey.
Good afternoon, Liz. How are you?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Hi, Larry.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Larry. How are you?
<Q - Larry Vitale>: Good. Thanks. You've covered a lot of ground here, and I think I just wanted to pick up on
something that Rob was talking about. There is some interesting language in some of your filings about additional
capital requirements at GS Bank USA and on the CRD IV capital requirements, and also the liquidity requirements at
Goldman Sachs International.
And I hear you, Harvey, on running a global business and evolving as your clients evolve, but the local regulators do, I
think anyway, loom larger in how you manage these businesses. And I'm just wondering if you can help us understand
what you see as the challenges for managing capital and liquidity at each of the units and how you expect to respond to
what appears to be maybe stricter requirements than what you've had to meet in the past. And then I had a follow-up on
something that Liz said.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: That's okay. So in terms of the liquidity requirements or capital requirements, and
broadly I would say this applies to all the regulatory reform as it evolves, we'll obviously adapt as we need to. Now,
we've always run conservatively the capital of our subsidiaries and obviously the liquidity profile, and the liquidity
management strategy that Liz outlined applies across subsidiaries. And so there's nothing specific I would share with
you as it relates to anything about those entities that I would call strategic at this stage, but I do think it falls into the
broader bucket of the evolution of regulatory reform and again, this'll be driven both by regulators and ultimately by
client activity. And so where the client activity is, we'll respond accordingly. It's a little bit akin to the prior question
also.
<Q - Larry Vitale>: Great. And specifically, can I get you to comment on the Tier 1 capital ratio? I'm not sure it's a
CET1, but you disclosed it at I think 8.7% for Goldman Sachs International and I'm just wondering how that fits in with
whatever they're going to be required to do, which is – at this point is unclear to me.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, so it's unclear to us too, Larry, but we can take it offline and then if you can follow
up and have more conversation with me if you want.
<Q - Larry Vitale>: That's fine, I appreciate that. And finally for Liz, this is my last one, you said something really
interesting about moving away from the traditional U.S. money market lenders and to – directly to global corporate. So
the global corporates, the way I understand it works, global corporates give cash to money market funds and then they
go find paper to invest in, and it seems like you're, in effect, bypassing the middleman. Do I have this correct? And can
you just maybe elaborate on your all motivations for this? Because it seems very interesting.
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Larry, thanks for that. I think our general strategy has been to look everywhere around the
globe for every type of institution that has excess cash, and try to develop structures, collateralized structures that
would enable them to give us that cash. And so, it's not a strategy of disintermediating the money funds per se, but it's
really looking for sources and pots of cash around the world, and trying to tap them as effectively as we can to increase
that diversity I talked about, which is so important to us.
<Q - Larry Vitale>: All right. Great. Thank you both very much.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks, Larry.

Your next question is from the line of Brian Monteleone with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Hi. Thanks. And thanks for the commentary on slide 13 regarding issuance being likely to
track maturities but with the caveat that Goldman is going to revisit the targets frequently depending on the size and
composition of the balance sheet. Just looking at the balance sheet size over the last – call it five years, it's been plus
minus $900 billion to $950 billion. Could you maybe give us some context in terms of what factors might drive that to
grow at some point, or do you think it's really largely range bound?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Look, I think the size of our balance sheet is driven principally by client activity and
serving our clients. I think there's also the factors of continued regulatory evolution, and so as we learn more about
regulations, we'll try to balance and serve our clients in the most effective way.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Okay. So just given the regulatory path, $20 billion of maturities and issuance a year is a
pretty reasonable base case?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Again, our base case is to replace the maturities as they come due, and as you can see on
the slide, it is roughly $20 billion a year. We do try to spread those maturities out and avoid concentration. Again, it's
both the size and the composition of the balance sheet that are relevant, and if either of those things change, our
issuance could go up or down accordingly.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Sure, understood. And maybe switching gears a little bit, on the SLR, you've laid out the
path to get the SLR from 4.2 to 4.9, and I think if we get a standardized approach to counterparty credit, that would get
you guys above 5%. Could you maybe talk then a little bit about how you think about scaling a management buffer to
SLR versus how you've talked about 100 basis point buffer for risk-based capital requirements?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So we haven't really spent any time on thinking through the buffer. The other thing I
would say is, I think given that the rules are still being developed, I think you could make an assumption that the
[indiscernible] (41:07) was accretive. But at this stage, I think we all need to see how the rules evolve and how the rules
are going to be finalized. But given the runway that the regulators have provided, we feel pretty comfortable. But we
haven't determined at this stage what buffer we'll run with.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Okay. And have you given any thought maybe to which of the two frameworks is ultimately
going to be more binding on your business model, more restrictive, given it seems like the SLR is likely to become part
of the CCAR process?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I think actually you could expand your question into the general one of sort of managing
binding constraints.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Yeah.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: And so you know, all firms, us included, will manage to their binding constraint. I think
if you're talking many years out at this stage for rules that are finalized like Basel III, you can see kind of 11.3, we're
running with significant excess capacity at this stage versus our target. But we'll evolve but at this stage, there's not a
binding constraint necessarily that we're particularly focused on. But, again, the rules are evolving. So we'll have to see.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Okay, great. Thanks, Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks, Brian.
