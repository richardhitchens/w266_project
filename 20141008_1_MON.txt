Greetings and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2014 Monsanto Company Earnings Conference Call. At this time all
participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank you. You
may begin.
Bryan Hurley
Thank you, Jessy, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter earnings update. I'm joined this
morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; as well
as Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team are Ashley Wissmann, Tim Boeker and Laura
Meyer. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.
We've provided you today with EPS measures both on a GAAP and on an ongoing business basis. Where we refer to
non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on
our website. This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements
are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results
may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the

SEC and in today's press release.
This morning, our focus is on the outlook for our next fiscal year where we expect to deliver continuing strong growth.
While today's call will focus on that outlook, let me set up the conversation with a couple of key points from our fiscal
year 2014 results on slide four.
With year-end ongoing EPS of $5.23 and free cash flow of $959 million, our final results came in ahead of our updated
guidance. Just as importantly, we said a priority in 2014 was to demonstrate Seeds & Genomics would return as the
biggest driver of our growth. And with the final results, Seeds & Genomics delivered the majority of our gross profit
growth, creating the right momentum as we think about what matters in 2015.
So with that, let me hand it to Hugh to take us through our updates this morning and the next step in our growth
outlook.
Hugh M. Grant
Thank you, Bryan, and good morning to everybody on the line. The fourth quarter's traditionally the point where we
focus on the outlook for the next 12 months. That look forward is particularly important as we set up our fiscal year
2015. And even with a more challenging commodity environment, Monsanto's set to deliver strong growth both in the
near-term and over a multi-year horizon. We closed our fiscal year 2014 a bit above our earnings guidance,
demonstrating our ability to deliver growth against more headwinds and marking our fourth consecutive year of strong
earnings growth. And we expect that growth to continue in 2015.
Let me share the key themes in that 2015 outlook as laid out in slide five. First, it begins with who we are. We're a
growth company. Our opportunity is built on innovation. Our value to our farmer customers is as a technology provider
and we have a portfolio and product pipeline that separates us from the commodity world. That sets up the most
important theme in our outlook. 2015 is a leverage year for Monsanto, in which we're able to commit to strong growth
today, and at the same time, step up significant incremental investments to unlock future growth.
There are few companies as well-positioned to dedicate a level of spending to deliver truly transformational long-term
platforms while maintaining tangible near-term growth. This isn't an either/or situation of growth or investment. We
plan to do both in 2015. And that's the key opportunity this year. As we deliver growth in 2015, as we stay focused on
our customers and as we continue to invest to unlock new growth, we can widen our long-term competitive position in
an industry that's particularly near term-focused right now.
There's no doubt that our 2015 growth is important and we're really focused on delivery. This morning, we laid out our
EPS guidance of $5.75 to $6.00, reinforcing our confidence in our ability to deliver the double-digit to mid-teens
growth that we targeted for 2015. That confidence comes directly from the strength in our core business, as there's no
hesitation that our Seeds & Traits engine is set to deliver strong growth that's the pace-setter for our EPS growth this
year.
So in a year where delivery matters, we'll be clear about how that growth plays out. This year, the industry will
certainly face the headwinds of a more challenging agricultural environment. We're not immune and our guidance
factors that in. But our more balanced global business also gives us more tools to manage the puts and takes. The proof
of that came in 2014 as soybeans emerged as a true differentiator, balancing the shifts in the global corn environment.
With macro factors that change every year and a business that has become more global, the pattern of the flow of the
business through the year has been changing. That will be true again in 2015. Brett and Pierre will cover the key
factors, but practically, we'd expect a shift that creates a smaller Q1 and builds growth as we reach our large market
seasons over the course of the year.
2015 is also a year where we have more tools. We're now more aggressively using the strength of our cash generation
and our balance sheet, providing a structural benefit through our $10 billion share buyback program that supports our
growth while returning more value to our owners.

So all of that's important because it sets up the opportunity beyond one year and that's my final theme. Over the course
of 2014, we took a bolder approach and outlined the five-year target to at least double our ongoing EPS. And we feel as
good today as we did when we outlined our goal, both in the near-term springboard of 2015 and the multi-year path.
At a macro level, the fundamentals of agriculture on slide six continue to be compelling. Global grain demand is
expected to grow every year through the end of the decade. The reality is, with grain stocks replenished from this year's
harvest, we're in a better position to meet normalized demand and there's already the first signs of increased use across
exports, ethanol and animal feed. And given availability, cost and the environmental footprint, adding new acres isn't
likely to be the long-term answer to this demand.
So the world needs to increase the rate of gain seen in the last five years by around 2x in corn and by 5x in soybeans,
just to meet baseline demand. That means yield and innovation are going to matter more than ever and that's who we
are. At a company level, we've more clear catalysts and more levers across our business than we've ever had before and
that's furthered by our focus on next generation platforms that have the potential to be transformational in our growth
horizon.
So our roadmap over the next five years is in place and it's as clear as it's ever been. It's not distant growth at the
back-end of the decade. We'll expect strong growth in 2015 that builds a cadence of consistent growth carrying from
2016 to 2019. We've everything that we need to make it happen and we're focused on execution.
Perhaps more importantly for the long-term opportunity, this is a gateway year where our strategy, technology and
opportunity can actually extend our leadership position and unlock the next leg of growth over the next five years in
our business.
So with that, let me hand it to Brett to walk you through the operational plans to back up this outlook. Brett?
Brett D. Begemann
Thanks, Hugh and good morning to everyone on the line. We are anchored on a five-year growth opportunity on slide
seven. The opportunity to at least double our ongoing earnings per share by 2019 is a compelling target that speaks to
our confidence in growth this year and for the remainder of the decade. And we're on pace for what we need to deliver
in the first year. Just as importantly, we haven't lost sight of our customers, as they deal with softer commodities and
macro trade-offs. We've made progress and applied our learnings over the past few years, so being consistent and
staying close to our customers this year is important in holding that momentum. So that we're in a good, long-term
position as agriculture comes out of this transition.
From that, we've built our operational plans and there are three key factors on slide eight I'm focused on this year.
Number one is Seeds & Traits growth. Simply put, we expect Seeds & Traits delivers double-digit gross profit growth,
which is the primary driver of our earnings growth. Number two, Seeds & Traits is balanced against our continued
strategic management of the Roundup business. Overall, we feel good about the expected full year Ag Productivity
contribution for 2015, as well as the long-term steady-state outlook. We do, however, expect the contribution from our
Ag Productivity business to soften in 2015, as the overall market normalizes after a strong 2014. The biggest variable
in 2015 is actually the timing of Ag Productivity earnings, more than any strategic factor.
We'd expect the majority of the year-over-year earnings decrease shows up in Q1 reflecting some changes in timing
and product mix as we've moved more of our volume in 2015 from the non-branded Supply business to sales in our
flagship brands. Number three, this is a year where the strength in our core business will allow us to aggressively invest
to drive climate and other new platforms. Against those factors, the metrics that matter this year are on slide nine.
First, we're going to build on the record soybean year in 2014 as we expect it to become one of our most meaningful
platforms and the first of our $1 billion-plus growth drivers. Soybeans were a real differentiator in 2014, providing the
offset to the macro corn shifts. That record-setting year in soybeans also drove our bottom line results, providing the
business lift for us to reach the high end of our overall guidance.

The biggest contributor in 2015 is clearly the Intacta opportunity in Latin America on slide 10. We're on track with the
10 million to 12 million-acre target we laid out, marking a record second year adoption pace for our soybean trait.
Penetration of Intacta at this level effectively places us at the tipping point of adoption in FY 2015 and sets us on an
accelerating trajectory across soybeans over the next few years.
That's furthered by Roundup Ready 2 Xtend on slide 11 which moves into the final commercial preparation in 2015,
setting up soybeans for a multi-trait multi-geography opportunity covering a market of almost 200 million acres in
North and South America during our five-year growth horizon. That accelerating soybean opportunity is backed by two
$1 billion-plus platforms in our global corn business.
In 2014, we increased our corn margins even as our corn business absorbed several hundred million dollars at the GP
level from lower acres and currency effects. That came from a couple of strategic metrics. Our COGS were lower, our
portfolio mix was on track, our total price was positive and we had good volume against declining planted acres. That
carries us into 2015, where the growth opportunity comes from a combination of those same strategic drivers.
First, the most important factor is our portfolio upgrade on slide 12. This is structural because it ties directly to our
ability to introduce new better-performing products every year. And the track record bears that out. Regardless of the
environment, we've increased our average price in our portfolio every year in the last decade. Our 2015 strategy reflects
that. The portfolio is in place, price cards are out in the Northern Hemisphere and we see mix benefit from our portfolio
lift. We continue to see that uplift in the range of a mid single-digit benefit and that provides a consistent contribution
across our global portfolio.
The second factor is the continued expansion of our underlying footprint in corn on slide 13. Practically, we don't
expect overall planted acres to make a significant rebound in 2015. In key regions like Latin America, shifts away from
corn planting are likely to create further headwinds. However, in other regions like Eastern Europe there continues to
be opportunity for added volume. Against that, we expect our footprint to expand and that comes from two sources:
continued growth in established markets along with opportunity in newer, emerging markets. The ability to grow our
volume in a declining macro market demonstrates there is resilient demand as we continue to deliver the
best-performing products.
Lastly, we also expect some continuation of the COGS benefits. While obviously not as pronounced as it was last year,
we do expect some residual cost tailwinds. One additional element on slide 14 that ties these drivers to our added focus
on our farmer customers revolves around our multi-channel distribution approach in the U.S. This is a key
differentiator. We're able to meet farmers wherever they prefer to buy their seed, giving us more touch points for the
key seed decision. The anchor of that strategy remains the full service reach with our retail partners and that doesn't
change.
But within our regional brands, our customers also told us there's more opportunity to further the relationship
component for the direct-to-grower brands. So we've evolved our Channel seed brand to a model with even more of a
direct-to-grower sales force, so they spend more time on the ground with farmers while shifting supply chain activities
to us, where we excel. That results in a change that shifts the timing of some sales within a year where we want to stay
close to our customers. It allows us to leverage a sales force that's highly motivated by day-to-day relationships with
the grower. Over the long term, that also furthers the footprint expansion opportunity in our largest market.
It's clear that corn and soybeans are the drivers, but our outlook also factors in the rest of our portfolio. Our other crops,
including vegetables and cotton, complement the core with an expected modest steady contribution. Cotton is among
our most international operations with significant contribution from the U.S., India and Australia. We expect nice
growth from the U.S. and importantly, the first proof point in our Roundup Ready 2 Xtend opportunity, as we expect to
launch this Xtend platform in cotton in 2015.
That's offset early in the year by some macro trends, as the Australia market is highly reliant on water availability and
the current drought is likely to drive acres down significantly. It's a small but high value market, so while we expect
good overall cotton growth, Australia will be a negative in Q1 and the growth through the year will be more aligned to
the U.S. and Indian seasons.

The performance in the core business becomes a leverage point as we use 2015 to accelerate our new platforms. The
most notable is our Climate Corporation platform on slide 15. 2014 served as an important foundation year with better
than anticipated progress as we combined the climate capability with Monsanto. In fact, our base tools were used on
nearly one in three U.S. corn and soybean acres this year, giving us a significant head start in making this a true
industry-relevant platform.
In 2015, we'll do three big things. We'll step up our investment to leverage that head start. We'll cultivate further
enrollment on the platform by increasing our active climate users by another 50% and we'll take the first steps in
building the runway with a focus on our entry-level premium Climate Pro offering.
On that upgrade, we're applying the core Monsanto experience by building a value ladder of multiple offerings at
multiple price points to incentivize trial and establish value, very similar to how we've thought about our biotech traits
over the years. This makes it an important springboard in establishing the portfolio that will become a staple of our
strategy moving forwards and part of our long-term growth opportunity.
Taken together, here's how I think about the operational summary. There's no doubt it's a challenging year for
agriculture and our customers. However, because of the products and platforms we have, we can grow in that
environment. Just as importantly, we're focused on the year at hand, but for us, this is really about the runway of
opportunity that begins in 2015. From here, each of the growth drivers becomes materially larger in 2016 and beyond,
unlocking the next wave of Monsanto's growth through the end of the decade.
With that, let me hand it to Pierre to walk you through the financials. Pierre?
Pierre Courduroux
Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone on the line. As CFO, my priority is to have a clear view of the factors that
influence our financial performance; those that we directly control, as well as those that are beyond our control. So let
me build on Hugh and Brett's outlook through that lens on slide 16.
First, there is no hesitation that we can deliver growth in 2015 and doing so in a challenging environment is an
important validation for our business. The current environment has people asking whether ag companies can grow and
with our guidance for 2015 we are clear in our confidence that Monsanto can deliver strong double-digit to mid-teens
EPS growth.
Second and importantly, we expect this growth to come from the right place and clearly from our Seeds & Traits
engine. And this growth comes even after we incorporate the impact of the overall macro headwinds we offset from our
Ag Productivity business and a step-up in our spending to fund future growth.
And third, the financial discipline we have demonstrated over the last few years will be a critical component to deliver
our financials in 2015. This is a key element we control, so while we won't lose the opportunity to invest in our
pipelines and new platforms, we will match that with discipline across our cost base with a priority on delivering our
financial results. And likewise, our new capital allocation approach provides us with more tools to leverage the strength
of our cash generation and balance sheet while supporting our growth and returning value to our owners.
So let me start the detailed look with the key elements and assumptions underlying our guidance on slide 17. Our
earnings guidance at $5.75 to $6 per share is consistent with the double-digit to mid-teens earnings growth that we
targeted coming into the year. In tandem, we expect to generate $2 billion to $2.2 billion of free cash flow as we expect
to see our earnings also translate into free cash growth.
There is a simple focused way to think about our outlook. Our core business is the overriding driver of growth. There
are two key offsets in Ag Productivity and in our increasing investments in spending that each stand for several points
of that growth. And finally, our buybacks then round out then supporting benefit.
Let me give you the details. First and foremost, as I said, the primary driver is our core Seeds & Traits engine, where
we expect to deliver double-digit growth on the GP line. We anticipate more than three quarters of that overall GP

contribution comes from our two core corn and soybean businesses. From there, we expect smaller, steady
contributions from the rest of our Seeds & Traits portfolio.
Within this gross profit outlook, our guidance builds in a realistic view on the current environment. As Brett
mentioned, with the decrease in acres in the Latin America summer season, we don't see a significant rebound in
planting corn acres in key regions this year. Additionally, our outlook builds in a prudent view on the current
conditions around global currency, as we anticipate similar currency movements as last year. So our guidance
incorporates limited erosion for the key global currencies in 2015.
And this also ties to the political landscape where we also anticipate some of the turmoil that has been a reality in
places like Argentina and the Ukraine will continue, although our 2015 guidance assumes reasonable operating
environments in both regions.
A key offset to the Seeds & Traits growth at the total gross profit level is the Ag Productivity segments. Practically, we
expect the peak pricing environment we have seen in glyphosate last year may soften some. And as a result, our
guidance assume Ag Productivity gross profit has the potential to be down in the range of 10%, offsetting some of the
core growth from our Seeds & Traits engine.
The second important offset is our spending, as our outlook factors in a disciplined near-term increase in operating
expenses. Very specifically, given the transformational opportunity in our new platforms and particularly in our
Climate Corporation platform, we are putting extra investment in SG&A and R&D to build on our acquisition and
accelerate the long-term opportunity. For fiscal 2015, the total operating spend in new platform is expected in the range
of $350 million representing an incremental $150 million over our total 2014 expense.
Increasing our operating expense is not something I take lightly. It becomes a priority because we believe the long-term
opportunity is compelling and because we have the strength in the core business to support it. Importantly, that
conscious new platform spend is balanced against our base business operating expenses, where we expect only inflation
level increases in SG&A and R&D as we take a disciplined approach to our overall expense managements.
The final factor in the financial outlook is the net effect of share buyback program. The benefit of the share count
reduction is balanced by significant step-up in interest expenses related to our debt offering in June. Depending on the
balance and timing of our share repurchase, we anticipate the net effect to provide a positive contribution of around 4%
to 5% to our total EPS growth in 2015, largely coming in the second half.
The next points in the delivery year is being very clear on how that guidance flows through the annual earnings pattern
on slide 18. As Hugh mentioned, our business has expanded globally over the past several years; and with that, we've
seen the earnings flow evolve between quarters. This is equally true in 2015.
So let me walk you through the expected earnings flow for this year. Basically, we anticipate a shift in the full year
flow that creates a smaller Q1 and the concentration of growth in Q3 and that comes from several key trends.
First, the macro environment has an effect on two key parts of the business in Q1. Most prominently, the reduced
planted corn acres in Latin America affect the quarterly corn contribution and are magnified against the relatively small
earnings base in the quarter. Likewise, the Australian cotton business that Brett mentioned is also a factor in Q1. As
acres are expected to be roughly half of the prior season, we expect an equivalent reduction in Q1 cotton gross profit.
Second, several of the business factors Brett mentioned also translate to some shifts in our earnings flow. The most
important in Q1 comes from Ag Productivity volumes. A key piece is a timing shift that comes from one of the key
structural benefits of our Roundup strategy. This year, we're able to move more of our volume from contracts in the
lower supply business to our flagship brands, creating a mix benefit. And this reduction in the supply volume is largest
in Q1 and the increase in the branded business is largest in Q3, which aligns to the over-the-top markets in the Northern
Hemisphere.
Including that shift, we'd expect the Q1 Ag Productivity GP contribution to be about 75% of what it was last year. That
means that the majority of the full-year Ag Productivity downside I discussed actually would be incorporated in Q1 and
the branded volume will translate to a greater percent of revenues in the second half of the year.

Beyond Q1, the biggest first half effects is the modification in our Channel seeds brand, which creates a shift in the
revenue flow. In FY 2015, we will book sales as we ship seeds to the grower, rather than the historical pattern where
we book sales with seed shipments to distributors. That change is expected to shift several hundred million dollars of
GP from Q1 and Q2 into our third quarter.
So together, those factors have the most effect on Q1 and we will build from there to reach our full year GP and
earnings growth in the second half of the year. We expect Q1 to come in at about roughly half of the total earnings
from last year's Q1. We expect Q2 to be roughly flat year-over-year, but expect to see significant uptick in Q3 earnings,
as a majority of our full-year growth flows through that quarter. And this will be punctuated by the Q4 that is likely to
be breakeven to positive on an absolute basis.
The last piece I want to cover today is our cash generation and use on slide 19. Fiscal 2015 will mark a rebound year
for free cash generation as we don't anticipate having the effects of the outlay for The Climate Corporation acquisition
or the Novozymes alliance. More importantly, at a level of $2 billion to $2.2 billion in cash generation, we expect to
see conversion of growth into cash. The second piece of that is our cash use.
Since we announced our new capital allocation strategy in June, we have had a very successful debt offering that set up
the first installment of our $10 billion share buybacks through an accelerated share repurchase program. That is a
strong initial step in our more aggressive use of capital and this sets us up to continue to prioritize returning value to
our owners.
Today, I've focused a lot on the mechanics of our plan, but let me end by stepping back and reinforcing why delivering
in 2015 becomes such an important point of leverage for ongoing growth on slide 18. From a financial perspective, I've
focused on three legs of our strategy: financial discipline, business growth and the ability to return value to
shareowners.
Today, we are a more balanced global business that's capable of delivering real growth even against macro variability.
Just as importantly, we are a company that has strong imbedded organic growth and meaningful new platforms in place
today. And with our ability to use our cash generation and balance sheet even more strategically, we have the tools to
continue a stepped-up focus on shareowner value. That is more powerful than just the growth this year. It's truly the
source of confidence and the opportunity as we target at least doubling our ongoing EPS in five years, an outcome only
a company that innovates in this space can deliver.
Thanks and I'll hand it back to Bryan for the Q&A.
Bryan Hurley
Thanks, Pierre. So with that, we'd now like to open the call for questions. As we typically do, I'll ask that you please
hold your question to one per person, so that we can take questions from as many people as possible.
So, Jessy, I think we're ready to take the questions from the line now.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan
Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Thanks and good morning, everyone. Brett, maybe you could just comment a little
bit, I guess it's early days in the order book for next year in the U.S. But you said price cards are out. Presumably
you've seen the competitor price cards. Is there anything that's going on that's deviating from your expectations in terms
of where the overall market is both in terms of price points on new and older products, as well as maybe timing of order

discounts or anything like that? Are you expecting the order book to fill a little slower this year, just given the corn
price and uncertainty around acreage?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yes. Thanks, Vincent, and good morning. I think first of all, it's important to put this all in
the context of what the farmers are facing right now. The last report I looked at, we're running at about 50% of the
five-year average for harvest. It's been really wet across the big corn/soy belt and it's slowed down harvest. So as you
can imagine, that's what the focus of farmers has been. So there has been some slowdown in their anticipation and
looking at what they're going to do on seed choices.
But to your point, our price cards have been out. Our competitor price cards are out there. Supply situations are similar
to last year where we all have ample supply, and I would tell you at this point that we feel comfortable with how we're
positioned in the marketplace and feel good about moving forwards.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: And when would you – usually Thanksgiving is kind of the point in time where –
right after Thanksgiving where you have a sense of where the order book is and how, at least, sort of how the first half
is shaping up. Do you think that's going to be later this year? Should we be thinking more towards the first of the year
or what do you think there?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, at this time, Vincent, as I mentioned, the farmers are totally focused on getting the
harvest in. I don't see anything that doesn't say it's going to be a pretty challenging harvest for our customers this year
with the – the weather continues to be wet, there's a lot of rain forecasted again for later this week. It's going be difficult
for them to get it out. That's going be their primary focus. So I would expect that things will continue to be slow as we
go through the ordering season, with their primary focus being on getting the crop out of the field.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Right. Thanks very much.

Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Perfect. Thank you. You mentioned some modest changes for your channel
platform, targeting at getting closer to the grower. Can you talk explicitly about what the margin effects are and the
reasoning for the change of season? And then also going forward, just randomly, is there anything else you can do on
DEKALB as well? Thanks.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thanks for the question. I don't anticipate there'll be any margin effect now but, Pierre, maybe
a little bit more color on how it shapes up between the quarters?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: No, really the change gives us better access to the farmer, to the grower directly and that's
really what we are targeting here. From accounting perspective, what we do is now we will have to recognize the
revenue as the product is delivered to the farmers. In the past, we were just moving the product to our distributors and
selling it to our distributors. So the change is really not material from a margin perspective. It doesn't impact the
business relationship. It just shifts actually the income from Q1 and Q2 into Q3. And to give an order of magnitude,
you're looking at $200 million to $300 million that will be transferred from those quarter into Q3.

<Q - Don D. Carson>: Thank you. Question back to U.S. corn, we hear a lot of talk of growers potentially trading
down on traits. So maybe you just tell me what you're seeing thus far in terms of their willingness to buy premium
genetics versus their willingness to buy traits. And even if they want a trade down on traits, is there enough of single
and double-stacked product out there that they could even do that?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thanks for the question. Good morning. I'd maybe ask Brett to give a little – but it kind of
goes back to the order book. But two or three points: number one, in a tough ag environment and it clearly is, the very
last thing that's traded out by the grower is seeds. So he takes a long hard look at his machinery purchases. He thinks
twice about what he's doing with soil nutrition and he'll even take a hard look at his chemical purchases, but the last
thing that he compromises on is seed. And we've seen this for a decade now, where our best-selling, our
best-performing hybrids and our best technology packages are – they're the first to sell.
So we've been conservative this year. We've been very careful in our price cards and how we've laid that out given the
environment. But I think, 2014's been instructive and if you look at our performance in 2014, when you strip back forex
and you strip back shrinking acres, our performance globally, we grew or maintained share in pretty much every market
around the world this year and a big piece of that was driven by performance. Headwinds in 2015, I think we're
expecting the same, Brett?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, as we look at 2015, Don, I anticipate similar headwinds to what we saw with the
currencies. I wouldn't say, at this point, we expect the same amount of deterioration in the acre base that we saw last
year, but obviously, it's starting out under pressure in South America.
But to Hugh's point, we did really well with our price lift last year. We got the mix improvement that we were shooting
for. Our COGS improved and we held and grew share in all the key markets around the world. So as I look at this year
and specific to your question around trading down on traits, the key in this, Don, is the biotech solution for corn
rootworm is still the most compelling offer for the farmer that has a corn rootworm problem. And I simply don't see a
farmer facing significant corn rootworm pressure to trade away from the biotech solutions that are available.
And the platform that we're selling today is very similar to what we had before and we continue to add better and better
genetics to that SmartStax platform. You might see a few farmers on the fringe areas that don't really have a corn
rootworm, they may shift around a little bit, but those are on the margin and they're not material in that shift. So I really
anticipate our portfolio to look a lot like it did this year as we go into next year.

Our next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Morning.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Hugh or Brett, you guys talk about this $4 billion of incremental Seeds & Traits growth
in the next five years. And I guess it seems pretty dramatic in the context of the prior five years. I think that growth rate
was more like $2 billion. And on slide six, you note that in the past five years, the industry output has been mostly
about acreage lift and not yield lift. So it seems like maybe the entire industry was benefiting from those trends and if
you look forward, you're going to grow twice as fast, but the acreage isn't going to grow as much. So does that imply
you expect a much more dramatic market share lift or more dramatic pricing gains? Can you sort of talk us through the
components that get you that substantially higher growth rate in what arguably might be a much tougher industry
context?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, no, Bob, thanks for the question. So I – Brett's been talking for a couple years about the
decade of the soybean and we are fast approaching the inflection point on that decade. So a big piece of this is the final
coming of age of soybeans and particularly the post-launch growth in Intacta in Latin America. So that's – it's unique to

Monsanto. It's a really big opportunity and if you believe that there's going be, compared to the last five years, a limited
number of new acres, this is going be – the next five years is about sustainable intensification and unlocking a
differential yield and I think Intacta and behind that Xtend in beans really make a big difference. We see that as a
breakout opportunity. You see some of it in 2015, but it really flies in 2016. Brett, I don't know if you – if maybe
another word on that and some of the other growth blocks?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, no, I think that's exactly right and don't get me wrong, I'm absolutely thrilled with
the success we had in 2014 with Intacta in South America and I'm just as excited about establishing a new metric, if
you will, or new a benchmark for increasing those acres this year on 10 million to 12 million acres on Intacta. We've
never been able to expand that fast.
But to Hugh's point, 2016 really becomes a huge inflection. But I also think it's important to keep in mind our corn
business and the growth we anticipate from corn. As I mentioned before, we did achieve our price lift and our mix
improvement and our COGS improvement and we do continue to grow our footprint and our platform around the
world. And with the focus becoming more on how we increase productivity on any given acre versus new acres that
bodes well for us and I'm highly confident in our breeding program to continue to bring those new genetics and allow
us to continue that performance.
And as Hugh mentioned, we have the 2x, the rate of gain that we've been seeing in corn just to meet the expected
demand of corn around the world. And I think we're very well-positioned to participate in that. So that's really the
fundamental driver that helps drive our corn portfolio around the world. That's the other big part of that growth on top
of the soybeans.
And then of course, we can't forget the other smaller crops that we have out there that continue to grow. And on top of
that, as you get towards the end of the decade, the new platform starts to kick in more. We're investing significantly in
climate. I'm thrilled with where we're at in that position in the marketplace and we have a head start. We're going build
on that this coming year and by the end of the decade, you see that starting to contribute as well. So I do feel good
about being able to accomplish that.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: And, Brett, as my follow-up, you gave the platform growth and the components over
four years. If I look to what you guided to for this year, a double-digit Seeds & Traits, given that the acreage isn't going
to move much and you've got the $150 million of incremental platform growth spend, can you give us some sense of
how those buckets would arrange just in the next 12 months, the components of that earnings growth?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, Pierre, maybe you can do that.
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: Yeah, Bob, obviously, there are a lot of moving pieces and maybe going in too much detail
may end up being confusing. So what I propose, maybe, let me lay out for you our key planning assumptions. So when
we look at our double-digit growth in Seeds & Traits GP, as we mentioned, it has to come from corn and soy. And
that's really what we are basing ourselves on.
So in terms of assumptions, overall, we're assuming a flat global acre for those two crops. And obviously, there will be
some minor give and take in between the two crops, but as you know, we're very well-positioned to take advantage of
that. From a currency perspective, we're basically looking at a similar impact as what we saw this year. So definitely
where is the growth coming from? The soy opportunity I think is very clear to everybody. So we've got, obviously, the
Intacta opportunity in South America. We've also got a great dynamics in the U.S. markets and that's something you
can see in our numbers. Our soy performance this year, beyond Intacta, has really been in the U.S. market. And then
we've got the continued ramp-up of our agreement with Pioneer, which is also going to impact our soybeans numbers.
So soy being a key driver for growth and obviously corn.
So specific to corn, we are definitely expecting to see the consistent mix lift that we've enjoyed over the last few years.
Then we know we can still count on continued tailwinds from a cost of goods perspective. I mean, our planning
assumptions are looking at continued tailwinds there. And we're also very confident, based also on what we see in the
market right now, in our competitive position from a volume perspective. So these are the three key drivers.

On top of that, we should start to see the benefits of our new platforms, but it's not going be dramatically material this
year. So this is how we build our plan, these are the key assumptions there and that's why we really have this
confidence that we are setting up a base that's going to allow us to grow this double-digit growth in 2015, but also
maybe set the base for future growth beyond 2015.

Our next question is coming from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thanks. As you talk about growth, we're not hearing you talk about vegetables very much.
Several years, the story with Seminis was that we were going to see an accelerated product launch process, then we saw
Europe slow down. What is the current growth view of Seminis? Has that business just not panned out the way you
thought it would?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: It's been slower, but I would say, I'd say, Mark, if you look at this last year, 2014, we never
talked about it much, but we saw real turnaround in the veggie business in 2014. And we look at freshness index, which
is kind of ironic in a vegetable business, but we look at how much of that new portfolio, how much of the new breeding
lines are contributing to overall performance. In the last year or two, we've seen a nice lift there.
So the learning for us is veggies took a hard knock through the recession. You'd never expect it, but consumers traded
down in vegetable consumption, particularly in Europe, particularly in Western and Southern Europe. But we've put a
lot of energy in the executional detail and operational focus and we've seen a nice – this last year 2014, we saw a nice
lift in that business. So I wouldn't count vegetables out.

Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Hi. Good morning. In your slides, you say that you think that your corn volumes will grow
in 2015. You've talked about how South America is already slow and presumably corn acres in the United States will
drop, I don't know, 5%, something like that? So in the scheme of things, can you explain why corn volumes should
grow in 2015? How might volume in Eastern Europe or in some other geography offset the pressure that's in your two
key geographies?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Jeff, thanks for the question. I'll maybe pass a piece of this to Pierre. But our assumptions are
that on – sorry, to Brett – on acres, who knows? We're sitting here in the fall and we don't have the crop harvested yet,
but our planning, our operating assumptions are that acres will be about flat with last year. So in the U.S., we said all
the way through last year, we would be happy if the crop had a nine in front of it, if it was 90-something. It looks as if it
probably had an eight in front of it. And as we go into next year, plus or minus, I think acres will be about the same.
The Latin American markets are still playing out in front of us, but there's no doubt the acres are going be down, the
question is how much. And a lot of that is just them watching U.S. harvest. And I think a fair operating assumption,
Brett, is that it's going be flattish down there as well. But as Brett mentioned in his points, we've seen either share
maintenance or share growth in every one of our key markets around the world. So we will see some volume growth
based on that.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I think the other thing, Jeff, I'd just add to that, I think as you look at Eastern Europe, we
continue to see the expansion of that marketplace to higher-performing genetics and that bodes well for us as we're
extremely well-positioned over there. So you get good volume growth in an environment like that, that helps offset
some of the things that we observe that's going on in Latin America.

And as Hugh said, it's so hard to call right now on what acres are going do. I tell you, though, I remind you that as we
look at the macro environment that's out there, ethanol plants are running as hard as they've ever run. We're seeing the
animal feeding industry picking back up and I think this big pile of corn that we're faced with, with the global demand
continuing to grow, I think that's going to deteriorate.
And most importantly for me, as I look at it and the trade-offs that I look at is, I can't sit here today and tell you what
the acres are going to be, but I can tell you that nobody has the soybean platform that Monsanto has. And in South
America, as soybeans start trading in to replace corn, we're extremely well-positioned to participate in that. And if it
occurs in the U.S., most likely, if corn acres slow down, they're most likely going to go to soybeans and we're very
well-positioned to participate in that. So I believe that that portfolio balance is really important for us and that will play
out over the year.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: For my follow-up, did your corn seed volumes grow in 2014, globally?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: No. If you look at this past year, we delivered on all the metrics that we were looking at, as
I've mentioned a couple of times, but the significant reduction in corn acres, particularly in the Americas, really put a
damper on corn growth. So we were slightly down to flattish on the overall corn volume, but the things that we were
following really drove our performance in corn. It was just simply the acres.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Okay.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Because I mentioned, I'm not expecting the same level of deterioration for next year as we
saw this year.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: I hope you're right. Okay. Thank you.

<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. On the same subject, the U.S. corn share, was it flat this year? Was it up
modestly given the big decline in corn acres? What do you think happened to your U.S. corn share?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Good morning, David. This is Brett. We're sitting here at harvest time and this is always
the frustrating time because we still don't know what the actual planted acres are going be in the U.S. As Hugh
mentioned, we believe they'd probably have an eight in front of them and that'll sort itself out over time.
Here's what I can tell you, from looking at our branded business and our license business, there's absolutely no doubt in
my mind that our genetic platform in the U.S. grew and that will sort itself out across the various brands. But I feel
really good about how we performed in the U.S. corn business this year.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Very good. And, Brett, just on – for 2015, should your corn seed gross profits margins
increase at the same rate as last year or higher or lower?

slightly lower.

<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: You're talking about shifting your supply chain, going directly to farmers. Can you tell us what
percentage of your sales are direct to farmers today? And where do you see that going in the future?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So, P.J., this is not going direct to farmers and maybe we didn't articulate it right. I mean,
the way we use our Channel brand and our Channel seeds men in the countryside is basically another channel of
distribution that we are using. And I mean, the size of that business, I don't think we've ever really disclosed the size of
that business. I mean it's definitely part of our brand share and an important part of our brand share but we've not
disclosed the breakdown in between the brands. What we know is this is definitely an area that we've seen growth in
and that we feel very good about.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: But I think that the couple of hundred million would be – if you were thinking about it, P.J.,
and try to scale it amongst everything else, to Pierre's point, when you see the shift – and it's our core, it's a couple of
hundred million dollars, so we gain good insights. It's a really important leg of the stool, but that's what it is. It's a leg of
the stool. So between the Channel business moving, with the revenue recognition that's associated with it and a lot of
our third-party supply Roundup business now being translated directly into brand, that's why we took the extra time this
morning to explain some of those shifts. As frustrating as they are, I think they're both really good moves for the
business long term.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you. And then can you quantify the benefit you saw from lower corn and soybean prices in

<A - Pierre Courduroux>: Yeah, yeah, we did see some benefits there. And in our margin improvement in our Seeds

per your guidance. So perhaps you could help us reconcile that.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: I'll take the first piece and then, Brett, maybe you cover the second piece. So we had some
customers who, as an industrial supplier, third-party business, who've indicated that they'll be stepping back or
throttling back from that. So we've been moving successfully. We've been moving third party supply into – to your
point, Kevin, into higher margin branded business. And as that occurs, we see that business moving closer to market
applications.

So it's – in a world where we make and sell 300 million gallons, every gallon that you can sell with Roundup brand on
it is marginally better news. So that's the timing shift and then, Brett, the margin effect, the slowdown or the 10% slide
in the business?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, good morning, Kevin. So as we look at the overall Ag Productivity segment and
specifically Roundup, I feel like we had a really strong performance year in 2014 as reflected in the final results. And
all I'm saying is I'm not anticipating that kind of strength through the entire 2015. And that's why we try to range bound
it in the range of down maybe 10% or so on the Roundup business or Ag Productivity. But it's really just about looking

back-end, could you maybe provide some color on how it's going, if you're getting paid and collect payments on the
back-end? Thanks.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, good early progress. Because we're in the front-end of the launch process we're selling a
lot more seeds than we are collecting at the grain elevator. So in many ways, this is a bit easier at the start, Brett.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, I think there's a couple of really important points, I think it's important to not forget,
before Intacta was launched, we had already reached the point where about 80% of the soybeans planted in Brazil were
from newly-purchased seed. So you combine that together with the fact that Intacta is in its early days, the primary
source of seed for Intacta is newly-purchased seed...
<Q - Joel D. Jackson>: Right.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: With where the market already was. We feel really good about our 2015 opportunity for
Intacta and we're in a really good place. I look at the point-of-delivery system that we have in place with the grain

<Q - John E. Roberts>: Okay. And it's largely just precision ag and biologicals that you're [indiscernible] (58:04)...
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: That's correct.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, it's exclusive....
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Is that for next year as well or we kind of plateau here at this level?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So we'll still see growth. Most likely not the same extent of growth, obviously, because
this year is a significant investment we are making, but we'll continue to invest in both platforms as we go.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Thank you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you, John. We brought forward some of that investment and I think that's a piece of the
uniqueness in the company, that in a tough year for the ag economy, we see the opportunity to grow the base. And
simultaneously, as we're growing that base, make the significant investment in these two new platforms and use that to
widen the gap versus us and our competition. So we're going do those two things simultaneously in this year.

So let me wrap up. I'd like, on behalf of the team here in St. Louis, I'd like to thank you again for joining us on the call
this morning. As always, this is an important call for us as we lay out our plans and our expectations for what we see as
the next milestones and it ties to the John Robert's question, it's the next milestones in a five-year growth runway.
So let me just wrap up this morning by emphasizing two points. Firstly, it begins in 2015. This is a year for us where
we believe that we're in a unique position to deliver strong growth today at the same time that we step up our spending
to unlock transformational long-term growth.
And secondly, 2015 is really a springboard into the opportunity that we see over the next five years. We don't see this
as backend-loaded. We see really nice growth through the 2016 to 2019 timeframe that starts in 2015. And that's why
we've been targeting at least doubling our ongoing EPS over that timeframe.
So we have a clear objective, the opportunity is real and we have the drivers in place and in hand. So we're focused on
delivering that opportunity and we look forward to sharing our progress against those milestones with you. So thanks
very much for joining us again this morning.
