Now, I'll turn the call over to Marty.
Martin J. Barrington
Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call.
Altria is off to a strong start in 2015. Our core tobacco businesses continue to deliver on their strategies backed by the
strengths of their leading premium brands. Each of our reportable segments grew operating companies income and
expanded their margins. Altria grew its adjusted diluted EPS by 10.5%, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends and
repurchased 3.6 million shares in the first quarter. And earlier this morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2015 full
year adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7% to 9%.
Here are some important highlights from the quarter. PM USA delivered on its multiple segment strategy of
maximizing income while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro over time. The segment produced
outstanding results in the first quarter, driven by higher pricing, higher volume, and Marlboro retail share growth. PM
USA has invested steadily to strengthen Marlboro and those investments continue to pay off. As a result, the smokeable
segment grew adjusted operating companies income by over 12% in the quarter. PM USA's reported cigarette shipment
volumes grew 1.6% in the quarter, benefiting from a moderation in the industry decline rate, trade inventory
movements and retail share gains.
In the machine-made large cigar category, John Middleton continued to strengthen its leadership position in the
profitable tipped cigars segment. The company posted strong double-digit volume growth in the quarter, driven
primarily by Black & Mild.
In the smokeless products segment, USSTC grew first quarter operating companies income by 5%, and expanded its
operating companies income margin by one percentage point to over 63%. USSTC estimates that its adjusted
smokeless segment volumes grew approximately 4% in the quarter while smokeless industry volumes grew 2% over
the past 12 months. Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined retail share by half of a percentage point in the quarter.
Turning to innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark remains focused on building a robust portfolio of innovative tobacco
products for adult smokers and vapers. Nu Mark began shipping its next generation e-vapor product, MarkTen XL, into
lead markets this month. In the wine segment, Ste. Michelle posted a quarter of nearly 23% operating companies
income growth, primarily through improved premium mix.
In the first quarter, equity earnings from our SABMiller investment were negatively affected by SABMiller special
items and unfavorable currency impacts from a stronger dollar. The investment continues to support our strong balance
sheet and provides cash flow through its dividends.
So, we came into 2015 with momentum, and our first quarter results reflect another quarter of strong execution against
our well-defined strategies. We believe our businesses are positioned to help us deliver against our full year guidance.
Billy Gifford will now discuss our business results in more detail.
William F. Gifford
Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Our smokeable products segment helped drive adjusted diluted EPS
growth of 10.5% in the first quarter. The smokeless products segment and fewer shares outstanding also contributed to
that growth. The smokeable products segment delivered strong adjusted operating companies income growth of 12.6%,
primarily driven by higher pricing, higher shipment volume, and lower resolution expenses, due primarily to the end of
the federal tobacco quota buyout payments.
Despite costs being higher in the quarter, due primarily to higher pension and benefit costs and timing of SG&A
spending, the smokeable segment expanded its adjusted OCI margins by 2.3 percentage points. Volume was also
strong. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that its first quarter cigarette

shipment volume was essentially unchanged, and that total industry volumes declined approximately 0.5%.
For the quarter, PM USA grew Marlboro's retail share by 0.3 of a share point to 44%, and grew its total cigarette
category retail share by 0.4 of a share point. L&M share gains also contributed to PM USA's first quarter performance,
as the brand continued to grow its share while the overall industry discount category declined in the quarter.
In the total machine-made large cigars category, Black & Mild's retail share declined 0.6 of a share point in the first
quarter. As Marty mentioned, Middleton continued to concentrate on the more profitable tipped cigars segment where
Black & Mild gained share.
In the smokeless products segment, operating companies income increased 5% in the first quarter as higher pricing was
partially offset by higher promotional investments. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors,
USSTC estimates that its domestic smokeless product shipment volume grew approximately 4% in the quarter while
the industry grew approximately 2% over the past 12 months.
Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share grew 0.5 of a share point in the quarter to 51.2%. Copenhagen's retail
share grew 1.0 share point, while Skoal's retail share declined 0.5 of a share point.
The wine segment delivered very strong results in the first quarter. Ste. Michelle grew operating companies income by
22.7% in the first quarter, primarily driven by improved premium mix. Shipments increased by 0.5% in the quarter.
That wraps up the operating results.
Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, let's cover a few housekeeping items. As
a reminder, comparisons when made are against the first quarter of 2014, unless we note otherwise. Marlboro's price
gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 31% in the first quarter, down two percentage points.
For the first quarter, Marlboro's net pack price was $6.06, up $0.15. And the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.62,
up $0.17. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax was $1.49 per pack for the first quarter, up $0.01.
Wholesale inventory changes are one factor. PM USA uses to estimate adjusted PM USA and industry volumes. PM
USA estimates that its wholesale inventories were approximately 2.6 billion units at the end of the first quarter of 2015,
and 2.4 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. At the end of the first quarter of 2014, PM USA's
wholesale inventories were estimated to be approximately 2.5 billion units. PM USA estimates that cigarette industry
wholesale inventory levels were 5.5 billion units at the end of the first quarter of 2015 and 5.4 billion units at the end of
the fourth quarter of 2014. PM USA estimates that first quarter of 2014 wholesale inventory levels were 5.5 billion
units.
Copenhagen's price gap versus the leading discount brand was 29% in the first quarter, down three percentage points.
Copenhagen's retail price was $4.22 in the first quarter, up $0.13. The price of the leading discount brand was $3.26 in
the first quarter, up $0.17. CapEx was $48 million for the first quarter. Ongoing depreciation and amortization was $49
million for the quarter.
Operator, do we have any questions?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Nomura.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hello, Owen.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: A couple of questions, please. I mean, firstly, any commentary on Marlboro Black, is that
still taking share, if you could say, I mean how much of Marlboro's share growth is being driven by Black?

And then secondly, any update on recent market share trends for MarkTen? I notice how you no longer have the
statements about being amongst the top e-vapor brands nationally like you did at year end, should we read anything
into that? Thanks very much.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure. Let's start with Marlboro Black. It continues to do a terrific job. In fact, it's grown
for 17 consecutive quarters. We don't break the shares out about by SKUs, as you know, Owen, but Marlboro Black is
doing a terrific job, particularly in the important segment of adult smokers 21 to 29. I hope you had a chance to see our
remarks at CAGNY about our vapor business. Our aspiration there is to succeed in the long-term. What that means is
we're moving with appropriate dispatch but with financial discipline, always learning from the consumer, and frankly
what we're working on principally right now in addition to our distribution in brand building is product development.
Consumers are telling e-vapor manufacturers that the products are not yet there, that's why you see us improving our
product development pipeline, and to be sure, share is important, but it will be important as soon as the products are
established with the consumers. So we're not unduly focused on share. We are focused on getting the right products in
the consumers' hands.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks for calling.
Operator
Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Hi. My first question is on consumption. Given the strong industry cigarette volume and the
decelerating smokers industry volume, do you have a sense of underlying total tobacco consumption when considering
both of these categories? And then do you believe it's rising, and if so, why? And then maybe touch on your outlook for
the cigarette decline rate. Is a 3% to 4% decline rate realistic going forward?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Okay, great. Thanks for those questions. Let me start with cigarette volume. We don't
forecast volume, as you know. It's been 3% to 4% over the last several years, and we think that you have to look at that
over time. To be sure, this quarter is a break but it's only a quarter, so we'll have to see. Probably the best answer to
your question about consumption is the total consumption rate over the last several years as measured by government
sources, which has been declining at about, call it, 1% to 1.5% total pounds, so that takes into account, Bonnie. All of
the products that adult tobacco consumers are trying and of course, it's a dynamic time, we've seen more movement
among the categories. That's probably the best marker.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: All right. Yes. So it was kind of the basis for my question, because of how smokers industry
volume has been performing not as well, so I think there's been a lot of interplay between the two categories, so you
would agree with that.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah. And I think there's still growth there, of course.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Right. Sure, it's just been decelerating slightly. And then I just want to touch on MarkTen
and just to hear from you, just any updates you have about recent consumer behavior for MarkTen. And then could you
talk about the revenue for the business given it was down quite a bit sequentially but was up year-over-year, but I'm
trying to also understand how much of a drag potentially was in those numbers from your financial service business?
So if you could help me understand that, that would be helpful.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: I'll try to give a little help. It's in the all other category, as you know. And so we don't
kind of break it out too much under that. But we're in an investment mode. That's the best way to understand it. And in

response to Owen's question, I pointed out that we have a lot of work underway to make sure that we have a robust
portfolio of products, because that's what the consumer is saying to everyone, which is, I'm willing to try these products
but they're not quite there yet, and so we are continually working to improve our offerings. That's why we've come out
with MarkTen XL, twice the battery size, and so forth.
And so, I think that's the way to understand it and we're going to be in an investment mode here, but we do it in a
financially disciplined way, always cognizant of our long-term financial goal of 7% to 9% growth in our EPS. And
we've been able to pull that off and I'm confident that we will over time.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay, thank you. And then speaking of MarkTen XL, when do you expect that to be a
nationwide expansion? I think you mentioned you're rolling out into lead markets, and then how incremental do you
anticipate this is going to be? And how concerned are you with cannibalization for that extension?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, we'll talk about national once we get in lead markets and we see how it does.
That's our innovation system, which is to put products in consumers' hands, conducting experiments about whether the
offering is interesting to them, find out how we can improve it, and then we roll forward. And you saw that's how we
did MarkTen. I think that's what you should expect with MarkTen XL.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. And then just my final last question is, your discount volume has been strong,
especially L&M. I'd like to hear what's been driving that, especially given the stronger consumer and maybe hear –
have you touched on how you're balancing the growth of this segment with margin expansion and what your strategy is
in this space?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, good questions both. Look, our focus is on the premium end of the business; more
than 90% of PM USA cigarette shipments are premium and that's where the action is for us. But, of course, there is a
discount segment out there. It's declining over time. The real reason that we're growing our discount business there is
because of L&M. It's a terrific product that's priced competitively in the marketplace and it's doing great. So it's not our
principal focus, but it does help the business, albeit small.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks for your questions, Bonnie.

Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Just had a question for you. This is – several quarters in a row where the price gap
between Marlboro and the lowest priced product in the market has been down. And you've been taking very strong
pricing and so I had two questions around that. One would be, as you look at your promotional spending overall in the
quarter, could you say that was up or down? And I mean for the cigarette business overall. And then is there any – are
you pulling back on promotions, say, on the premium side versus discount to help widen that gap? You seem to be in a
little better economics position today and perhaps that gap could widen a bit from this level.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Okay. Thanks for your questions. Let me go at it this way. We had net pricing realization
in the cigarette – in the smokeless segment – of more than 5%. So you can see that despite the fact the price gaps
narrowed, we're, as you point out, taking strong pricing, which is great. The reason the price gaps narrowed in the
quarter is because some discount brands increased their pricing faster than the premium brands did, and that's what
accounts for the math including some rounding, frankly, when you do the math in the price gaps. So price gaps are an
important metric as we've spoken about, and we keep an eye on them, but, boy, to have a quarter where we can grow
our volume, grow our margin, get strong pricing realization, you can see the result of that, Chris, with nearly 13%

operating company income growth. That's a pretty good algorithm for us, price gaps narrowing or not. I don't know,
Billy, you want to say a word about promotional spend?
<A - William F. Gifford>: Yeah. I think if you think about it, Chris, you'll recall last year, we actually had started
dialing back promotional spend around Marlboro and so we're lapping that as we go through the first quarter.

Operator
Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Great. Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So I guess I wanted to just go back to the cigarette consumption question and I hear you, this is
one quarter we really have to look at it on a longer term basis, but I don't recall a quarter where you've had this kind of
volume performance with the price growth that you're seeing across all the players. So I'm just wondering if you could
give us a little bit more color just in terms of the sustainability of this kind of performance within the current macro and
competitive backdrop if there's anything in terms of the investments that a lot of the players have made and perhaps
brand equity building initiatives are kind of driving some of that as well because it seems to kind of imply that
historically when you saw the volume performance really come through, typically this was associated with lower
pricing and certainly that's not what we're seeing today.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yep. Let me see if I can give you a bit more color and try to help you with it. You're
right. It has been some time since we've seen numbers like this. Part of it is the comp versus a year ago, I mean the
volume was down pretty significantly in the first quarter of 2014, as you remember. But there's no denying that several
factors are at play here. The economy is improving. It is improving for our consumer set finally, happily, after this very
difficult time during the recession. We have the phenomenon of dropping gas prices and it occurs for us at a time after
we've made very significant investments in Marlboro, we implement the Marlboro architecture, we launched Marlboro
Black, I would say all of those factors came together to contribute to what's a very strong quarter for PM USA. That's
our analysis for our business, at least.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then, Billy, just in thinking about the SABMiller contribution, clearly, the FX and
some of the headwinds from a macro perspective is depressing SAB contribution right now. It's a business that
obviously you don't necessarily have a control over in terms of the operating performance. How do you sort of think
about your 7% to 9% earnings growth algorithm to the extent that if SABMiller, the currency continues to weaken, do
you have levers, either buyback or at the operating line that you can offset the weakness or because it's sort of outside
of your control, do you kind of look at that as more of a transient factor?
<A - William F. Gifford>: Yeah, Judy. I think when you think about the SABMiller asset, it's been a great asset for us,
it's performed very well. We're talking about one quarter and you mentioned the negative drivers on that equity income
year-over-year, one being the special items which were primarily related to asset impairment and then the negative
currency drag. We don't provide down to that level for the total year, but no, at the beginning of the year when we
provide that guidance, we incorporate a number of factors and SAB was incorporated in that.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. So basically you have a view of how SABMiller would perform throughout the year and
that gets baked into your guidance, but to the extent that SABMiller piece gets worse than your anticipation, and I
guess the question is really do you have other levers to kind of drive the offset?
<A - William F. Gifford>: Yeah. I think, Judy, overall you heard us reiterate guidance today. We feel good about that
and we feel good about where the business is.

<A - Martin J. Barrington>: I do think, Judy – it's Marty – that your reference to levers is exactly correct. That's what
differentiates the Altria offering, we have numerous levers that we can use to try to meet our long-term goal of 7% to
9%, and if you look over the last several years, we've been able to do that as various businesses have been up or down.

Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. Two questions. One, firstly, I wanted to ask you about the performance in the
smokeless products segment. And specifically the acceleration in consumption for your products during the quarter, the
improvement to 4%. Marty, I just wanted your assessment of what actions you've taken or what factors during the
quarter would have driven that acceleration. Is that a function of perhaps addressing the value proposition around some
of the brands and the degree of pricing that you've taken, or would you attribute some of that to tactical efforts that
you've made on Skoal or whether you're seeing any impact there?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure, sure. I think you've identified the two drivers. One is Copenhagen continues to
grow strongly. You see it grew a share point in the quarter and I do think the actions we are taking on Skoal are
improving. In fact, if you look at the quarterly results for Skoal, it's down half a share point but it's the fourth
consecutive quarter where it's narrowed those share losses year-over-year. We gave it a new equity campaign, we have
terrific equity-based promotions, I think that are improving its relationship with its consumer set. And then as you
know, we've been working on the price gaps on Skoal Classic. I think all of that is helping to steady up Skoal in that
spot on strategy for us. So I think it's the combination of Copenhagen's continued growth and our work on the value
equation on Skoal.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. And I think we saw more improvement in UST volumes than we it did for the
category overall, but would you say there's any change in the level of interaction between smokeless and other
alternatives – other smokeable alternatives?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah. I know it's just hard to tease that out right now. It's been a couple of quarters. We
do know that some of the growth previously in smokeless was due to cigarette smokers coming in to the category. We
now know that there are vapor alternatives, we now have a recovering economy, so just really hard to tease out, Matt,
what exactly those factors are. But we'll be able to do it over time, I would expect.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thanks. And just one question on the cigar performance as well. Just if you could
help me better understand the mismatch between the volume growth and the market share trend. I know you're focused
on tipped, but with volumes up 10% and share down roughly 50 basis points, does that imply that growth is up 15%,
20% in untipped or is that just noise in the data, I suppose?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: It's probably short-term noise, although untipped does continue to grow. What we're
trying to do, as you know, is to balance the share question with profitability, and in this segment, we always try to
maximize income first. So, Black & Mild happily has a very strong share position in the segment that is providing,
frankly, most of the profitability and we think that's the better course at this time.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay, great. Thank you both.

Your next question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good morning, Vivien.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: So not to belabor the point but I do also have a question on smokeless tobacco. Marty, we
talked a lot about price elasticity in cigarettes and clearly they're holding up quite well. Can you just remind us how
you guys think about or calc out price elasticity in the smokeless segment?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah. We have some proprietary models for that, that allow us to try to get some sense.
They're not as highly developed as you might expect in the category that's been around as long as cigarettes, but that's
really a proprietary view of it, which I'm not prepared to talk about on the phone, candidly.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Okay. Fair enough. As we look ahead to the mix shift that's ongoing in the cigarette
segment, suffice it to say, if the consumer continues to hold up, can you point back to another time where we've seen
this much kind of trade-up or resumption in trade-up and how we should think about that trajectory continuing, all else
being equal, from a macro perspective?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, we do know that when adult tobacco consumers are feeling better about their
economic situation, they want to be in premium brands. And in this category, the premium brand they want to be in is
Marlboro and we've seen that several times. If you go back in history, for example, and you look at the infamous
Marlboro Friday, price gaps got out of line, the consumer was not feeling good about that, you're much too young to
remember, Vivien, but people predicted that it was going to be the end of brands and so forth. And in fact, it wasn't. It
was that when the consumers thought that the price gap was appropriate, they came right back roaring into Marlboro.
So Marlboro has that kind of equity, and we would expect that as consumers continue to consolidate around premium
brands that Marlboro will do just fine.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Terrific. Thank you very much.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks for calling.

Your next question comes from Michael Lavery of CLSA.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Just back on Marlboro, obviously, it had a strong share performance in the quarter. Can you
just highlight any of maybe what the key drivers were there and how much Rich Blue may have contributed?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, it's early for Rich Blue. It's having a nice little effect. In a phrase, I would say
Marlboro architecture, Marlboro Black, strong Marlboro equity, those continue to be the drivers of Marlboro's growth.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just looking at it on a longer view, going back five, six years,
it's up a little over two share points; your discount share is up slightly as well. But it is partly offset by about 1.5 share
loss for the other premium. You just said, obviously, you're a premium-focused company and clearly Marlboro is the
focus and the star, but is there anything you can do with the other premium brands that would make sense to invest
there? Or is there any way – how do you think about those as a piece of the puzzle and is there any way to hold or gain
share in those that make sense?

<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, that's really a terrific question. You know, we do have these other terrific
premium brands that we offer for adult smokers. They don't get a lot of support because, frankly, they have their
franchise pretty well settled and they're very profitable, but Parliament is probably the best example. We gave some
limited support to Parliament last year and it really paid back very well. Our focus is Marlboro. The other premium
brands produce nice profitability contribution and if we can do some modest things for them that help them stabilize
their share while producing that profitability that – we're open to that.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then just lastly, on maybe a little bit just broader view,
where do you see sort of risk either near-term or long-term and just what do you kind of see as where the watch-outs
are, maybe specifically for this year in terms of what could put you at the lower end of the guidance or just longer term
in terms of strategically?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, there's always risks in every business, right, and we kind of look at that at the
beginning of the year. In a category like this, you're always watching volume, you're watching your pricing power,
you're watching regulation, you're watching excise tax, you're watching competitive activity. Now, those have all been
well handled over time and we have good plans in place for all of them, but if you're trying to identify factors in this
industry that present risk as well as opportunity, those are probably some of them.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay, thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Bill Marshall of Barclays.
<Q - William Marshall>: Hi. Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - William Marshall>: Hi. Just kind of building off of Judy's question, I think, from earlier in your comments,
Marty, obviously, there's a lot of top-line momentum here and even underlying the consumer seems to be doing better
and you pointed out that the levers that you have across the P&L, just want to put it into context through strong first
quarter into context with your full year outlook of 7% to 9% earnings growth, is there anything specific we should be
looking out for, the spending ramp-up, is it just a matter of a tougher 4Q comparison? Anything specifically in there
and as you launch your new MarkTen product, anything that we should be looking out for?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: No, I don't think in particular. I think, Billy said it best earlier which is when we put the
year together for our guidance, there are always puts and takes and we look at the operating company performance, we
look at SAB contribution, you always look at excise taxes and so forth and so on. So I think the guidance that we put
together, which we reaffirmed today just reflects our view particularly early in the year about how we do. I think we
pointed out previously, I think, when we gave the guidance that we've got some pension and benefit expense which is
flowing in, we're winding up the Philip Morris Capital Corp business, so it's not contributing at the same rate it used to
contribute at, and we're making disciplined investments in the innovative space. That's probably the best way to look at
that, Bill.
<Q - William Marshall>: Okay, thank you. And then just a quick question. I'm just curious on your thoughts, as you
see one of your competitors go through the MRTP, modified risk tobacco product process with the FDA, just want to
get your thoughts about prospects for the PM technology, [indiscernible] (33:38) and if you had any idea of a timeline
when you think that could be commercialized and kind of the process that you're looking at going through to get that
into market.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah. That's an interesting area to ask about, thank you. Listen, the – one of the reasons
we supported FDA was because this process now allows manufacturers to bring products to the FDA to try to see if we
can get them qualified as modified risk or reduced risk. And so the [indiscernible] (34:05) was the first hearing and

there was quite a lot of buzz about that, but gee, it was just the first hearing and what's expected to be a long-term
project to bring these projects to market. So I think I wouldn't be over-reading that too. We continue to work with PMI
on our own process regarding heat-not-burn. The first milestone to watch for will be the filing of the application, and
then hopefully the one after that will be its approval. And we continue to work in the meantime on our branding and
marketing and go-to-market strategies as we're very hopeful about that product being brought, and as you know, we'll
have the exclusive on that product in the United States. So we continue to pursue that.
