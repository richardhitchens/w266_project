MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Today's
call is being recorded. At this time for introductions and opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Paula
Waters of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Paula Waters, Vice President, Investor Relations
Good morning and thank you for joining us. We'll begin this morning with comments from Entergy's Chairman and
CEO, Wayne Leonard, and then Leo Denault, Entergy's CFO, will review results. In an effort to accommodate
everyone with questions this morning, we request that each person ask no more than two questions.
After the Q&A session, I will close with the applicable legal statements. Wayne?
J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Paula. Good morning, everybody. I'm pleased to report a solid quarter of financial and operational
performance while advancing longer term goals and objectives outlined earlier this year. Leo will review the quarter's
financial results and even with severely depressed commodity prices affecting the non-utility business, the highest
second quarter operational earnings per share in company history.
I'll start with progress on our business and financial objectives. At the Utility, one of the financial objectives which
we've consistently come up short on is to receive a reasonable opportunity from regulators across the system to earn
rates of return consistent with investments of equivalent risk and then actually realize that opportunity when it is
available.

In that regard, we have struggled in Texas since we first entered the state with the Gulf States utilities acquisition in
1993 and more recently in Arkansas since the FERC system agreement order on rough production costs equalization.
I can't say that we've turned the corner yet, but I do believe we are making meaningful progress with all of our retail
regulators in developing agreements on the need for solid credit metrics, particularly in uncertain financial markets,
with the need to track capital to meet changing regulatory requirements in transmission for the environment, for the
potential new investments needed for reliability and to meet other public policy objectives.
On June 23, the Arkansas Public Service Commission approved a unanimous settlement agreement in Entergy
Arkansas's rate case filed last year. The settlement allows a $63.7 million base rate increase effective the first billing
cycle in July, and a 10.2% ROE, up from the 9.9% allowed in the previous case.
But more importantly, it allows a greater opportunity to actually earn closer to that allowed return. It was certainly not
everything we asked for or needed, but it recognizes that implementing alternative operating structures for Arkansas,
such as a stand-alone entity within the Entergy family, but outside the system agreement, will require constructive
regulatory treatment to attract needed capital.
We remain encouraged that the APSC has the authority to improve upon this outcome through things like formula rate
plans and transmission riders. There are open dockets where these issues have been raised and can be addressed if the
Commission is so inclined.
The good news for Entergy Arkansas customers in the short term is that despite this rate action, Arkansas residential
electricity rates decreased 22% compared to levels in July 2009, after factoring in lower fuel costs, continued efficient
operation of our power plants and sizeable reduction in the amount collected and paid to other jurisdictions under the
rough production cost equalization formula established by the FERC.
In Texas, parties in the Entergy Texas rate case are working to complete a stipulation agreement resolving all but one
issue in the case. The contested issue, the competitive generation service tariff, was the subject of a limited hearing
conducted in July. Regarding this issue, legislation enacted in 2009 has ended the Entergy Texas obligation to establish
a competitive framework for all retail customers, required the company to file this proposal and intended that Entergy
Texas be made whole for program costs and any loss of revenues from participating customers. Entergy Texas hopes to
get the stipulation finalized in the near future. The procedural schedule calls for a final Commission order by
November 1, 2010.
In Louisiana and Mississippi, the formula rate plans have been the regulatory construct for many years. Each company
roughly earned close to the mid-point of the earnings made in 2009, as indicated by filings in Louisiana and a
settlement in Mississippi this past quarter. The Mississippi Public Service Commission has already approved the terms
of that settlement.
While the Louisiana companies earn within their bands, pursuant to the terms of the FRPs, both companies are
requesting rate adjustments outside the FRP where capacity calls for PPAs not covered under the fuel costs. At the
LPSC meeting last week, the Commission approved increases effective in September and nuclear decommission
funding of approximately 7.8 million at Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and 3.5 million in retail rates in Entergy
Louisiana, also outside the FRP.
Entergy New Orleans' recent formula rate plan filing reflected over earnings energy rates during the period and under
earnings in the gas distribution business, the FRP's direct implementation of rate adjustments in the first billing cycle in
October. Since exiting Chapter 11 in May of 2007, Entergy New Orleans has reduced its total residential rates to its
customers by 16.5%.
This opportunity to reduce electric rates, again, is due in part to a 9% sales growth increase over the past two years as
New Orleans recovery from Hurricane Katrina continues to exceed initial expectations, along with substantial efforts
on the part of our team to be as effective and efficient as possible in the rebuilding of the city's energy infrastructure.
While on the subject of storms, having just prepared for the threat of Tropical Storm Bonnie, which was headed to our
service territory before dissipating in the Gulf around a week ago, and predictions more to come from an active storm

season due to the transition from El Nino to a predictive La Nina conditions, which hasn't happened yet, by the way.
And in a record warm electric – warm Atlantic sea surface temperatures, which has happened, the Louisiana Bond
Commission recently acted to close out the very active 2008 storm season, approving Act 55 financing for recovery of
costs associated with Gustav and Ike and the establishment of cash reserves for future storms under Act 55. If you don't
remember that Act in particular, the bonds are issues on behalf of the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation, not
by Entergy.
The financings closed on July 22, providing collectively over $400 million in proceeds for the balance of storm
restoration costs to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, as well as $290 million in dedicated cash
reserved in the bank for future storms. At just under a 3.3% average coupon on a durational weighted basis, these bonds
have the lowest yields for any previous rate payer backed bonds in its asset class, substantially benefiting the Utility's
customers with this low cost financing source, particularly compared to the old rate based approach, where we finance
this obligation 10 to 15 years or longer using Utility's balance sheets.
At Entergy Arkansas, securitization for storm recovery was permitted through legislation enacted in April, 2009. In
June, the APSC's financing order authorized the issuance of approximately $126 million in storm recovery bonds for
the January 2009 ice storm, with closing anticipated in the third quarter.
Now I have to take a second here to remind everybody, particularly those who attended the EEI Financial Conference
in 2005, I suspect many of you remember that day. It occurred shortly after we had completed storm restoration for all
customers that could take service following Katrina and Rita. But I want to remind you just how far we've came since
those bleak days.
In 2005, we had negative account balances in storm reserves before the hurricanes hit. Since then, utility regulators
have taken action to bolster storm reserves by over $640 million, including authorizing securitization of nearly $570
million of storm reserves, and building a $75 million storm reserve for Entergy New Orleans over the next 10 years.
In addition, utility regulators authorized securitization of nearly $2.4 billion for actual restoration costs. Remembering
back to that EEI meeting in 2005, I don't think very many people in the audience saw that one coming. We didn't
predict it either, but we did say at the time that it was one of our objectives.
Staying with the balance sheet, potential new investment opportunities remain attractive to investors and customers.
Even with resource additions over the past several years, utility operating companies remain in the short position
relative to long term expected demand.
Last week the Entergy Operating Companies concluded the Summer 2009 long term request for proposals in which the
system was initially targeting up to 1,000 megawatts of long term resources starting in 2011, as well as 550 megawatts
of dispatchable capacity in 2015 localized in a unique south area to help meet specific reliability needs and any system
needs for capacity and energy.
Based on the evaluation of submitted proposals, our fee selections were increased to four acquisition proposals totaling
approximately 2,800 megawatts, including the self-built option identified in the RFP at Entergy's Louisiana's 9 Mile
site and one PPA totaling 500 megawatts.
Of course, all is subject to completion and satisfactory negotiations and execution of definitive agreement, which is
targeted for late this year or early next year.
We also received FERC approval to acquire the 580 megawatt Acadia Unit 2. Closing is targeted for first quarter 2011,
subject to receipt of LPSC approval and Hart-Scott-Rodino and anti-trust clearance. At the end of July, the Utility also
provided notice of intent to conduct a request for proposals for long term renewable generation resources. More details
will be made available in September on that initiative.
In addition, work began on the 178 megawatt extended power uprate at Grand Gulf. Certain activities were performed
during Grand Gulf's most recent refueling outage to lay the groundwork for completion of the upgrade project in 2012.
Once the uprate is installed, the reactor at Grand Gulf will have the largest capacity of any single nuclear generating
unit of its size in the nation.

Finally, regarding the proposed cancellation of the Little Gypsy repowering project currently in long term suspension
for over three or more years, the LPSC staff testimony filed in June agreed it was prudent to cancel the project and at
Entergy's recommendation to suspend on a longer term basis was timely made that indicated that except for $819,000
in compensation-related costs, the requested costs of $211 million incurred should be deemed recoverable and allowed
recovery of carrying costs and a return on project costs at a rate approximating the cost of debt, which the staff
estimated at around 7%.
The LPSC staff also recommended the project costs should be securitized, if legally feasible and found to be in the
public interest. To that end, Louisiana Legislature unanimously passed legislation now signed by the Governor for that
and more to allow securitization for canceled construction of electric generating transmission facilities, the purchase of
long term fuel supplies and any other capital investment above $350 million that the LPSC deemed suitable for
securitization.
The logistic quarterly monitoring costs have proved to be a model framework for working jointly with the utility
regulators on long lead time, large capital projects, particularly in an uncertain economic climate. It allowed all parties
to respond quickly as market conditions changed and it's particularly critical, given the capital intensive investing phase
that the utility industry is facing.
No one wants a repeat of the 1970s and 1980s massive disruption of capital and utility's credit capacity. Clearly,
Louisiana is setting the tone that this is a good state to invest in. Louisiana's decision-makers are eliminating the
potential for the unhappy surprises that you all worry about and we worry about and enhancing the Utility's access to
financial markets through things like Act 55 financing for storm damages.
To summarize, during the quarter the Utility made significant progress regarding better actual earnings and better
earnings opportunities through more constructive regulatory orders governing existing assets and clear investment
opportunities in new assets that will benefit our customers for years to come. While low growth is on track with
expectations, Utility's 5 to 6% net income growth aspiration through 2014 remains in clear view.
Turning to the valuable option represented by the non-utility generation business. In early June, I announced my first
major reorganization in more than 11 years. Internal restructuring is the first step to preserve the valuable options
identified in a spin off and ultimately to unlock that value.
The new Entergy Wholesale Commodities Organization, led by Rick Smith, called EWC, as you may hear us say, will
have P&L accountability for the non-Utility business in the same manner that Gary Taylor has for the Utility business
in the same manner that Rick had in the Utility business before he moved over.
This new structure is patterned after what Enexus would have looked like in a spin-off. Rick's new EWC organization
places a clear focus on commercial opportunities, government and regulatory affairs and financial and risk matters for
the entire non-Utility wholesale business. Mark Savoff, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, now has
responsibility for the hour-to-hour, day-to-day accountability and focus for all Utility and non-Utility generation
operations, allowing us to maintain the scale and operational excellent for all of Entergy. Mark reports to me, but his
matrix to Rick and Gary, the business unit heads.
In other events related to the spin unwind, having still not received an order from the New York Public Service
Commission, we submitted a formal request in July to withdraw our petition in order to officially close out the spin-off
proceedings in that state. It's clearly time to move on from that failed effort. This action followed the Vermont Public
Service Board's order issued in June to close out the spin-off proceedings in that state.
Efforts continued in the second quarter on one of our top priorities for the new Entergy Wholesale Commodity
business, license renewal. At Pilgrim, as expected, the NRC dismissed an appeal at Pilgrim Watch in a license renewal
proceeding. Remaining activities include submittal of revised commitments and information to allow the NRC to
supplement Pilgrim's safety evaluation report and resolution of a file matter remanded to the Atomic Safety and
Licensing Board for hearing.

The hearing date has not yet been set, but could begin in late fall. Likewise at Vermont Yankee, the NRC denied one
appeal and has remanded one issue back to the ASLB to give parties a chance to amend a challenge to the BUI Fatigue
Monitoring Program, a very limited scope issue. In addition, Vermont Yankee received the same request as Pilgrim to
submit revised commitments and information to allow the NRC to supplement its safety evaluation report.
In Vermont in April, findings from the initial Comprehensive Reliability Assessment prepared at the direction of the
Legislature were re-affirmed by the Department of Public Service and its consultant, NSA, more specifically finding
that Vermont Yankee can be operated reliably for another 20 years. In July, the Public Oversight Board, previously
impaled by the Legislature, also issued its supplemental report, essentially re-affirming the central finding of its March
report. That is, if the company addresses several key concerns, the panel's fundamental conclusion remains that
Vermont Yankee can operate reliably for an additional decade.
Since the original Comprehensive Reliability Assessment was issued in December 2008, Entergy Vermont Yankee has
resolved or developed plans to address all of the report's recommendations. Nonetheless, Entergy Vermont Yankee
recognizes there is still much work ahead to secure votes in Vermont for license renewal.
As we've said before, the key day for substantial commitments remains the second quarter of 2011. We will make every
reasonable or practical effort to satisfy the stakeholders in Vermont the plant is safe, secure and critical to clean energy
future for the state. No one takes the safety of nuclear plants more seriously than we do, but if for whatever reason the
plant ceases operation beyond 2012, while we do not believe that will be the outcome, we do believe it is important for
you to keep in mind that Entergy's financial aspirations are not dependent upon license renewals of this single plant.
We do have approximately 650 employees at that plant that I do lose sleep over, however and we are working on how
we fairly address that very real concern. We have a very broad organization, as you all know, and we expect to be able
to offer positions to those employees somewhere else in the system.
At Indian Point, the ASLB issued a detailed schedule order scheduled for the hearing process expected to be held in the
third quarter 2011, followed by an ASLB decision in mid 2012. Also at Indian Point, pre-trial hearings began on the
water quality certification draft denial. Although raising a variety of issues, the weight of petitions filed and comments
submitted with the ALJs prior to the hearing echoed Entergy's concern with any decision requiring cooling towers at
that facility.
For example, the New York City Economic Development Corporation filed a petition for amicus status in the case.
While they did not offer an opinion directly on the cooling tower question, their comments echoed statements made by
the New York Public Service Commission in a spin-off preceding on the importance of Indian Point, specifically to
New York City's electricity supply and meeting air quality and green house gas production goals. The New York
Department of Public Service and its petitions for full party status raised concerns, including the feasibility and
affordability of cooling towers.
Others voiced similar issues, including the Independent Power Producers of New York and Central Hudson Gas &
Electric. During the public comment portion of the hearing, many interested parties also spoke in support of Indian
Point and the importance of giving due consideration to Wedgewire screens as a far less invasive and more
environmentally friendly alternative.
At the Issues Conference in response, the DEC restated that in their draft denial of the water quality certification in
April they were not requiring the cooling towers. Instead, simply stating their opinion that Wedgewire screens are not
the best available control technology.
While we certainly believe that cooling towers are not the right answer at Indian Point, we also believe our reports
clearly show how the Wedgewire screen alternative is a proven solution that will resolve concerns about the plant's
impact on the Hudson River. The Issues Conference continues today and is scheduled for a legal briefing that certain
threshold legal issues is expected to be issued soon. However, after the settlement we don't expect full hearings earlier
then around the middle of next year.

In addition to added focus on regulatory and community matters, the new EWT organization is designed to capture
value through a greater commercial focus on pricing, hedging, managing risk and capitalizing on growth opportunities.
We will be talking with you more about that in the coming weeks and months as we continue to work to translate our
vision to results that reflect the valuable option known today in this wholesales commodities business.
Before closing, I'm pleased to report once again in June Entergy received GovernanceMetrics International's highest
global rating, a perfect 10.0 for best in class corporate performance, a rating Entergy has maintained since June 2006.
Only 42 companies or just 1% achieve an overall global rating of 10.0 in GMI's most recent release.
As in all things if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well. We hold ourselves to stringent corporate government standards
and this recognition reinforces the actions we're taking to achieve that end and assure all of you that we understand that
particularly in this day and age it's critical that we be above reproach in everything we do. As owners we know you
agree. It's what you expect and it's what our Board of Director demands.
Before turning it over to Leo, I'd also like to note that we have two new participants on our call today. Paula Waters has
stepped into the lead role as Vice President of Investor Relations. I can tell you that her background in investor
relations and strategic planning, along with her superior financial acumen, makes her a perfect fit for that role. I can
also assure you that she will continue to pursue the standard of excellence we have strived to achieve at our disclosures
and our relations with all of you.
At the same time, Michele is not going too far away. In, fact she's about four feet away from me right now. She's been
given broader responsibilities, which include responsibilities for Investor Relations, which will continue to report to
her.
Also joining us today is Rod West, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer. Rod has been on my
radar screen since I joined the company in 1998. At times, it has tried my patience as we have moved Rod through the
various chairs to prove his capabilities and really learn the business firsthand and now it is paying off.
We have a proven leader with the knowledge and experience that you rarely find in the senior management team and as
Chief Administrative Officer, Rod is at the heart of our decision-making process. His operational excellence in
managing rebuilding the New Orleans electric distribution system after Hurricane Katrina and Rita, as well as his
financial and legal experience, leading Entergy out of bankruptcy into the successful business it is today will serve him
well in this new role.
You may not know Rod as well as many outside the industry do or those inside the industry who have consistently and
unsuccessfully tried to recruit Rod away from Entergy. He provided outstanding leadership as President of the LSU
Board of Trustees before being enticed to the Board of Trustees in Notre Dame, his alma matter. He also served and
continues to serve in key roles in various national committees and organizations that promote and support the public
good. I know you will enjoy getting to know him better, including at our Analyst Conference next year in New Orleans.
And speaking of the 2011 Analyst Conference, in the Appendix to the webcast presentation we've inserted our Save the
Date Notice. This jazz fest is one of the most highly attended events in New Orleans. We will communicate often with
you about the logistics of the conference. In particular, we encourage you to make arrangements well in advance to
ensure adequate flight selections for travel. Now I'll turn the call over to Leo. Leo?
Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Wayne, and good morning everyone. In my remarks today I will cover quarterly financial results and cash
performance, followed by an update on our share repurchase program, our 2010 earnings guidance and then close with
some perspective on Entergy's value proposition.
Starting with our financial results on Slide 2, second quarter 2010 earnings were higher than one year ago at both the
Utilities and Nuclear, while they were lower at Parent & Other. Second quarter earnings included accretion from our
share repurchases, mainly due to those executed in connection with authorized programs completed in 2009.

As reported results once again this quarter include a charge associated with spin-off of synergies and the expenses for
outside services that are now focused on the spin/unwind process. As we previously committed, we have been
aggressively working through the process of unwinding the spin infrastructure to eliminate these costs as soon as
possible.
Excluding this special item related to the spin, operational earnings were up nearly 40% compared to the second quarter
of 2009. The strong operational results for the second quarter came from robust growth in Utility sales, along with solid
performance across the fleet at Entergy Nuclear. Utility sales increased all customer classes, and included the effect of
warmer than normal weather in all the jurisdictions we serve. However, each jurisdiction also had positive overall retail
sales growth on a weather-adjusted basis.
At Entergy Nuclear, where lower power pricing continue to affect that segment's results, the fleet again this quarter
delivered solid operational performance, including the second longest run in Vermont Yankee history, and the second
breaker to breaker run in 4.5 years before starting its refueling outage in April, an ongoing record operational run at
Fitzpatrick and the second longest operational run at Pilgrim.
In addition, Palisades was recognized by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations as achieving excellence in overall
plant performance for the first time in the plant's history. Employees of Palisades also received the highest honor given
by the Nuclear Energy Institute, the Top Industry Practice Award.
Turning back now to factors driving quarter-on-quarter results, we refer you to Slide 3. First at the Utility, higher net
revenue was the primary factor driving the quarterly earnings increase. Overall, Utility retail sales grew by 8.6%, led by
double-digit performance in the industrial sector. For the second consecutive quarter, weather was a significant factor
in residential sales growth. Our region experienced record weather once again. With 116 years of data available, it was
the warmest quarter on record in Louisiana, the second warmest ever in Arkansas and the third warmest in Mississippi.
However, we believe the real residential sales news here is that the sector achieved solid growth of 2.1% on a
weather-adjusted basis.
Turning back to the industrial sector, the positive effects of economic rebound we saw taking shape in the first quarter
results continued through the second quarter. The national industrial recovery, supported by the need to rebuild
diminished inventories and reinforced by a comeback in the auto industry and stronger exports, is clearly benefiting our
customer base. This rebound is magnified – when the comparable period is the first half of last year, when the worst of
the economic recession was affecting our region.
In looking at specific industrial segments, the results are mixed and tied directly to trends in both the national and
global economies. For example, an improving global industrial picture has provided a boost to the chemicals segment.
This occurred while the weakened national demand for gasoline and high natural gas inventory levels have pressured
the pipeline segment.
The decrease in demand for gasoline also created some resistance to recovery among our refining customers, who are
relying more on export opportunities. Primary metals are experiencing a rebound due to some bounce in the auto
industry, while a soft housing market continues to depress the wood products business segment. Further evidence of the
mixed nature of the recovery can be seen in Arkansas, where its industrial sales are benefiting from recovery among
small manufacturers tied to global industrial expansion.
Slide 4, which we've used for a few quarterly calls now, clearly reflects this rebound. As a reminder, this chart plots
month-by-month the change in cumulative retail sales for a three-month period versus the same three-month period in
the prior year. After excluding the effects of weather and the 2008 hurricanes, we once again can see the effect of an
economy that has clearly shown improvement in our service territory.
There are some tempering effects included in our industrial sales results this quarter. As was true last quarter, the
increase in net revenue from higher industrial sales volume was somewhat offset by the price effect associated with
demand charges. Recall that last year these charges had offset the negative impact of lower volume. In addition, late in
the second quarter we saw indications that the pace of recovery was slowing, suggesting that while recovery may hold,
we could see the improvement moderate in future months. The key takeaway from all of this is that our

weather-adjusted sales results to date align well with the assumptions used in our full-year guidance numbers.
Finally, regulatory actions in 2009 produced results that benefited this quarter, including FRP actions at Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Mississippi and the absence in the current quarter of a May 2009
FERC order, which resulted in a charge at Entergy Texas. Turning back for a moment to Slide 3. We see that an
increase in interest expense at the Utility partially offset the positive effect of higher net revenue for the current quarter.
Moving to Entergy Nuclear, the quarter-over-quarter increase in operational earnings was due primarily to higher net
revenue associated with higher generation due to fewer planned and unplanned outage days and the absence of
impairments associated with decommissioning trusts recorded in the second quarter of last year. Fewer planned
refueling outage days reflect the timing of our refueling reschedule for the fleet. Our schedule for '09 included all three
refueling outages in the spring, while the schedule this year has two spring and two fall refuelings.
The reduction in unplanned days reflects strong performance of the 23% decrease in the number of unplanned outage
days this quarter compared to a year ago. Partially offsetting the positive results coming from a solid operating quarter
at Entergy Nuclear, the lower net revenue on lower energy price for sales on a contracted basis and higher non-fuel
operation and maintenance expense due primarily to tritium remediation work at Vermont Yankee, the effective fewer
refueling outage days during the quarter and higher benefits expense.
Finally, Parent & Other results were lower due primarily to higher income tax expense because of the absence of
decreases in valuation allowances of lost carryovers that were recorded in the second quarter of 2009.
Moving now to Slide 5. Entergy's operating cash flow performance for the second quarter 2010 reflected an increase of
approximately $150 million over the second quarter of last year. This net increase in OCF was driven mainly by three
factors: Higher net revenues at both Utility and Entergy Nuclear; the absence of storm spending that occurred in the
second quarter of 2009; and lower refueling outage costs due to fewer scheduled outages in the second quarter 2010 at
Entergy Nuclear. Partially offsetting these positive contributors to cash flow was higher working capital requirements
at the Utility.
In closing the topic of cash, I believe it's important to emphasize that as we enter the height of hurricane season, our
liquidity position remains solid. We had $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand and another 1.3 billion of
available liquidity should we need to call on such funds as of the end of June. In addition, we have the ability to access
$290 million in cash storm damage reserves from Louisiana securitizations that were funded in July.
Now turning to an update on our share repurchase program, as reflected on Slide 6. During the second quarter, we
completed roughly $138 million of share repurchases. We purchased a total of 1.8 million shares at an average price of
$76 per share. About 55% of the repurchases were made through the existing $750 million Board authorized program.
The balance was repurchased to offset the dilutive effects of stock option exercises. We continue to expect to complete
repurchases under the current program by year end. However, consistent with past practice, decisions on whether to
buy back stock are made based on a number of factors, including current business conditions and investment needs, our
liquidity and financial flexibility to quickly respond to changing conditions and our point of view on the value of our
stock.
Slide 7 details our current 2010 earnings guidance, which ranges from 5.95 to 6.80 per share on an as reported basis
and 6.40 to 7.20 per share on an operational basis. The as reported and operational guidance ranges remained
unchanged from the numbers we shared in our first quarter earnings call.
As we assess our earnings performance to date, we believe we have made good progress through the first half of 2010
and are well positioned relative to our full year guidance range. The Utility has experienced consecutive quarters of
strong sales growth, bolstered by positive performance across all of our jurisdictions, particularly among residential and
industrial customers. Economic rebound, both nationally and globally, has yielded benefits to our business, as reflected
in our Utility sales numbers. And our efforts in the regulatory arena produced constructive rate actions in 2009 which
also contributed to improved results.

It is noteworthy to recognize that weather has been a significant contributor to results over the first six months of this
year. Clearly, we cannot predict nor control the effect of weather in any given period. In addition, third quarter is
historically our most significant earnings quarter. We're only about one-third of the way through that period. The point
here is that there's more work to do in order to achieve the level of financial success we targeted for this year at the
Utility.
At Entergy Nuclear, the fleet continues to perform well and posting a capacity factor of 90% this quarter while working
through two planned refueling outages. In addition, there are more planned refuelings in the fall. Also, pricing on the
portfolio's unsold position continues to work against us relative to our guidance assumption, although we've seen a
slight rebound since we updated you last quarter. While the power markets may not be as unpredictable as weather,
many factors beyond our control will drive prices for the un-contracted power we sell over the remainder of the year.
In summation, we are pleased with our financial performance for the first half of the year. Our efforts will focus on
continuing to produce positive financial results through strong operational performance. And consistent with our past
practice, we will not revise our guidance earnings, given the uncertainty of key earnings drivers, such as weather,
outage schedules and market prices, among other uncertainties, unless we see factors moving us out of our overall
guidance range.
Change direction just for a moment. As Wayne mentioned earlier, we have a couple of new players on today's call in
Paula Walters and Rod West. I would also like to point out that today is the last earnings call for someone that many of
you know and have had interaction with over the last decade.
During the third quarter, Paul LaRosa will be retiring. Paul has been a key part of the IR team for over 10 years and has
been with Entergy for 33 years. I know that many of you have developed a relationship with Paul, and I can tell you
that for the last six years he's provided me with great counsel on a number of wide-ranging issues. As you all know,
Paul was slated to lead the Investor Relations at Enexus. I know that you all want to wish Paul well in your dealings
with him over the next couple of months.
So in closing, the last script that Paul will help me write, we recognize the current economic environment has created
widespread uncertainty for many of our stakeholders. However, we also recognize that the unsteady, drawn out pace of
economic recovery offers an opportunity for those who remain focused. At Entergy, we maintain our focus through the
tireless pursuit of our aspirations.
As we discussed with you in the past, our aspirations include 5 to 6% growth at the Utility, driven by sales growth,
improving ROEs and making productive investments through portfolio transformation. Our focus has produced
measurable results against these aspirations, as indicated by strong sales growth, including sales on a weather-adjusted
basis, constructive regulatory outcomes, including meaningful progress in our most challenging jurisdictions and
continued progress in our efforts to identify productive investments, as demonstrated by the promising results of the
Utility supply plan RFP. These results include four acquisition proposals totaling nearly 3,000 megawatts and include
one self-held option.
The Nuclear aspirations continue to focus on preserving the valuable option of this low cost, base load, in fleet through
superior operational performance. Again this quarter, our fleet turned in strong performance, achieving a 90% capacity
factor, despite planned outage times with two refuelings.
And finally, we know that retaining focus in our business produces the financial outcomes you expect, like solid
liquidity and credit and value that is returned to you through dividends and/or share repurchases.
As noted earlier, our liquidity stands at more than $2.5 billion, which excludes nearly $300 million of storm cash
reserves; a very solid position for us. And with regard to getting value to you we plan on completing share repurchases
through our $750 million program by year end. These repurchases are an important element of our program forecasted
to return to you as much as $5 billion in dividends or share repurchases over the next five years, absent additional
attractive investment opportunities.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question today will be from Greg Gordon from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: As you look through time over the next 18 to 24 months and you look at the sort of the cash
balance and you look at the fairly sizeable amount of current parent debt. Your net balance if you just aggregate up all
the cash is around 1.3 billion. I know you're going to be doing a buy back. What sort of are the big puts and takes and
where do you see sort of the "right" parent cash balance for the company in the long run? Or the parent debt, sorry,
balance in the long run?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, Greg, we've maintained a pretty
consistent level of debt at the parent on a net basis over the last few years. We've had some of the term debt that has
come due that we've as it's matured we paid off over the last couple of years. There was a re-capitalization plan
associated with the spin that involved kind of changing that mix up a little bit.
As we go forward, we're going to move past what we would have done to the spin and parent debt levels will remain
reasonably modest, but we'll continue to carry some debt there. We just may change in terms of the nature of how it's
placed. What we used to have as term debt, which now fits potentially in the revolver and the cash that we have, we'll
work through maintaining a pretty consistent level of debt there for the time being, but maybe in a different form
<Q - Greg Gordon>: You envision terming any of the current parent debt out at any of the subsidiaries, including at
the Nuclear business?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Something that would happen at the
Nuclear business is definitely a longer term, I guess, what we're used to referring to as plan B type of option, but
certainly terming out debt at the parent is one of the options that we'd be looking at going forward.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Moving along, we will hear from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning. Congratulations, Paul, and I wanted to ask you about Vermont Yankee. It
sounded like you were perhaps looking for other positions for the people who work there. How should we think about
what your actual outlook for the plant is now?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, Paul, it was like I said: We believe,
without getting into all the various options at that plant, we believe that at the end of the day, that plant keeps running.
And as we always do, we plan for the worst, and if the various alternatives to keep that plant running all fail, for
whatever reasons, and it could be an economic shutdown. I mean, people forget that we're pretty clear about that too. If
it's not economic to operate it, we'll do something ourselves, but we have – began planning some time ago, just like we
do when a union contract is up, we begin planning for the possibility of a strike.
And in this particular case, we began planning for what we would do with the people, what opportunities would be
available. Obviously, in that case there would people that would need to be there for a while for decommissioning work

and things of that nature, but we want to make sure to the extent possible we keep everybody gainfully employed. And
it's a contingent; it's a backup plan. We do it for hurricanes, strikes, like I said, for everything. It's not a base plan at all.
The base plan is that we expect that plant will keep operating in the public interest and it's an excellent plant.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And how would the negotiations with the utilities to do a new PPA with them, how are
those progressing? Do you think – is there any update you can give us on that?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, that's where Rick seems to be spending all
of time on his expense account at least, so I'll let him tell you what he's been up to.
<A - Richard Smith>: Hi, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Hi.
<A - Richard Smith>: I mean, they just keep moving on. I mean, I'm having conversations essentially every other
week, so I'd take that as a positive sign.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then just finally on the $675 million of repurchase. You guys, if I understood
correctly, you guys expect to have that complete by the end of the year?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: That's correct.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Okay, thanks a lot.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks.
Operator
And the next question will be from Leslie Rich with JPMorgan.
<Q - Leslie Rich>: Hi. I wondered if you could walk through again for me that RFP that you were discussing, and you
said that it included four acquisition proposals. Am I to assume that that means that you would acquire existing
generation and, if approved, that you would then file to basically put that in rate base? Is that what you meant?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: That's correct.
<Q - Leslie Rich>: And then in addition to that, one self-build option; build a new combined cycle plant?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: That's correct.
<Q - Leslie Rich>: Okay. And then one was a PPA just with an existing generator?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: That's correct.
<Q - Leslie Rich>: Okay. And so the timing on approval of all that is what?
<A - Richard Smith>: Well, we're going to begin the negotiations with the counterparties as we speak, and we would
expect to go through the regulatory approval, and the timeline would be up to one, one and a half years for that
approval, put that in the rate base.
<Q - Leslie Rich>: Okay. So – but the RFP for 1,000 megawatts. I thought that was for long-term resources by 2011?
<A - Richard Smith>: Well, we have 500 megawatts of a PPA that will go into effect next year. Once again, we have
to reach agreement with the counterparty on that. And while we're going through the negotiations on these assets, we'll
go ahead and have short-term PPAs on those and go ahead and have that capacity available to us over the time of those
negotiations.
<Q - Leslie Rich>: Is the Acadia plant included in that 1,000 megawatts? Or is that in addition to?

Operator
Okay. We'll move along to Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Hey, good morning. Wayne, can you just talk a little bit more about New York? I understand there
you guys withdrew the application, but there were still some outstanding issues around how far the commission could
reach and their control over debt limits and that sort of stuff. Where does that stand? And kind of with the EWC
organization as it stands, how is that going to maybe impact some of the planning for that business?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, by withdrawing the order, essentially in
our minds I think it takes that issue off the table, essentially, at this point in time. And then it puts the company back in
the position of trying to or revisiting some of the things that were said in that case, some of the things that weren't said
in that case, and coming to some agreement with New York about what is in their best interest and what rights they
have and what rights we have. We clearly failed in that, in our presentation of that case in the manner that we took it
on, and it was probably too big and all at once. And I think if we – in the process of the finalizing before they came to
that decision, we heard a lot more about what their position and interpretation was of the law and their rights and their
own particular preferences and needs.
And that's something that we'll be a lot more sensitive to in the future. It does not mean, of course, that we have
acquiesced to anything at this point in time. It just means that we don't need to beat this dead horse any longer. We lost.
And we'll continue to pursue what's in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders, and we believe the people
of New York also, but we'll have to figure out a different way and a better way to do it than what we did.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Okay. And then I guess on the dyssynergy cost mitigation efforts. How long do you guys think
until you get that number down to an acceptable level? And from the $0.06 in the second quarter, what do you think is
going to be the ultimate run rate from a cost perspective?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Dan, we still believe we're going to get
that – or we know we're going to get that – all wound up by the end of the year. The issue that you have to some extent
with some of these costs is, from an accounting point of view, there are certain things, certain criteria that have to be
met before you can actually take the charge for some of the things you know you're going to take a charge for, like
relocations and severance and even getting out of leases and the like.
So some of that'll drag on for a few months while we wind down through some of those things, but going into next
year, the numbers will be – we won't have any kind of special associated – they'll be gone next year.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Dan, one of the things I probably should
have said is one of the reasons certainly to pull down that order or that that petition is we do not want to get an order
from the New York Public Service Commission that would require us to have to appeal it. That could happen. They
could put something in the order that we simply believe is against the law and then that would require us to have to take
it to court and that would be an enormous waste of everybody's time if we did that.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q>: Hi, guys. Just two quick questions. In Vermont, the tritium. How much was that in the quarter, the cleanup?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we're struggling with that one. You or
somebody's got that. Maybe Mark's got it. How much?
<A - Mark Savoff>: About 11 million.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay, Mark had it.
<Q>: That's good number. And then the second question for Wayne. Listening to the Duke call, I guess, Jim kind of
stated that we were at the beginning of a cycle of consolidation within the industry. And so I just want to get your
thoughts on that and what Entergy is thinking along those lines longer term?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I thought Jim said that back in 1988 when he
first joined the industry.
<Q>: Well, it's relative 15.50, right?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Obviously I didn't hear his call, I mean the
context he put that in. There's always an argument for consolidation in this industry, just because of the very dispersed
nature of the talent across the board. I think it is a very, very tough sell to boards and to regulators on consolidation
right now. The way the rules have developed, the antitrust rules, if you merge with somebody, that's close to you,
you're in an divestment mode or things that you need to serve your customers. And you're giving most of the benefits to
your customers and not much to your shareholders if you're paying a premium and then if you're merging with
somebody very far away, it's hard to develop a strategic rationale, other than I just want to get bigger, which doesn't
really work for us as a strategic rationale. It's got to produce better cash flows, less risk or something.
I think that consolidation is something on Mr. Rogers' mind for a long time, and he's been successful at it. And they
may well continue to pursue it. And we – we're like everybody, we've said before I think last year that we looked at a
lot of stuff, and at the end of the day, nothing ever seems to really make sense once you count all the costs, the
premiums and things. I don't think you're going to see a lot of consolidation in this industry. I think you may see
something, but it will be unique. I think once you get through this building phase and with some of the plans people
have, that there will be maybe some forced consolidations like occurred after the last building phase just through
financial distress, but I don't see it today.
<Q>: Okay. Thank you very much. And, Paul LaRosa, good luck to you. You've been a good guy.
Operator
And now we will move along to Steve Fleishman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Yeah. Hi, guys. Just a question on the – you didn't really touch on the impact of the BP spill
on your territory. I know in our past conversations it didn't look like it's having much of an impact on the overall
economic growth, but could you just give a color on kind of where you see that over the next 6 to 12 months? If at all?
<A - Gary Taylor>: Yeah, Steve, it's Gary. I think if you look in the near term in the timeframe you're talking about, I
don't think we're going to see a large impact. Anything that's really been impacted has really been offset primarily by
the additional resources that have come into the area to deal with it. I think it's really question of a lot of people are
taking a wait and see approach right now as these moratoriums are working their way either through the court process,
and that's probably longer term as to how it impacts drilling in that area. There's about 33 – there were about 33
deepwater wells, and so I think it could be a little bit longer term impact, but in the timeframe you're talking about, I
don't think we see a large impact to this company. Obviously to the people that are affected it's significant.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. And one separate question, Wayne, on the way you talked about I guess Rick's new job
in terms of strategy for this EWC, both political/regulatory, but also kind of commercial hedging and all that. Could

you or Rick maybe elaborate a little more on how you're thinking about the commercial and hedging side of things?
What are some of the things you're looking to do differently than what you've been doing?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. I'll let Rick do that, but, Steve, I think
really the key thing is it's been painfully obvious to us that our structure in the Northeast was totally inadequate. We
looked at those plans. We talked a lot about managing that as a business, but we continue to manage them functionally
without a P&L head, without all of the functions in the Northeast that you would have, for example, at the Utility. And
it was clear in the spin-off process that most of the states viewed us no different than a utility, and we did not have the
functions in place in that area to provide the answers and interface with the people and explain – understand their
positions and explain our positions and come to some agreements.
And that's a big part now with Rick's job is we're now much more part of the communities and we'll do a lot better job
in terms of, I think, in terms of execution by being kind of the business unit up there instead of just functions.
I'll let Rick talk specifically about some of the things they're going to do differently.
<A - Richard Smith>: You know, Steve, near term you're not going to see much change of what Entergy was doing.
We're hedged out for this year about 91%, 90% for next year, so there's not a lot of activity that we could do over the
next couple of years. But we have been thinking about years '12, '13 and '14 and what we might do as it relates to
capacity additions in the area that will allow us to kind of change the product mix from pretty much solely unit
contingent to more firm capacity.
So I mean we're just jumping into that. I'd admit that what we dealt with the spin kind of bogged us down on the
regulatory process, so I think we'll be able to provide you some better thoughts over the next couple of quarters. But I
mean it is in the back of our mind to kind of look at the portfolio more broadly and see what we can do around those
existing baseload units to really sell different products.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Great, thank you.
