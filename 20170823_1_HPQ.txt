Dion J. Weisler
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today. It was another outstanding quarter,
showcasing strong execution of our strategy. I'm very pleased with our sustained performance and continued
momentum. We are striking the right balance in how we plan, innovate and consistently deliver.
We're competing and winning in our core print and PC markets. We're entering new growth markets and natural
adjacencies with the right products, supply chain and go-to-market with world-class sustainability. We're investing in
future categories, where we can disrupt with innovation and we are relentlessly focused on increasing productivity and
taking cost out of the business.
With that context, let me highlight a few outstanding results for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net
earnings per share of $0.43, at the high end of our outlook range. We grew net revenue 10% year-over-year to $13.1
billion, and for the second consecutive quarter achieved growth in both Personal Systems and Print segments. And we
continue to see broad-based growth across all regions with double-digit year-over-year increases in both EMEA and
APJ.
We surpassed our expectations entering the year, delivering free cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion for the quarter
and $2.8 billion year-to-date. And through quarter three, we returned approximately $1.6 billion to shareholders
through share repurchases and dividends. In the past seven quarters, since HP became a stand-alone company, you've
heard us talk about reinvention. We reinvented ourselves, our company, and our solutions to amaze our customers,
partners, employees and shareholders.
Reinvention is a long journey, but we're driving consistent results and seeing our hard work and dedication bear fruit.
Make no mistake, there is much more work to do based on the volatility of our markets, but the past several quarters
reflect our ability to consistently execute with a healthy balance across our portfolio and across all of our regions. We
continue to leverage our innovation, differentiation and scale to create unique advantage and drive further growth.
Now let me turn to business segment performance. Personal Systems had another stellar quarter. We achieved
double-digit revenue growth for the third quarter in a row, despite a tougher year-over-year compare. The results were
balanced across the business with double-digit revenue growth across all three geographic regions, in consumer and
commercial and across notebook and workstations. I'm also encouraged that desktops returned to growth in the quarter,
reflecting the ongoing reinvention of products.
In calendar quarter two, we outgrew the PC market unit growth by 9.5 points year-over-year, remaining the number one
global PC market share leader with 22.8% share. We saw year-over-year share gains in each region, with Americas
increasing share by nearly 3 points in both consumer and commercial. While we are proud of these results and the
team's efforts, share gain continues to be an outcome, not the objective.
Profitable growth will continue to be our priority. To this end, Personal Systems' operating profit dollars, margins and
revenue each grew sequentially, despite the remaining industry-wide component cost headwinds. We have been
proactive with our ongoing productivity efforts, repricing actions and focus on product mix.
During the quarter, we continued to reinvent our Personal Systems business and shipped the most secure and
manageable PCs to our customers. We have raised the bar in the premium segment with the new Spectre x2, and we
expanded our OMEN gaming portfolio with a new virtual reality backpack, and we offered even greater value to our

customers buying Pavilion devices with extended battery life and new features such as biometric log-on and inking

As a category, PC market revenue grew year-over-year in calendar quarter two, although units were down. The market
remains highly competitive. But with that said, we have a strategy that is delivering. We're playing our own game,
pursuing the heat in the market, and it's paying off. We are now consistently achieving industry-leading results and
setting the standard for the type of balanced performance the category has not seen in quite some time. The team's
execution is truly superb.
Shifting to Printing, the business delivered across multiple dimensions, reflecting operational progress and sustained
momentum, as we continue to ignite our renaissance in Printing. Total revenue was up 6% year-over-year and, once
again, included growth in both hardware and supplies. Units also grew year-over-year for the fourth consecutive
quarter, and we remain well positioned to place positive NPV units. Total print unit market share was 38.5% in
calendar quarter two. We saw a slight unit share increase year-over-year in our office business and a slight decline in
our home business.
Turning to supplies, we are pleased to report that supplies stabilization occurred in quarter three, one quarter earlier
than originally expected. Supplies revenue grew 10% year-over-year on a reported basis, or up 2% after adjusting for
constant currency and last year's supplies sales model changes.
As you know, this is an important milestone and has taken a concerted effort across the print team to achieve. Going
forward, we expect the same execution in the 4-box model in order to consistently win in the market. Additionally, we
are making progress in our strategic growth areas and have the opportunity to do more.
Our Graphics business grew revenue year-over-year in constant currency for the 16th consecutive quarter. While I like
this trend, with our leading portfolio, this is an area where we can be growing even faster. Quarter three was the first
full quarter of shipping our portfolio of disruptive A3 multifunction printers, and we are encouraged by the early
progress. These are the most secure printers in the world. The customer reception has been positive, and we are adding
new channel partners ahead of plan.
Further supporting our A3 momentum, we expect the acquisition of Samsung's printing business to close in the fourth
quarter of this calendar year, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. Managed Print
Services continued to grow revenue year-over-year. We have the opportunity to further accelerate this business,
especially with our growing A3 portfolio. In summary, for Printing, I'm very encouraged by the strong and balanced
performance across hardware, supplies and our key growth initiatives.
Turning to 3D Printing, this quarter we launched our business in Asia-Pacific, the world's largest manufacturing
market, expanding into Greater China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Australia. We now have more than 45
resellers globally and more than 20 Reference and Experience Centers. We're also expanding our open materials
ecosystem, adding Sinopec, one of the largest integrated energy and chemical companies in China, to our growing list
of material partners.
Shipments are accelerating, and we continue to have new and repeat customer wins with some of the largest companies
in their industries, such as Jaguar Land Rover, Flex and others in automotive, pharmaceutical, government and
education. We are also driving continued growth with manufacturing service bureaus, a key part of our market
expansion strategy. This includes leaders such as Forecast 3D in the United States, which has deployed a dozen systems
to anchor a full-scale 3D production facility, Materialise in Europe and Shining 3D ePrint in China, among others. We
are pleased with the progress of this strategically important part of our future and continue to execute on our long-term
plan for disrupting the $12 trillion manufacturing market.
Overall, I'm proud of our Q3 performance and confident in our future. We're executing across multiple strategic
dimensions and positioning HP to capture the big opportunities today and well into the future. We are delivering short
term, while investing for the long term, gaining share with a focus on profitability and driving both operational
efficiencies and innovation across our business.

In closing, I said a couple of things last quarter that are worth repeating. First, every day we must amaze our customers
and partners. This focus underpins our results and guides our future performance. And second, change is a constant in
this business and to us, change equals opportunity. We must continue to embrace and drive change with an eye on
delivering long-term growth and returns.
I'll now turn the call over to Cathie to provide more details and our financial outlook.
Catherine A. Lesjak
Thanks, Dion. We've continued the momentum from our strong first half, and I'm very pleased with our third quarter
results. We delivered net revenue of $13.1 billion, up 10% year-over-year as reported or 11% in constant currency. We
continue to see broad-based and consistent performance across businesses and geographies. Regionally, year-over-year
Americas grew 8%, EMEA was up 14% and APJ grew 15%, all in constant currency.
Gross margin at 18.6% was up 30 basis points year-over-year. The increase was driven primarily by Print margins
resulting from productivity improvements and higher supplies mix, partially offset by higher commodity costs in
Personal Systems. Sequentially, gross margin was down 60 basis points, driven by an unfavorable print mix and a
higher sequential growth in Personal Systems.
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.4 billion were up 35% as reported. But this year-over-year variance is largely
driven by gains recorded last year, resulting from the divestiture of certain marketing optimization software assets.
Sequentially, operating expenses were down 1%. Net OI&E expense was $66 million for the quarter with a non-GAAP
tax rate of 22% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net
earnings per share of $0.43.
Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes restructuring and other charges of $46 million and
acquisition-related charges of $40 million, partially offset by non-operating retirement-related credits of $34 million,
tax indemnification credits of $10 million and the related tax impact on these charges. In Q3, GAAP diluted net
earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.41.
Turning to the segments. Personal Systems net revenue was an impressive $8.4 billion, up 12% year-over-year as
reported or 13% in constant currency. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth and third
consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth. We continue to segment the market and offer some of
our most innovative products ever. These efforts have helped us sustain revenue momentum, deliver consistently across
each region and drive strong market share as an end result.
By customer segment, Consumer revenue was up 14% year-over-year, and we gained unit share across each of the
three regions in calendar Q2. Commercial revenue was up 11% year-over-year and similarly, we gained unit share
across each region. We also achieved strong results by product category with Notebooks up 16%, Desktops up 5% and
Workstations up 11% year-over-year.
We delivered 3.7% operating margin in the quarter, which is up 0.5 points quarter-to-quarter, above historical
seasonality and down 0.7 points year-over-year. Consistent with what we said last quarter, margins have been pressured
by industry-wide increases in component costs and currency headwinds. We have increased pricing globally and have
continued to see positive mix shifts in the business, both of which have helped improve operating margins sequentially.
However, we remain cautious about the potential negative impact on demand, which could result from higher prices.
Turning to Printing. The momentum gained in Q2 carried into Q3. Revenue was $4.7 billion in the quarter, up 6%
year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. Hardware units were up 1% year-over-year with Consumer units up 1% and
Commercial units flat. As noted previously, our total unit growth includes HP Sprocket, our handheld photo printer. In
calendar Q2, overall print unit share was roughly flat sequentially and year-over-year. We remain optimistic about our
print growth businesses.

Our A3 business is off to a strong start since launching its new product lineup in Q2. And we're excited about the
opportunity to be a disruptive new entrant in this $55 billion market. As Dion highlighted, both Graphics and Managed
Print Services continued to grow revenue year-over-year, and we have the opportunity to increase our growth rates.
Now, moving to Q3 supplies performance. Revenue of $3.1 billion was up 10% year-over-year and represented 66% of
Print revenue. The supplies growth was better than anticipated, driven by improving 4-box model drivers. As we
described in the past, the way we look at supplies revenue growth operationally is to take our as-reported number and
adjust for two things. First, we look at constant currency growth. In Q3, currency represented less than a point of delta
so supplies grew 10% year-over-year in constant currency.
Second, we adjust for changes made in the second half of last year to our supplies sales model. In Q3 2016, reported
supplies revenue was negatively impacted by approximately $225 million or 8 points of growth. Therefore, when you
deduct the 8 points against the 10% constant currency growth, net adjusted supplies growth for Q3 2017 was 2%
year-over-year. We are very pleased to have achieved supplies stabilization a quarter earlier than expected.
We also expect to consistently operate with supplies channel inventory levels remaining at or below our ceiling. And in
Q3, channel inventory levels were below the ceiling. As a reminder, as part of making the supplies sales model changes
last year, we lowered our channel inventory ceiling to better reflect the more demand-driven sales model.
Looking forward to Q4 2017, we expect that our year-over-year supplies revenue growth will remain flat to slightly up
when making similar operational adjustments for currency and then backing out approximately $225 million for the
supplies sales model channel inventory adjustment taken in Q4 of 2016.
Print operating profit was 17.3% in the quarter, down 3.1 points year-over-year and down 10 basis points sequentially.
The year-over-year decline was primarily due to the onetime adjustments I mentioned earlier, the positive margin
impact of divesting certain marketing optimization software assets, offset by the negative impact of changing the
supplies sales model plus productivity improvements year-over-year. Excluding the onetime adjustments, we saw good
operating profit dollar expansion year-over-year. Sequentially, the 10 basis point decline is consistent with normal
seasonality.
Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation, cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in Q3 and approximately
$3 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow was $1.7 billion in the quarter and approximately $2.8 billion year-to-date. Cash
conversion cycle was minus 35 days, a five-day sequential improvement driven by an eight-day increase in days
payable outstanding, offset by a one-day increase in days of inventory and a two-day increase in days sales outstanding.
The strong Q3 results were driven by Personal Systems revenue performance, which grew sequentially by over $700
million or 10%, well above historical norms. This incremental volume materially helped near-term working capital,
including days payable.
As you know, since Personal Systems has a negative cash conversion cycle, the timing of cash flow was impacted
either positively or negatively, depending on its sequential revenue performance. Also, we saw positive business
linearity in purchasing in other receivables, which supported improved timing of cash flow by a couple hundred million
dollars.
Year-to-date cash flow is now ahead of our full-year range provided during last year's Security Analyst Meeting (sic)
[Securities Analyst Meeting]. We are now targeting a higher revised full year free cash flow outlook of at least $3
billion. This assumes a cash conversion cycle down sequentially, more than normal seasonality and more in line with
the first half performance. Finally, we expect higher fourth quarter capital expenditures but will not exceed our
full-year CapEx guidance of $500 million.
During the quarter, we had a total capital return of $524 million through share repurchases and cash dividends.
Year-to-date, we have returned 56% of free cash flow as compared to our full-year target of 50% to 75%. For the full
year, we still expect to deliver returns towards the higher end of the range.
Looking ahead, keep the following in mind related to our financial outlook: For the full year, we are on track to deliver
our productivity initiatives as announced at SAM. In Personal Systems, we expect to see continued increases in cost of

components in Q4. We expect to offset these headwinds with increased pricing, which could have a more significant
impact on demand and operating margins than we've assumed. With this demand uncertainty combined with our very
strong Q3 revenue performance, we expect Personal Systems Q4 revenue to grow less than normal sequential
seasonality.
For Printing, we expect supplies revenue to be flat to slightly up in Q4 in constant currency and adjusted for last year's
supplies sales model change. We also expect to continue placing units with a positive NPV. Given our hedging
strategy, we have rolling currency hedges, which extend into future quarters. And therefore, we do not expect a
material tailwind from currency in Q4 2017. We'll also continue to leverage our balance sheet if we see attractive
economic opportunities to do so.
With all that in mind, Q4 2017 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.42 to $0.45. Q4 2017
GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.37 to $0.41. We are raising the
midpoint of our full year fiscal 2017 non-GAAP and GAAP EPS: full-year fiscal 2017 non-GAAP diluted net earnings
per share to be in the range of $1.63 to $1.66 and full year fiscal 2017 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from
continuing operations to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.50.
With that, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will be
from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sherri A. Scribner>: Hi. Thank you. You guys have done a good job of returning supplies to some modest
growth when you make the adjustments from last year. We saw 2% growth this quarter, which is the same growth we
saw last year. What type of long-term growth would you expect based on the 4-box model? Should we assume that
supplies is generally flat long-term or do you think that growth is modestly single digits at some rate? That would be
helpful to know your long-term perspective. Thank you.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: Thanks for the question, Sherri. I think it's important to remind everybody how we define
stabilization. We've done that on previous calls, and we've said that supplies revenue and constant currency not
declining further is our definition. We also walked you, over the last couple of years, through the 4-box model drivers
and our consistent focus on driving improvement across each of those four boxes.
Now, in quarter three, our focus and execution over the last two years on all four of those drivers saw the supplies
revenue mature and stabilize one quarter ahead of plan, and we are very, very encouraged by that. As it relates to
quarter four, we're on track for supplies revenue to be flat to slightly up in constant currency as well as being adjusted
for last year's supplies sales model change. Beyond quarter four, we believe we can drive further improvements across
all the 4-box model drivers to impact supplies revenue as we go forward.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And Sherri, we'll talk more about FY 2018 specifically at our Security Analyst Meeting
(sic) [Securities Analyst Meeting] in October, so everyone should join us then.
Operator
The next question will be from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Wamsi Mohan>: As part of shaping this installed base that you talked about placing high value printers, you've
seen some deceleration in the growth rates on printer placements. How much of that is an opt-out of lower NPV
printers versus competitive dynamics or versus the market slowdown, and do you feel that the installed base is shaping

up to a profile that can keep this positive supplies growth over the next year or so on an organic basis as you're defining
on this adjusted basis? And I have a follow-up for Cathie.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Sure. So, from a growth perspective, first off, it's a little bit tougher compare, right? So if
you actually look at what's happened to unit growth kind of each of the quarters this year, each quarter, the previous
year is a bit tougher. So I think that's part of what's going on. And then, the other part is that we are very much focused
on high value units. As we've talked about before, all units are not created equal in the market. And where we want to
focus all of our energy is really on positive NPV, and those typically are really the high usage categories. That's where
we want to grow and where we want to gain share.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: So, double-clicking a little bit on that, Wamsi, I would say that the team continues to execute
on both the core and the growth initiatives, and they're maintaining steady momentum in print hardware as we have
over the last several quarters. In quarter three, print hardware units grew 1% year-over-year. But notably, this was
driven by better than normal sequential growth of 4%. And we achieved slight increases year-over-year in both
commercial and consumer hardware, which was driven by a very disciplined focus on the 4-box model drivers,
particularly high-quality units that you're referring to there in your question such as growth in the office A4 laser
market.
Of course, this comes with high-usage, double-digit growth in multifunction value. That's the 21st consecutive quarter
in a row of growth in that segment. We are ramping our A3 business for the first full quarter. We only have 6% market
share, as you'll recall, of this $55 billion market. Encouraging thing is that it's up 1%. We were up 5% last quarter. And
home ink, also which is a more profitable part of the market for us due to the full verticalization of our technology,
we're pleased with the results, but obviously always more work that we can do.
<Q - Wamsi Mohan>: Thanks for the color, Dion. If I could follow up, on your free cash flow, you're now achieving
$3 billion here, and that's including some restructuring payments as well. How close is this to what you would call
normalized free cash flow for the company?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So, I think – I don't think there is necessarily a normalized free cash flow. One of the
things that you saw in the strength of our free cash flow this quarter was the business mix impact. So when Personal
Systems grows $700 million in revenue sequentially, or 10%, well above normal sequential, you're going to see a big
increase in accounts payable, as you saw, and a lot of free cash flow. So, the concept of a normalized free cash flow is
really not one that I can really comment on directly.
Operator
The next question will be from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: Yes. Thank you. I'm trying to decipher your comments on PC revenue for the fourth
quarter. Do you see a scenario where PC revenue actually declined sequentially or your commentary is just that it
grows slower than the normal seasonality, and then maybe in that answer, comment on which market, consumer or
commercial, you see more price sensitivity? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Sure, Katy. So it's that it will grow less quickly than what is typical seasonality, not that it
will decline. We do expect it will grow sequentially. And then, in terms of price sensitivity, we see the greatest impact
in the commercial space. Consumer price increases have taken hold, and we continue to perform very well in the
consumer space. I think, consumer revenue was up 14% year-over-year even though we have done price increases. So
it's much more in the commercial space. And our view is that, as we mentioned on the Q2 call, that it would take a
quarter for them to kind of catch up, and we did see some of that in Q3, hence some of the sequential improvement in
operating profit for Personal Systems.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: Okay. And can you share some metrics around the A3 success thus far? I know it's
early, but any color on how many partners you've ramped, any customer numbers? And then, as you think about this
going forward and we try to track the business, are you planning to break out any metrics more consistently so we can

monitor how the business scales?
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: We don't release a lot of detail around the business for obvious competitive reasons, but what I
would tell you and to give you a little bit of color is that I'm very encouraged by the initial progress. I'm excited by our
future in this $55 billion market. We only have 6% share of this $55 billion market in the last quarter.
It was our first full quarter of shipments. The customer reception is particularly positive, and particularly positive
around our security message having the most secure printers on the market, as well as the choices that are available to
our customers from a technology perspective. They're able to choose both ink-based solutions and laser-based
solutions.
We are – as it relates to go-to-market, we're ahead on our partner on-boarding targets across all three regions; across
transactional, Managed Print Service channels as well as the traditional copier partners that we were looking to
onboard. The pipeline is very strong. We have a very clear ambition to be a relevant A3 player, and we're on track to
doing that. If we can add just 10 points of revenue share in the next three to five years or so, that's $5.5 billion of top
line and the associated OP drop, so encouraged with our first full quarter start here.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And let me just add. Dion mentioned that we had 6% share. That is up both
year-over-year and sequentially a point or a little over a point. So that's one of the metrics you can absolutely see
externally and track as we make progress here.

The next question will be from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven Milunovich>: Thank you. Dion, you mentioned reinvention a few times, and that's your tagline that we've
written about and have some interest in. Regarding that, first of all, what's changed – parent HP try to kind of get back
to the invent idea without a lot of success? What's different about what you're doing, particularly in terms of the new
product pipeline?
And then second, why should investors be excited about this? I remember when the split first happened, a number of
HPQ investors were kind of saying, I don't want to hear about growth, I just want the cash flow. What gives you
confidence you'll get a substantial return on capital on your investment in the new product areas?
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: It's a great question. And the way we think about it is to anchor ourselves in our strategy,
which straddles multiple time periods. The core is all about the here and now. It's our core businesses of Printing and
Personal Systems. We have to be excellent in the core. I would say, we're doing a lot of things differently right across
the company.
We begin our journey through customer insights, and we've really bolstered our customer insights team, listening to our
customers, working with our customers to help define and build our products. Then we go to work on the cost
associated with those products; the full bill of materials, taking out the costs that we can and adding in the sprinkles of
magic that delight our customers. And that's across the entire portfolio, both Printing and Personal Systems.
The third thing we've done differently is really put a focus on design. Design really matters in a one-life world, and
whether it's the design of our award-winning x360 or our new Sprocket Printer, that is the Sprocket for your pocket, we
really do think about how customers use our products every single day. And then we think about what really concerns
customers, what's most on their mind, things like security. It's a dangerous world out there. And for us to have the most
secure printers and Personal Systems on the market is important to our customers; therefore, it's important to us, and we
invest heavily in that area.
And then, right across the company, we reinvent all of our processes. We take out non-revenue generating costs in our
business that allows us to continue to innovate across the core, but also invest in our future growth areas. And we only
have three of those: we have our A3 business that we see as a $55 billion opportunity; we have our Graphics business,
which continues to grow; and commercial mobility. And that's over the next two to three years. And the third time

The next question will be from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Suva>: Thank you very much. I have a question and a follow-up, and I'll ask them both at the same time.
The first question is, I think, Cathie in her prepared remarks mentioned that the goal is to have printers that consume
more ink and more NPV and that yields itself to more consumer – I'm sorry – more Commercial growth over Consumer
growth. But, Cathie, if I look back, it looks like the past three quarters or so, Consumer units have meaningfully
outgrown Commercial units, and maybe I don't know if that's due to Sprocket or something else there, but it looks like
while the goal is to grow the commercial, it looks like actually consumer has been growing much faster.
And then, the follow-up question is on the seasonality for PCs. You mentioned that market will still grow, but you'll
undergrow normal seasonal. Do you expect to lose share this quarter or why do you think you'll be below seasonal? Is
that because of pricing action? And do you think you'll maintain share or lose or cede some share? Thank you.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So, Jim, let me take the second one first, just to make sure that we're all communicating
well. What I said was that our business in Personal Systems would grow slower than normal seasonality for our
business. We have been outgrowing the market by quite a bit. So, I don't expect that we will lose share, even though
our revenue will be a little bit behind normal seasonality.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: And as it relates to printer hardware, obviously, not all print units are created equally, and I
mentioned a couple of data points earlier. There's certain segments of the commercial market that we are very
interested in. The growth in office A4 laser, which comes with that higher usage, is very important to us. The
double-digit growth in multifunction value is also very important to us. Obviously, ramping the A3 market goes
without saying. And it means not abandoning our traditional home ink markets.
We have done very well there with the release of new desktop printers, as well as the Sprocket which is obviously
exciting a customer that in many cases had never had access to print in the past. The sub-segment of demographics that
are buying Sprockets are largely millennials; in many cases, their first print experience. And what they're finding is that
they store what they like and they print what they love.
Operator
The next question will be from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Antonio M. Sacconaghi>: Yes. Thank you. I have a question and a follow-up. First on the question, I know you
talked about currency really not having an impact in Q4 because of the way hedges work for HP. But if we just step
back from that, I think entering fiscal 2016, you talked about a currency headwind of $0.34 to EPS for HP when the
dollar was a 3% to 4% headwind. I think spot rates would point to a dollar being a 2% tailwind for fiscal 2018, which if
you just did sort of the blind linear math would suggest you should have a $0.15 to $0.20 benefit looking forward. So, I
understand hedges need to roll off and that's why you don't really expect much impact in Q4. But as we just think about
currency more broadly looking forward, given we saw a really material hurt in 2016, why couldn't we see a really
material benefit looking forward if spot rates stay where they are? And then I have a follow-up, please.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So, Toni, we'll talk a lot more about 2018 obviously at the Security Analyst Meeting (sic)
[Securities Analyst Meeting] in October. But I think one of the things that needs to be brought into that analysis is
what's going to happen in the market from a pricing perspective. We've now seen in fiscal 2017 pretty significant price
increases. And so if there is a tailwind from currency in 2018, our expectation is that prices are going to have to come
down pretty significantly to relieve some of the pressure that's building because we've been increasing prices this year.

And so then it's going to be ultimately what is the total impact is going to be, how many price declines do you have to
do and what impact does that have on both revenue and EPS.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: I've got to tell you, I spent my life in sales, a large part of it, in any case. And one of the
hardest things that any salesperson ever has to do is to stand in front of a customer and convince them why their price
has to go up, either through currency or cost headwinds or other issues that impact the business. I think Christoph, Nick
and Richard, our three regional presidents along with their sales team have done an outstanding job in doing that
repricing. But as you get in front of those customers, whilst they understand for the large part that they have to pay
more for the products that they receive and they see the value in our products, they expect that as currency goes the
other way that you equally reprice the products as well. And I think that's very much worth keeping in mind as we head
into the Security Analyst Meeting (sic) [Securities Analyst Meeting] and we talk more about it.
<Q - Antonio M. Sacconaghi>: And then just to follow up. In your guidance for Q4, you've talked about PCs being up
sequentially, although not as much. Typically, the Printing business is also up. And yet the midpoint of your EPS
guidance is up only fractionally. I'm wondering if you can comment about whether there are any assumptions for
Samsung accretion or dilution that are embedded in your Q4 guidance, or how specifically you might be thinking about
component costs or other operating profit forces at work on Q4. Because I think just at a high level, given that revenue
should grow between Q3 and Q4, I probably would have expected a little more EPS upset.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So, first on the Samsung part of your question, Toni, we don't expect that Samsung's
going to close until calendar Q4. So, we do not expect it in our fiscal Q4, and so I think that's important. Q4 will be
without Samsung.
And then in terms of kind of the puts and takes of the sequential view, probably the two biggest things to call out; first
is commodity costs, we do expect commodity costs to go up sequentially, and so that will be a bit of a headwind. But
probably the bigger impact is just the opportunity that we see to place more positive NPV units, and so that's really
what is kind of the biggest impact sequentially on EPS relative to normal seasonality.
Operator
The next question will be from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Can you talk a bit more about the underlying dynamics of the
supplies revenue growth you saw and that you're expecting? And specifically, I'm thinking about between ink and toner
how the growth in commercial print, which is mainly ink, is maybe mixing it a little bit toward ink. I don't know if that
doesn't work because of the offset of consumer, but obviously with the higher margin benefit from ink, I'm just
wondering how we should sort of think about what's going on there below the 2% growth.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So, Shannon, I think it's a bit difficult. We don't break out kind of that level of detail.
What we have talked about is obviously our commercial business is bigger because of the usage than our consumer
business and, therefore, you'll see a difference in toner and ink as a result of that. Although just to be clear, some of the
consumer now has our low-end laser in it, so when we talk about our home print system, it includes low-end laser.
But ultimately what's going to drive the supplies is really the 4-box model drivers. It's not ink or toner. It's really about
driving across the four boxes, focusing on placing the right units, the high-quality units, working on your installed base,
working on obviously our aftermarket market share as well as the pricing related to supplies.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay. And then I guess I had a follow-up on the commodity side. Cathie, you'd mentioned
that you expect commodity cost to actually go up in the fiscal fourth quarter. I know some people I've talked to were
thinking more flat. So, I'm just trying to figure out, is that reflection of contracts rolling off that are going to reset? Or
are there specific areas where you think that you're going to need to buy more? And also, is any of that reflected in
what's going on in your inventory in this quarter as well?

<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Sure. So, I'm not aware of other views that say it's going to be flat. We actually think it's
going to continue to go up, but at a slower rate. This is particularly true from a DRAM perspective. And then when you
step back and you look at it kind of Q4 versus Q3, in the course of Q3, the commodity prices continued to go up. So, of
course, that will represent a headwind for us in Q4. But we do expect some additional increases in commodities in Q4
as well.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: The other thing I would add to that, Shannon, is that staying out in front of these cost increases
and being proactive has really worked for us. We called this particular issue well before our competitors and we took
very early action here. And we did not get caught behind the curve.
The other thing we did is we took some strategic decisions to leverage the balance sheet. We secured inventory as our
highest priority, and you heard me talk about that on the last couple of earnings calls because that then, at least, gives
the opportunity for the sales team to go out and reprice our products if you don't have them because you haven't gone
and secured them in a tough buying environment, then obviously you have no opportunity there.
So, we're very predictable for our supplies. That helps them through a time when they had to put up their costs that
were in shortage. And then, of course, as I mentioned before, the team went out – the sales team and the category team
did an excellent job of repricing the products, and our customers still see a lot of value in the incredible innovation
that's going into them.
Operator
The next question will be from Abhey Lamba of Mizuho. Please go ahead.
<Q - Abhey Rattan Lamba>: Yeah. Thank you. Cathie, you mentioned the price increases are impacting commercial
PC demand, and that's also the market where we have aging hardware installed base. So, how do you think it plays out?
Do you think it pushes out demand until prices become more reasonable in their mind? Or would there be pricing
pressures where we would see unit sales, but at lower price? How do you expect the commercial demand to kind of
play out from here on out?
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: I think you've got to take a several quarter view of the personal systems market. I think the first
thing that's important to remember is that it's still a $333 billion market, and about one in five machines got an HP logo
on. It's very quickly becoming one in four. We're creeping up there. The top four players, including us, in aggregate
grew 1%. And we grew a 5 point premium to that. So, the big are getting bigger and we're growing much faster than
the big four in total. And that's really off the back of innovation.
That's what we're focused on is delighting our customers and surprising them and amazing them with our products. And
I think we have the best product line we've ever had and that's picked up quite regularly now by third-party reviewers
that look at our products relative to our competitors. For us, it's about driving a continuous transformation of the
business to more profitable sub-categories where we can get value for that innovation.
In quarter three, that paid off again. We did have incredible top line growth of 12%, sequential growth in operating
profit as well as share gains. But just recall that share gains are not the objective, but rather the outcome. There's no
magic pill here. I don't think the markets, as they move from quarter to quarter, ever really are given a magic pill except
for when it's sort of like the last month or two before an operating system changes over. This was broad based across all
categories, all regions.
Desktops back to growth as well. Channel inventory, aged inventory very well managed. A lot of kudos to our team in
all regions, in the business unit, in the supply chain and the functions. And I think we're in a very good position to
compete as we go forward as the various dynamics play out in the market.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And then the other thing that I would add is that I was asked to make a relative comment.
And we saw Consumer revenue this quarter grow 14% year-over-year and Commercial 11%. Last quarter, we said that
the Commercial price increases were going to take a while to work their way through and we saw some of that pickup

in Q3. So, I wouldn't – I'm not suggesting that commercial customers are completely sitting on the sidelines at all. I
think that with our great product lineup, we're certainly able to make the sales that we need to make in that space, and
get them off of kind of the fence.

The next question will be from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rod Hall>: Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I had one accounting question for Cathie and
then a follow-up to that. So, I noticed that the other income/expense last year in the fiscal fourth quarter was a pretty
big negative number, Cathie. And I wonder if you could just kind of help us understand what that might look like this
year. And also, maybe comment on interest income/expense, how you would expect that to come out in the fiscal fourth
quarter of this year. Thanks. And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So, Rod, let's just make sure we're level set. So, what I have is for OI&E last year was a
negative $65 million in Q3 and for this year it's a negative $66 million. So, I don't see a real big difference there on a
year-over-year basis.
<Q - Rod Hall>: I was referring to fiscal Q4.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Are you looking at a full year basis? Pardon me?
<Q - Rod Hall>: Yeah. I was referring to the October quarter of last year. So, last year, the October quarter other
income and expense, I see at minus $435 million. Do you have a different number?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Sorry. I haven't been focused on Q4 last year. I don't remember off the top of my head
what happened last – can we take that offline?
<Q - Rod Hall>: Yeah. Absolutely.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And I can look it up. And maybe even while we're talking here I can look it up.
<Q - Rod Hall>: Okay.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: But I haven't focused on it.
<Q - Rod Hall>: Yeah. Because it's been a big fluctuation last year, so I just wanted to make sure that – just
understand if it was likely to do that again this year from a modeling point of view. And then on OpEx, the OpEx
numbers were a little higher than we had modeled. Maybe we just mis-modeled it in July. But just wanted to
understand in the October guidance what you're thinking in terms of operating margins and OpEx.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: I'm sorry. Can you say that again?
<Q - Rod Hall>: I was just wondering on the October guidance, if you could talk a little bit about what you're thinking
in terms of operating margins and OpEx and what some of the drivers of that might be.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So, the big drivers off of normal sequential performance from Q3 to Q4 is basically the
units that we expect to be able to place. We have made great progress in our Printing business on our cost structure.
And that is enabling us to go into the market and find opportunities that used to be negative NPV opportunities that are
now positive NPV opportunities, and we expect to take advantage of those opportunities. That's the biggest reason for
not being in normal sequential. The other is that we do have commodity cost increases that we see in Personal Systems.
We don't guide at a OpEx or an operating profit level.
<Q - Rod Hall>: Okay. Since I missed the first one, Cathie, could I just ask you to comment a little bit on how far out
you're hedged on commodities? Are you guys pretty well hedged looking forward? Or will you have to add to
inventory over time to protect yourself from commodity prices in the future?

<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: We are fairly well hedged in the sense that we have a fair amount of inventory, strategic
buy inventory, but that's never for multiple quarters or has never been for multiple quarters. And so we will absolutely
face increasing commodity cost both in Q4 to some extent and into 2018.

And the last question will be from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Hey, Cathie, just going back to the normalized a
little bit, the free cash flow question from before, your comments around sort of normalized not being applicable today
as it used to be. Do you feel that maybe with what's going on in sort of higher-quality supplies and ongoing traction in
PCs that the cash conversion cycle could actually be in the process of redefining itself? And if you think that maybe it
is, how would you like us to kind of think about that? Thanks.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: I don't really think of the cash conversion cycle as redefining itself so, this quarter, very
pleased with the performance. We had a cash conversion cycle of minus 35 days, which was 5 days better sequentially.
But as I mentioned, that was really driven by the incredible strength and sequential performance of the Personal
Systems business.
Because the Personal Systems business had such a negative cash conversion cycle, that when its growth increases
sequentially, you're going to see a fair amount of free cash flow. Similarly, if the growth is less in the following – in the
next quarter sequentially, you're actually going to see a little bit of a reduction in free cash flow. What we expect for
this year is that we would do at least $3 billion in free cash flow, so making great progress on free cash flow. And that
our cash conversion cycle would likely end the year at a minus 29 days, kind of in line with FY 2016's exit, and I think
of that more as kind of the range that I would be modeling over the longer term.
Dion J. Weisler
So, I'd like to thank everybody for taking the time to join us today. The key takeaways I'd love you to leave the call
with is the following. We stabilized revenue a quarter earlier than we expected. We posted double-digit total revenue
growth in the quarter. We've delivered non-GAAP EPS at the high end of our outlook range, and we generated $1.7
billion in free cash flow. We have growth across all segments and regions, and sustained success across the three time
horizons of our core growth and future pillars. And that's really important in that we're delivering for today, but
providing real opportunity for long-term growth into the future.
Every day, we wake up knowing that we need to amaze our customers and partners with the most competitive
disruptive portfolios; job number one for us. Very proud of the outstanding execution of the strategy from the team, and
believe that our very best days still lie ahead of us. I look forward to seeing you all at SAM on Thursday, October 12 in
Palo Alto. Thanks very much for your time.
