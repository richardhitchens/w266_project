Before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our
executives include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our
expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those factors identified in the
release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations may also include certain
non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliations of these measurements is provided on our website.
Now, let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.
Francis S. Blake
Thank you, Diane.
And I'd like to start by saying our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been stricken by the violent storms in
Oklahoma and throughout the Southwest. Our company and our associates are part of these communities, and we'll be
working hard to be of help in the days and weeks ahead.
Now, on our results. Sales for the first quarter were $19.1 billion, up 7.4% from last year. Comp sales were positive
4.3%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.83. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 4.8%.
All three of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps for the quarter. For our Northern division, in particular, this was a
significant accomplishment, given the dramatic difference between the unusually warm spring of 2012 and the
relatively cold spring of 2013. Our Western division was our best performing division, driven by double-digit positive
comps in most of the major markets in California. Our Florida markets also performed well, with comps above the
company average.
Internationally, our Canadian business had positive comps for the sixth quarter in a row, and our Mexican business had
another quarter of positive comps, making it 38 quarters in a row of positive comp growth.
As Craig will detail, while weather negatively impacted our seasonal and exterior businesses, our core interior project
business remained strong throughout the quarter. This was encouraging and consistent with the view that the housing
market is starting on the path to recovery.
For the first time in the last several years, the growth rate in our Pro customer segment outpaced the growth rate in the
consumer segment. We've been tracking the relative growth rates of our Pro and consumer segments as one indicator of
the housing recovery. Since 2008, our Pro segment has under-performed our consumer segment. Last year, the relative
growth rates drew closer and in the fourth quarter of 2012, they grew at approximately the same pace.
Our expectation was that the Pro business would accelerate during a housing recovery, and so this quarter's
outperformance from the Pro segment is a positive sign. Some of the outperformance was due to the slower growth in
our consumer-oriented garden business, but even adjusting for that, the Pro segment had a higher growth rate.
Also, our smaller-spend Pro customers contributed more significantly to the overall Pro growth than in the last few
years. Our expectation was that we'd see improved performance in the smaller-spend pros as the housing market
recovers, so this is another positive sign.
Our services business had double-digit growth in the quarter, and we're pleased with the integration of MeasureComp
and U.S. Home Systems, our two recent services-related acquisitions. Marvin and his team have been able to improve
the customer experience both in the home and in the store by bringing these businesses directly into Home Depot.
As part of our interconnected retail strategy, we have completed the rollout of Buy Online, Ship to Store. This required
an effort across our business from supply chain, to merchandising, to online, to IT and store operations. Our customers
now have access to over 300,000 items available for pickup at their convenience in our stores. So far, the growth we've
seen from this has been ahead of our expectations, and one out of five customers who pick up an order at the store also
buys an additional item while there.

We also continued our efforts to improve the overall Dot Com experience for our customers. We simplified our
checkout process for fresh landing pages and integrated e-receipt into the site, among other key activities. We're
pleased that the online traffic to our site was up almost 50%, and as part of that, not surprisingly, mobile traffic more
than doubled.
The U.S. macro data on housing continues to improve. Private fixed residential investment as a percent of GDP picked
up for the sixth consecutive quarter to 2.7%. Increasing household formation, price appreciation, and higher housing
turnover are all positives for our market, but credit availability remains tight and constrains the velocity of the recovery.
Last year at our investors and analysts conference, we set out a framework for thinking about the recovery of the
housing market and the impact the recovery would have on us. In 2010 and 2011, we went through a period when our
sales were growing but the housing market was still down or at best, stabilizing. Our sales performance correlated most
directly to overall GDP.
Last year, we had an additional modest assist from housing as the market started to improve. We saw that carry through
in this past quarter, somewhat stronger than we anticipated, after adjusting for weather impacts. As Carol will discuss
in more detail, we are therefore revising upwards both our sales and earnings guidance for the year. We remain focused
on taking care of our customers and investing in our business and in our associates. I'd like to thank our associates for
their hard work and dedication.
Based on this quarter's results, roughly 98% of our stores would be in Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for
our hourly associates. Last year, we had 100% of our U.S. stores make Success Sharing. Our objective is to accomplish
that again this year.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Craig.
Craig A. Menear
Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone.
We are pleased with our performance in the first quarter, with strength in our business across the breadth of the store.
We had positive comps in all departments except our indoor and outdoor garden departments. The departments that
outperformed the company's average comp were kitchens, lumber, tools, plumbing, décor, electrical, bath, flooring,
lighting, and hardware. Paint, millwork, and building materials performed positively while comp sales in indoor and
outdoor garden were negative.
Spring arrived at various times across the country and we were ready when it broke. In the Western division where
weather was more normal, we had positive performance in all departments throughout the quarter. In contrast, in the
Northern and Southern divisions where weather was significantly colder than a year ago, spring gardening and outdoor
entertaining categories posted negative comps in February and March. But as the weather improved in April, our
nimble supply chain and partnership with our store operations and field merchandising teams reacted quickly and
maximized demand spikes. By taking advantage of these moments of opportunity, we were able to post positive
performance in our garden business across all divisions in April.
Inside the home, we continue to gain momentum in simple décor. In flooring, customer response to our soft spring
carpet, new floor tiles and fusion grout helped drive department comp above the company average. In bath, our lineup
of Moen and Delta foundation faucets, as well as new vanities from Glacier Bay were the drivers of our performance.
We continue to see strong results in lighting as customers transitioned to LED bulbs and wall fixtures.
In maintenance and repair categories, we continue to see strength with comps above the company average in wiring
devices, safety and security, plumbing repair, pipe and fitting, tools, hand tools, power tool accessories, cleaning and
door locks.

Total comp transactions grew by 0.1% for the quarter, overcoming significant downward pressure from our seasonal
business. Transactions for tickets under $50 representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were down 1.6% for the
first quarter, principally due to our garden business. In contrast, in the month of April, we were able to drive positive
transactions, including tickets under $50. Transactions for tickets over $900 also representing approximately 20% of
our U.S. sales, were up 9.7% in the first quarter. Average ticket increased 5% in the first quarter. The drivers behind
our average ticket growth were the strength in appliances as well as continued improvement from our Pro business. Our
average ticket increase was also impacted somewhat by commodity price inflation, mainly from lumber and copper,
which contributed approximately 120 basis points to comp.
Now, let me turn our attention to the second quarter. We're introducing new technology in paint from Behr with our
new line of marquee exterior paint and primer. This new paint creates a tough, non-stick surface that resists dirt and
offers advanced paint performance for longer-lasting color, all backed by a lifetime guarantee. Our exclusive marquee
paint resists rain showers as early as 60 minutes after application and can be applied in lower temperatures, which are
great features for our Pro customer. Also in paint for our professional customer, we're introducing new paints sprayers
from Greco.
We have an incredible lineup of great values and special buys as well as innovative products for Memorial Day. We are
introducing the first battery-powered trimmer that converts to a corded trimmer so that you never run out of power
from Ryobi. In-store now, we have the Pennington Smart Feed Sprayer System without measuring, pouring or mixing,
this system delivers even-feeding every time and puts out more nutrients than competing products while using less
water.
For our Father's Day and 4th of July events, we also have an extensive lineup of great values and special buys. These
events, along with our superior execution in the stores, will generate a lot of excitement in the second quarter.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.
Carol B. Tomé
Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone.
In the first quarter, sales were $19.1 billion, a 7.4% increase from last year. As you will recall, fiscal 2012 had a 53rd
week, which shifted our fiscal 2013 calendar. By starting fiscal 2013 one week later than last year, we had an additional
week of spring sales. The calendar shift contributed approximately 320 basis points of year-over-year sales growth. On
a like-for-like basis, comps or same-store sales were positive 4.3% for the quarter with positive comps of 4.6% in
February, negative 3.5% in March, and positive 9.9% in April.
Comps for U.S. stores were positive 4.8% for the quarter, with positive comps of 4.8% in February, negative 3% in
March, and positive 10.8% in April. The monthly variation in our comps was due primarily to weather, which impacted
our garden department as well as the timing of Easter. As Craig mentioned, every department, with the exception of our
garden department, reported a positive comp in the quarter.
Sales related to Hurricane Sandy were approximately $145 million in the second quarter, $30 million higher than the
storm sales we realized from Hurricane Irene in the same period last year. As the rebuilding continues, we believe we
will see some additional storm-related sales in the second quarter.
Our total company gross margin was 34.9% for the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points from last year. This gross
margin expansion came from our U.S. business and can be attributed to the following. First, our shrink efforts are
gaining traction. As we realized 11 basis points of gross margin expansion due to better shrink performance than one
year ago. Second, we experienced approximately 20 basis points of gross margin expansion due to the impact of
recently acquired businesses, which are gross margin accretive. And third, we experienced approximately 10 basis
points of gross margin contraction due to a change in mix of products sold. For the year, we continue to expect
moderate gross margin expansion.

In the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 112 basis points to 24%. Total operating
expenses grew at a factor of 35% of our sales growth, better than our original guidance, due principally to the sales
environment. Interest and other expense was $161 million for the first quarter, an increase of $77 million over the same
period last year due to the following factors. First, in the first quarter of 2012, we had a $67 million benefit arising from
the termination of a third-party loan guarantee that did not repeat in 2013. And second, our net interest expense was
$10 million higher than last year due, for the most part, to interest associated with $2 billion of incremental debt issued
in April of 2013.
Our income tax provision rate was 36.6% in the first quarter, and we expect our income tax provision rate to be
approximately 37% for the year. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.83, an increase of 22.1% from
last year.
Moving to our operational metrics, during the first quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico for an ending store
count of 2,257. At the end of the first quarter, selling square footage was 235 million, and total sales per square foot for
the first quarter were $328, up 7.8% from last year.
Now, turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $11.8 billion, up approximately 2% from a
year ago. Inventory turns were 4.4 times, up from 4.3 times last year. We ended the quarter with $44.2 billion in assets,
including $4.3 billion in cash. In the first quarter, we repurchased $2.1 billion or approximately 27.2 million shares of
outstanding stock, including 9.1 million shares through open-market repurchases and 18.1 million shares through an
accelerated share repurchase program. The shares acquired under the accelerated share repurchase program are an
initial calculation. The final number of shares repurchased will be determined upon completion of the program in the
second quarter.
In April, we issued $2 billion of long-term debt at a record low blended coupon of 3.45%. At the end of the quarter, our
adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio was 1.8 times against a target of two times, giving us approximately $2 billion in
additional borrowing capacity. We have no plans to issue incremental debt in the second quarter, but if conditions
warrant, we may look to do so in the back half of the year. Computed on the average of beginning and ending
long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 17.7%, 230 basis points higher
than the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Continued strong performance in the core of the store drove first quarter sales
ahead of our plan. Further, we know that some garden sales that were deferred in the first quarter will be realized in the
second quarter.
Finally, while the forecast for GDP growth in the U.S. hasn't changed materially, housing continues to recover. Today,
we are lifting our 2013 sales and earnings per share growth guidance, reflecting our first quarter outperformance and
our forecast for the second quarter where we are projecting sales and earnings to be higher than what we originally
planned. Because of this early in the year, we are not changing our forecast for the back half of the year.
As a result, we now expect fiscal 2013 sales to increase by approximately 2.8%, with positive comps on a 52-week
like-for-like basis of approximately 4%. Given our updated sales growth guidance, we now expect expenses to grow at
30% of our sales growth rate on a 52-week basis. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We
now project fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share to increase approximately 17% to $3.52. This earnings per share
guidance includes the $2.1 billion of share purchases completed in the first quarter and our intent to repurchase an
additional $4.4 billion in shares over the course of the year.
So we thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Mary, we are now ready for questions.

<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Hi. Good morning. I guess first question, Carol, I think it was a couple of years ago you had
mentioned an REO turnkey program for banks on the foreclosure side, and I think that business is probably still
growing, and you've got an emergence of single-family rental companies out there as well that are going to be a little
bit more institutionalized and maybe national. Can you just talk big picture, kind of what that program looks like today
and how you guys are thinking about maybe agreements that could get you into the maintenance side on the
single-family part of the business on the rental side?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, I'll start and then, Marvin, maybe you want to kick in. We're pleased with this business.
On a relative basis, Dennis, it's pretty small for us, but we are seeing nice growth, and we will continue to use our
services organization to expand this across the country.
What we're more excited about actually is what Frank commented on is the strength in our Pro business. And REO
would not be inside of that Pro business necessarily, but we're really excited in that regard. Marvin, any color you want
to add?
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: Dennis, the only thing I'll add is as you know, the business is shifting from traditional
foreclosures with banks to private equity funds going in purchasing up groups of properties. So we're shifting and
adjusting, but I think Carol's point is most important. This is a small business; it's something that we're very interested
in. We think that we have unique competencies with our Pro business, with the products that we sell, and our key is
really two things: leveraging our GC network that we have because we are in the services businesses and the Pro
business, but also leveraging product pull through. We want those customers to come to our stores to buy products and
those products to be the fixtures, the faucets, the plumbing, supplies, et cetera, that we put in those homes from a
remodel and from a maintenance standpoint. So, so far, so good, but it is a relatively small business.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Roughly how big would that be today?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We haven't disclosed that, Dennis.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Okay. Second question, as you talked about double-digit comps in California for the quarter,
can you maybe go into a little bit of detail as far as categories that you see driving that performance and then maybe,
Frank, just big picture how you think about that maybe being a leading indicator to other parts of the country as home
price inflation gains momentum as well?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Well, let me take the latter first, Dennis. I mean what we've seen over the last several quarters
is some of our most hard-hit markets, the markets that were really ground zero of the housing collapse recover. And
that's California, Florida, moving into Arizona, now even Las Vegas and Nevada. So it's really part of how badly those
markets suffered previously and now starting to return to more normal performance. I'd let Craig and Marvin comment,
but I am not aware of any particular differences in terms of what's being sold in those markets. We're really selling
across the store there.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yeah, it really is broad-based when you look at virtually every department we have. All
posted positive growth in the California area. So we're very, very pleased that it's a broad-based sales pattern.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: There's that saying, a rising tide lifts all boats. The entire business is lifting.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Correct.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Pretty bullish. Thanks, guys.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Gary J. Balter>: Thank you. Just two questions. One is could you talk about – you did – you've been doing these
different tests with PayPal and other ways of servicing the customer from a payment point of view. Could you discuss

where you're going with that and what's been the results of some of the tests and what are you rolling out, et cetera?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, on the PayPal front, we are very pleased with the year-over-year performance. It actually
doubled in penetration, but, Gary, it's very, very small. We brought PayPal into our business because our customers
wanted to use that as a form of tender, and so we're delighted to have the relationship with them.
As we look ahead, we've got our eyes wide open as to what may be available to retailers from a mobile wallet
perspective, and there are a number of things that are being talked about, as you know. There's a consortium of
retailers, we are not part of that consortium but we are watching what they're doing. That's MCX. We're watching what
they're doing.
Obviously, we're watching what Google is doing. There was an announcement today about Google. So we're eyes wide
open, we want to be with where the customer is going. We don't necessarily want to lead the way.
<Q - Gary J. Balter>: Okay. And Lowe's being part of that consortium doesn't really impact your decisions, right?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Eyes wide open. We want to do the right thing for our customers.
<Q - Gary J. Balter>: Okay. And second question, your productivity now, assuming the calculation, at least, is about
$326 per square foot. You [ph] pay out (25:15) about $100 higher back in the good old days. And just comping in the
high singles, you're going to get near there. As you look at your staffing in the stores and the way the store is set now,
do you have – do you feel like you could – the capacity is fine for getting up to those levels or do you feel that maybe
you'll start stretching your stores again and you have to start changing the way you come to market a little bit?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, it really depends on the nature of the sales growth. As you know, we forecast sales
growth as 50% coming from transactions, 50% coming from ticket growth. As you saw in the first quarter, our growth
came from ticket growth. That has an impact on our staffing model because it's an activity-based staffing model. But,
Marvin, you've got tons of flexibility to do what you need to do to serve the customer.
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: Gary, we do, in fact, if you go back to the whole 60/40 initiative, over the last four years,
we've reinvested roughly 500 hours per store per week back to the stores for service and that's a reallocation, not an
incremental add. So that's really allowed us to continue to sustain a service level while making sure that we respond to
the needs of the business.
But I think Carol's point is very key and that is we have an activity-based system, driven by transactions and ticket. So
where sales are picking up, our staffing has increased. We think we will be in a perfect position to keep up with the
trends. We work hand in hand with Craig's team. So as we forecast events, new product introductions, we will adjust
our staffing to make sure we have customers served in a most appropriate way. So we feel really good about the future
and how we can keep up with the business.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Gary, the one other point that I'd add to that on the store, we're pleased with the size of our
store, we don't see a need to substantially remodel our stores or expand them. But one thing that we're dealing with
between Marvin and our supply chain team is Buy Online Pickup In Store as – and Buy Online Ship To Store. And Buy
Online Ship To Store particularly that we've had some pretty good customer interest in that and so we're thinking about
how do we segment parts of the store to more efficiently serve that customer who's coming in and has bought online
and just wants to pick it up in the store. So Marvin and his team are working on, gee, what would we do with the store
layout but that's a slight alteration, it's not a remodel.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Here's a really interesting statistic. If you look at the first quarter, 22% of the sales based online
were actually picked up in the store and 10% of those were BOSS related: Buy Online Ship To Store related, isn't that
interesting?
<Q - Gary J. Balter>: Thank you very much.

And we'll take our next question from Aram Rubinson [Nomura Securities International, Inc.].
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Hi, Aram.
<Q - Aram Rubinson>: Hi. Good morning. A question about traffic and ticket. I see the quarter's entire comp, as you
said, came from ticket. There were a number of factors though that might have influenced that such as the extra – the
week shift and the weather and other things. Can you help us disaggregate some of those factors? Trying to get a sense
of how the underlying traffic is on a reported basis. Underlying traffic on a comp basis was slightly negative. So was
just trying to get a little context around that.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, I can start and then Craig, you can add some color. Our comp transactions, as Craig
pointed out, were up 0.1%, and that's a good number given how we are so heavily penetrated in garden in the first
quarter. Our garden business makes up 18% of our total sales. If you look at our comp average ticket, it was up 4.2%
year-on-year and if you look at the drivers, it was across all categories. As Craig pointed out, we had about 120 basis
points coming from commodity inflation. We had about 70 basis points of growth coming from appliances, so our
appliance business is growing quite nicely and then the rest is across all categories. Craig, you want to give some more
color?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yes, just to reiterate, when we got into April and actually began to see a more normalized
weather pattern, we were able to actually drive the transaction growth in the company, and with the garden businesses
kicking in and getting into positive growth in the month of April, it significantly helped that, including the lower ticket
categories, which grew as well.
<Q - Aram Rubinson>: So usually in a cyclical rebound we see ticket lead the comp. Is that just part of what we're
seeing naturally? Or do you expect the traffic to kind of be balanced with the ticket in the year ahead?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, we would expect the traffic to come back in the second quarter, of course, because the
sales that we didn't get in the first quarter have not been lost. As we look at our garden sales, you recall last year, we
had a really warm first quarter. So we pull forward about $160 million of garden sales into the first quarter last year.
This year, we estimate we lost about $188 million of garden sales. But it's not lost forever...
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Correct, correct.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: ...maybe some of it's lost. But we're going to get the majority of that back in the second quarter
and with that comes people.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I think the other factor when you think about the growth in ticket as we called out over $900
being up 9.7%, the improvement in the Pro business is also a factor there.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yeah.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: That's helping to drive that higher ticket. While we're not back to historical norms, we're
seeing improvement in terms of unit productivity in the number of items in a basket with our Pro customer, and so
that's encouraging for us as well.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yeah.
<Q - Aram Rubinson>: That's great. All right, thanks for that thoughtful reply.

<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: I was wondering if you could just give us your best thoughts on what the – when the seasonal
shifts will occur with – let's just say the week shift that occurred in Q1, how that plays out across the rest of the year.
And then my second question was just regarding competition, both online and on land, how that's looking these days?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Sure. So let's talk about the seasonal shift. And I'm going to do it on a comp basis. So for the
first quarter, we told you that the seasonal shift was 320 basis points on a comp basis, in terms of dollars that was $554
million. Looking at the second quarter, we will actually have a lower comp basis, and it will be lower by about $300
million.
So if you think about what that means, our comps will be higher in the second quarter than our total sales growth. And
looking to the third quarter, there shouldn't be any meaningful difference in the comp basis. And then finally, in the
fourth quarter, our comp basis should decline by about $100 million. You can call that pretty flat. So hopefully that's
helpful.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: And as far as the competition, really it's still there. We have plenty out there. Kind of haven't
seen anything dramatically different in the last quarter, but clearly it's a – we monitor what's happening in the
marketplace, and then adjust according to what we see happening.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Great. Thanks.

And we'll take our next question from David Gober with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David Gober>: Good morning, guys. Craig, I was just wondering if you could touch a little bit on some of the
merchandising initiatives, particularly on the localization front, as you ramp into the busy part of the year. Any kind of
update on what you're seeing there and how you're expecting that to impact the business? Whether that would be
contributing to ticket or traffic?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yeah, David, we have – as you know, we've put tools in place to assist our merchants in
assorting. We are working on actually delivering enhancements to those capabilities right now.
We have been developing clusters, so working to do a better job of assorting locally. Probably an example of that
would be adjustments in floor-tile mix.
And we had pretty nice performance. So we believe that by working with our field merchandising team in conjunction
with the merchants here in Atlanta, that those kind of adjustments are paying off for us, and seeing it in the
performance.
<Q - David Gober>: And maybe just a follow-up on the appliance business. I know Carol mentioned that, that
continues to be strong. It seemed like in the fourth quarter that was a big call-out, as you guys expanded a couple of
relationships with vendors. Are you still seeing momentum there? And as you continue to roll that out, are you seeing
the impact across the store? Is it more localized to the appliance section?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: First of all, let me start. We are pleased with the performance that we're seeing in the
appliance business. As Carol called out, it contributed about 70 basis points of comp in the quarter. Our customers are
responding to the expanded offering.
We completed the initial rollout of our expanded store base, which was 120 stores at the end of last year, and we are
moving forward, as we called out last quarter, with an additional 120 stores.
The appliance business is an interesting business. It's highly repair-oriented. A lot of appliances break every day in the
country. So we do see that as a big repair business. It also does complete the kitchen. So there's an opportunity on both
sides.
<Q - David Gober>: Got you. Thanks.

And we'll take our next question from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Thanks, and good morning. Carol, I believe you mentioned 18% of sales is historically –
you said garden in the first quarter. What was that this year? How does that compare to 2Q?
And perhaps can you expand that bucket? How much would you say is seasonal and outdoor broadly historically in the
first and second quarter, including things like grills, and patio furniture, and outdoor paint, and all the outdoor
activities?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, the 18% number that I shared with you is the penetration this year. And as we pointed out
that our comps were negative, so obviously the penetration was higher last year, slightly higher.
And, Craig, you might want to talk about how we've categorized -
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yeah. In terms of outdoor kind of categories in total, as we look at it, generally in Q1, that
represents about 30% of our business, and it grows to about 35% of our business in Q2.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: And then – okay. And so I will assume last year, that was a lot higher in the first quarter. Is
it 200 basis points, 300 basis points higher – the flip year-to-year? Or is it something smaller?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, if you just want to give us a second, we can tell you. So the penetration has changed
about 200 basis points year-on-year.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: 200 bps year-to-year. Okay.
So you're raising the guidance for the – you're just raising – assuming that the seasonal business shifts into the second
quarter from the first – I think the $180 million that you mentioned that you missed this year, that's about 90 basis
points.
I mean should we look at the 2Q outlook on a stack basis, or are we just going to sort of assume that the 4.8%
domestically, and I get the 90 bps back of that garden business shifting? Or another 200 basis points from the seasonal
shift – total outdoor seasonal shift?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, let me share with you how we're thinking about it.
The guidance that we've given today, the lift from 2% to 2.8% – or on a comp basis 3% to 4% – equates to about $800
million more in sales than we originally planned. Of that $800 million, about $340 million was recognized in the first
quarter. So the balance, we believe, will come in the second quarter.
And we get there the following way. First, is recovery of garden, and we won't recover everything we lost but we will
recover the majority.
We also believe that we'll have additional sales from Sandy. And these will all be incremental sales. We're projecting
$80 million from Sandy. And I will tell you that it's a projection. Don't really know.
And then the rest will come from strength across the core of the business.
It's May 21. Our sales thus far in the month are great. So we feel very comfortable with the guidance that we've given.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Thanks very much.

<Q - Michael Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I actually have two.
First, it's on the flow of credit to consumers. How are you viewing that dynamic within the broader macro environment
as influencing your sales? Is that starting to happen, which is a driver? Or do you expect that that is still on the horizon
that will happen down the road? And I have a follow-up.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: So, Michael, the question is on consumer credit?
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Yes, is it starting to flow? And we saw in the fourth quarter home-equity lines were still down
year-over-year. What do you think is fostering all this good growth that you're seeing?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, interestingly, we did see improved penetration on our private-label cards in the quarter.
The penetration increased 119 basis points to 22.9%. And if we look by category where we saw that growth, it was
driven by our kitchen department, our millwork department, and our plumbing department, some of our strongest
year-over-year growth departments. So that's good news.
I will tell you, our approval rates continue to decline, principally because people are coming off the sidelines with
lower FICO scores, and they're not being qualified. So our approval rates are about 65%, down from last year slightly.
The average FICO score being approved is 710 with an average credit line of $5,800.
The other interesting statistic is that for our existing customers, they are only about 27% utilized on their credit. So
consumers continue to be pretty cautious with credit.
Same thing holds true for Pro. Our Pro approval rates are about 70%. Bit of a higher line there of $6,800, but only 20%
utilized.
Now, on the consumer side, as you know, the ability to pay or the CARD Act really negatively impacted approvals.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau came out with some changes recently, which we think will help approval
rates. We think it will help grow our approval rates by 100 basis points more or less. So that's good news.
This is my long answer to your question – that much like the housing market beginning to recover, the consumer and
credit availability is beginning to recover, but it's not recovered.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: And it sounds like you're doing your part to contribute to the freer-flow of credit to the
consumer.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes, we are.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: And my second question is, as the housing recovery continues, the profitability of the supply
chain should improve – of the entire home improvement supply chain should improve as capacity utilization rates rise.
Are you starting to see evidence that you're benefiting from that, in whatever capacity you think you might?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, as you know, we've given guidance through 2015, which suggests we will get about 20
basis points of benefit from our supply chain by 2015. Didn't see that in the first quarter, but that's just because of the
nature of the -
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Seasonal.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: – seasonal business and the spiky sales. And our supply chain did a great job in the first quarter.
But longer-term, we should enjoy far more benefits.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: So I wasn't necessarily talking about your supply chain. Sorry for the confusion. I was talking
about your vendors becoming more profitable, such that you would start to participate in their improved profitability.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Certainly, when you can put throughput through the factories, that improves overall
profitability. And we do have agreements in place with our suppliers where, as we drive productivity for them, we
share in that productivity, and obviously can deliver greater value for our customers, as well.

And we'll take our next question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot, and good morning.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: You spoke about the strength in your commercial business, and you attributed that in part
to macro dynamics, which clearly are working in your favor. What – when we've been talking to Pros over the past
month about the power center channel supplied to them, Home Depot often stands out as taking more aggressive action
and making incremental – having incremental impact.
So is it possible to try to disaggregate, you think, the contributions of your own changes – and you might talk about any
ones that are new or different – are making a big difference – versus that of the market in driving that Pro business
above the consumer business here in the first quarter?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: So, Matt, first off, I'll ask Marvin to address some of the actions we've taken in the store to
better serve our Pros.
But I'd just say generally, it's tough for us to measure share, period. It is really hard for us to measure share with the
pro, because the pro shops across so many different channels. There are so many different kinds of Pros in our stores.
So we really don't have a good read-through into to what extent do our pro numbers reflect some possible share gain
versus the market.
Since we've started – for several years now, we've had a notional theory of what we'd see in the housing recovery, and
since we're seeing that play out with our pro numbers, we're more inclined to think of that as a more general market
recovery.
But we have done – and thank you for noting, we have done some things that are very focused on this customer
segment in the store, and maybe, Marvin, your comment on some of those.
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: Sure. Matt, we really took advantage of the downturn. We had processes and our focus was
really not that good, to be quite candid, and so when the market was depressed, we decided to invest in a couple of
things.
Number one, we had a very distinct focus on what we do in the store and what we do outside of the store. In the store
was primarily for our smaller Pros. Outside of the store was for Pros that typically would not venture into Home Depot
because of the nature of their business.
And in the store, we focused on speed and convenience. We put in dedicated cashiers for the Pros. We put in dedicated
loading. We created Pro power hours where we eliminated tasking and we wanted service focus for specific times of
the day, and we really made a really consistent focus on speed. We leveraged the mobile point-of-sale to help Pros
accelerate their transactions.
Then we shifted outside of the store. We put in a sales force designed specifically to go to the Pros, the larger Pros, and
to make sales calls, talking about the features and benefits of working and buying from The Home Depot.
We work with Craig's team to improve the bid room process. It would take, in the past, days to get a bid back. We
turned it into minutes.
We continued to listen to Pros and just made the necessary changes. And what we hoped is that when the market started
to improve, that the investments in training and service that we put in place would benefit us.

It's still very early. We still have a lot of work to do. And to Frank's point, it's difficult to measure market share, but we
have to believe that all of the dedicated focus over the last two years may be giving us a disproportionate benefit as the
market improves.

And we'll take our next question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Good morning.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Good morning.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: First question, I just wanted to follow on Matt's question on the Pro a bit, but you called out the
strength you have seen in the Pro business here, and clearly, as you said, it's been a big focus for Home Depot.
But you're connecting better with those customers now. You're following the data better. Is there – as you look at the
buying patterns now – with all that's going on in the macro environment, it is not surprising Pro is picking up – but are
you seeing something in your data to suggest we really do have a sustainable trend here now for Home Depot in this
Pro business, more than we've seen in the past?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: So I'd say, Brian, this is – interestingly, this is the first quarter that the Pro segment sales have
outpaced our Consumer segment sales. So we are, I think, appropriately cautious about drawing broader
generalizations. As Carol said, we raised our guidance thinking through what's going to – what we think is going to
play out in the second quarter. And we're just – I would say it's a bit early from this quarter to say, boy, this is
sustaining. We do like the trend over the last – I mean definitely the trend has been a positive trend.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: It might be helpful to share with you the top 10 Pro classes to the question of, well, what are
they buying.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Yeah.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: It includes plywood, gypsum, dimensional lumber, pipe fittings, floor and wall tile, tile set
moldings, interior paint, studs and light bulbs. That's pretty core to the Pro customer.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Right.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: And, Brian, the only thing I'll add is when you talk about large Pro, which we defined as over
$10,000 in annual spend and the smaller Pro, the smaller Pro is improving, and that's a good sign, as Frank noted
earlier, and what we're hearing from the Pros is a very simple definition as to why. A lot of the smaller Pros basically
shut their businesses down and started to work for the larger Pros. And so now as the business and the market
improves, there are more jobs available and a lot of smaller Pros are venturing out again to open up their shops. And
they're back in business. But it's very early. But the trend is positive. We just hope that it sustains.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe just a shorter question on – a lot of us are focused here
on seasonal sales because it's key this time of year and there has been a lot of shifts with the weather and such, but is
there a way that you could look at your business and say, okay, despite all these weather shifts we've had in 2013
versus 2012, seasonal sales are actually better this year or are they the same as last year? Is there some way to look at it
like that?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Sort of a weather-adjusted seasonal sale metric, we really don't. We really don't have that.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Okay.

<A - Francis S. Blake>: That would be a difficult one to come up with.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I think what we do, do is we look at this really on a half basis.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Yeah.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: And we try to take into account both quarters combined to eliminate the shifting noise, if you
will, from year-to-year. And we look at multi-year penetrations by category, by week. And this is why, as Carol said,
we feel like we've got an opportunity to gain most of those sales in Q2. You may have some categories like
pre-emergent that we may not get it all back. But we feel pretty confident that we'll get the majority of it.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Well, thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hey, guys. Thanks. What do you guys make of the recent decline in lumber prices? What do
you think is driving that and just getting to your outlook for inflation over the balance of the year? What are you guys
thinking on that front?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: The lumber pricing has been interesting for the year. I think output in Q1 from the industry
was up double-digit in the U.S. as well as up high single digit from Canada. So I'm sure that has a factor on driving the
overall pricing in the market. It's still up significantly year-over-year, but I think that's probably a factor to the recent
declines.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And we plan on a commodity-neutral basis.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Right.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: So as you know, we haven't lifted the back half of the year for anything that might happen with
prices up or down.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Right.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, thanks. And then diving a little bit more into that Pro – some of the Pro questions here.
Any indication in some of the categories, things like jobsite tools, windows, things like that, are they starting to show
any kind of an uptick or is that still on the come?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean we look at Pro categories, Carol called out the top 10. We're seeing growth in those
businesses. And we saw growth in the first quarter, obviously versus the fourth quarter, which you would expect to see
some based on just seasonal. So we're encouraged by the growth across those categories.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Thanks. And then just one last one. When spring arrives as it did last year, I mean when does
it typically peak? I mean are we seeing the peak now, does the peak occur kind of as you get into June? Just trying to
understand how long the spring season goes when it arrives at a similar time as it did this year. Thanks.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: That really varies by area of the country. And as you can imagine, the south peaks several
weeks in advance of the north, but even in that, the peak in any given area can shift up to roughly two weeks, give or
take. So it really does vary by area of the country. In some areas, it can be as early as week 10 and other areas, it can be
as late as 17 or 18.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yeah, based on our month-to-date sales, I would say it hasn't peaked.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Has not. Thank you very much.

And we'll take our next question from Greg Melich with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi. Thanks. I have one follow-up question from before and then a longer-term one. Carol, you
mentioned that May is running great. Which – would you describe April as great as well?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, April was an outstanding month. But I'd also want to bring your attention to the timing of
Easter. Because of where Easter fell this year versus last year, March was – the negative comp was overstated by about
230 basis points, which means the positive comp in April was overstated by about 230 basis points.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Got it. So April was great, not outstanding, if you adjust for Easter? I will leave it at that.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Okay.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: So a more serious question. Your free cash flow guidance you didn't update as part of the
change in your EPS guidance. I think it was around $7 billion. Has that changed particularly given that it seems that
inventory was only up 2% to get the sort of top-line growth. Should we expect more free cash flow leverage or is it still
the same number there?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: No. We've updated our forecast. I didn't call it out because I didn't think it's really material on a
$7 billion number, but it's up maybe $200 million or $300 million.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay. That's great. Thanks.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yep.

And we'll take our next question from Michael Baker with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Mike A. Baker>: Hi, thanks. So one shorter-term, one longer-term question. Shorter-term, just this quarter, can
you tell us the EPS impact of that calendar shift of the $540 million odd?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Sure. The EPS impact was $0.03.
<Q - Mike A. Baker>: Okay. Thank you. And then the longer term, so at least in my model, the last time you were at
an equivalent sales per foot number, your operating margins were 250 points lower than they are now. So as I sort of
start to think out longer term and if you can get back to where sales per foot were pre-recession, is there any reason to
believe that your – that the operating margin shouldn't be that much higher, 200 basis points, 300 basis points, 400
basis points higher than they were last time they peaked?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, as you point out, we have a ton of operating leverage in our business. And by the great
work of the team, in terms of cost out and just driving productivity, it's more productive than it's ever been. We've
guided to a 12% operating margin by 2015. Let us get there and then we'll talk about how much more opportunity...
<Q - Mike A. Baker>: You're going to – well, it looks like you're going to get pretty close by the end of this year,
maybe within 50 basis points? We'll wait for that update.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Very good. Thank you.
<Q - Mike A. Baker>: Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Alan Rifkin with Barclays.
<Q - Alan M. Rifkin>: Thank you very much. With respect to the average ticket, 900 plus, is the composition between
large Pro, small Pro and the DIY similar within that category as the rest of – as the corporate average?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, it's interesting when you look at that average ticket performance, some of the top drivers
of the year-over-year growth were in the appliance category and that's mostly consumer.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: That is mostly consumer.
<Q - Alan M. Rifkin>: Okay. So collectively, I mean compared to three and six months ago, what is your take on the
proclivity for both the Pro customer, large and small as well as the DIY customer to take on some of these larger
projects? Are you seeing clear evidence of that?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean I think we've seen an expansion of the project business, as I called out. We have seen
nice growth from the simple core. So whether that's customer taking on flooring projects or now taking on storage
projects where in the past they might have deferred that, we've begun to see those categories have nice growth in the
business. So we're encouraged by that.
Other drivers to kind of expansion in ticket is also innovation. So things like LED, which drives ticket expansion inside
of a category. Things like lithium technology, which drive expansion in tools now across almost five departments in the
store. All of those have positive influences on the growth of average ticket as well.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And just one thing we are looking at very carefully, and this data comes from CoreLogic, and
that is where homeowners are on a loan-to-value basis. Because once homeowners believe their home is more of an
investment than an expense, we believe the nature of their spending will change. And so this data came out in the
fourth quarter. It suggests those that have negative equity spend maybe $1,000 a year. But those that have 100%
positive equity, or maybe a loan-to-value as much as 49%, they'll spend close to $3,000 a year.
So we are watching with home price appreciation, how households will move into different spending buckets and then
trying to determine what the impact on our business will be. It's a little early, Alan, obviously because this data is just
coming out, but we're really trying to understand what it could mean for our business and the project nature of our
business going forward.
<Q - Alan M. Rifkin>: Okay. Thank you, Carol. One follow-up, if I may, for you. Obviously, California, Florida,
Nevada, Arizona outsized gains. Where are we today in absolute terms with where your stores in those markets are
relative to where we were six years ago when the crisis really began? Are we above those levels in absolute terms at the
store level?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Not yet.
<Q - Alan M. Rifkin>: No?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Not yet, no.
<Q - Alan M. Rifkin>: Any quantification of still how far below you are on an average store revenue basis in those
markets?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: No. Just think about it as of the end of 2012, we still had close to $3 billion of sales to recover
from what we lost during the recession.
<Q - Alan M. Rifkin>: Very interesting. Thank you. Good luck.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Thank you.
<A - Diane Dayhoff>: And, Mary, we have time for one more question.

Okay. And our last question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Good morning.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Obviously, there were some weather challenges that you guys kind of called out already but –
and generally, I think what we have continued to see over the last several quarters is relatively modest improvements in
the smaller ticket sales, but pretty big improvements in bigger ticket sales. I guess my question is how much of that is
due to changing mix on the assortment side and if this trend continues, is that something you continue to adjust in terms
of the mix and assortment of stores in addition to the labor enhancements Marvin's already called out?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean it is certainly a portion of this is driven by the growth in categories like appliances,
which carry a big ticket. But certainly in the first quarter, the smaller ticket was clearly negatively impacted by the lack
of garden sales, which is a massive driver to transactions on smaller ticket. As you can imagine, lots of customers
coming in, buying some bags of dirt and buying live goods and so on, which carry a much smaller ticket.
But as we look at the larger ticket, improvement in penetration in lumber with our Pro customers, one of the top
classes, both plywood, dimensional lumber fallen to that, gypsum, those are businesses where customers in – on the Pro
side are buying multiples, helping to drive the larger ticket, as well as, as we say the appliance business. We've seen
over multiple quarters the hard work that we've put in to things like our kitchen business overall and as well as the
improvement of our services businesses which drive ticket, payoff and help drive the growth in the larger ticket over
the past several quarters. We still feel that it's balanced that we'll be driving both – on an annualized basis both
transactions as well as ticket in our business.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: But is there anything that you've seen in the business to make you think that the trends that
we've seen recently won't continue? I mean it seems like you've been calling out appliances for a while, lumber has
obviously been gaining steam for the last couple of quarters like these tend to be kind of long cycle trends, don't they?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yeah, I think they'll continue to help us grow the larger ticket categories for sure.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.
