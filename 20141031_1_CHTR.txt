Please also note that on July 1, 2013, Charter completed its acquisition of Cablevision's Bresnan Broadband Holdings
LLC and its subsidiaries, also known as Bresnan. Unless otherwise specified, all customer and financial data referred to
on this call are pro forma for the Bresnan transaction as if it had occurred on January 1, 2012. Please also note that all
growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise

Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. With that, I'll turn the
call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Rutledge
Thanks, Stefan. Good morning. Our improving results demonstrate that Charter's strategy is working. We're providing
more value to customers with superior products at competitive prices combined with high-quality service. We continue
to generate more sales, grow market share across all our products and increase revenue per household.
Over the last year, our increasing customer penetration and revenue per customer has translated into growing EBITDA
per home passed. And as we complete our all-digital initiative at the end of this year, we expect our operating and
financial results in our existing footprint to continue to improve.
Our network is now over 80% all-digital, and by the end of the year, we will be delivering a superior HD content
package essentially everywhere we operate. Our video product is delivered in HD on HD sets with interactive guides
and full video-on-demand libraries on every outlet. That superior video product is now available for our customers on
mobile devices inside the home and increasingly outside the home. The lowest Internet speed you can get from Charter
inside our latest offering is 60 megabits per second, faster than what our competitors can provide virtually everywhere.
All of that is bundled together with a fully featured voice product at a $90 price point with no contract, no hidden fees
and taxes. That is the Charter Spectrum brand.
And whether it's Charter's video product in the home or an Internet device, we provide a more valuable product within
a real service infrastructure. Our ability to be a good service operator has also improved significantly despite putting
nearly all of our customers through an all-digital service transaction in the past year. It's not just about competing well
today, but providing a superior product when compared to potential new entrants as well. We're far from done. We
have a full set of products and service enhancements at different stages of development. And we're preparing to apply
the same operating strategy that is succeeding today on a larger base of subscribers for the benefit of Charter's
shareholders and the future shareholders of GreatLand Connections, which includes Charter.
Looking back at the last quarter, our residential customer growth continues to accelerate. During the third quarter, we
added 68,000 new residential customer relationships versus 46,000 last year. And over the last 12 months we've grown
our residential base of customers by 4.9%. We added 94,000 broadband customers versus 86,000 in the prior-year
period. And our third quarter video performance also improved with a reduction in net video losses versus the prior
year. Over the last 12 months, we've grown our expanded video base by 74,000. The total third quarter revenue grew
by 8% versus 5.4% for the same period last year, with residential growth of 6.7% versus 5.1% the last year.
Commercial continued to perform well with revenue growth of 18%, while advertising grew at 16%, which includes
the benefit of political advertising. And adjusted EBITDA grew by 7%. However, our underlying EBITDA growth was
over 8%, and Chris will walk you through that in a moment.
So we are growing market share, developing new products and preparing to integrate a large set of new assets, but our
largest value driver is just being a good service operator and we continue to improve our execution in field operations,
customer care and network operations.
Our simplified product set and higher quality service operation leads to fewer customer transactions, lower costs and
longer customer lives, driving higher market share and better margins. We've invested in simplicity for our customers
and employees, and process improvements to reduce transactional volumes in the business. Whether it's repairs,

repeats, upgrades, downgrades or disconnects, our field operation and customer care units are now properly structured
and organized to provide a better service experience, with in-house employees trained and compensated to our
standards.
It's also about making it more convenient and efficient for our customers to do business with Charter. We've increased
our operating hours, reduced appointment window times, and in the coming months, we'll launch a completely
reengineered online customer portal which will provide a leading modern service experience which adds to our
competitiveness. So I'm very pleased with the operational progress we're making.
Our all-digital initiative which will be complete by yearend is on plan. Slide 5 outlines the volume of customers that we
have migrated to an all-digital platform on a monthly basis since we started all-digital. We also introduced HD Auto
Tune, a feature that auto tunes HD set-top boxes to the HD version of selected channels, and an instant upgrade feature
on our set-top boxes which allows video customers to instantly upgrade their level of video service.
We continue to enhance the value of the Charter TV App designed for tablets and smartphones. We now have over 150
linear channels available in the home and a growing number available outside the home as well. In coming months,
we'll add both VOD streaming and downloadable to-go features, giving our customers the ability to stream or
download content to tablets and smartphones.
Our new cloud-based guide has now been launched to over 25,000 of our Fort Worth customers. Spectrum Guide is
scaling well and working as intended. We will deploy the guide in our retained footprint in 2015. The guide, which will
work across our entire base of set-top boxes, provides a dramatically improved user experience, making content search
and discovery easier and more Internet-like and highlights the quality and large quantity of on-demand assets we offer.
We're also close to launching World Box, a more powerful but less expensive set-top box which relies on
downloadable security. This smaller, more elegant box can be sourced from a broader base of manufacturers.
Customers will have the same search and discovery experience whether they have a legacy box or a World Box, but on
the increment, World Box gives us the ability to do more with a more robust DVR, a DOCSIS 3 modem and it provides
a better box platform and economics for digitizing acquired cable systems.
Which leads us to the update on the Comcast-TWC transactions. We're making good progress on the regulatory
process, long-form documents and the necessary carve-out financial statements and filings. We have the necessary
financing for the TWC portion of the transactions. We remain confident that from a regulatory perspective these
transactions will support the successful close of the Comcast-TWC transaction which we expect in early 2015. We
expect to close our deal about 30 days to 45 days after the Comcast-TWC transaction closes, once the spinoff financing
for GreatLand is complete.
Our transition and integration planning with Comcast and TWC is making good progress, and we remain very pleased
with the deal that we've done. There's a lot of effort involved in transitioning the carved-out assets among the parties
and setting up the service agreements with GreatLand. There's still work to be done, but we remain confident that these
transactions will be transformational for Charter and will bring significant benefits to both our customers and
shareholders.
Finally, while M&A is not a necessity for Charter to be successful, future acquisitions could be added to our
opportunity set. We continue to believe that attractive opportunities may present themselves and we have experienced
transactional and operating teams, and our recent experience with the Bresnan integration and the pending transaction
with Comcast and Time Warner Cable provide a good framework for future activities.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher L. Winfrey
Thanks, Tom. Turning to slide 7 of today's presentation, third quarter residential PSU growth improved by 14,000
compared to the same period last year. We lost 9,000 residential video customers versus a loss of 27,000 last year.

That's an 18,000 improvement. Note that our third quarter residential video customer net adds include approximately
20,000 bulk digital upgrades versus 3,000 a year ago, driven by all-digital activity.
In residential Internet, we added 94,000 customers, up from 86,000 last year, and we added 29,000 residential voice
customers compared to 41,000 last year. Over the last 12 months, our residential customer base has grown by 4.9%,
and third quarter revenue per customer relationship grew by 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher product
sell-in, rate adjustments and higher average dollar step-ups at promotional roll-off. That's partially offset by continued
strong sell-in of single-play Internet relationships.
As slide 9 shows, our accelerating customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in residential revenue
growth of 6.7% year-over-year.
Looking at commercial, we added 5,000 PSUs versus 21,000 last year. And excluding the impact of digitization on our
EBU counts, PSU growth would have been 18,000 this past quarter. Total commercial video billing relationships have
increased slightly since the third quarter of last year. Commercial revenue grew by 18%, driven primarily by small and
medium businesses, and excluding the lower growth hospitality video base, commercial telecom revenue continued to
grow by over 20%.
So turning to expenses and adjusted EBITDA on slide 10, programming expense grew by $67 million, accounting for
about 57% of the increase in total operating expense versus the prior-year quarter. Programming cost grew by 12.1% on
an absolute basis, really driven by four factors: first, contractual rate increases; second, 1.9% growth in our expanded
video customer base, so volume-related, over the last 12 months; and some one-time benefit last year; as well as,
finally, higher penetration of our tiers, broader carriage and the launch of new channels like the SEC Network.
If you look to cost to service customers, which includes field operations, customer care and network operation cost,
these expenses grew by 4% year-over-year, about half of our total revenue growth. And marketing expend increased by
$5 million, up 4% given continued sales channel development and sales activity. All other costs grew by $28 million or
15% year-over-year driven by higher labor cost to support commercial, as well as some additional administrative labor
expense.
In total, adjusted EBITDA grew by $51 million or 7% year-over-year. As Tom mentioned, our third quarter underlying
EBITDA growth was just over 8%, really if you exclude the impact of one-time expense benefits last year relative to
this year, a few million dollars of transition costs for the Comcast transactions, and if you also net out the benefit of
political advertising.
Turning to slide 11, third quarter capital expenditures totaled $569 million. About half of that spending was driven by
CPE to support our all-digital initiative and new customer acquisition. In total, $115 million of our CapEx in the
quarter was directly attributable to our all-digital initiative, with most of that spend inside CPE.
For the full year 2014, we continue to expect approximately $2.2 billion in capital expenditures for the plan we've laid
out, with $500 million of that spend relating to all-digital and our insourcing initiatives.
As I mentioned on our last call, we've approved additional projects and CapEx spend for the M&A transactions, really
as we position the company to serve roughly twice as many customers as we did previously. So whether the $2.2 billion
is inclusive of that activity or we have a rounding difference really won't be known until later in the year. I recognize
people can get a little locked in on rounding differences, so we'll provide the appropriate disclosure at that time.
We ended the quarter with $14.2 billion of debt with a weighted average borrowing cost of 5.6%. And our leverage
ratio was 4.6 times on an LTM basis but lower on an LQA basis. Note that those figures exclude recent financings for
the transactions which I'll discuss in a moment. So that covers our normal third quarter operating and financial
performance.
As Tom mentioned, we remain focused on planning the integration activities for the announced transactions and from a
financial perspective, we recently completed the 2013 audited carve-out financial statements for each of the pieces of
the transaction. And today's presentation includes a few slides in the appendix which provide those updated operating
and financial data.

On slide 13, you can see the estimated purchase price for the TWC asset exchange and sale. It's come down from $8.4
billion to $8 billion due to some allocation of costs in the final 2013 carve-out audit of TWC's systems, some higher
Charter divestiture EBITDA and updated consensus figures to get an estimate of net 2014 acquired EBITDA. The key
takeaway is we're receiving all the systems, subscribers, assets and employees we expected, and the final purchase
price will be ultimately calculated on audited 2014 carve-out EBITDA.
On Wednesday this week, we launched a senior secured notes offering, raised $3.5 billion of 8-year and 10-year notes
at 5.5% and 5.75% fixed, respectively. Together with the $1 billion of term loan A and the $3.5 billion of term loan G
which we already raised in August, we have now completed the current estimated financing needs for the sale and
exchange transactions with Comcast. That sums up the $8 billion I mentioned a moment ago. We also have an
additional $400 million of available financing commitments if needed.
The $3.5 billion of previously funded term loan G bank debt and the $3.5 billion of notes we raised this week will be
held in escrow in unrestricted subsidiaries until closing. In fact, you'll see in today's 10-Q that the cash associated with
the term loan G is already reflected in non-current assets, as it's intended for the purchase price payment, and again, it
sits in escrow. Over the coming quarters, our interest cost leading up to close will be a bit higher than usual as a result
and that already started in September.
Finally, similar to what we mentioned on the last call, we will provide regular updates on transition and integration
operating expenses, capital expenditure and financing that sits in the numbers. In Q3, there's really just a few million
dollars in each, OpEx and CapEx, and roughly $7 million in interest expense.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay, thanks. Good morning, guys. Now that you guys are winding down the all-digital
conversion, obviously you pointed out how much of that was in the CapEx. But when should we start seeing the
benefits on the CapEx line? I'd imagine you bought a lot of the boxes that you're deploying now in the third quarter, but
so should we see some leverage in the CapEx lines starting in the fourth quarter? And then similar, as it relates to cost
to serve. Can you talk about what benefits we should see in that line as that initiative winds down and potentially when
we should see them? Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Hi, John. So I'll take at least the first one. So we updated our guidance today for
business as usual, Charter, the estimate remains at $2.2 billion for the year. So you can do the first three quarters, add it
up and find out that we'll still have a healthy Q4 CapEx in total for Q4. But you're right, the mix will change a little bit
because a lot of the boxes have been bought and they're being deployed right now. As is typical for cable, you tend to
see a lot of the support and scalable be a little bit more back-ended towards the back half of the year.
On the cost to service, which include network operations, field operations and customer care predominantly, we have
invested in the past in these areas significantly, whether it was through preventative maintenance or insourcing, which
continues to take place. I think when you sit back and take a look at 6.7% residential revenue growth at 8% overall or a
4% growth – above 4% growth in our customer relationships, take any one of those measures and in fact the cost to
service customers is only increasing by 4%. At the same time, we're significantly improving the quality of the service
operations. It means that we're already – we have been getting, and this has gone on for several quarters – we have been
getting significant operating leverage out of better service operations, and we're reducing transactions outside of
all-digital along the way. Could there be more? Maybe, but we're pretty pleased with the direction it's heading already.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Great. Thanks.

Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Good morning, guys. I had a couple for Tom. Tom, I wanted to get your take on the
decision by CBS and HBO to go direct to consumer and what effect you think that's going to have on you all. And any
comments you can make on the potential for the FCC to at least partly try to establish some sort of Title II regulation
on the sector? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Sure, Jeff. I think that there are a lot of discussions about direct-to-consumer
relationships between programming and over-the-top, and they have interesting implications from a business model
perspective that I think in some ways are favorable.
You can look at it a lot of different ways, but the opportunity for us to be – potentially to put more specific
customer-oriented packages together or packages that meet customer needs, would be an attractive thing. And to the
extent that programmers voluntarily break up the very fat basic bundle that they have put together contractually, would
be an opportunity for us to actually build a more compelling product.
The interesting thing about the business is that people want our products, and the biggest strain on the business from a
video perspective is cord-cutting is really financially driven more than it is content driven. And the reason it's
financially driven is because incomes have not kept up with the cost of the product. And it's true that the fat basic could
be better put together for specific segments of the population. And if we had that ability and if programmers were
willing to allow us to have that ability, I think we could actually have a better, more successful video product.
With regard to the regulatory situation, we don't think there are actually any issues in terms of net neutrality that are
being violated by the industry or ever have been violated. We think that there are solutions that don't require Title II
regulation and we would like to see the FCC come up with a conclusion that does not include Title II.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Hi. Two questions if I could. First, Tom, I think you're still sort of the intellectual father of
the idea of Wi-Fi first wireless back from your days at Cablevision. I wonder if you could just update your thinking
now that you're at Charter; as other developments from others sort of push that forward, how could Charter participate
since you're not party to the MVNO agreement with Verizon?
And then, second, if you could just share some thoughts about Time Warner Cable's recent results in general. It seems
like they are quite reliant on aggressive broadband pricing, and does that change your perspective on how you might
operate those systems given how far they've pulled that lever in the past?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Craig, with regard to Wi-Fi, I still think that Wi-Fi is a great opportunity for the cable
business. Charter is beginning to deploy Wi-Fi. We have not put that at the top of our list over the last several years
because of the general condition of Charter and the need to put it into a good operating situation, which we have done.
And so, we've turned our attention to the opportunity that wireless presents.
Yes, it's true, we don't have an MVNO relationship, but I think that we could. We have not been actively seeking that. I
think that there are all sorts of value propositions that come from the current Wi-Fi situation. Charter has begun
marketing a wireless – a Wi-Fi product inside the home that is actually consistent with the speed of our broadband
network, and we have the claim, and it's true – we've tested it in our labs – that we have the fastest Wi-Fi in the
country, and we think that that's a differentiator for us. But in terms of where Wi-Fi takes us, we think it takes us into
initially an improved value proposition for our whole broadband product. And already today we are the dominant
provider of data to smart devices that our customers buy regardless of who their subscriber relationship for those smart

devices is.
So you see the Wi-Fi networks becoming increasingly used as content changes and content gets richer. And so we think
that investing in Wi-Fi ultimately leads us to an opportunity to either monetize it directly or monetize it through our
overall relationship.
In terms of TWC, I think that their strategy has been consistent and we've understood it all along and we accounted for
it in our valuation of the assets. And they're doing what we thought they would do and what they said they would do
and we're prepared to step into that and put our business model on those assets. And so, there's nothing going on that is
a surprise to us.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Okay. Thanks, Tom.
Operator
Next question will come from the line of Vijay Jayant with ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Thanks. Tom, you just talked about your program which give you some flexibility to repackage
your products to really target the millennials and the potential cord-cutters. Can you talk about what you've done so
far? Are there any skinny packages that you're offering, any comments on the success of that?
And then just a quick question for Chris on the mechanics of the GreatLand Connections deal. The shares that Comcast
shareholders are going to get in GreatLand Connections and the implicit shares that GreatLand Connections is going to
have in Charter, are Comcast's shareholders going to own the shares directly or GreatLand Connections is going to own
those shares?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: So to the extent I heard the first part of your question, what are we doing with our
products to serve the millennial audience, we have been growing our expanded basic tier which is the full package of
video, and we've been shrinking by 9,000 subscribers our basic-only subscription universe. And what that means is that
we're actually growing video market share against all of our competitors across the country. And that's because we've
put a better video product together with more channels than our competitors' offer. So, it's actually richer and it's
two-way interactive and on-demand.
So, yes, it's expensive and the expense of the product is an issue. But because it's a better, higher quality product, it can
carry the expense to some extent better than it could historically, and it's growing. But there is an overall cost issue of
video, but we are growing the richer video package with a more fully featured service proposition. And we've
combined that with other products in a total value proposition that's working in the marketplace.
Chris?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Vijay, for GreatLand Connections, the Comcast spin will be a spin of GreatLand
Connections directly to all of its shareholders, at which point in time Charter will have a subsidiary that merges
together with GreatLand Connections, and the GreatLand Connections shareholders, which includes Comcast and
former TWC shareholders, at that point in time will also receive shares in Charter.
So if you're a Comcast shareholder today, you'll have some number of GreatLand Connections shares and you actually
become a Charter shareholder, if you weren't already, through that spin merge that takes place subsequently. We'll end
up owning 33% of the shares of GreatLand Connections and we're looking forward to that closing taking place.

<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thank you. Good morning. Tom, I don't know if you've had a lot of time to digest it
or you've been thinking about it, but on this sort of hybrid Title II approach, what would be the practical implications, if
any, of the FCC moving to classify what they describe as the backend or the edge connection, as Title II common
carrier, change how you think about your product or your business or your capital spending?
And then totally unrelated, either for you or Chris, I think we're now in year two of the first vintage of promotional new
pricing and packaging customers. I think it started in the third quarter of 2012. I could be wrong. But I'm just
wondering what you've seen in the second year of step-ups as the promotional pricing has rolled off on that original
cohort, how they've behaved versus expectations.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: So, Ben, without seeing a specific proposal, which we haven't from anyone with regard
to what you're saying, it's hard to say. But we don't think there's any need for any Title II anywhere in the current
process and that there's actually not a net neutrality problem and that there are other regulatory avenues in which to
solve the issue.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Got it.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: From a new pricing and packaging, which actually, it was implemented, as you
pointed out, two years ago, we're continuing to see better retention at the step-up than what we had historically seen.
So, we're achieving the results we expected.
Some of that is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, being offset by the fact that we do have a promotional
one-play Internet that's being sold in as well at a roughly $40 price point. So, the real impact, you're not fully seeing in
the overall customer relationship ARPU. But keep in mind, we're growing customer relationships by 4.9%
year-over-year which is – well, it's strong.
So, the impact is everything that we expected. We're retaining customers. We're stepping up. We're providing real
value into the product offering, and that improves our ability to retain the customer and to retain the step-up through the
price increase.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: And then, Chris, if I could just ask one quick follow-up on commercial. You
mentioned that there was a revenue bucket that was dragging down the growth. I think you talked about hotels, motels.
Any sizing of that business so we can understand how big of a drag that's going to be going forward?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Well, if you take a look at – I don't want to get into the individual products, but it's the
video hospitality business that's in there. We've, over the past couple of quarters, provided an outlook of what our
adjusted growth rate is, excluding that. I think you could back into, using those numbers, some reasonable estimate of
what that is. But it's sizeable.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Yeah.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: And it's an important sector too. And it's not that it's not growing, it's simply that it's
not growing at the same rate as the regular commercial telecom space.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thank you.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Thanks.

Your next question will come from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
<Q - Amy Yong>: Thanks. Two questions, one on churn. I was just wondering if you can comment on what the impact
of Spectrum brand does to the churn profile of your customers. I think Comcast at one point said that X1 or X2, they
actually see a double-digit improvement in churn. I was just wondering if you can comment on what that looks like for
your customer profile.

And then my second question is, can you just lay out what the right way to think about the top line growth is pro forma
for SpinCo and the 1.4 million subs. I know it's going to be somewhat dilutive to the top line, but if you take a look at
what Bresnan did, I think you accelerated growth within Bresnan by from anywhere between 5% to then 8%. So, just
any way you can frame that for us would be helpful.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, Amy, this is Tom. I'll take the front part of that. The Spectrum brand is a
representation of all the products that we sell and the quality of those services. And it's a way to differentiate what
we're doing now as opposed to what we did in the past.
As a general proposition, our belief is that we can reduce churn by having better products that have more value as it's
perceived by customers and to have a better service infrastructure and to have less transactions in general as a result of
the way we market and service our customers. And all of those things reduce transactions in the business, which are
costs. Churn is also a cost and longer subscriber life reduces churn, with the same amount of cash flow and the same
amount of customers – same amount of cash flow per customer. So we think that the product strategy we have is a
churn reducer.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Amy, on the forward revenue growth, I mean, we're not going to provide guidance.
But we did spend a little bit of time on it last quarter talking at length about the different buckets of subscribers and
how we would expect that they would perform, and I'll go through quickly some of that again. You have Charter today
which is growing very well. I don't think it's done. Our growth continues to accelerate. And right at the point, as
somebody mentioned earlier on the call, as all-digital spend is going to start to drop off, we'll get a quick preview into
the free cash flow, the significant free cash flow growth coming out at the backend at the same time that revenue and
EBITDA continue to do well.
We're going to take from that 4.2 million subscribers and we're going to divest 1.5 million of those that are growing at
or a similar rate to Comcast, because they're in markets where there is not a long-term path to be an efficient marketer
or operator because we didn't have the long-term path to owning the DMA.
And we're going to incorporate about 3 million TWC subs that look a lot like Charter, we said, from two years ago, and
we're going to apply the Charter operating strategy, new pricing and packaging, take those systems all-digital, and we
expect to be able to drive the same type of results that we've been able to do on Charter as a whole on the TWC assets,
we're going to replicate the ROI that we're demonstrating on another 3 million subs.
We expect that we'd actually be able to have a better ROI in doing it because we think they're good systems, they're
good networks. They don't have some of the issues that Charter had that needed to be addressed. We were able to buy
set-top boxes at a dramatically lower cost than what we've been doing at Charter over the past two years, and that
means we have a proven operating model, we have a way to go all-digital, we're going to do it on a larger set of assets
at a lower cost, and we think the returns could be higher as a result.
The final piece that you mentioned was GreatLand Connections. We will not consolidate GreatLand Connections'
results. We're a minority shareholder, we own 33%, we'll have a seat on the board – or we'll have several seats on the
board. And we'll provide operating services to them, but they'll be an independent publicly traded company and they'll
have their own results, and we'll help them in terms of an operating service provider to implement that strategy. They
will be marketing under the Spectrum brand with the Spectrum product set and have some of our operating strategies;
that's already been decided by GreatLand's management team. And we look forward to working with them. But other
than the management fee that we receive from them, you won't see their consolidated results inside of the new Charter.
<Q - Amy Yong>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Sure.

<Q - Matthew J. Harrigan>: Thank you. Two years or so ago, big dichotomy between large market and small market
cable in terms of Cox's attitude, your attitude, et cetera. And you've gotten a lot of traction with your strategy. I mean,
Wi-Fi in the home has been a big deal. It's working outside the home. X1, Spectrum are getting pretty good traction. So
do you feel differently about M&A now in terms of looking at a broader brush on opportunities? I know it's too soon
out of the blocks with the current transaction not even closed. And how do you reconcile I think a lot of [ph] grouping
(37:53) in the industry and maybe too much hype over OTT with the valuation still being as stuck in the mud as they
are relative to the long-term cash generation?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I think the crux of your question is how do we feel about broader M&A opportunities
for cable or cable-related space, is that fair?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: And how does rural versus urban...
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Urban play into that.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: It's always...
<Q - Matthew J. Harrigan>: In other words...
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Go ahead.
<Q - Matthew J. Harrigan>: Your product, okay, looks so strong and the valuations haven't really moved yet. Would
you feel more confident going into some other areas than you necessarily were before given the success that you're
having? I'm sorry if I explained everything pretty awkwardly.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah, as a general proposition, the answer is yes. We think that cable is a good business,
that it's a good product, and I've said this many times, that if you have over 1 million customers, you pretty much have
the average American mix of rural and urban. And it's the rare – it's hard to put a bigger company than that together
that isn't pretty average in terms of the demographics that you serve. And that kind of business can grow and it can
grow in both low income, high income, rural and urban areas successfully if properly managed and right investments
and the right products are stood up.
<Q - Matthew J. Harrigan>: Thank you.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Thanks.

Your next question will come from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kannan Venkateshwar>: Thank you. Just a couple of questions. Chris, first on the pricing issue. I was
wondering if you could breakdown the underlying drivers a little bit more to help us understand what that ramp could
look like if you were to strip out the impact of the lower priced broadband-only versions.
And secondly, Tom, from your perspective when you look at the video contribution margins for the expanded product
that you have now versus the relatively skinnier product that you had earlier, is there a value in sticking with the
skinnier bundle versus the more expanded bundle from that perspective? And just given the acceleration and
programming costs to see double-digit growth, is there a point at which you are at a breakeven point from a video
perspective? In other words, offering video versus not offering video kind of a question. Do you face that, say, four
years, five years down the line? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, I guess the simplest way of answering you is to say I don't really look at the
margins by product. I look at the margins by customer relationship that are created and look at the things that are
necessary to create a customer relationship. So to some extent, the margins across the various businesses are legacy
notions from my point of view.

I think that video is a very compelling product that people love. And as I said earlier, I think the biggest problem with
video is that it's very expensive, but people want it and love it. And almost everyone in the country wants it and has it
already. And I think that an operator like us with the capabilities we have can stand up great video products in a lot of
different regulatory and commercial environments. And we're prepared to do that and think we'll continue to do that no
matter how the marketplace evolves and that video will be a compelling piece of our business. We do not have any
strategies or never even considered abandoning the video marketplace.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: And your question on the pricing breakdown, I mean, you've asked a complicated
question as to the relative moving parts. A lot of people think about it as simply as what's your gross connects in the
different products and how does that drive your ARPU, but they really underestimate the complexity of the cable
business in terms of migrations, upgrades, downgrades. What's the ARPU of people who are desk connecting? What
are your step-ups taking place? So it's a pretty complicated model when you work through it.
And at the end of the day, I think you have to take confidence in the fact that we're saying we are acquiring customers
in triple-play at a higher rate than we've ever done before. And we're retaining them and we're stepping them up on rate.
And in addition to that, we're acquiring new customers in low-priced, high-value Internet packages that are very well
situated, particularly when we have things like Spectrum Guide on the boxes, to be future video customers as Charter's
earned back its service reputation. So I think the customer base is growing, ARPU is growing, triple-play is growing
but so is single-play Internet, all of which is good and we expect to continue to move in that direction.
<Q - Kannan Venkateshwar>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Thanks.
Operator
The final question will come from the line of Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisors. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas William Eagan>: Great. Thank you very much. With the Comcast and DIRECTV deals next year,
there's going to be unprecedented nationwide subscribers swapping and all sorts of new marketing campaigns. How
does Charter cut through all the clutter without overspending? And do you think that you'll end up spending more as a
percentage of revenue next year than this year? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, that's a good question. The beauty of the new footprint of Charter is that we go
from an environment where today we can use mass media in 48% of our footprint effectively. And that's at the margin,
meaning we have many properties where Charter is a minor player in a large DMA and our ability to buy marketing is
negatively impacted by that strategic situation.
That said, we're growing nicely because we are using tactical marketing to reach those potential customers, and you can
do that just fine and we've proven that you can do it just fine. But when you look at the new footprint, more than 95%,
and probably more than 98%, of the combined footprint of Charter and GreatLand using the Spectrum brand commonly
will be reachable by mass media and in very concentrated marketplaces, DMAs. So the efficiency of our ability to
spend marketing dollars goes up. And will we spend more with the opportunity? Maybe, but the efficiency of the spend
relative to the opportunity should improve.
<Q - Thomas William Eagan>: Great. Okay. Thank you.
