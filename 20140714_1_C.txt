Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements,
which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of
factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC
filings, including without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2013 Form 10-K.
With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.
Michael L. Corbat
Susan, thank you and good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $181 million for the second
quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact of the legacy mortgage settlement, CVA and DVA, net income was $3.9 billion,
up slightly from last year or a $1.24 per share. Before I get into our operating performance, I want to discuss our legacy
mortgage settlement.
The comprehensive settlement announced today with the U.S. Department of Justice, the State AGs and the FDIC
resolves all pending civil investigations related to our legacy RMBS and CDO underwriting, structuring and issuance
activities. We also have now resolved substantially all of our legacy RMBS and CDO litigations. We believe that this
settlement is in the best interest of our shareholders and allows us to move forward and to focus on the future in serving
our clients.
During the quarter, our Institutional businesses performed well outside of markets where macro uncertainty and
historically-low volatility reduced client activity, clearly impacting our fixed income and equities revenues. Corporate
and Investment Banking revenues strengthened, led by strong equity and debt underwriting and our Treasury and Trade
Solutions businesses again saw underlying revenue growth as volumes continued to increase.
In Consumer Banking, year-over-year of comparisons continued to be affected by lower mortgage refinancing activity
and our repositioning efforts in Korea, but we believe these businesses have now stabilized and we're better positioned
for growth in the second half of the year.
We grew our consumer loans despite the uneven economic environment and saw continued signs of progress in our
U.S. cards business.
Excluding this settlement announced today, Citi Holdings turned to profit for the first time since its formation and we
announced agreements to sell our consumer businesses in Greece and Spain, which will further reduce Holdings' assets
in the third quarter.
The Holdings profit actually helped drive DTA consumption, which totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter and $2.2 billion
for the first half of 2014. And despite the impact of the legacy mortgage settlement on our net income, our capital
position strengthened to a Tier 1 common ratio of 10.6% on a Basel III basis and our tangible book value also
increased. During the first half of this year, we generated $10 billion in capital, despite today's settlement.
Throughout the organization, we're focused on strengthening our capital planning process, improving our execution and
increasing efficiency. We're engaged in a firm-wide effort that includes improving our target client model, streamlining
our structure, processes, and technology platforms, and optimizing our real estate footprint. These actions create the
capability to make investments in our business, regulatory and compliance activities and strengthen our capital
planning process. They also allow us to reduce our operating expenses both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year.
While this effort is ongoing, we are already making some good headway. For example, during the second quarter, we
reduced our head count by 3,500 people to 244,000 and it is now down nearly 7,000 for the first half of 2014 and
15,000 people since the fourth quarter of 2012. We continue to simplify our product offerings and we further
rationalized our footprint, shrinking retail branches by nearly 140, while reducing consumer support sites by another 31
locations.

Looking ahead for the second half of this year, I feel good about how we're positioned and I believe we should see an
improved revenue picture. On the consumer side, the U.S. economy is gaining strength as job creation and consumer
spending increases. Internationally, our franchise is performing well and we believe the headwinds facing our retail
business in Korea are abating. In our Institutional business, while client activity has been lower in markets, businesses
such as Investment Banking and trade finance are showing momentum.
We've also demonstrated the ability to reduce the drag of Citi Holdings and utilize DTA, both of which will contribute
to the strengthening of our capital positions going forward.
John will now go through the deck and then we'd be happy to take your questions. John?
John C. Gerspach
Okay. Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. To start, I'd like to highlight two items, which affect the
comparability of this quarter's results to last year. First, as Mike described, this quarter we took a $3.7 billion after-tax
charge related to the mortgage settlement for a negative impact on EPS of a $1.21 per share. And second, CVA and
DVA was a negative $33 million pre-tax this quarter or $0.01 per share after-tax compared to a positive $477 million
pre-tax or $0.09 per share in the second quarter of last year. Adjusting for CVA/DVA and the impact of the settlement,
we earned a $1.24 per share in the recent quarter compared to a $1.25 in the second quarter of last year.
Throughout today's presentation, I'll be discussing our results excluding these two items to provide comparability to
prior periods. On slide four, we show total Citigroup results. We earned $3.9 billion in the second quarter and $8.1
billion for the first half of 2014, both up slightly from prior periods, as lower revenues were offset by lower operating
expenses and a decline in credit costs.
Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 4% year-over-year to $668 billion, as 8% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by
the continued decline in Citi Holdings and deposits grew 3% to $966 billion.
On slide five, we show more detail on expenses. Legal and related costs were roughly $400 million in the second
quarter, mostly incurred in Citicorp. Repositioning costs were also around $400 million, including approximately $270
million of repositioning costs related to our consumer franchise in Korea. Excluding these items, core operating
expenses of nearly $11 billion in the second quarter declined by over $225 million in constant dollars, driven by
continued cost reduction initiatives and the decline in Citi Holdings' assets, partially offset by higher regulatory and
compliance costs, as well as the impact of business growth. Sequentially, core expenses were down versus last quarter,
reflecting lower incentive compensation and continued efficiency efforts, again, partially offset by higher regulatory
and compliance costs.
On slide six, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. In Citicorp, earnings declined 18% year-over-year,
as lower revenues and higher legal and repositioning costs were partially offset by lower core operating expenses and
an improvement in credit. In Citi Holdings, we earned over $240 million this quarter compared to a loss of nearly $600
million last year. Citi Holdings' revenues increased significantly from last year driven by the absence of rep and
warranty reserve builds in the recent quarter, higher gains on asset sales and lower funding costs. Core expenses
continued to decline, in line with the 15% year-over-year reduction in assets. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $111
billion of assets or 6% of Citigroup assets.
Turning to Citicorp on slide seven, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues
grew 1% year-over-year in the second quarter. Core operating expenses, excluding legal and repositioning costs also
increased 1% from the prior year, driven by business growth and higher regulatory and compliance costs, partially
offset by ongoing efficiency savings. Including legal and repositioning costs, total operating expenses increased 12%
from the prior year, mostly due to the repositioning charges in Korea.
International consumer revenues continued to reflect spread compression as well as the impact of regulatory changes
and the repositioning of certain markets. Korea remained a headwind year-over-year. However, the franchise was
broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and we believe we should begin to see sequential revenue growth in Korea as we go

into the second half of the year.
Aside from Korea, the most significant challenge for Asia consumer revenues this quarter was a decline in investment
sales revenues, both year-over-year and sequentially. While this business has grown over time, quarterly investment
sales revenues tend to reflect the overall capital markets environment, and in the second quarter, we saw weaker
investor sentiment. We provide more details on Asia consumer revenues on Appendix slide 25.
Despite these headwinds, most underlying drivers remained positive with average loans up 7% and average deposits up
3% from last year. International credit costs grew 10% year-over-year, mostly reflecting portfolio growth and
seasoning in Latin America, while the net credit loss rate remained broadly favorable at below 200 basis points.
Slide eight shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues were down 5% year-over-year and
flat sequentially. Retail banking revenues of $1.2 billion declined by 26% from last year, mostly reflecting lower
mortgage refinancing activity and were up 3% sequentially, as higher mortgage revenues and improved deposit spreads
offset the absence of a one-time $70 million gain in the prior quarter. Branded cards revenues of $2 billion were up 3%
versus last year, as we grew purchase sales and lower average loans were partially offset by an improvement in spreads,
driven by a reduction in promotional rate balances. And retail services revenues grew 7% from last year, driven by the
Best Buy portfolio acquisition. Ongoing cost reduction initiatives drove total operating expenses down by 4%
year-over-year to $2.3 billion, even after absorbing the impact of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.
We continued to resize our North America retail banking business in the second quarter, taking costs out of our
mortgage operations and rationalizing the branch footprint, all while continuing to grow our franchise. Over the past 12
months, we have sold or closed over 70 branches in North America. During the same period, we grew average retail
loans by 11% and average deposits by 4%, including 11% growth in checking account balances.
In branded cards, we also saw momentum. While total average loans have continued to decline modestly, this mostly
reflects the runoff of promotional rate balances. Full rate balances have grown year-over-year for five consecutive
quarters, reflecting account growth and increased card usage, primarily in our proprietary rewards and travel co-brand
products, including American Advantage where new account growth for our executive card has exceeded our
expectations.
Credit remained favorable in the second quarter with net credit losses and delinquencies both improving more than
what we had anticipated in branded cards and retail services, contributing to a loan loss reserve release of $400 million.
At quarter-end, loan loss reserves in North American cards represented roughly 16 months of concurrent NCL
coverage.
Slide nine shows our Global Consumer credit trends in more detail. Overall, Global Consumer credit trends remained
favorable in the second quarter, with net credit losses and delinquencies both improving as a percentage of loans. In
North America the strong credit trends I just mentioned drove an improvement in our outlook and we now anticipate
the full-year NCL rate to be roughly in line with first half results or slightly better than our previous estimate of around
3%.
Asia remained stable. And in Latin America, we saw a modest uptick in both NCL and delinquency rates. These trends
were driven primarily by Mexico cards as that portfolio continued to season and consumers continued to adjust to fiscal
reforms, as well as the impact of slower economic growth.
We continue to expect the full-year NCL rate in Latin America to be roughly in line with first half levels. This rate
could be higher, of course, if we incur any losses related to our exposure to homebuilders in Mexico. However, we
would expect these losses to be charged against our reserves and therefore they should be neutral to the overall cost of
credit.
Slide 10 shows the efficiency ratio for Global Consumer Banking on a trailing 12-month basis. Total franchise results
are shown on the light blue line, while the dark blue bars represent the efficiency ratio, excluding North American
mortgage and Korea. As I've mentioned before, revenues have declined in both North American mortgage and Korea
over the past year. In addition, we incurred significant repositioning charges in Korea in the second quarter, creating a

drag on our reported operating efficiency. Outside of these businesses, we have made steady progress, reducing our
efficiency ratio to just under 54%, as we have exited underperforming markets and simplified our operations.
Slide 11 shows our total consumer expenses over the past five quarters, split between core operating expenses and legal
and repositioning costs. Legal and repositioning costs were elevated in the second quarter, driven by Korea, while core
operating expenses continued to decline. We expect to make further progress in reducing core expenses in the second
half of the year, as we remain on track to achieve or exceed our year-end goals for head count reduction, card product
simplification, and branch and support site rationalization.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide 12. Revenues of $8.5 billion declined 7% from last year and 8%
sequentially. Total banking revenues of $4.5 billion grew 6% from last year and 9% from the prior quarter. Excluding a
one-time $50 million gain in the prior year, Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion were up 3%, both
year-over-year and sequentially, as growth in fees and volumes were partially offset by spread compression.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.3 billion were up 16% from last year and 27% from the prior quarter, driven by
particularly strong debt and equity underwriting activity. M&A revenues improved from the prior quarter and we
continued to increase our share of announced M&A volumes in a growing market.
Private Bank revenues of $656 million grew 2% from last year as growth in client volumes was partially offset by the
impact of spread compression and were down 2% sequentially on lower capital markets activity.
Core lending revenues were $454 million, up from prior periods, mostly due to higher average loans. Total Markets and
Security Services revenues of $4.1 billion declined 16% year-over-year and 21% sequentially. Fixed income revenues
of $3 billion declined 12% from last year, as historically low volatility and continued macro uncertainty dampened
investor client flows, particularly in rates and currencies. In addition, the prior-year period benefited from gains as we
pared back risk positions given increased volatility in emerging markets. Sequentially, fixed income revenues declined
22%, reflecting seasonal trends.
Equities revenues of $659 million were down 26% year-over-year and 25% sequentially, reflecting lower client
activity, as well as weak trading performance in EMEA, in part driven by macro and geopolitical uncertainties in the
region. In Securities Services, revenues were roughly flat versus last year as increased client activity was offset by a
reduction in high-margin deposits and up 7% sequentially, due to increased client balances and higher activity from
new accounts.
Total operating expenses of $4.9 billion were down 2% versus the prior year, driven by lower incentive compensation,
partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs and legal and related expenses in the recent quarter. On a
sequential basis, expenses decreased by over $100 million mostly reflecting lower incentive compensation.
On slide 13, we show expense and efficiency trends for the Institutional business. On a trailing 12-month basis, we
have lowered our operating expenses every quarter for over two years, driving the full-year efficiency ratio from 66%
two years ago to 60% as of the second quarter, even as the revenue environment has remained challenging. Our comp
ratio for the most recent 12 months was 29%, consistent with the full year of 2013.
Slide 14 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues declined year-over-year driven mainly by hedging activities,
while expenses increased on higher legal and related expenses, as well as higher regulatory and compliance costs.
Assets of $326 billion included approximately $104 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $167 billion of liquid
investment securities.
On – slide 15 shows Citi Holdings' assets, which totaled $111 billion at quarter end with roughly 60% in North
American mortgages. Total assets declined $3 billion during the quarter, mostly driven by net paydowns. Roughly $3.8
billion of asset sales were in process during the quarter, but not yet closed as of June 30. These include $2.7 billion of
assets from the announced sale of our retail operations in Spain and Greece, as well as nearly $1 billion of mortgage
loans, each of which should close in the third quarter.
On slide 16, we show Citi Holdings' financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.5 billion were up
year-over-year, primarily driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve builds in the recent quarter, higher gains on

asset sales and lower funding costs. Citi Holdings' expenses decreased significantly with core operating expenses down
15%, in line with the reduction in assets. Net credit losses continued to improve and we released $254 million of loan
loss reserves, the vast majority of which was related to North America mortgages.
Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings' results on slide 17, the operating margin in Citi Holdings remained at
roughly $700 million this quarter, driven in part by gains on asset sales. Credit remained fairly stable. And on an
adjusted basis, legal costs declined significantly, driving Citi Holdings to a profit in the second quarter.
On slide 18 we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. Net interest revenue was $11.9 billion in the
second quarter, up from last year on higher interest-earning assets and an improvement in net interest margin, and up
sequentially driven by day count. Our net interest margin declined sequentially to 287 basis points in the second
quarter, driven by lower loan and investment yields, partially offset by lower cost of funds. We currently believe our
net interest margin should remain roughly flat to second quarter levels for the remainder of the year.
On slide 19, we show our key capital metrics. Despite the impact of the settlement, our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio
grew to 10.6% as we benefited from DTA utilization during the quarter. Our supplementary leverage ratio also
improved to 5.7%, and our tangible book value grew to $56.89 per share.
So, in summary, our results in the second quarter demonstrated further progress on several fronts. While Markets
revenues reflected the challenging environment, we showed continued momentum in our Investment Banking
franchise, and Treasury and Trade Solutions continued to grow, all while we continued to reduce our total expense base
in ICG. On the consumer side, we continued to grow loans, deposits and card purchase sales, while reducing our core
operating expenses and maintaining overall favorable credit performance. And in Citi Holdings, excluding the impact
of the settlement, we achieved our first profitable quarter and we believe Citi Holdings should remain profitable for the
remainder of this year, although with some variability quarter-to-quarter.
Looking to the second half of the year, in markets, our results will likely reflect the overall environment, although we
would certainly anticipate that market conditions should be somewhat more favorable than in the second half of 2013.
In Investment Banking, revenues will also reflect the overall market, but we feel good about the quality and momentum
of our franchise as demonstrated by our performance not only in the second quarter but over the past year. And, in
Treasury and Trade Solutions, we believe we can continue growing our revenues in the second half of the year, driven
by continued volume growth and abating spread headwinds.
Turning to Consumer Banking, in North America, we believe revenues should grow in the second half of the year, both
versus the first half of 2014, as well as year-over-year with positive operating leverage. And in international consumer,
revenues should also grow in the second half of the year as we move past our repositioning efforts in Korea and the
underlying growth of the remaining franchise becomes more apparent.
Turning to expenses, in Citicorp, our core operating expenses should continue to decline, although we expect to face
ongoing higher regulatory and compliance costs. Repositioning expenses in the second half of the year should be
roughly in line with first half levels. And legal costs will likely remain somewhat elevated and episodic in nature.
We continue to have an overall favorable outlook with regard to our credit performance. While we saw an increase in
loan loss reserve releases in our North America cards business this quarter driven by better than anticipated credit
performance, we do expect the reserve releases to be lower in the second half of the year. And nominal credit costs in
Citicorp could increase as we continue to grow our loan portfolios. And finally, we expect our tax rate for the
remainder of the year to be broadly in line with the first half, in the range of 32%.
And with that, Mike and I would be happy to take any questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Good morning. John, a few questions. Yeah, just wanted to follow up on a couple
of things you just mentioned. On the legal costs, would you expect with the settlement now taking a lot of the mortgage
exposure off the table, I assume that legal costs would look more like this quarter, where ex-CMBS settlement they
seem to come in around $400 million rather than the prior trend, which was closer to about $800 million?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, let me break it down this way, John. I'd say that with the legacy mortgage settlement
behind us, we wouldn't expect Holdings to have any significant level of legal charges in the second half of 2014. Now
as I said, legal expenses in Citicorp that they're going to remain somewhat elevated and episodic in nature.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. [ph] That's great. (28:10)
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I wouldn't expect anything significant.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And this quarter you had $400 million in Citicorp and would you characterize
that as still elevated, the $400 million?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, I would say that that's elevated as to what we expect in a normal environment. So we
will see where we go with the second half of the year.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then I thought the repositioning expenses would be coming down in the
second half of the year after the elevated charge this quarter for Korea, I thought you might have said that last quarter
that they'd be coming down after this. So, I thought you just said now that they would stay at the first half levels. What
would be keeping the repositioning costs so high?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, John, we continue to focus our efforts on our operations in the countries that we had
identified as optimized markets. And matter of fact if you go back to the conference that we presented at near the end
of May, we actually used a slide that showed that we had improved our efficiency ratio by over, I think, it was 300
basis points in those markets during 2013, and we generated further improvements during 2014 through a combination
of efforts, the branch closures, product rationalization, consolidation of operations, and head count reductions. And
we're just going to continue that focus during the balance of this year and given that continued focus we just think it's
more likely that the repositioning reserves for the second half are going to be much more in line with what we had in
the first.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And you mentioned North America consumer expenses likely to improve some
more. Overall expenses on the core expense face of about $11 billion this quarter company wide, do you hope to
improve from there?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We expect the core expenses to decline sequentially in each of the next two quarters.
Obviously some – we won't get as much I think as everybody would like just because of the higher legal and regulatory
costs that we're facing. But we do anticipate continued sequential decline in the core operating expenses.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And just shifting gears to DTA utilization, it was a big number this quarter,
John, and better than expected. The big settlement didn't seem to have an impact, is that because it wasn't tax
deductible? Could you just explain that?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, you've got it, John. The lion's share of the cost, if you take a look, we talked about
taking a pre-tax charge of $3.8 billion and an after-tax charge of $3.7 billion. So to your point, not much of the
settlement cost was tax deductible. And so perhaps the best way to take a look at the performance in the quarter is
looking at the results excluding the settlement and there you'll see that I think in the first quarter we had $5.9 billion or
so of pre-tax earnings and in the second quarter we had roughly the same amount. So when you're dealing with that
level of pre-tax earnings you're going to get DTA utilization of, again, somewhere between $700 million, $800 million
or $1.1 billion in the quarter.

formula that you've got to go through and take a look at not just the level of DTA but first of all what type of DTA. In
both the first and the second quarter, most of the DTA that we've been able to utilize has come out of the FTCs, those
foreign tax credits. So you start by, that's immediately dollar-for-dollar reduction because those things just come off the
top. Then between the capital growth as well as the reduction that we have had in things like mortgage servicing rights,
we've got even more room now in our 10% buckets as well as the overall 15% bucket, and so you just add up all the
various multiplier effects and you end up with that $1.1 billion actually contributing $2.2 billion in regulatory capital.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, right. You've got expansion of the cap, the dynamic cap. Okay. And last thing,
maybe Mike, could you comment on the CCAR, or any update on the progress you're making, understanding the Fed's
concerns, what they're asking you to improve and your confidence in the ability to satisfy the high qualitative bar that
the regulators are setting?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Sure. Well, I would say, John – it's Mike, that there's really very little additional
information beyond what we've said at the venues along the way. But I think to summarize that, we still are operating
and feel strongly that this isn't an issue with our business model, our strategy, our levels of capital or clearly our ability
to generate capital. Gene and the team are working to continue to enhance and where necessary, build the right
inclusive processes and the range of scenarios around the firm. We feel good about the progress. We feel very good
about the communication with the Fed, but it's work in progress and we've got more work to do between now and year
end.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Thanks, John.

Your next question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Jim.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: A quick question, maybe just a follow-up on the legal side. You guys settled for $4.5 billion
in cash and took a $3.8 billion charge, so you only used up $700 million in reserves. Is that effectively a reserve build
for what remains and that makes you feel a little bit better about your coverage going forward? Or is that – or you only
really had $700 million set aside for that issue?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Jim, I'm not going to comment on the reserve levels that we have set up for any individual
litigation, but in the math that you've done, you've left out the cost of the consumer relief efforts. And we do anticipate
and have made provision for expense that we will incur in connection with those consumer relief efforts, and so that
estimate is also embedded in the $3.8 billion pre-tax charge that we took.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. So it's not just through reserves but also through expense?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We've...
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: On consumer relief.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's through the expense that we've taken this quarter, yes.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. All right.

<A - John C. Gerspach>: Jim, we start with the $4 billion penalty. Then you've got the $500 million that we'll pay to
the State AGs and the FDIC. You add to that the cost of the consumer relief, because there are hard dollar costs
associated with the consumer relief efforts. And then you subtract out the reserves that we have previously established
and that's what leaves you with the $3.8 billion pre-tax number.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. No, fair enough. Just to follow up on the expenses and targets. I think we've
obviously seen revenues come down quite a bit in capital markets year-to-date. I think you guys as recently as early
June at a conference have been sticking with your targets, and I've had some questions on how you guys get there with
lower revenues. Is this part of the reason why restructuring costs are going to remain higher because you're doing more
on the expense side? So I guess I just want to see if that's right and if you feel still comfortable with your ROA and
efficiency ratio targets given where you are right now?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, we're still committed to those targets for 2015 and as we've said, we're very focused
on our execution efforts and in – and rationalizing the expense base in every one of our businesses.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: And so the weaker revenues don't give you pause?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, I mean, I don't want to be so cavalier about it, Jim, to just say that we don't consider
the weaker revenues, but we've taken all of that into consideration when we say that we're still committed to those
targets.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right. Right. Okay. No, that's great. And one last question just on deposit growth. You've
had very good core deposit growth in Citicorp, but Asia has lagged quite a bit in your international side. Is that simply a
function of Korea or is there something else going there more broad-based across Asia that's limited deposit growth?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, Jim, we're carefully managing deposit growth and we have been managing deposit
growth for some time. You can't just manage deposit growth at the top of the house, you need to manage it in each
country and frankly, in each legal vehicle. And so as we look at the liquidity needs for each of our – each of the
countries in which we operate, we're very focused on the level of deposits that we have and importantly, the quality of
those deposits. So you're going to see – you'll see some regions where we have targeted higher deposit growth than
others. And it's really based upon the liquidity needs in each of those regions.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. So it's just you guys holding it back?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We're carefully managing the deposits.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right. Okay. That's all I got.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: You have to manage your balance sheet.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: No, I hear you. Okay. Thanks. I appreciate it.

<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi. Thanks.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hey, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hello, there. Quick in Holdings, heard your comments about second half profitability, which
is cool. I'm just curious on the net interest revenue side, net interest revenues have increased last three quarters in a
row, but assets, loans and deposits are obviously shrinking with the whole runoff. Just curious on how that works?

<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, there's yield on assets and then there's cost of funds. And we have been actively
managing both sides of that equation. So when you take a look at it, you start to lower your cost of funds as you runoff
assets and that produces the results that you're looking at.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: That makes sense to me on cost of funds. I'm curious mechanically how that works. Is that
assigning the relative – meaning when the book is larger and they're less liquid, it gets a higher cost and as the book
gets smaller and more liquid, you get a better funding cost. Is that the big swing in there? I mean, it's like $150 million,
it's not enormous but it's just counterintuitive?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, it's the type of funding that you have and the level – and certainly the amount of
funding that you have in each business as well. And as the cost of that funding then goes down, you're going to get a
benefit. I don't know how else to describe it. Clearly, some of the characteristics that you mentioned are driving
characteristics. Highly illiquid assets have a higher cost of fund, or cost more to fund than liquid assets. And so as a
book shifts from illiquid to more liquid, you're going to see that we can therefore change the funding profile.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Yes. I'm good with it. I appreciate it. The same kind of question inside the equities business,
you mentioned some of the weakness was due to obviously lower volumes. The other part was – I think I read a tagline
on hedging on the Ukraine side produced part of the drop. Can you just give a further comment? I didn't see it in the
release, but I think I saw it online.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes. No, in the second quarter, again this is specific to the equities markets, the trading
business, in the second quarter; we had hedged our equities book in EMEA in anticipation of kind of a significant
negative market reaction to the Russia/Ukraine situation. Ultimately, that did not materialize to the extent that we had
planned for. And so as a consequence, our actions to de-risk the book actually resulted in realized losses during the
quarter. So, the realized losses that we took in lifting those hedges equaled about 40% of the revenue decline in that
product year-on-year. So, we had a – equities markets were down 26% year-over-year and so that the de-risking
activities actually contributed about 10 full percentage points to that decline.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Got it. Okay, super helpful. And then the last one, in the FX business, I know this is a hard
one, but the slowdown that we have seen, the environment, obviously volatility has fallen off dramatically. Is there any
way to attribute how much of that is the cyclical obvious of just lower volatility, lower client volumes, lower revenues
to changes that have taken place in light of the recent investigations in the market?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I think that's going to be really difficult to try to parse out.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: It's Mike. And I would say a couple of things. I think that, again, when you think of our FX
business there's a couple of components to it, which in some ways makes it different from others. One is, we've got the
big transaction processing business and money is coming through the pipes that we process on a regular basis. I think to
your question, where we've seen the real slowdown is on the more active trading and just that largely being as a result
of the lower volatility. So I would view a lot of that as being largely cyclical and I would expect as volatility comes
back, some reasonable portion of that to come back with the volatility.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. That's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks Mike.

when the Q comes out?

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. Fair enough. Thought I'd ask. I wanted to ask a question on the potential for the
significant deposit movements in the probably foreseeable future at this point when the Fed starts to move short-term
rates higher. It seems like the mechanics are going to be different than they've been in the past for all the reasons that
we all know about. And I think we can say that there is a couple of schools of thought as to what might happen when
short-term rates go up. One is deposits had really only shrunk a couple of times in the last century or so. It has always
been very marginal, so not to worry.
And then on the other hand, JPMorgan has flagged their view kind of at the other end of the spectrum that maybe this
time it's different because the mechanics of what the Fed's going to do will be so different and may require a drain of,
they've said, maybe a $1 trillion of bank deposits. As you think about liquidity planning and your internal stress testing,
is there anything that you can share with us about the range of best and worst case deposit growth that you might be
thinking about?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'm not going to give you a range, Guy, but I'll say this, I'd say that when you think about
the potential impact of the Fed's actions on deposits, one, we're probably less exposed than others on this. Don't forget,
we've got of our $968 billion of deposits, it's just a little over $400 billion are domestic deposits. So it's not the biggest
part of our book. And as I mentioned in response to one other question, we've really been managing our deposit base
very carefully over the last few years.
And so I think the other thing you need to consider is the quality of an institution's deposit base. And I think that what
we have been able to achieve is an improvement in our quality of deposits both internationally, but specifically
domestically over the course of the last several years. We are much more focused on and much more concentrated in
real operating accounts. We've really driven down the level of time deposits that we have in the business.
And importantly, when you look at some of the Fed's actions, I think that they're more likely to impact deposits that
people take in from financial institutions. And if you're managing your deposit base in connection with the LCR and
NSFR rules, you're going to be lowering that deposit base anyway, so you should be less susceptible to big deposit
movements because in the LCR and the NSFR rules, deposits associated with financial institutions, you get very little if
any credit for the liquidity value of those deposits. So they really bring you nothing as part far as managing your overall
funding, your overall liquidity.
So we've been very focused on managing all the aspects of the deposit base over the past couple of years, both as to the
nature of the deposits, the liquidity value of those deposits, and really trying to focus on core operating deposits of both
retail and corporate customers.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. So the follow-up question was going to be how all of this might interact with LCR,
but it sounds like what you're saying is that the LCR shouldn't change very much even with the kinds of flows that
might be associated with that type of Fed activity because they would probably be low LCR credit deposits anyway.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, it's going to be really interesting to see how the Fed goes about the next level of
managing as far as increasing rates because when you take a look at how monetary policy is going to interact with
regulatory policy, I think we're going to end up in a new world that none of us have lived through before, nor has the
Fed.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Great. And then the final question for me, just on the core equity Tier 1 ratio that as you
noted, did pick up. That I believe is an advanced calculation. Is that right? And if so, can you just tell us what the
standardized was?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, the number that we published is the advanced methodology because again, our Tier 1
common ratio is lower under advanced than it is currently under standard. I don't have the standard in front of me, Guy,
but it's higher than what the advanced approach produces.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. Fair enough. And thanks for the thoughtful answer on the deposit outflows. That was
very helpful.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Not a problem.

Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: A couple of questions. One is on the op risk RWAs. You noticed – you mentioned at the
bottom of page 19 that the op risk RWAs are flat Q-on-Q at $288 billion well for the last three quarters and I guess I'm
just wondering, does that imply that the kind of settlement that we just had this morning was reflected in your RWA
outlook before?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, that's our view, Betsy, that this settlement was already embedded in the increases that
we took to the op risk risk-weighted assets both in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay because then when we're looking at these articles that are out there and obviously we
don't know how much is reflective of your views, but you went in with a lower bid for the settlement than the ultimate,
final settlement. So I'm just trying to square that.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, don't forget, it's a – what usually impacts op risk is the overall industry more than a
particular institution.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. So you would have thought that like the numbers that JPM came out with was more
relevant than what the initial ask was that you might have had for yourself? Is that the way to think about it?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: The way to think about it is really the operational risk environment that the industry is
facing, and we think that that is really was already embedded in the $288 billion number...
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then we...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: ...that we had as of the end of the first quarter.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then we also have a couple of more things that still need to get resolved.
Obviously, it's been in the headlines for a while, things like LIBOR and FX, and so would those also be embedded
within this number as well?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Based upon everyone's current views as to what those could be.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. A separate question on the Citicorp – Corporate/Other, it's page 14. Just wanted to
make sure I understand the expected sustainability of these numbers versus one-timers in this quarter. Revenues down
because of hedging activities, maybe I could just understand what your thoughts are for that line item? How much did
hedging activities impact that? Would that have been more like $140 million, last year's – sorry, last quarter's revenue
line?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, I think that when you take a look at Corp/Other, you're going to get a variation
around $100 million from quarter-to-quarter. Sometimes it'll be a little bit less than $100 million, sometimes it'll be a
little bit more than $100 million.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, on the revenue side?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Correct.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And then on the expenses, a little bit of higher legal and regulatory compliance. So I'm just –
legal sounds like it's a one-timer, but reg compliance, I'm not sure if that's a one-timer or if that just keeps going, so
how much should I be thinking about the expense line now?

<A - John C. Gerspach>: When you take a look at the first – I'd take a look at the core operating expenses
sequentially.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Yes.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And if you look at them, sequentially, the $284 million and the $297 million are fairly close.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right. So legal and repo should fade over the next I suppose a couple of years. Is that how to
think about that?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, certainly, repositioning, as I said, repositioning costs overall for Citi should be – the
second half should be somewhat in line with what we had in the first half. And legal, as I said, I think that's going to
remain elevated, but it's also going to be somewhat episodic in nature.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right. Okay. And then just lastly on page 11, you have the consumer expense drivers. And as
of 2Q, in some cases you've already exceeded what your year-end forecast is, does that suggest your year-end forecast
will be updated or we're just running ahead of schedule and the levers for the expense line in Global Consumer are
largely around the support sites at this stage?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, I'd say yes to everything that you said. So when you look at some of the drivers, we are
running ahead of where we thought we would be on – clearly on head count. We didn't feel that we could update you
with a new year-end target at this point in time, so we will likely give you a better view as to where we're going to be at
year-end when we come back to you in the third quarter. But obviously, it should be lower than the 145,000 that we are
right now. As a matter of fact, if you look at the target, we had said it's going to be less than 145,000. Less than
145,000 will give you a sense as to how low we think we'll be able to drive that next quarter.
And I think as far as from a support site point of view, that clearly is a big driver of expense in the consumer
businesses. And that is something that we're very focused on. Good progress in the second quarter taking those support
sites down by about 30. And we hope to be able to do that and more in the third and fourth quarter.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And that's in part the benefit from the Project Rainbow?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: In part, it's Rainbow. It's also we've talked about in the past trying to run the consumer
business as opposed to a collection of 35 individual consumer businesses as more of a global consumer bank. And so
that clearly has some aspect of it, but there's also aspects that we can do just in the U.S. where in the U.S. we sort of ran
the consumer business not as a bank, but as a collection of product silos. And so as we begin to run the U.S. more as a
retail bank, that also gives us the ability to close down sites and consolidate.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. So there should be more to come here on the expense outlook?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: That's what we're saying, yes.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Yes, yes, okay.

Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. A few questions. First, how much was the Ukraine hedging loss?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, I didn't give you an exact dollar amount, Mike, but you can figure it out by the fact
that I said it cost about 10%. So let's call it just slightly around $100 million or so.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And as it relates to Korea, you're saying the headwind should be abating. Can you give us
any net income figures for Korea or revenues or some additional detail that you don't disclose in the press release?

Page 14 of 26
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'm not going to go into specifics. We don't do specific country results. I will tell you this;
our view is that, again, revenues should be now growing sequentially in Korea. Excluding the repositioning charge, for
the first time in several quarters, Korea actually turned a pre-tax profit. So again, we're encouraged as to the future
direction of our consumer franchise in Korea.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: As it relates to expenses, a few people have asked about this, but when I go back to March 2013
presentation that gave efficiency targets, it said the high end of efficiency assumes flat revenues? And revenues for the
first half of this year versus last are down 3%. So once again, why are you still comfortable with your efficiency targets
for 2015 when revenues have been so much worse. And you highlighted slide 10 and slide 13, your efficiency targets
for Global Consumer and ICG, just can you confirm that is for the entire year 2015? You still expect to get not only
those two targets but for Citicorp as a whole?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes. I confirm that.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And [ph] if I had to give (57:05) a very short answer, you've given a lot of things that you're
doing, why can you still reach those efficiency targets even though revenues have been so much worse?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Mike, it's Mike. I think as John kind of walked through things, we've been taking a
multi-pronged approach to things. So the combination of head count, support sites, tech data information, we've been
going across the board at different levers that we can pull to try and keep the expenses in line. And again, I think as we
think about the second half of the year certainly on a sequential basis, we're feeling better. I think if you look at the
underlying drivers and fundamentals of the business, deposits, loans what's going on in TTS, what's going on in the
Investment Banking side of things, despite market challenges, parts of the firm are performing well and we think in the
second year, there's some continued revenue uplift there. And so again, the combination of both levers around the
efficiency ratio, the combination of revenue lift with expense discipline gets us to where we need to be.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then I guess the one wildcard is still legal. And I know this settlement was a lot more than I
expected or was more than almost any shareholder that I spoke with expected. And so if you can just give any
additional color. I mean I just read one article saying that the Department of Justice didn't want to hear about your
small market share in some of the mortgage areas whereas that seems to be a relevant consideration. So, why did you
go ahead and settle for what is a huge amount in the minds of many shareholders as opposed to pushing this on, and
what does this mean for your remaining legal issues and what are your remaining legal issues, the way you think about
it?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Well, I think when you look at our settlement, Mike, there's two components to it. One is
the RMBS, which has been quantified, and then if you've got to go down the list to have actually [ph] find us (58:59)
on the list in terms of our size and participation. But I think the other side of that is what we did in terms of putting the
CDO litigation behind us. And when you go back and you look at our participation in CDOs, you look at 2005, 2006,
2007, we were somewhere at or near the top of the league tables year-in and year-out in CDOs, and so this was very
important to get behind us and I think meaningful. And again as I think we went through the negotiation, we felt to get
this behind us that this was something that was in our shareholders' best interest to move on from.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And what remains? I assume FX and LIBOR are the big ones. How should we think about that
potential exposure or am I correct in assuming those are the two big remaining legal exposures?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: We don't comment, Mike, in terms of forward-looking legal.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And last question, if interest rates increased by 100 basis points, what's the benefit to
Citigroup today versus say a quarter ago?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: A quarter ago, I think we told you it was somewhere between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion
for a parallel shift in the interest rate move – if interest rates move by a 100 basis points. That's about 100 basis points
higher, so now it's somewhere between $1.9 billion and $2 billion.

Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks. I guess I was sort of wondering, I mean when you had last spoken at a
conference toward the end of May, you had mentioned that you thought the entire Markets revenue would be down
20% to 25% and the FICC performance substantially better. And you kind of addressed a little bit around that, but is it
as simple as that June was better than the previous months? Could you talk a little bit about that and maybe put it in the
context of current activity for the last couple of weeks and into the third quarter?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, I'd say that June was certainly a much better month overall from what we had – the
way we had viewed the market performance when we spoke at the conference at the end of May. And several events
transpired at the end of May, beginning of June that had a calming influence on the markets, specifically as it relates to
spread products. So, everything from the Crimea referendum, everything just sort of seemed to calm down and it was
just a better overall environment, as I said, mostly for spread products in the month of June.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: And that's kind of continued to show through in July so far?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Again, it's been just a couple of days in July. Let's not get too carried away.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Okay. Another question kind of unrelated and that is, given the strengths of your capital
and the high level of capital generation, are there ways that you can actually kind of use that capital position before you
have an opportunity to return capital next year? I mean are there activities that you had reduced or stopped doing that
you would consider doing again? I mean are there any ways to think about that for the back half of this year, just given
I mean even the sin buckets, are there ways to use those just given the strength of that capital position?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I think, Moshe, if you'd go back, I think there's a couple of different ways we potentially
think about using it. One is, we're not going to do stupid things with it around putting risk on it, doesn't make sense or
doesn't fit the business model. But I think you go back, you look at Best Buy, and I think going forward, there'll
probably be the opportunity to take a look at some more portfolios that might come available. And so again, we'd take a
hard look at those and if they're accretive to the business, we'd be prepared to act on those. Clearly, we continue in our
invest-to-grow markets to grow and whether that's footprint, clients, balance sheet, and so we're putting our capital to
work in those areas. And I'd say those are probably the two primary things that we look at in terms of capital use.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Just to follow up on that, Mike, the private label card is an area where there have been a
couple of portfolios that are up for sale. Any other areas that you would just specifically highlight where you've seen
kind of opportunities to put capital to work?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I think that the private label card, I think there's potentially some things coming forward in
the cards business. John talked a little bit about we've been pleasantly surprised in terms of the uptake on the American
Airlines portfolio, opportunities to continue to grow organically, but I would say, away from those things, Moshe, we're
largely focused on what we can do organically around our business model. And again, you've seen both in consumer
and both in ICG pretty good loan growth.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: True. Thank you very much.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Yes, all right Moshe.

Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning. Following up on the comments about the good loan growth in
ICG group, you guys had very strong corporate lending revenue growth in the quarter. Can you give some color where
the corporate loan growth is coming from?

<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Now again, it's pretty widespread. Trade products have continued to perform well. We
actually saw a slight rise in loan spreads in trade loans this quarter. And we had good uptake on – from a corporate
lending point of view in both Europe and North America, some of that was related to activity in the capital markets area
and M&A, but again, it's been pretty good.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: The results for the second quarter in years past the large banks' second quarter results often
reflected the Shared National Credit exam. Can you give us some color? Do the results reflect – your results this
quarter reflect any changes that the regulators may have had due to this SNC exam. And maybe where does that stand
right now, the SNC exam?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, I'm not aware that we had to make any significant changes as a result of the Shared
National Credit exam.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Another question, sticking with the ICG group, can you guys estimate how much of the
falloff in the trading revenues are cyclical versus secular? I know it's a difficult question but the volatility is certainly
down in this business. Hopefully it will come back to drive revenues higher. But can you give us an estimate of what
you think it might be? And then as part of that, are you at a size, if it is a secular decline, are you comfortable with the
size of your expense base if it is – part of it is the secular decline?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, as you said, Gerard, it's really hard to come up with an actual number as to what is
cyclical versus secular. We continue to evaluate how we view the various offerings that we have in those markets
businesses. And we constantly adjust our capacity to where we think the new secular trend is. So, again, it's somewhat
product by product as opposed to just, say, it's markets in general.
And, again, it's things move based upon market conditions. Take a look at our FICC revenues for this quarter. FICC
revenues were down 12%. Now that was primarily driven by rates and currencies. Rates and currencies are going to
respond to what's going on in the market but even the rates and currencies, rates and currencies were down something
close to 30% for the quarter. But you're looking – you're comparing rates and currencies this second quarter compared
to the second quarter of 2013, and the second quarter of 2013 was a relatively strong quarter for rates and currencies.
And in fact, our results in the second quarter benefited from some outsized gains that we took as we correctly lowered
our inventories in our local markets business in anticipation of increased negative sentiment in the EM associated with
the tapering. So the absence of those prior-year gains associated with the de-risking contributed probably a full six
percentage points to the year-over-year decline in risk and currencies revenues. And so, risk and currencies down 23%
year-over-year, that's kind of in line with what you would, I think, expect from a seasonal point of view and in the
current environment.
So hard to find that there's something dramatically secular going on there. When you look at spread products on the
other hand, spread products were up just about 30% year-over-year. And basically, the entire year-on-year increase
occurred in the month of June following the improvement in market sentiment that I referenced earlier. So, you're still
seeing a lot of cyclical that's running through the various businesses at this point.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: And I think to the second part of your question, if you go to slide 13, ICG is not standing
and watching. If you go back and look at slide 13, you see the nine consecutive quarters. You see from a core operating
expense the business has taken out about $1.1 billion of operating expenses. So again, continuing to stay focused on the
model and the cyclical versus secular and trying to make sure we're adjusting to those two pieces.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Shifting gears, moving on to Citi Holdings, you gave us some good color about the pending
sales that you have in the pipeline. And I think you said almost $1 billion of that number comes from mortgage loans.
What are you seeing in pricing for the distressed assets in the mortgage area? I'm assuming it has improved, but by how
much?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's improved. I can't give you an actual figure quarter-on-quarter. I just don't have it in my
head, but it has improved. But again, it's improved, but you have to take a look at those loans broken out by a bunch of
different categories. And also by the location of the loans by specific MSA codes. So it isn't as though the entire market

is repriced up by 500 basis points or something like that. It really is product-dependent and market-dependent. And, as
you know, we have been very active sellers of these mortgages in the past. So it's not that we haven't already gone
through this book and done a lot of sales activity.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: In view of putting this mortgage problem behind you with the settlement today, is there
ever a reason to do a very large bulk sale in Citi Holdings to put it behind you? Is that ever feasible?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I think it's all dependent upon price. If the price was right, we'd be happy to do it. I think
based on current market prices and you can see the improvements on the NCLs and you can do your own market check
and look at what the market would pay for these assets versus the funding collect out value. And today I'd say it's not
there. But if it were to present itself, we'd be happy to react to it.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Would you say it's extremely wide from what you – in terms of market prices versus what
you're comfortable with or are we within – is it something that within the realm of possibility?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Well, I think – again, I think as John said, you can't just take the entire portfolio and lump it
because it goes through first through seconds through the old CFNA mortgages and all are very different and all have
very different pricing characteristics to it. So it's probably most likely amongst the prime first, you'd get closed first and
as you move down that spectrum, that bid to offer spread, so to speak, would probably widen out. But again, as we've
looked at what we want to sell, it's not just the headline asset reduction, but more importantly, it's the removal of risk,
it's the removal of costs of servicing and in particular special servicing against these and obviously capital release. So
we look at it against what we see the risk adjusted earnings power of the asset is and if it's close we're happy to move
on. I would say for a lot of the portfolio today, we don't see that, but not to say it won't happen at some point in the
future.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Great. And then just last question, I may have missed this, I apologize. You guys have
moved very swiftly in reducing your branch count globally, but in North America as well. Is there much left to do in
North America in terms of reducing the number of branches in the consumer business?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I think you'll see continued centralization of our branches around the key metropolitan
areas, again, in accordance with our stated strategy where we want to really focus on the large cities. So I still think that
there's some level of branch rationalization yet to go.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Co.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Yeah, good morning.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Earlier in the quarter there were a number of press reports about attempts to sell OneMain
Financial and I'm just thinking, does it make sense for Citi to sell a profit-making company for cash that it can't return
to shareholders? Or is there a way to spin it out to shareholders? Or would that get caught up in the whole CCAR
process? Or would it count as a disposition if you do it that way?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Well, I think, again, kind of going back, we've, in my words, crossed the bridge back in
2009 when we placed OneMain into Holdings or at that point, CitiFinancial into Holdings, and while it's a terrific
business, the subprime unsecured lending business is not a business that's core to who we are or our client base or our
future. So again, what we've said is we want to, in essence, maximize the exit value for our shareholders, and we've
been running that and in accordance with that. And I think as we've shown in Holdings dispositions, we're wide open to
different structures. Spin, sale, different approaches are on the table and I think as we get closer to kind of looking at
that exit, we'll certainly weigh all of those.

Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Hi. How are you? Maybe if we could just step back for a few minutes and talk about the list
of strategic priorities, Mike, that you've articulated since you moved into the CEO role. There was, of course, the
operating expense reductions, the DTA utilization, the resumption of revenue growth across different regions, the
reallocation of resources among different global geographies that maybe were under scale and maybe an unspoken one
was some of the resizing that would occur inside ICG. So I just wonder now, where would you say you are – like,
which inning are you in with respect to those various priorities?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Well, I think if you go back, and you touched on some, so I think you've seen from the
efficiency ratio perspective and your operating expenses, I think you've seen pretty consistent progress against moving
towards the target that we set out for the company. I think that when you look at things such as DTA, at the point we
really stated the priority of DTA utilization, DTA was still going the wrong way, it was still increasing and I think since
that point in time we've showed the consistent ability to use it. I think a piece you didn't mention in there was we said,
John and I had put out, that by the end of 2015 we wanted to get Holdings to break-even, and I think this quarter got us
there a little bit early and it's our job to work to try and obviously sustain that.
And I think, candidly, the most challenging part of it has really been the revenue side of things, it's been the
environment. I think a combination of the economic, the regulatory and the political nature of things around the world
has probably made things more challenging than we certainly would have liked. We've tried to continue to adjust the
business model to that. So I think that we've made progress on everything that we've set out to do. We've got more
work to do. We're not going to rest until we get there. But I feel quite good and quite proud of what we've managed to
accomplish in the last year and a half or so.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And you touched on the benefits to the reductions from the sale of Greece and Spain, but
were there any geographies or – that sort of moved into the [ph] full (77:33) review bucket in the past quarter or two
quarters that maybe we're, the market isn't aware of?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: No, I think, again, we showed the optimized list as part of the 2013 exercise. John spoke
earlier to the progress against that bucket that, in fact, we've made about 330 basis points of efficiency gains in 2013
and we've continued to get those gains in 2014. And what we've said I think remains consistent today that we need to
have a pathway or line of vision or line of sight to those businesses or geographies making sense over the intermediate
or longer timeframe. And so if we discover businesses or believe there are businesses that can't get there, they'll
absolutely come under strategic review.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And last question from me, on slide 24, the last 12 months return analysis, the 10% that's
listed there and then there is the callout box of – including the DTA, would be 13%? Your disclosure changed a little
bit from the prior quarter, so I'm just curious would that number have increased the number excluding the DTA? Would
that have increased sequentially this period?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, actually, it – on a trailing 12 month basis, because we've generated more capital, our
denominator has increased and therefore has lowered the return.

<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Right. So that actually got to the crux of my question, that the compounding of capital is
occurring at a rate faster than what's occurring in the numerator, is that effectively correct?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: That's exactly what's going on.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay.

Your next question will come from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Hi. Good morning. So I had just couple quick questions here. You said that the revenues
in Citi Holdings benefited from the asset sales done there. Can you give us what the dollar impact was from the benefit
and was it all through NII?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, the dollar amount of the asset sales is somewhat similar to the dollar amount that we
had disclosed last quarter as far as the benefit of asset sales which was somewhere in the vicinity of $200 million or so.
So it's roughly flattish to the first quarter.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Okay. And then [indiscernible] (80:26) Citi Holdings, I mean end of period loans went
down $8 billion, other assets went down about $300 million, but the total assets and they only went down $3 billion,
what's the driver of the delta there? Is it organic growth?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, what we've done – you're focused on Holdings, right? I just want to sure.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Yeah, just Holdings only.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah. As we signed to sell the businesses in Spain and Greece, they come out of the loan
book and they go into assets held for sale. So they move down into in other assets category. That's the way that – once
you've got an asset held for sale, you one line the assets and one line the liabilities of those businesses and so therefore
they come out of loans or whatever balance sheet line they are in and they all go down to other assets and other
liabilities, that's all.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Okay. And then within the efficiency ratio that you looked at in the Global Consumer
Banking you said that excluding Korea and mortgage banking would meaningfully lower but even if you back out the
expenses related to Korea this quarter, I mean it's still mortgage banking as being a drag on the efficiency ratio. Do you
still think that market share gains is enough to improve the efficiency ratio there or do you actually need to do more

repositioning in North America mortgage?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, we've actually been taking the – the expenses have been coming out of North America
mortgages. Now, they come out of mortgages on somewhat of a lag basis because you tend to recognize your revenues
especially when you're doing originate to sell, you tend to recognize the revenues when you lock in the rate, when you
do a rate lock. And then you still have another quarter where you've got to do all the processing in order to really make
the sale. But in general, the expenses have been coming down in North America. We think we've got the – with the
expense reductions that we should expect to see in the third quarter, I think that the business is properly sized both from
an – certain from an expense point of view compared to the level of originations that we would expect to get out of that
business.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.

Your next question will come from the line a Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: John, first on – just a follow up on Holdings. So the adjusted operating margin has gotten
up to $700 million with the help from that couple hundred million of gains. Is it fair to say that we're now kind of in
this new higher range for that operating margin for Citi Holdings? Or is it still just dependent on whether or not you can
get those gains every quarter as you continue to make incremental sales?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'd say it's still dependent upon our ability to get those gains. So I would tend to look more
at the $500 million as the level we would expect in that business, somewhere between $400 million and $500 million.
And if we get a reasonable amount of asset sales, then you'd get up to the $700 million level.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay. And then secondly, on credit quality, this quarter it's interesting that the reserve
release in consumer and specifically in North American card was bigger that it's been for a while, and then conversely,
the mortgage release in Holdings was actually smaller. So can you help us dimension what – how we should think
about aggregate release going forward and what you anticipate would be the bigger drivers from here?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, the – clearly, the reserve release that we had in cards, as I tried to indicate in some of
the remarks that I made, that was in really in response to the fact that the credit performance in cards just got a lot
better than what we had been anticipating at the end of the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter, we were talking
about overall North America NCL rates sort of leveling off at 3% for the year. And we just continue to see much more
favorable delinquency experience as well as NCL experience in both branded cards and retail services. And we expect
that level of NCL and delinquency to continue. So that's what really drove the reserve release in the second quarter. I
don't expect that the reserve releases in those two cards businesses to stay at the level that we've had in either the first
or the second quarter as we move into the second half of the year.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: And then on the mortgage side, is it just more dependent on sales from here than it is on
credit performance?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, if you take a look at just at mortgages, I believe that if you look at the reserve release as
a percentage of the NCLs that we took in mortgages, it's roughly equivalent to where we had been. I think that the
reserve release was equal to about 86% of the net credit losses that we had in the Holdings' mortgage book, and we had
been looking between 85% and 90% in any of the last several quarters. So that reserve release is likely going to be,
again, somewhere in that 85% to 90% range of the NCLs that we ultimately charge off in mortgages.

<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay. And then quick question on the asset yield; so you mentioned that the NIM should be
stable from here, deposit costs look to have flattened. So can you talk to us about incremental loan yields and
incremental securities purchases and then ability to continue to just grow overall balance sheet in terms of NII dollars?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Our expectation is that loans will continue to grow. I mean we still have loan growth in –
again, focus on the Citicorp business. Citicorp loans grew 8% year-over-year and we anticipate, again, still getting
good healthy loan growth in our Citicorp businesses. Those loan growth, even if spreads come down a little bit on
loans, that still gives you a nice healthy contribution to your NIR and your NIM. I think you're right as far as deposit
cost, I think that's probably going to be somewhat flattish from here on out, maybe a slight uptick but not much. And –
but we still have the ability to lower our overall cost of funds as we continue to issue – rollover the long-term debt at
more favorable spreads than what we were issuing several years ago.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay. And then – last question then on that last point, John. As far as the long-term debt,
and then also more importantly, the continued preferred issuance and I think you guys are still around 70 basis points of
BIII RWAs, can you give us an understanding of just how much of that long-term debt is to roll and then also your
general issuance plans on how much of that preferred bucket you want to continue to get done?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, as far as long-term debt, I think we're pretty much at the level certainly of the
long-term debt held at the holding company. We're pretty much at the level that we think we need to be on a full-year
basis. And so there will continue to be issuance. We'll give you an update on those issuance plans when we do our
Fixed Income Conference towards the end of this week. But I think it's pretty much in line with the guidance that we
gave out at the end of the first quarter. And we will continue to be an issuer of preferred stock. We recognize that we've
got some preferred stock issuance to do over the next three to five years. So we will be issuing preferred stock, but in a
somewhat paced approach.

positive commentary about underwriting strength and M&A strength, and I guess I'm trying to get a little more color
on, was that just in the U.S. or you feel you're gaining share across the different geographies, Asia, Europe, and the
U.S. in both of those businesses?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'd say it's fairly widespread. Obviously, it's going to be a little bit heavier in some
geographies than others. And I don't want to get into a geography-by-geography commentary. But again, it's a
widespread improvement in the second quarter certainly in the wallet share. And again, as we look to the wallet share
that we're capturing in the announced M&A, again, that's fairly broad-based.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. And then just returning to slide 24, I appreciate the breakout of the average
allocated TCE, which I presume is going to be updated annually. I guess I'm curious as to the $42 billion of TCE
allocated to Corp/Other, is that going to stay at a roughly similar amount to the total Citigroup capital or could that be
moved down into some of the operating units over time?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, when we set up the amount equal to Corp/Other, we laid out the rationale for how we
got there. It's a little bit of the operations that we have in Corp/Other. Importantly, it's where we hold the capital
associated with the DTA. It's where we hold some of the op risk capital that we can't quite allocate to other businesses.
And importantly, as we continue to generate capital far in excess of our ability to distribute capital, that amount will
grow over time. So we'll do an annual re-appropriation based upon what the level of capital that we think is appropriate
for each business. But as long as we continue to be net generators of TCE, you're going to see more of that in the

Corp/Other number.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. And just finally from me, you mentioned that the impact of 100 basis points higher
rate is slightly more at the end of June than it was at the end of March, I noticed that your securities, your investment
portfolio is up about 8% year-over-year, up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Can you update us on what the estimated
reduction in your tangible common equity would be from a 100 basis point higher rate environment?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Again, we'll put this all out next – probably when we do the Fixed Income Conference, but
my recollection is that it goes to about $3.4 billion.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay, thanks very much for taking my questions.

Your next question will come from the line of Derek De Vries with UBS.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Great. Thanks. I have a couple questions on Latin America. I guess, starting with last week,
the Mexican Antitrust Authority published recommendations on reform. I was hoping you could give us some of those
key recommendations and maybe talk a little bit about the impact that could have on Banamex?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I have to tell you, we don't view what was published last week as having any significant
near-term impact on Banamex. I'd say that the industry is still sorting through what was published and it's still in the
early stages of analysis.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Maybe a little more concrete, the provisions in Latin America ticked up and I take on board
your comments about portfolio growth and seasoning, but if there's nothing sort of one-off in nature there, is this a level
we should sort of expect going forward from Latin America or is there some one-off things in there?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's not necessarily one-off, but again, most of the performance – the credit performance in
Latin America consumer really is being driven by Mexico cards. And the consumer in Mexico is still absorbing a little
bit of the fiscal reform actions that have gone through and, clearly, as the Mexico economy continues to struggle, to
really regain the momentum that everyone thought that it would have, consumer spending has not been robust.
So we would anticipate, and that's why we said that the NCL rate will remain relatively high through the end of this
year and that's why we said the Latin America NCL rate will probably stay at around the first half levels. But you
know, our – we do believe that once that gets behind us, there should be improvement in those NCL rates as we go into
next year. So we still feel very good about the – overall, the underlying credit quality in our Mexico cards portfolio.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Perfect. Thanks. And then I guess one last question, just touching on a subject you've talked
about a lot today. Last quarter you said that when you made your 2015 targets, you built in about 200 basis points in
your efficiency ratio for litigation, so obviously falling off a lot from this year. And I was just wondering, we're three
months further along, do you still feel comfortable you'll get enough of the litigation stuff behind you this year that the
200 basis points for litigation's still a good guess as to where it will come out next year?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Just to be clear, I believe that what I said was that the 200 basis points would cover both
repositioning as well as legal and related costs.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: You absolutely did. Apologies.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah. So we'll have to see. As we get closer to year end, we'll take a look. But again, we
still believe based upon what we look at today that we should be able to achieve the efficiency targets that we set out
for 2015.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Perfect. Thank you very much.

Your next question will come from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Good morning, guys. A couple of things.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hey, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: How are you? Just back on the balance sheet dynamics in a potentially changing rate
environment at some point and the deposit velocity question that Guy was getting to earlier, can you just help us
understand if you do have a certain level that you've baked into your modeling, or how you think about the [ph]
outcome (95:48) in terms of maybe that – I mean over half of the deposits are in fact from the ICG group and a third of
those are in North America. So it's still a relatively good contribution of total deposits, how you do think about maybe
isolating that component that could be at risk in terms of a reversal, once rates do eventually move higher?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, actually, we don't view that component as being at risk because of – certainly, I won't
say there isn't one dollar of deposit that isn't at risk, but the overall deposit level we don't view as being at risk,
especially on the TTS businesses, the Treasury and Trade Solutions deposits, because they really represent, for the most
part, operating account balances. And so those are the funds that businesses need to have in order just to conduct their
ongoing operations. So again, we feel relatively good about that. Now if the Fed tapering or the Fed comes in and does
something to try to drain liquidity out of the system, that could impact future deposit growth, but it's not likely to
impact the absolute level of deposit that we currently have in those businesses.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: All right. Okay, that's helpful. And then do you have an updated LCR ratio at this point?
Or is that something we should wait for another Fixed Income call question maybe?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, that calculation is still ongoing and we'll give that to you when we do the Fixed
Income call. It still is a very strong ratio. I just don't have it in front of me right now.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: The last quarter it was about 120-ish if I recall correctly.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, it's going to be just around that, maybe even slightly higher when we publish it this
week.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it. And then just lastly, I know there's been a lot of questions on the efficiency ratio
and goals sort of, but can you just help us understand, maybe just to dumb it down, like if in fact the revenue
environment remains tepid and tougher for longer, if the revenue environment is stagnant here [ph] that we certainly
see, (01:38:07) it sounds like there's room on GCB to move and then maybe on ICG as well, can the efficiency ratio
really be met if the revenue environment today stands as it is for another six quarters or so? Is that possible? Or is there
enough room on what you have already or would it drive you to kind of rethink maybe pulling another – something out
of the drawer to reconsider other things?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, let's think about the revenue environment that you referred to. All right? We have
ongoing revenue growth and have had ongoing revenue growth in Latin America even as Mexico has slowed down. So
the revenue environment for Latin America still seems to be in growth mode. And we feel very good about the way our
franchise is positioned there. When you take a look at Asia, we now have got the Korea repositioning behind us. And
we have had underlying growth in each of our franchises in Asia over the last several quarters but that has been offset
in many ways by the reduction in revenues in Korea. So we actually are quite constructive as far as the revenue
environment today in Asia. Asia consumer has producing growth both sequentially and year-over-year in the second
half of the year. So we feel really good about the performance of our Asia consumer franchise going forward.
In North America, we've got the mortgage repositioning out of the way, so our mortgage revenues stabilized in the first
quarter. They actually grew in the second quarter. We've got that business now positioned properly, we think, for the
way the market should move forward. And again, we're not looking to constantly gain – we don't look to be number
one or number two in that business. We just want to be able to serve our customers through our retail branches within
appropriate mix of correspondent business. So again, we're very constructive on what we've been able to do with the

mortgage business.
Branded cards I've mentioned, we've got purchase sales growth. We've got good underlying momentum in the full rate
of loans in that business and importantly in the products where we have actually been investing. When you take a look
at branded cards, branded cards I think the year-over-year sales growth, purchase sales growth, was about 5% but if you
look at the portfolios where we've actually been investing, the sales growth there year-over-year is upwards of 8%. So
again, we feel really good about the momentum and the revenue prospects for branded cards.
So in our consumer franchises, from a revenue momentum point of view, we feel good about the revenue momentum.
And then when you move over to the ICG, we look at the banking franchise, and again, with the past investments that
we've made in investment banking, we're doing very well as far as being able to maintain or actually grow wallet share.
We've had several quarters in a row now of $1 billion or $1 billion-plus revenue quarters. So again, we feel good about
the revenue momentum in that business.
We feel very good about the revenue momentum that we've got in transaction services – in TTS. Ten quarters, eight
quarters in a row we've struggled with spread compression overwhelming the volume growth, the contribution of
volume growth. Now that we see the impact of the spread compression beginning to abate, the impact of the volume
growth now actually is able to overcome the spread compression and so we feel good about the revenue prospects for
that business going forward. So then that leaves you with markets. I think we spend an awful lot of time focused on
what's going on in markets but markets while it's an important part of our business, it is not the largest contributor to
our overall revenue picture or our overall profitability. And so I think that there are some legitimate questions going
forward as far as markets, but the rest of the business, I'd say, we feel pretty good about the revenue prospects.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: That's helpful. Thanks for that summary. And then in terms of end markets and maybe it's
summarized in the ICG. When you referenced your – I think comp ratio this last quarter was 29% in line with last year,
should we expect that that should remain or could it tick higher just because as one referenced earlier as well still trying
to figure out how much is cyclical versus secular?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I think the 29% that I referenced is actually the comp ratio over a trailing 12-month basis.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: So that's 29% both for full-year 2013 and 29% for the last 12 months as measured as of the
end of this quarter.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: And should we expect that for the full year or is that...?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: You know I'm not going to forecast where comp ratios are going to be, but you can see that
we've been holding it fairly constant.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Thanks, guys.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay, no problem.

Your next question will come from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Good morning, Steven.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So one of your competitors provided some helpful disclosure on the advanced approach
framework under CCAR specifically, which reflected an additional 100 basis point decline in firm's Tier 1 Common
under stress. Due to the stressed RWA inflation under the Basel III advanced framework. And since the advanced
framework appears to be your binding capital constraint at the moment, I was wondering whether you've conducted a

similar assessment internally. And if so, if you could provide some guidance as to how the advanced approach
framework could further impact future risk-based capital ratios under CCAR?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I've got to tell you, I have not spent any time looking at what our peer institution put out
there. So I apologize.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Have you done the work yourselves, though?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'm not sure what they did. I don't know what they did. So I can't comment as to whether or
not we did something similar.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, fair enough. And then switching gears and as a follow up to Betsy's question on
operational risk capital, your comments indicated the $56 billion true-up proposed by the Fed or imposed by the Fed
late last year contemplate some buffer for litigation matters not yet resolved. And I was just wondering what the
process is for the Fed providing guidance on op risk capital levels. So is the feedback given quarterly or is it nearly
evaluated as part of the advanced model submissions, which from what I recall is actually an annual process?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, it's something that is under discussion periodically, but obviously it goes through a
much fuller exam on an annual basis.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. And then just one more from me on capital allocations. As part of your enhanced
segment disclosure on slide 24, the amount of capital allocated, exclusive of DTA, to support the operations in Corp
and Holdings and focusing, I guess, or excluding the Corporate/Other segment was a combined $126 billion or so,
which implies on current RWA level's about a 10% Tier 1 Common target. And I was wondering if we should think
about that 10% Tier 1 Common ratio as an appropriate through the cycle target for Citigroup at this juncture or is it
simply still too early to make such a determination?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Again, when you take a look at the underlying franchises, in Citi right now, we clearly think
that the Citicorp businesses are capable of producing mid-teens ROTCE. And again that's going to be. So the overall
firm's contribution to ROTCE is going to be dependent upon our ability to return capital at some point in time.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, thanks. And actually just one more quick question regarding the DTA disclosure. Can
you update us on the level of U.S. foreign tax credits that are subject to expiry by 2018? I know it was about $9.9
billion at the end of the year, but obviously you made some progress over the last two quarters?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, we update those disclosures on an annual basis. There is just too much movement
during individual quarters to actually come up with something that is relevant. So we'll update you at the end of this
year as to the progress that we've been making.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, that's it for me. Thank you for taking my questions.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Not a problem. Thank you very much.
