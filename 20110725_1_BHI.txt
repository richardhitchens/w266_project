Switching gears to the financials, this morning we reported net income of $408 million or $0.93 per share. This
excludes a Libya charge of $70 million, which would be $0.16 per share both before and after tax. This charge is
associated with increasing reserves for doubtful accounts, inventory, and certain other assets as a result of ongoing
events in Libya. Including these expenses on a GAAP basis, net income attributable to Baker Hughes for the second
quarter 2011 was $338 million or $0.77 per diluted share. Revenue was $4.74 billion, up 41% or up $1.37 billion
compared to a year ago and up 5% or $216 million sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.02 billion, up 80% or $469
million compared to year ago, and up 7% or $63 million from last quarter.
To help you in your understanding of the moving pieces, I'll bridge Q2 last year EPS to Q2 '11 EPS. GAAP EPS a year
ago was $0.23 per share. Add $0.13 for acquisition-related expenses in Q2 last year. Add $0.02 for the impact of the
lower tax rate this quarter, offset by a higher share count. Subtract $0.05 for higher corporate costs and net interest
expense. Operations and one extra month of BJ Services this quarter compared to a year ago added $0.60, which brings
us to $0.93 per share. Last, subtract $0.16 for the Libya charge. That brings us to $0.77 per share on a GAAP basis.
Bridging the sequential quarters, GAAP EPS for last quarter was $0.87 per share. First, subtract $0.02 per share for the
combination of a higher relative tax rate, higher share count, higher interest, and lower corporate expenses this quarter.
Operations added $0.08 per share, including the impact of the seasonal break-up in Canada. Last, the impact of Libya
was $0.16 per share, which gets us to $0.77 per share this quarter.
In Table 3 of our earnings release, we provide financial information on a pro forma combined basis with revenue and
profit before tax with BJ Services included into the prior period's results to allow meaningful comparisons between
quarters. It also excludes the impact of the $70 million Libya charge. From this point on in the conference call, any
comments on revenue, operating profit, and operating profit margin refer explicitly to Table 3.
Revenue in North America was $2.37 billion up 37% compared to a year ago and up 1% sequentially. North America
operating profits were $440 million, up $217 million year over year and down $20 million sequentially. North America
margins were at 18.6% compared to 13% a year ago and 20% last quarter.
As we said during the prior call, the seasonal impact of the Canada break-up in Q2 to North America results would be
significant. However, Canada has already started its recovery in Q3, supported by the rig count, which stands at 376
rigs as of Friday compared to an average of 187 rigs in Q2 and 587 rigs in Q1. In the Gulf of Mexico, we've incurred
some mobilization and regulatory compliance costs gearing up for the work we have been awarded for Q3 and Q4.

Moving to the international side, international revenue was $2.05 billion, up 16% compared to a year ago and up 8%
compared to the prior quarter. Operating profits were $276 million, up $157 million year on year and up $43 million
from the prior quarter. International margins were 13.5%, up 123 basis points sequentially, and up 675 basis points year
over year as we continue to progress towards our international operating margin target.
Our Industrial Services and Other segment revenue was $324 million, up 31% compared to last year and up 20%
compared to last quarter. Operating profit was $34 million, up $14 million compared to a year ago and up $20 million
sequentially as the segment recovered from a seasonally weak Q1, as we expected. Operating margin was 11%, up
from 5% last quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet, at quarter end, our total debt was $3.6 billion, down $233 million from the prior quarter,
reflecting the repayment of $250 million of maturing BJ Services notes in June. Our total debt-to-cap ratio was 19%,
and our capital expenditures were $594 million this quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $937 million of cash and
short-term investments. We also had $1.7 billion undrawn and available under our committed credit facilities.
And finally, I will provide you with our updated outlook for the balance of 2011. We now plan interest expense
between $210 million and $215 million for 2011. Corporate cost's now approximately at $270 million. Depreciation
and amortization expense is now approximately $1.37 billion – expected to be, I should say. Annual capital
expenditures at $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion, which is unchanged. And our tax rate unchanged between 34% and 36%,
excluding the impact of the Libya charge. The biggest factor impacting Q3 performance will be the partial seasonal
recovery in Canada. But don't expect a full rebound to Q1 levels.
I'll now turn the call over to Martin.
Martin S. Craighead
Thanks, Peter, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Prior to delving into the operational update, I'd like to take this
opportunity to tell you how we are better positioned to compete as a result of the integration of BJ Services.
Let's start with North America operations, where the proof of our strength is clearly demonstrated by the capture of
$400 million in new multi-serviced contracts during the quarter. These wins were primarily driven by the integration of
our pressure pumping, horizontal drilling, and completions technologies. The timing of combining the BJ Services
products and services into Baker Hughes couldn't have been better. We're now very well positioned to capture an
increasing proportion of the unprecedented levels of activity we're seeing in the unconventional shale place.
Near-term demand continues to outpace supply, but not only in pressure pumping but also directional drilling and
completion services. Sequentially, revenue improved in U.S. land at a pace more than twice that of the rig count, which
speaks to the growth in both the service intensity per rig as well as the emerging power of our fully combined
organization.
The service intensity per rig in the unconventional markets is being principally driven by three forces: First, rigs are
becoming more efficient as we work with our customers to address their drilling challenges. As such, we are routinely
posting improvements in rate of penetration and decreasing time from spud to total depth. Second, horizontal drilling
technology continues to improve. Baker Hughes has been a leader in pushing horizontals even further, with 10,000-foot
laterals now considered routine in some parts of the United States. And as AutoTrak Curve, a technology we introduced
last quarter, gains further market penetration, we expect this trend of longer lateral length to continue. And last is the
number of stages per well. Reservoir experts from Baker Hughes' Reservoir Development Services including
disciplines such as geomechanics are increasingly being called upon to evaluate and recommend the optimum fracture
techniques to efficiently drain these reservoirs.
Since the start of 2010, we've seen a 30% increase in the number of stages fracked per well, utilizing the plug and perf
technique, and a nearly 40% increase in the number of stages fracked in wells using our FracPoint technology.
Traditionally, an important metric for predicting revenue was rig counts. But one interesting dynamic that has changed
over the last year or so is that we are seeing a widening disconnect between the rig count and the potential for revenue

growth. Today, we're generating revenue beyond what the rig count would historically suggest by pushing new
technologies, such as AutoTrak Curve, FracPoint, and the In-Tallic balls, that when, coupled with services such as
sophisticated reservoir modeling and better well construction techniques, allows operators to drill longer laterals and
enhance production, all from a single well.
Now, obviously, these lateral lengths cannot continue to extend indefinitely, and there will be a point of diminishing
economic returns for the operator. But we haven't seen the end of the possibilities yet in the marketplace, and the
customers who understand the value of this higher-end technology are seeing more efficient and reliable production
performance. There's only a small set of providers who are capable of delivering these technological game-changers,
and Baker Hughes is one of those companies.
In previous updates, we told you that there were a number of metrics we would track to ensure we were unlocking the
value of our integration of the pressure pumping product line. As an example, one of these is tracking the total number
of discrete Baker Hughes services provided on each one of the wells we frac. And over the past three quarters, the
number of wells for which we are providing multiple services has more than doubled. This is evidence that Baker
Hughes is providing comprehensive solutions to our customers' unconventional reservoir challenges. We are creating
value for our customer by providing a more seamless and integrated operation. In turn, this drives substantial
incremental revenue and margin performance, benefiting our shareholders.
I'd like to give you a few examples of where these efforts are delivering results. In the Niobrara play, we were awarded
a one-year contract to supply directional drilling, drilling fluids, wireline, cementing, and pressure-pumping services
for a major IOC. In the Permian Basin, where we have a particularly large pressure-pumping footprint, we were
awarded – excuse me – we were awarded two multi-service contracts from large independents that include pressure
pumping, completion tools, bits, production chemicals, and wireline. And based on the unparalleled strength of our
completion tools segment, we have continued to grow our presence in the Bakken with an award from a new customer
who wanted to convert from a plug and perf completion technique to our new FracPoint 40-stage system. As a result of
this, we've been able to pull through a multitude of services, including pressure pumping.
Of course, this combined performance extends well beyond North America. In Argentina, we performed our
geomarket's first hydraulic fracturing job in an unconventional oil shale during the quarter. And in China, there is a
definite increase in the demand for horizontal completion technologies. And Baker Hughes has a long history of
providing that very technology. Over the years, we've successfully serviced more than 1,000 wells in some of China's
largest oil fields. Most recently, we successfully installed a 12-stage FracPoint system.
All of these multi-service examples are important, because they draw on the strength of a completely different Baker
Hughes than we were just a year ago, and we're just beginning to unlock the value of this integration, and I'd like to
acknowledge the substantial effort our people have put forward to make this a success.
Now, let me continue with the operating results by region.
Focusing on North America first. We had a strong quarter in U.S. land and posted improved results in the Gulf of
Mexico, which was offset by seasonally weaker results in Canada. The Gulf of Mexico rig count is up 19%
sequentially, following an initial burst of new permits. At the time, this was encouraging. However, the pace of issuing
permits has not been sustained, and the deepwater activity has not reached the levels yet that we need to achieve an
acceptable margin. We were underrepresented on the rigs that mobilized during the second quarter. However, current
rig schedules indicate our share will pick up measurably in the fourth quarter, provided our customers are granted the
permits that they're expecting.
And as these operators get back to work in the Gulf, the safety of both people and systems and the reliability of
processes and equipment are at the forefront of the industry's focus. Baker Hughes has invested in a meaningful way in
order to be fully capable of meeting these new and stricter offshore regulatory requirements. We've made these
important investments in order to provide best-in-class services to our customers, to be fully compliant with these
stricter regulations, and to help protect our people. These costs, which will continue through the next several quarters,
had a modest impact on Q2 results. It is our intention to recapture these costs over time, along with the higher value

that we are creating with these enhanced services.
Now, to the international market, where we continue to achieve sustained margin improvements. In Latin America, we
experienced strong revenue growth during the second quarter. In Brazil, Baker Hughes is the leading provider of
drilling services, and this quarter we continued to reinforce that position with our services on several new directional
wells in the pre-salt. Our foothold in Brazil extends beyond Petrobras, and we are heavily involved in a major
integrated heavy oil project where we are seeing measurable execution success from a number of our high-end MWD
and LWD technologies.
Furthermore, in Colombia, we continue to be pleased with the increase in activity, as well as our ability to capitalize on
the opportunities to grow revenue and margins. For example, we recently secured a new contract in Colombia that was
awarded solely on the strength of our drilling systems technology. This multi-well award will utilize our TruTrak
drilling system to drill 19,000-foot vertical wells in the tectonically active [ph] Piedmonte (16:25) Basin, where the
geology is some of the most challenging to drill in the world.
Performance in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions showed improvements. Activity rebounded strongly in
Asia-Pacific, as seasonal weather cleared up. Our improved results were driven by activity increases in Australia and
pressure pumping and completion tools sales in Malaysia. Sequentially, activity was up modestly in the Middle East.
We expect to see a measurable increase in the rig count during the second half of this year.
Wireline services are gaining momentum in Abu Dhabi and Qatar, as evidenced in substantial contract wins during the
quarter. In Iraq, consistent with the strategy we've laid out during the last several quarters, our focus has been on
near-term production enhancement, on building infrastructure, and gradually introducing all of our product lines into
the country. I'm very satisfied with our team's execution of our Iraq strategy.
For Europe, Africa, and Russia/Caspian, we saw modest activity growth but strong margin performance. In fact, profit
margin was up 271 basis points sequentially in EARC. In Libya, our local management is maintaining a state of
readiness in order to serve our customers when the environment stabilizes.
For West Africa, activity remains good and our sequential performance was strong as our build-out of infrastructure
across this area has enabled us to more effectively compete. We've seen encouraging signs for North Africa, excluding
Libya, where activity has improved in areas such as Algeria and Tunisia. We continue to participate in the exploration
of East Africa's emerging basins and look forward to further progress.
Moving to Europe, we experienced strong operational and financial performance driven by high-pressure, high-temp
wireline activity; improving weather in Norway; and high-end drilling and completion services in Continental Europe.
In Portugal, we began a multi-service contract for cementing, drilling, completions, and tubular and casing running
systems for an independent.
In summary, operationally, we had a very solid quarter. We were awarded hundreds of millions of dollars of
multi-service projects in North America, secured our reputation as the leading provider of drilling services in Colombia
and Brazil, performed our geomarket's first frac in Argentina, grew our wireline business in the Middle East, and
executed well on many other parts of the business, as I've just discussed. We are taking the steps necessary to
measurably demonstrate the power of our combined company, and we are just beginning to tap the true potential for
creating sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders going forward.
At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Chad.
Chadwick C. Deaton
All right. Thank you, Martin. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by quickly highlighting the progress we've made
against some of the key targets that we laid out earlier this year to all of you.
First, our international margins continue to improve. We're making solid progress towards exiting the year with
mid-teen international margins. This has been a result of trimming our costs, growing our business, and improving our

overall operating efficiency. Certainly there's more to be done, but we're pleased with the steps we've taken so far, and
our current trajectory is definitely in the right direction.
Second, as we said before, we expect to deliver superior margins in North America throughout the cycle. The seasonal
break-up in Canada did provide some marginal headwind this quarter, but activity will improve over the next few
quarters, as the fundamentals in this area are particularly strong. We remain confident in the underlying strength of the
U.S. market, and we're encouraged by the ever-increasing number of unconventional plays our customers are asking us
to help them exploit. Our new technology, including AutoTrak Curve, In-Tallic disintegrating frac balls, and extended
stage FracPoint Systems are all delivering results in the first stages of their commercialization, and we continue to be
encouraged about the impact Baker Hughes' technology will have on this very important market.
Third, we told you we intended to be the leader in offshore markets. Let's start with the Gulf of Mexico, where as you
know, the deepwater remains a work in progress for all of us. Clearly, the pace of permits remain lighter than the
industry had hoped for. However, we've seen progress on this front, and like our customers, we continue to be
committed to this very important basin. The deep gas on the Gulf of Mexico shelf has been a bright spot for the
industry and particularly for Baker Hughes. We continue to play an extremely part in the exploration and development
of this resource. And we proved this point again with the recent award of a multi-product line and service contract by a
supermajor. Also, we continue to be a leader in the supply of drilling and completion services to the Pre-Salt in Brazil,
and this will become a substantially more important part of the deepwater market going forward. And in the
Asia-Pacific region, we're very pleased with our deepwater win rate, where we have captured more than 40% of the
contracts awarded over the last year and a half.
A fourth area is that we expect to be a leader in competency assurance. As previously mentioned, we're investing
heavily in our people and processes to ensure that we will be fully compliant with the regulatory requirements in the
Gulf. More importantly, we know that our people are our single most important asset, and we believe that our efforts at
having a superior means of assuring their competency will be a sustained differentiator for Baker Hughes. I'm pleased
with the progress we've made in our compliance efforts over the last quarter, particularly as it relates to taking
advantage of our broad portfolio of technologies and services. We've always been a strong provider of innovative
products and solutions, and we are better positioned now than we've ever been before.
The fifth initiative we've discussed is around supply chain, where we continue to engineer our process so that it will
provide us the best-quality products at the optimum cost level. And in spite of the headwinds and the rising costs
around materials such as metal, we've continued to bring the overall cost of our supply chain down.
And our sixth initiative is to continue to build out our pressure-pumping business and become the second largest
provider in the world. As we discussed, we are focused on providing a full suite of services, as well as new
technological solutions to differentiate Baker Hughes from our competitors and thereby grow share. Establishing Baker
Hughes as the second largest provider of pressure-pumping services continues to be a very important long-term goal of
ours.
I'd like to wrap up by looking at the market. For North America, we revised our 2011 average rig count forecast to
1,850 rigs in the U.S. and that's a 20% year-on-year growth, and to 400 for Canada, which is a 15% growth. And
globally, although there are numerous potential macroeconomic risks, in general our outlook for the global energy
service industry is really quite strong. Growth in rapidly industrializing countries, coupled with modest improvement in
the developed world, should continue to drive the industry forward to produce the hydrocarbons needed to meet the
ever-increasing demand for energy.
The fundamentals of our business indicate that pricing should gradually improve, and we are evaluating specific
markets and technologies for opportunities to raise prices, either through existing contracts or when submitting new
tenders, and we're encouraged that the pricing momentum will build. That said, we continue to watch for potential
pitfalls on the global recovery, including the Euro debt crisis, weakness in the U.S. economic recovery, and of course
monetary tightening in China. However, given the increasingly complex reservoirs that our customers must exploit in
order to maintain and drill production capacity, our outlook for our business remains positive now and into the future.

<Q - James Carlyle West>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Good morning.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Chad, in your comments around international pricing, you sound a little bit less optimistic
than one of your major competitors was on Friday when they talked about some price increases coming through at the
end of the second quarter. I was wondering if you could, I guess, highlight perhaps your differentiated view versus
them on pricing. Are you being more conservative, are they being more aggressive, or is it more just a question of
where they play in the market?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: No, James, I didn't mean to not sound positive on pricing, because we are starting to see
movement. We saw a little bit of movement in the second quarter. Some of it – I mean, this obviously is market by
market, region by region, and -
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Sure.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: – business by business. But we saw a little bit in the second quarter. We submitted quite a
bit of price increases. Some has been awarded, some we were declined on, and some will not kick in till probably Q3,
Q4 and into early 2012. The momentum is definitely building, there's no doubt about it. Stronger in some markets than
others, but I don't want to sound negative on pricing, because it is building.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay, understood. In which markets in particular are you seeing the most pricing
momentum at this point?

<Q - James Carlyle West>: Sure.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: – we are in specific markets, which I'm sure they wouldn't want to tell us where they're
increasing pricing either. But we're seeing a little bit in the Far East. We saw some in a couple geomarkets in Latin
America. And we see a little bit in the Middle East. Not so much in Europe yet, but it's beginning to get the feel in
Europe. So I think those are mostly the markets where we're seeing it. It's just like we started to see it about three
quarters ago in North America and continue to build, and that's what we're starting to see internationally.

that. First of all Martin, can you give us a sense as to what the revenue decline was quarter on quarter in the second
quarter? Was it greater or less than 50%?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: This is Peter. It was greater than 50%.
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: Okay. And so, when we think about the third quarter, do we think about capturing
about half of what was lost quarter on quarter in Q2? How should we think about that, Peter, and Martin?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Probably somewhere between a half – probably around two-thirds recapture. Something like
that.
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: Okay. Great. That's very helpful, thank you. And then, Martin, with regard to the
advent of sliding-sleeve technology and the traction that it's gaining U.S. onshore, historically, the way we thought
about this was that it was an application that was being well-received in markets with meaningful weather windows:
Bakken, Canada, et cetera. How should we think about sliding-sleeve going forward? Is it going to gain significant
traction beyond weather-sensitive markets, and if yes, why?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I would say that it has, maybe, modest growth beyond the markets you just highlight.
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: But I think the point here that is maybe lost a bit is that this technology continues to
evolve rapidly itself, in terms of efficiency, everything from running it, and to executing it. Of course you're familiar
with the cleanup process of the In-Tallic technology.
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: Yes.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: And as well, as I kind of hinted at, not every customer completely accepts its application
yet, relative to the more traditional.
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: So I don't want to tell you exact market absorption rates, but there's a substantial amount
of opportunity in the existing basins for this technology to still convince, let's say, offset customers of the value it
provides. So new customers, as well as evolving technology, I'd say, still has a huge amount of potential for the product
line.
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: And the differential in time per stage – plug and perf, on average, I think you guys
have said, has five hours per stage, and sliding sleeve an hour per stage. Is that correct?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: More or less.

<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: Okay. Got it. Last question from me. Martin, same question I asked you last call,
and that's the pace of absorption and delivery with regard to new frac capacity that's been ordered. Are we still on a
runway of 40,000 horsepower every six weeks?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah. Probably picking up a bit. We were a little bit back-loaded in the – just given the
integration of BJ into the company, so -
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: Right.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: – unlike our, let's say our peers, we probably had a more back-half-loaded CapEx plan
that went the -
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: – pressure pumping. So that's a safe number.
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: So the amount of horsepower that's going to be delivered second half of 2011 versus
what's been delivered first half, is it -?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: More.
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: I understand it's more. Is it modestly more, or is it more than trivial – for the

And your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Good morning, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Just have a follow-up question here on the pricing power in the U.S. first. Can you just give us
some general handle on where you're seeing it increase the most outside of pressure pumping? And then, what product
areas do you think are still lagging?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Drilling systems clearly has a lot of price traction right now. Bits are okay, but as we
know, bits in the U.S. don't require the same capability or technology challenges in the shales as they do in the sands
and others. I think fluids, we're probably still lagging a little bit. There's more room to go there. And completions are
clearly – have a lot of traction on price – complex completions.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. So when you guys talk about the pricing improvement on the international basis going out
into next year – or starting to see some signs of it now – and then going out into next year, how do we think of the
flow-through of that on the P&L and generally speaking, right? Because you have, I think, a number of projects that
continue to roll off. So do you think you get like a third of the pricing benefits in next year, a half of it, two-thirds?
How do we think about pricing power for international projects going into next year?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Well, I think you still have a third, a third, a third of type contracts roll over, Kurt. I don't
think the long-term contracting internationally is going to go away. So at minimum, I think you're going to see some
improved pricing on a third, but we are – as we said in our comments – we are going in even on existing contracts and
pushing price on existing contracts, especially on some of the directional type work, because tools are getting tight
everywhere. You can feel it. So I'd say a little over a third could roll into early 2012.

<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. And then lastly, just wanted to – I was looking for some clarification. You mentioned
some increased costs to meet the new regs for deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Hadn't really heard that from the other major
players yet, so what kind of costs are you looking at?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Well, I think it's too early to try to put an actual dollar number on it, Kurt. What we're
seeing is that clearly, come the end of November, BOEM is going to require certain minimum standards to be met,
offshore compliance standards. And this means – and we're seeing it in some of the audits that are going on with our
customers as they visit our facilities, or BOEM or clients audit the rigs that you're on.
So we are being proactive in this area. We know it's coming. We've seen it happen in the North Sea back after
following the Piper Alpha disaster, and for a period of about a year to 18 months, you see increasing regulations and
standards being set. So we're just trying to get ahead of the game to make sure that come November 15, when some of
these regulations are rolled out, we're well in line and not any surprises for us. So we can't really quantify it yet, but we
clearly have picked up on our training and certification of people and making sure our systems are in place to handle it.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay, great. Appreciate it. Thank you.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: You bet.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of David Anderson with JPMorgan.
<Q - David Anderson>: Thanks. Just sticking on the same subject of the Gulf. I think in the past you've said you were
on something like 40% of the deepwater rigs out there. Permits obviously are a huge issue, everybody's talking about.
How you guys planning your business around this over the next 12 months, with such limited visibility? I mean, where
do you guys think you're going to be a year from now in terms of equipment, services, people? Do you think you'll be
back 50%, 75% back to normal? I mean, how does this go through in your mind?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Well, first you – it all starts with the government and the permitting. The clients looking
at the next two quarters, clearly through the end of the year, have already assigned work on the rigs that are coming in.
So I think we're at, what, 16, 21 rigs in Q2? And it's going to 24 rigs in Q3. There's an ongoing shift of half of those on
work order and half of them drilling. That increases quite a bit in Q3 and clearly more in Q4. That's subject to getting
the permits on all of them. Some of them have permits, some don't now.
We know what rigs we're assigned to in Q3, Q4. We see a nice build through Q3 and a very nice position in Q4, as
Martin highlighted in his comments. So that's our planning in terms of people and equipment needed. So in a sense, this
thing is kind of ramping up fairly slowly, allows us the time to go ahead and try to get the equipment built and assigned
and clearly get the people back in and onboard. We brought all of our people back that had been assigned outside the
Gulf to deepwater over this last quarter, quarter and a half. So they're now back in place.
I don't know, Martin, you have any comment you want to add to that?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah. Thanks, Chad. David, I'd say that to follow up on Chad's comments, there's 130 or
so well locations identified in the Lower Tertiary over the next several years. This is an enormous amount of spend.
Our customers, the key customers, are committed to it. No one wants to speculate on exact timing or the way the
government will respond. But we're here to service our customers. I can tell you that the amount of conversations
regarding these complex completions, all the way into 2013, given the type of technology that's required and the
conditions of these wells, are probably at a record pace, actually.
So are they out there drilling to the density we'd like? No. But is the work being done to prepare for it, including, as
Chad mentioned and I mentioned, preparing for this work at a much higher standard of performance is underway. So
how are we planning for it? We're optimistic, and we're confident that – we're not going to try to predict exactly, but
we're confident it's going to follow through.

<Q - David Anderson>: So with all your people back in the Gulf, presumably your margins in Gulf are a little bit of a
drag right now. Obviously Canada was a big drag. And, Peter, maybe you can just kind of quantify for us how much
that impacted your margins? But I guess my broader question is, Chad, you were talking about superior margins in
North America, but your margin progression seems to be coming at a slower pace than your competitors. There
obviously isn't any reason for that considering your product line, your strength of your completions business. So, how
does that – how do you guys close that gap? Is that something that's closeable over the next 12 months? Is there any
reason to think that shouldn't close?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: I'm not concerned about our North America margins bouncing back. We're the biggest
player in Canada. I don't think – we're not going to outline exactly what that hit in Canada was, but it went from 587
rigs to 187 rigs. That's a 400-rig drop, and that hit us pretty hard. And as we said, Gulf of Mexico, what rigs did go
back? We had a mix issue in that. We weren't necessarily on some of those rigs that went back, but we're clearly on
them in Q3 and then definitely in Q4, because like I said, this work's been awarded. We know who's going to be on
which rig in Q3 and Q4. So I think the Canada mix definitely hit us this quarter. Gulf of Mexico hit us a little bit this
quarter.
And we're still catching up, as Martin said, on the pressure-pumping side. Technically, we've had BJ two quarters now.
We are clearly seeing the pull-through both ways, from putting pressure pumping on some of our completions,
complicated completions, as well as the other way around now. So I'm not worried about U.S. margins.
We also said that we would be a leader through the cycle, and we've got a pretty good chunk of our business in North
America that is tied to the production side, ESPs and the chemicals. So when things are booming and rig count's
accelerating rapidly, we're probably not going to have the top margins in that area. But I have no doubt when things
soften, we will clearly have the top margins during the weaker period. So as we said, we want to be able to lead
throughout the cycles.
But I'm not concerned with North America margins. They're there, and they'll be back in Q3, Q4. And will they be at
the very top? Maybe not with our production-side influence, but we'll be up there very, very competitive.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. Thanks, Chad.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Yeah, thank you very much. Just following up on that last point. So if we look out to the fourth
quarter, do you see that for North America that you'll be – and you come to benchmarking yourself against the industry
and the peers in the fourth quarter – do you expect to kind of meet your targets at that point, just to clarify that once for
all? And be – I mean, that's the fourth quarter with the, let's assume, least in Canada – clearly not like your first quarter,
but decent. So do you think you'll be on a sequential and year-over-year revenue growth and margins be where you
want to be, where you highlighted?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Yes.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Very good. If – you talk about the Gulf of Mexico coming back, which is, I presume, also very
margin work compared with onshore. But could you talk a bit about the timing of when this work was awarded to you?
What's the timing between when you're given a contract and when the rig mobilizes? In other words, when did you win
this stuff in the third quarter?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Yeah, this is all over the map, Ole, because a lot of it depends on when the rig's ready,
and then clearly, it depends on the permit that the clients are finishing up on, on the permit and allowed to get back to
work. But we see, as I said in Q4, from what we've seen and what the clients have told us and what we need to be
geared for, Q4 will be the first real big improvement for us. Q3 will be a little better, and Q4 is much better in the Gulf
of Mexico for us.

<Q - Ole Slorer>: And could you help us with a little bit of a generalization on when that Q4 work was awarded on
average, get a little bit more color?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Last quarter, or early last quarter, clients started to line up. I mean, we just mobed on
three – two drill ships and a deep semi in early July, that just went out. So that's – and that work was probably awarded,
what, Martin, four months ago?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah. You know, Ole, it's all over the map. But we're in customer offices now with
contracts that are awarded, planning the well, and the well won't spud until 2013.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Yeah.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: These investments our customers are making are just incredible in the technology
requirements, the amount of manpower, and thought leadership, so to speak. So it's hard to generalize, but I'd say
probably from award to actual, I think a safe number might be six months.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Okay, so the work that was carried out in the second quarter, was that for the most part awarded
post-Macondo?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Post-Macondo, yes.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Yeah, okay. Just wanted to get up to sync here. Well thank you, that's all for me.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Conlan with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matthew D. Conlan CFA>: Hi, guys. I wanted to ask about the North Sea. One of your competitors said that
they thought that the change in tax regime there was having a negative impact on the customer commitments to new
business. Have you seen anything on the UK side that confirms that?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: No, we haven't, Matt, but we've been staying it for quite a while. Our people said they
don't think that's a 2011 event for us. 2012 may see some things happen, too early to tell yet, but we actually had a
pretty decent order in the UK. It didn't affect us.
<Q - Matthew D. Conlan CFA>: Okay, great. And turning back to the U.S., Schlumberger gave some incremental
margin improvements in the first quarter to the second quarter on U.S. land. Are you able to give kind of the same, kind
of apples-to-apples difference between first quarter and second quarter margins for U.S.?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Peter?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Well, we had pretty strong incrementals on U.S. land in Q1 and Q2, which are sort of 40% to
50% range. And revenue growth, you could – similar to the peers. So on U.S. land, we're all doing pretty well.
<Q - Matthew D. Conlan CFA>: Okay, okay. So the bogey that you put out there that you were more than two times
the rig count growth for revenue growth, I mean, that's around 12%, 12.5%, but it seems like you did actually
significantly better than that.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah, we did better than that.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Yeah, we did. U.S. land was not our issue in the second quarter, as we said. It's Canada
and a little bit the Gulf of Mexico.

<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Yes, good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Hi, Scott.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Martin, you mentioned that the number of jobs with multiple products and services being sold
in North America doubled for you over the past three quarters, I think it was, if I heard you correctly.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Correct.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: It sounds like you're taking material share in that market now with BJ Services under your
umbrella. Is that true? Do you think you're taking material share in the packaged service market in North America?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I think we're taking some share. I don't know if I'd want to say material. It's really
providing an overall solution for the customer. But as Chad highlighted as well, I mean, all the key products or service
lines in U.S. land right now are – outside of maybe a couple, depending on the basin – are sold out. So share gain is not
the objective, by any means, so – and the other thing, Scott, that we didn't define, but since you asked, when we say
multiple services, it's three or more discrete services on a well site.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Okay. And I'm not sure if you have the full market data for just how big the packaged service
market is, as you define it, based on three or more services. But do you feel like your share now with some incremental
gain is more on par with your size, or do you feel like there's some more running room there?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, no, we're – it's doubled. I could tell you it's still less than half of where we're out
there, let's say, with the frac fleet. We've got a lot of headroom in this category.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Okay. Great. And then just turning to Latin America, just wanted to hear some detail on the
slight sequential dip in margins there, if you'd provide some color. Was it cost inflation or just mix? Any detail would
be great.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I wouldn't read much into that, Scott. It's really just a little bit of mix.

<Q - Joe Hill CFA, MBA>: Okay. And then, we've heard from both you guys and some others that drilling and in
some cases wireline is kind of leading pricing. If you ranked your product categories in North America, are drilling
systems in excess of pressure pumping now in pricing momentum?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: I would say yes. But Martin, you want to confirm that?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's exactly right.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Yeah.
<Q - Joe Hill CFA, MBA>: Okay. And then you guys talked a little bit about doing some jobs for YPF in the
Neuquén. I had been thinking that basin was a sub-100,000 horsepower basin total. When you look out over the next
several years, how big do you think we can get there?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Well, I think if you look around the world, at the potential shale plays and the customers
I've had lunch with or talked to who are sniffing around down there, I think Argentina is as exciting as what people are
saying for the U.S. And you're right – I mean, I noticed in our comment at one point we said our first frac in the
geomarket, and that's not true. We've been fracking there – BJ's had a history in Argentina for quite some time. It was
our first horizontal frac in that area, a horizontal shale frac.
But the one thing about Argentina, horsepower can be added there fairly easily. And a lot of it is because you can take
U.S. horsepower and move it down there, U.S. tractor-trailer-type horsepower, which is not the case you can do in a lot
of places around the world. So if it takes off, the capability of building horsepower in the U.S. is clearly there, and
people can just – eventually we start moving horsepower down there or build it easily for the Argentina market.
Argentina is more a challenge in just terms of some of the government regulations, the unions, and other type things.
And I think that to me is what's got to play out before people invest heavily down there.
<Q - Joe Hill CFA, MBA>: Okay. And I'll turn it over, but I just want to say thanks to Gary for all of the help over the

<Q - William Sanchez>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Hi, Bill.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Martin, my question for you is I know, I guess, historically the approach in the U.S. pressure
pumping business for Baker has been to stay relatively short as relates to your contract structure. I'm just curious, with
the incremental adds that you continue to discuss on the call earlier, what's the thought process here to perhaps getting a
bit more term contracts in place on the U.S.? Maybe you could share with us what kind of the split is between longer
term and short term as we think about your U.S. pressure-pumping capacity right now?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Okay, Bill. First of all, when we say history, of course, we're only talking about nine
months, right?
<Q - William Sanchez>: Sure.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: All right, so we're a little bit of neophyte at this. Our sense is that we still like to stay – I
wouldn't to call it spot market, but flexible. Do we see an increase with customers wanting to commit to a little bit
longer? Depending, again, on the portfolio of services that were awarded, depending on the depth that we get into their
business in terms of well planning or even better field development planning, we'll have those conversations. But at this

stage, I don't think we've moved the needle materially – in fact, I know we haven't – from long term to – from short
term.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Hey, Bill, this is Chad. Let me just add something to that. Martin talked earlier about
some big wins on these solutions, total packages of multi-services. I think that is the change we're seeing in this
industry in North America, where a client is awarding a multi-product line, as Martin said, reservoir-completion type
package and fracking. That tends to be being awarded now on a year-type basis with a lot bigger package. So an
individual call-out pressure-pumping type thing where they're only looking at a year or two contract for just pressure
pumping, I don't think that's happening. But the multi-package projects tend to be starting to go out a little bit longer.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. Peter, my question for you just relates to third quarter margin in North America. Given
your earlier comments, is it reasonable to think, as we just do the math here, that third quarter '11 margin could
approach back to the fourth quarter '10 margin that we saw in North America? Is that a reasonable type of inflection to
be assuming for the model at this point?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Refresh my memory on Q4 North America -
<Q - William Sanchez>: So you were close to 22% in the fourth quarter in North America last year.

<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Hi, good morning, guys. Chad or Martin, can you give us some comments on your Iraq
operations, first on your margin progression versus your goals? And second, I believe you were the official low bidder
on two Iraq IPM projects. What is the status of these awards? I believe you were essentially waiting on government
approval. And if that is awarded, when would that work begin?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Martin, you going to take that?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah. Angie, as I said in my comments, we're quite happy with our progression. As you
know, [ph] we've stayed on the (52:50) production side of this. We have been on the sidelines a bit. Based on the risk
profiles, it should be not a surprise to anybody that initiating these contracts there can be very, very challenging
depending on the scope of the work that was outlined. You're correct with regards to the information you have on some
projects. But I'm not going to speculate as to – and we haven't really been public on those yet because we don't have
any probably – much more information than you do as to the actual timing of the award. But – those are big awards.
But again, they have to work through the machinery within Iraq.
And in terms of the margins, I can tell you that we were slightly profitable, and we expect to be moving in that
direction from this point out on Iraq.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay, okay. So it's fair to say you are wading through the government process before you
make any commentary on the awards?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes, ma'am.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay. And then secondly, you obviously had some pretty impressive incremental margins in
Europe/Africa/Russia at 74% with margins moving from 11.8% to 14.5%. Was that driven by a specific country,
region? What occurred in the region?

<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Well, I think, one, Africa is a continued turnaround story and getting better. So that
helped contribute quite a bit. And we did have, as I mentioned, a good UK and Norway quarter, and Continental
Europe as well. And Russia continues to improve. So I think it's all the way across the board. The only area, Angie, that
was probably a little bit weak in all those areas comparatively was probably the Kazakhstan-Azerbaijan area where
things are a little softer. But everything just across the board improved in Europe.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: West Africa and Algeria, particularly, to give you some more detail, Angie.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay, okay. Well, you're one of the few that are seeing good numbers in Algeria. And then
finally, Russia, you had a nice ESP award in the region. Thoughts on the activity outlook for 2012, and could you see
pricing in the region next year as well?
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: Yeah, if you recall, we thought Russia would be one of the first areas internationally
where we'd start to see some price movement. At the early of the year, it was looking pretty decent, but that's kind of
gone flat.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Yep.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: I think Q3 pricing will be flat. Q4 we start to see a little bit of improvement. Now, that
being said, activity shows a nice ramp in Russia in Q3, and then in Q4, Russia will be ending the year, pretty decent
position. We just mobed, beginning of this Q3, on three big IO projects, integrated projects. They just got kicked off,
which will be contributing heavily in Q4. And I think, like I said, activity is improving in Russia, and probably Russia
will be a 2012 price inflection point or price change point.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay, perfect. Thanks so much.
<A - Adam B. Anderson>: Thanks, Angie. Mishay, at this point, can we take one final question?
Operator
And your last question comes from the line of Rob MacKenzie with FBR.
<Q - Rob James MacKenzie>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in.
<A - Chadwick C. Deaton>: You bet, Rob.
<Q - Rob James MacKenzie>: I wanted to explore with you guys a little bit more of the sliding sleeve technology in
general and FracPoint in particular. There have been some that have criticized it, more generically, the sliding sleeve
technology, as producing poorer result than to the plug and perf, and then there's been other anecdotes where it's
outperformed. Can you give us a feeling for how much of that might be the technology itself in individual applications
or the plays? Or how should we think about how the sliding sleeve technology will proliferate and where it's most
applicable?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Okay. Rob, this is Martin. Let me take that. I don't understand the criticism of it, so I'm
not going to go there. The absorption in the market, I think, should put those arguments to bed. Customers would not be
continuing to repeatedly use it if they weren't seeing differential performance. And I would not say that I could identify
any issues with the technology itself, other than it continues to evolve and be more applicable and more reliable. To me
– and it gets back to what I said, which Chad has been saying for a long time – it gets down to the reservoir
characterization to begin with. How this – where the well has landed, the type of geology specifically. And to say the
sliding sleeve technology, which allows obviously the customer to put a lot more fracs on something that has extremely
low permeability, to say that it doesn't have increasing application is beyond me. I don't understand that argument.
And so, as I mentioned early, the 40-stage, the In-Tallic balls, the new FracPoint direct connect, which we'll be
launching shortly, which has built-in nozzles to get the fracs more initiated and more focused, holds a heck of a lot of
promise in not only U.S. land, but other parts, as we mentioned, China and Argentina specifically.

<Q - Rob James MacKenzie>: Okay great, that's very helpful. And I guess as a follow-up to that, when you aren't able
to commit the customer to use it, what is the pushback you typically hear, and how do you address that?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Cost, money.
<Q - Rob James MacKenzie>: So it's a trade-off between the benefit and the incremental cost to do it?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's right.
<Q - Rob James MacKenzie>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
