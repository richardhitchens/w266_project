Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman, CEO, Wick Moorman.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thank you, Katie, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our first quarter of 2015 earnings
conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including our President, Jim Squires, our Chief
Operating Officer, Mark Manion, and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.
As all of you know, earlier this month we announced first quarter earnings of $1 per share, 15% lower than last year.
These results reflected lower fuel surcharges on the top line, as well as continued weakness in our coal franchise which
restricted growth in revenue and revenue per unit. Additionally, very severe weather in our service territories slowed
our operations, increased our expenses and impacted our volumes.
With the exception of the ongoing effect of lower fuel surcharges and continued pressure in our coal markets, we
believe that most of our issues will be largely resolved by the second half of the year. Having said that, we will be up
against strong comps, particularly in the second and third quarters as last year's results were record-setting quarters for
us. Jim will share with you more detail on the revenue trends and the outlook for the remainder of the year.
With respect to service, we've already seen steady improvement in our network and we expect to reach our strong
2012/2013 velocity and service levels in the second half of this year. Mark will provide you with the latest on the
relevant service metrics and our operations outlook, and Marta will round it all out providing you with details of our
full financial results.
Before getting down to the details, I'll just reiterate what I told all of you on our earlier call. We have a great team at
Norfolk Southern and while there are always uncertainties around our markets, all of us are confident in the long-term
strength of our franchise and our prospects for future success.
On that note, I'll turn the program over to Jim, Mark, and Marta, and then I'll return with some closing comments
before taking your questions. Jim?
James A. Squires
Thank you, Wick, and good morning, everyone.
First quarter of 2015 operating revenue declined 5% to $2.6 billion, primarily due to a $132 million reduction in fuel
surcharge revenues as a result of lower fuel prices. Growth in intermodal and merchandise volumes offset coal
declines, increasing first quarter volume 2% to 1.8 million units. Revenue per unit declined 7% but without the impact
of declining fuel surcharges, revenue per unit declined only 2%. Mix shifts between increased volumes of intermodal
and decreased volumes of coal offset strong pricing across most of our business segments. We will discuss the mix
impact as we review each commodity group.
Overall volume growth of 2% for the quarter was driven by a 5% gain in intermodal and a 3% gain in merchandise
markets, partially offset by a 7% decline in coal volumes. After a strong start to the year, volume in the first quarter
was again impacted by winter weather conditions and accompanying service disruptions, particularly throughout
February. But similar to first quarter 2014, we achieved a strong volume and improved service levels in March.
Breaking out the market segments, starting with coal, first quarter volume decreased 7%. Coal burn at eastern utilities
was down 14.5% in the first quarter due to lower national and regional natural gas prices, causing our utility volumes to

decline 6%. Volumes to northern utilities were down nearly 9% while volumes to southern utilities were down 2%.
Though handling a greater percentage of utility volume to our southern utilities generally increases our coal revenue
per unit, this positive mix impact was more than offset by a 20% decline in export coal volumes in the first quarter.
Persistent weak conditions in the global marketplace, soft prices, and a strong U.S. dollar made it very difficult for U.S.
coals to compete in this oversupplied environment.
Domestic metallurgical volumes were down 1% with weaker demand for met coals related to softer steel production,
and sourcing shifts partially offset by market share gains of coke shipments. This decrease in volume and lower fuel
surcharges reduced revenue by $86 million to $455 million, a 16% decline versus the first quarter of 2014. In addition
to the previously discussed mix changes, lower fuel surcharges also negatively impacted RPU.
Turning to our intermodal market, we continued to see strong volume growth of 5% to nearly 927,000 units. Intermodal
pricing gains outpaced our other business units with continued growth expected the rest of the year. Despite these
positive trends, the decrease in fuel surcharge revenues drove the decrease in overall revenue and revenue per unit. The
effects of lower fuel surcharge revenues more than offset a 2% increase in average revenue per unit already dampened
by negative mix resulting from higher volume increase in international freight. As we've discussed before, international
intermodal freight has a lower revenue per unit.
Merchandise revenue of $1.5 billion was $32 million or 2%, was down $32 million or 2% for the quarter with a 5%
decline in revenue per unit. More than 80% of this RPU decline was due to fuel surcharges. We also experienced
negative mix associated with increased volumes in lower rated sand, gravel and aggregates, while higher rated iron and
steel volumes declined.
Our automotive sector was also impacted by negative mix with decreased auto parts shipments and increased bi-level
traffic. Volume for the merchandise book was up 3% overall with the strongest gain in our chemicals market due
largely to increased shipments of crude oil from the Bakken and Canadian oil fields to East Coast refineries, as well as
increased natural gas liquids from the Marcellus Utica shale plays.
Automotive volumes increased 4% in the quarter with increased vehicle production at several key NS-served plants.
Our metals and construction markets benefited from increased volumes of aggregates for construction projects in the
Southeast as well as increased frac sand volume into the Marcellus Utica region to support natural gas drilling efforts.
These increases were partially offset by reduced shipments of steel pipe and steel coil driven by a softening of the pipe
market and reduced steel production in the quarter.
Agriculture shipments were up 2% with increased volumes of corn moving to Southeast poultry producers as well as
increased volumes of feed products and fertilizers. These gains offset reduced volumes of export soybeans resulting
from a record South American crop, the strength of the U.S. dollar and limited railcar availability. Finally, paper and
forest product volumes were flat in the quarter with strength in lumber related to the continuing housing recovery offset
by reduced volumes of wood chips and waste materials.
Let me close with expected trends in volume and revenue for the balance of the year. First, we expect solid volume
growth in many parts of our franchise throughout the year. Highway conversions and corridor investments should
continue to drive domestic intermodal growth, while international intermodal shipments will benefit from the recovery
following the West Coast port disruptions earlier in the year.
We expect growth in natural gas liquids and, despite lower oil prices, crude-by-rail volumes. Double-digit growth in
housing starts and increases in construction activity should generate more lumber, plastics, soda ash and aggregates
traffic. Automotive volumes should grow at a rate better than North American vehicle production driven by output at
key NS-served plants. Ethanol shipments should increase due to rising gasoline consumption and project related growth
while a stronger crop should push export soybean volumes up later in the year.
However, lower oil prices are expected to cause declines in our metals and construction group as drilling activity slows
reducing shipments of pipe, frac sand and other drilling imports. Further production curtailments by major steel
producers and high inventories will likely dampen shipments of iron and steel products. Lastly, low natural gas prices,

utility stockpiles at or above target levels, a strong U.S. dollar and global oversupply will make this a challenging year
for coal.
We continue to obtain price increases at or above the rate of rail inflation in most areas of our business and should see
negative price mix effects abate in the second half. However, high fuel surcharge recoveries in the comparable periods
last year are likely to result in lower revenue in the second and third quarters and for the full year. By the final quarter
of 2015, however, we expect top line growth to resume.
Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the presentation over to Mark, who will provide an update on our first
quarter operations.
Mark D. Manion
Thank you, Jim. Restoring our service levels remains our primary focus; however safety is at the heart of everything we
do so let's take a look at our safety numbers. Turning to slide two. Our reportable injury ratio was 1.08 for the first
quarter of 2015 as compared to 1.49 for the first quarter of 2014. The train incidents through March 2015 were 71
versus 61 over the same period last year. Grade crossing accidents through March were 76, down from 88 over the
same period in 2014.
Now let's take a look at our service. While our service composite in the first quarter was lower than 2014 as a whole,
we are operating at a higher level than we were in the fourth quarter even with the more challenging operating
conditions that existed in the first quarter.
In addition, as you can see on the right, our service has been trending upward since the end of February. The timeline
and trajectory of our service recovery I provided on our last call, which outlined incremental improvement in the
second quarter with more significant improvement in the second half of this year, has not changed. We expect that
composite service performance will be near 80% by the end of the second quarter.
And as you see, the sizable improvement in train speed and dwell in December was maintained in January and although
February was challenging, recovery has been evident. We expect this trend of increasing train speed and terminal dwell
reduction to continue through the rest of the second quarter. We fully anticipate that our end-of-quarter speed and dwell
metrics will be commensurate with the superior service levels we achieved in 2012 and 2013.
As you have seen, we've made solid improvements and we expect to see even larger gains in our service metrics by the
end of the second quarter. Slide five outlines our plan that will lead to these larger gains. We have an increase of 600
conductors and 50 locomotive engineers between March 1 and July 1. We expect to take receipt of 40 additional
SD90MACs during this same period and we're already seeing the number of bad order locomotives normalize, which
will results in 160 additional locomotives available for service. By the second half of the year we anticipate we will be
storing some of our older, higher maintenance locomotives which will reduce our expenses and strengthen our service
reliability.
With regard to infrastructure, the connection track in Chicago, as well as Goshen siding, east of Elkhart were
completed in April. Both of these projects will further improve our fluidity through the Chicago corridor. Lastly, the
second phase of the Bellevue Plan has begun with modification of the eastbound flows. The westbound flows will then
be implemented later in the summer. The full implementation of Bellevue will improve velocity through reduced car
handling, improve asset utilization and result in an overall reduction in cost structure.
In closing, we're confident our service will continue to trend in the right direction with sequential improvements in the
second quarter. In the second half of the year we expect improved metrics consistent with strong service levels as the
full effect of our investments is realized.
Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Marta.

Marta R. Stewart
Thank you, Mark. Now let's review our financial results for the first quarter. As you can see on slide two and as has
already been noted the weather and service challenges significantly affected our first quarter result. Jim discussed the
5% decline in revenues and while operating expenses decreased by $61 million or 3% it was not sufficient to offset the
revenue decline resulting in a 9% reduction in income from railway operations and an operating ratio of 76.4%.
Slide three outlines the major cost categories affected by the weather and service recovery effort. These are estimated at
$42 million a large portion of which was in compensation and benefits. Additional service hours were incurred in all
areas of operations, including train and engine employees for field service, mechanical employees to maintain the
higher number of locomotives and maintenance of way employees related to storm clean-up and repair.
Similarly the other listed expenses reflect the increased cost of a slow network and added assets. Purchased services
and rents were primarily affected by the decreased velocity while the last two categories, materials and fuel, were
principally affected by the rise in locomotive count. As we previously stated some of the services recovered costs are
expected to continue into the second quarter, however, at a lower level currently estimated at $25 million.
Turning now to slide four. This illustrates the year-over-year change by expense category. Fuel was the only category
to decline versus the first quarter of last year and the decrease was largely attributable to lower prices as shown on the
next slide. Breaking down the components of the fuel expense change, $160 million of the reduction was due to price
as consumption was flat on the 2% increase in traffic volume.
Slide six depicts a $43 million or 6% rise in compensation expenses. We had higher than usual wage rate and payroll
tax increases. As discussed during our January call the union wage increase was effective January 1 versus the July 1
timeframe of recent years. This resulted in a $26 million increase.
Payroll tax rates rose on January 1 as well and total payroll taxes were up $14 million. In addition employee activity
levels, including increased hours, more overtime and more trainees added $14 million; and signing bonuses related to
our recently ratified agreement with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers added $11 million. That labor
agreement also calls for a lump sum bonus which will affect fourth quarter expenses by a similar amount.
The final significant item within the compensation area was a reduction in the accruals for incentive and stock comp,
reflective of the quarter's result.
Slide seven shows purchased services and rent expense, which increased by $31 million or 8%. This rise is primarily
due to higher volume related activities such as equipment rents and intermodal operations. As previously mentioned,
lower network velocity also caused these costs to rise.
Turning to the next slide, materials and other expenses rose by $25 million or 11%. About half of the increase was due
to higher materials expenses and was associated with both locomotive and maintenance of way usage. Environmental
and personal injury expenses also rose, in part due to a prior year favorable accrual. And lastly travel costs increased
largely related to our train service employees who had more overnight stays, as well as temporary transfers to areas on
our systems with crew needs.
Depreciation expense displayed on slide nine rose by $8 million or 3% reflecting our larger capital base as we continue
to invest in infrastructure and equipment.
Operating expense headwinds are summarized on the next slide. In addition to the service recovery costs, the wage and
payroll tax increases and the lump sum payment, 2015 expenses will include costs associated with the previously
announced closing of our Roanoke, Virginia office. Approximately 450 employees will be affected by this move, going
from Roanoke to either corporate headquarters in Norfolk, operations headquarters in Atlanta or choosing to retire or
resign.
Moving and relocation costs in 2015 related to this transition are expected to total $35 million and will begin to be
incurred in the second quarter, although most of the costs will impact the third quarter when the bulk of the relocations
are expected to occur. Efficiencies associated with this consolidation will begin to benefit expenses in the fourth

quarter.
Next, income taxes totaled $185 million for an effective tax rate of 37.4% compared with 33.6% in 2014. As you may
recall, last year contained a $20 million, or $0.06 per share, tax reduction resulting from a tax law change in Indiana.
Net income and EPS comparisons are illustrated on slide 12. The $58 million net income decrease is a 16% decline
compared to last year and diluted earnings per share of $1.00 was 15% lower than last year.
As shown on the final slide, cash from operations covered capital expenditures as well as our higher dividend level of
$181 million. On our fourth quarter earnings call in January I mentioned we anticipated returning to a higher level of
share repurchases. During the first quarter we used cash on hand to buy back $415 million of our shares. We now
expect full-year 2015 repurchases to be between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion.
And with that, I thank you for your attention and I'll turn the program back to Wick.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thanks, Marta. Well, as you've heard, clearly, our first quarter results were not as strong as we and you expected that
they would be and in the short term we face some continuing headwinds in the tough comps from last year. However,
we see continuing strength in the overall economy; and as Jim described, we have a lot of opportunities in many of the
markets we serve and a great franchise with which to capitalize on these opportunities.
In addition, we're well on the way to restoring our network velocity and efficiency, which will drive further costs out of
our operation. And as all of you know, that will also enable us to secure more business at rates that drive positive
returns for our shareholders. As we do that, we also remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders as
demonstrated through our strong dividend history, as well as through our share repurchase program, where, as Marta
just mentioned, we're now targeting between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in share repurchases this year.
In sum, we have a proven strategy for success and the right people and resources to successfully execute it. Thanks and
I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And
our first question is coming from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - William J. Greene>: Hi. Good morning. Jim, you obviously identified in your slides the challenges ahead from
the fuel surcharge mechanism. We asked this last time as well but since we've gone another quarter and now with the
preannouncement, is there any reason to think that you might address that again and come back and say maybe we need
to adjust that and change that going forward? A number of the freight transports have rebased fuel surcharges given the
volatility there. So what are your thoughts on fuel surcharges?
<A - James A. Squires>: We are working towards shifting more of our revenue to an OHD-based fuel surcharge
mechanism over time. And so, that's going to take a while. It's contract by contract. Customers have their own
preferences. Our overall goal will be to increase rate and grow the revenue. But we recognize that our reliance on WTI
and our fuel surcharge program creates volatility in our earnings and that's undesirable. So we will be working overtime
to shift to a more OHD-based program.
<Q - William J. Greene>: Okay. And then, Jim, or even Wick, how do you get confident in volume growth being
actually a good thing? Obviously, last year we had service challenges and we had unexpected growth. And now we're
having a change in the macro outlook that's created some excess resources and yet the service levels aren't back. So can
you walk us through your thoughts on does it make sense instead to sort of let's focus on getting the right kind of

business on the network to result in a better margin, a better outcome and not worry so much about the volume growth
instead? Do you know what I'm getting at, right? So it seems like there needs to be more of a focus almost on shrinking
the business. That will improve the service, which is even better for price.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, Bill, I understand your question and I think it's a very reasonable and
interesting one. One of the things that I will say about our volume growth is we don't go out and try to grow volume at
rates and margins that don't make sense from the standpoint of shareholder value. So we're certainly not in the mode of
let's just grow volume for volume's sake. And in fact, if you look at a lot of our volume growth this quarter, it's been in
intermodal where you know we've made a lot of investments and where we're now seeing, as Jim mentioned, very
positive pricing trends. So we don't see that as a problem. In fact, we see volume growth at good rates as a strength for
us.
We also don't see that volume growth as severely impacting in any meaningful way our service recovery. Our service
recovery is based upon getting the right resources in there. We think we've largely done that and we're on the right path
back. Last year, as you mentioned, we had some volume growth we clearly did not foresee into the second and third
quarter and got caught short, primarily on the crew side. So the volume growth we're having right now, we see as
desirable. We see it as continuing to be a good thing for us.
As Jim mentioned, in this quarter in particular, and although we may see it for a little while longer, we saw some mix
effects even within our merchandise business that didn't help our overall RPU. But even within that the somewhat
lower rated traffic that was growing was still good margin business and business that we want to continue to handle.
<Q - William J. Greene>: Okay. I appreciate the time. Thank you.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks, Bill.

Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q>: Hi. Yes. This is Ken on for Allison. How are you guys doing today?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Good. Thank you, Ken.
<Q>: So just a quick question on the buyback. So as you mentioned the buyback was pretty big in Q1 and you
highlight a target of $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion for the full year. Just curious on how that could possibly trend through the
next few quarters and whether there's any limit on how big of a buy back you can do in any one quarter? Thanks.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Well, the estimate of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion is just a little bit higher than what we
projected on the January call, and so we're very comfortable with that level. We did not issue debt last year. We have
plenty of debt capacity this year, and we're comfortable with our projections that that's going to be an amount of cash
we're going to be able to return to the shareholders.
<Q>: Got it. Thank you. And just as my follow-up, so you mentioned that utility coal stockpiles were currently above
target. Just curious how far above target you're seeing the stockpiles currently trend at your utilities? And how long you
would expect it to take to get back to that target level if we assume a normal weather environment?
<A - James A. Squires>: Based on our estimates, utility stockpiles in the South at the end of March were at around
71.5 days, in the North 65.3 days, a rough target for Southern stockpiles of 70 and for the Northern utilities about 50
days. So as between the two the Northern utilities are a bit more overstocked. The stockpile trends will depend heavily
on the weather pattern in the summer, and all of our assumptions around utility coal, in fact, do assume a normal
weather pattern in the summer, which would drive our volume assumptions going forward.
<Q>: Perfect. Thanks a lot, guys.

Our next question is from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Thank you. Marta, I wanted to ask about your Roanoke relocation. You talked about the incremental
costs you're going to incur this year but I was wondering what are the savings we should anticipate next year? And then
I guess more importantly are there further opportunities to rationalize or consolidate your operations and is there a
pipeline that you might be able to sort of allude to? Thank you.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Well, the Roanoke relocation has, Tom, two components to it. I mean the primary reason
why we decided to do that was because we think it will be more effective for our people to be in fewer locations. So we
think that will help the operations of all the departments that are involved, so that was number one. But as a result of
doing that was sort of a catalyst to accelerate some G&A reductions that we had been planning for the next three or
four years and so that allows us to – because some people are choosing not to move, that allows us to kind of accelerate
those, as I've said. And so we think we'll have about 150 G&A positions between now and the end of the – between the
third quarter and the end of the first quarter of next year that will come out as a result of that.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Great. That's helpful. And as a question with regard to the coal and in particular I guess the coal
exports. What are the levers you can adjust to a potential longer and deeper down cycle for export coals? To what
extent would it make sense to maybe even rationalize terminal interests? And then maybe even with rolling stock, is
there something you could there? Like are you satisfied with utilization levels? Or could you do anything with regard to
even that side of the business? Thanks.
<A - James A. Squires>: For starters, we can be very nimble with our equipment asset serving our coal business, our
export coal business we can obviously redeploy the locomotives, we can downsize or curtail whole car replacements.
So we have complete flexibility with regard to the equipment. The infrastructure adjustments would involve
adjustments to maintenance levels particularly in the coal field and in some cases perhaps a longer-term mothballing of
the asset. But most likely the infrastructure side would involve service reductions until the volumes return.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - James A. Squires>: Morning.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: With regard to the kind of merchandise outlook, obviously there are a couple of puts and
takes with regard to your growth expectations with weakness on the softening steel production side, as well as growth
in several other end markets. When I'm thinking about the crude by rail outlook, it sounds like you're expecting
continued growth. I would imagine we should be seeing that volume growth decelerate and potentially decline in the
back half of the year but was hoping for a little bit more color in terms of your expectation for – regarding that and
commodity.
<A - James A. Squires>: Sure. So we've handled around 29,000 car loadings of crude by rail shipments in the first
quarter of 2015 and that compares to 22,000 car loadings of crude by rail shipments in the comparable quarter last year.
That's an increase of 34%. Now, since the first quarter of last year we have had a handful of new customers come
online. With softening oil prices, we do expect the growth rate for crude by rail to decelerate, but we think we should
be able to maintain a ratable 29,000 or 30,000 car loadings per quarter this year. That would imply growth
year-over-year in the second quarter and for the full year, but we would be modestly negative relative to the crude by
rail volumes in the third and fourth quarter.

<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Okay. That's really helpful. And then with regard to the train length opportunity on the
merchandise network, do you feel like, as the service improves, that there should be the opportunity to extend out those
train lengths in the back half of the year? Or given some of the softening of the growth in crude by rail, as well as likely
declines in the steel production, will that be an offset in terms of your ability to gain some operating leverage in the
merchandise network?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We're always looking for ways to increase our average train length. And in fact, we are
seeing an increase in our merchandise train length even now. I think we're in the neighborhood of 5,900 feet
thereabouts currently. And keeping in mind that around our system, our siding capacity at a minimum is in the 8,000
foot range. So a lot of room to grow there and that's something we continue to work on. And that has mostly to do with
continuing to adjust our train plan, our operating network plan to be the most efficient.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Morning, guys.
<A - James A. Squires>: Good morning.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Jim, I know you talked about expectations for revenue to remain down the next couple of
quarters. I'm wondering if you can share with us a view of if you think that the revenue declines kind of moderate in the
second and third quarter, or do they kind of stay here, maybe even get worse? And if you think, based on that, should
we continue to expect these double-digit type earnings declines? And I know you don't typically give that level of color
but and obviously a lot of us have struggled modeling the numbers in the first quarter. So it might be helpful just to get
your perspective on near-term earnings and revenue.
<A - James A. Squires>: Sure. Let me start by reminding you of the fuel surcharge comparisons in the second and
third quarter. So in the first quarter of this year we booked $163 million in fuel surcharge revenue, that was a $132
million decline year-over-year. Last year in the second quarter we booked $358 million in fuel surcharge revenue, $369
million in the third quarter of last year. So, assuming stable oil prices for the next couple of quarters that would imply
roughly $200 million less fuel surcharge revenue per quarter for the second and third quarter. Then in the fourth quarter
the comparison gets a little bit easier. Last year we took in $308 million in fuel surcharge revenue in the fourth quarter.
So that right there is a pretty significant revenue headwind for the next couple of quarters.
On the other hand, as I said, we expect some of the negative mix effects we saw in the first quarter to begin to abate.
And so by the third quarter, based on our current forecast, we'd be looking for revenue per shipment excluding FSCs to
turn favorable. And similarly revenue x-fuel surcharges in the third quarter would turn favorable and then by the fourth
quarter we start to see overall growth in the top line.
Now that's obviously has a volume component as well and there we're feeling pretty bullish, obviously the declines in
coal volume are not helping but we are feeling as if – on the utility side natural gas substitution has run its course and
we should be able to see a fairly stable utility coal volume run rate for the balance of the year, albeit with the tough
comparisons to last year. So that's our overall outlook on the revenue and – so we have a lot of opportunities to grow
revenue and as I said the negative mix effect should begin rolling off in the second half.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just other question as we think bigger picture, a lot
of the rails have operating ratio targets in that 60%, low 60% range. And I'm wondering as you think about the
business, Jim, do you think that there's structural differences for you or eastern rails in general or is that eventually a
place where you think you can get to with the right mix of revenue and cost?

<A - James A. Squires>: No, last year at this time we were on the verge of producing some of the best quarters that we
have produced in this company's history and the lowest operating ratios as well. And that was possible because we
were seeing significant growth – volume growth in our merchandise and intermodal businesses in particular. And that
was sufficient to warrant a more than offset declines in our coal business. And that's the formula for us going forward.
We will begin to see our coal volumes stabilize at some point. And we will, we believe, grow our merchandise
volumes, our highest incremental margin volumes and our intermodal volumes with substantial price increases to boot.
That is a formula for continued improvement in our financial performance and for materially lower operating ratios in
the future.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Yeah, let me add to that. I think that, sure, inherently if you, railroads are franchise
businesses, the West looks different than the East, which looks different than Canada. But, we as Jim mentioned, we
came off, we've come off a year where we took our operating ratio for the year below 70% for the first time. We expect
to continue to drive operating ratio improvement and we have a very, very strong franchise, particularly in terms of
intermodal and merchandise. So I think that the pace of when you get there it's obviously always something that the
economy will largely determine, as well as our own efforts, but we have internal goals for driving operating ratio down.
And we believe that we'll continue to do that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Hi. Yeah, good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit about the pricing. You've got a lot
of moving parts in the revenue side and you've highlighted the mixed headwinds. But is there any way to kind of
disentangle that and talk about core price and give us a sense of where you are at in first quarter, or if you don't want to
do that, if you just talk about progression. Should we expect x-mix to see acceleration in your core price? Or did you
kind of already get the step up from tighter rail capacity in first quarter and it's just negative mix rolling off? Or how do
we think about the, how much core price you're getting and whether that accelerates if you look into second quarter,
third quarter?
<A - James A. Squires>: We were successful in meeting our goal of increasing pricing, core pricing at a rate at or
better than rail cost inflation measured based on all inclusive less fuel, in the first quarter, in most of our business.
Generally speaking, outside coal, we were able to drive pricing higher. And I think most encouragingly, we saw the
largest core price increase across our book of business in our intermodal line.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Wait. Just to refresh -
<A - James A. Squires>: [indiscernible] (42:21)
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: ... you referred to [ph] ALIF (42:27). Where did you see [ph] ALIF (42:28) in first quarter?
<A - James A. Squires>: So reported [ph] ALIF (42:29) in the first quarter was 2.8%.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Okay. And so it's not, there's not really a caveat that you're saying across the book you
would have done better than that 2.8% if we'd looked at a core price and taking out mix? Is that fair?
<A - James A. Squires>: Right. Right. So with the exception of coal, as I mentioned, virtually across the book – now
there were pockets where it was stronger but on average we were able to meet the goal of increasing core prices at that
rate.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Okay. And what about the aspect of accelerating? I mean it seems like you're pretty
optimistic about improving the network performance so you would think that customer service would improve as you
look into – through second quarter into second half. I guess the truck market seems like it's loosened a bit, maybe
freight overall isn't as strong, but do you think there's more momentum in pricing that that would accelerate? Or have
you kind of achieved the run rate in first quarter and you stay stable next couple of quarters?

we're going to stay very, very focused on that goal and are confident we can achieve it.

Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Securities. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Thank you. I just had a question – maybe a big picture overview of the network. You guys have
done a good job of explaining your target of returning the service metrics, be it speed or dwell or your composite
service indices back to kind of the peak 2012, 2013 levels by 2Q, and you've also kind of outlined very nicely what you
intend to do to get there.
I just wanted to take a step back and maybe understand from an operational perspective if we were to look at network
map – kind of a heat map if you will, what are the key areas that you need to address? The pinch points, if you will.
Because you've given us the pieces to get us there, the targets that you'd like to reach, I just would like a better
understanding because we're only six to eight weeks out from kind of the middle of the second quarter, or the start of
the third quarter when you can hit these goals. What are the focal points that'll help you get to these targets? Thanks.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, our most challenging part of the system last year and into the first quarter was our
Chicago line and really principally between Chicago and the Cleveland area. And a lot has gone on in order to increase
our velocity and I'll say that that area is running really well now. There's just been a lot of focus on it. So in order to do
that there was, we really pinpointed the manpower increases which have come along very nicely, and I'll just say that
we're in pretty darn good shape up in that area from a manpower standpoint now.
Another thing that has been going on for a longer period of time is infrastructure improvement up there. And I did
mention the fact that we've got a couple of significant infrastructure projects that are now complete that just give us, it
just gives us a bigger pipe to run that traffic through there.
So keeping in mind that parts of that area up there will run 100 or more trains a day, so infrastructure improvement,
nice increases, the Bellevue Project like I said is there's more to come which will be very helpful as well as we go
through the summer. So that's the area we've put a lot of concentration into and it's paid off very nicely. And of course
a lot of the things going around other parts of the system and other very important parts of the system, but that was a
big focus and it's really had a nice ending.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Thank you. And my follow-up would be on the intermodal piece. The international volume growth
of 8% makes sense given the potential for some diversions residually from the West Coast port strike or work stoppage.
But the domestic piece, the volumes up only 3% was a little bit lighter than I think. We've become accustomed to
seeing through given your good traction and progress in highway conversions. Wondering if you could just update us
on some of the corridor or gateway strategy and was that 3% representative kind of more of a GDP level growth what
you'd expect this year? Or were there certain mix factors or contractual factors that said we saw a little bit of a dip in
that growth in domestic intermodal for you folks, should kind of resume at a multiple of GDP as it has been in the past?
Thanks.
<A - James A. Squires>: Sure, Matt. Let me take a stab at that. So within the domestic intermodal book we obviously
have several channels. The intermodal company, IMC channel, principally Hub and Hunt, grew at 6%. So that's a little
closer to our historical growth rate. And that's the sort of growth rate we would expect to see or better out of that
channel going forward. Our premium and Triple Crown books declined somewhat and that's what led to the overall 3%
increase in volume in the total domestic book. Going forward we do think that we can continue to drive the entire
domestic intermodal franchise at growth rates more like a mid to high-single digits.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Great. Thanks, Jim.

Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Mr.
Wetherbee, your line is open for question. Our new question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - John Barnes>: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. First on the operating ratio improvement, so not asking for
a specific target but whatever we model for OR improvement. You've kind of given – you got the service related costs,
you got the savings from Roanoke, you got some things like that. Can you just talk about the magnitude of each of
those? And from most important to least important, what's going to drive the improvement going forward?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Well the main thing that will drive improvement will be getting the network back to the
velocity that Mark mentioned. So the train speeds, the terminal dwell, improvement that he mentioned he thinks we'll
have in the second half of the year that is the main thing that will help us with expenses. I would like to point out if
you're looking at the OR that going forward, as Jim mentioned, the fuel surcharge component of it is going to be quite a
drag, it's on our operating margin the rest of the year.
<Q - John Barnes>: And then from network velocity, what's the next couple of catalysts there?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: After network velocity? So...
<Q - John Barnes>: Yes.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: It's just the general productivity book. And again, that network velocity we think will begin
to – will happen towards the end of the second quarter so we expect that improvement to happen in the second half of
the year.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: If you look at our track record for the 2012, 2013 period and we discuss this a lot.
When you ramp the network up you start to take – not only you take the cost out that Marta has been discussing, but it
then sets the stage for even further projects to continue to drive costs down, particularly as volume grows. And it's that
combination of an ever higher network velocity. Mark mentioned Bellevue and we've talked to you about the savings
that are coming online as we turn Bellevue on. But it's that combination of having a stable, high velocity network
which then sets the stage for continuing projects to drive velocity along with the leverage, as Jim mentioned, of volume
growth that really drive the economics of Norfolk Southern and for that matter any railroad.
<Q - John Barnes>: Okay. All right. Thank you for that color. And then my follow-up is, Jim, you talked about
stability on the coal franchise. Can you talk about how you weigh getting to maybe a more stable but lower level of
coal, both on the domestic and the export side? And when you start to make maybe some of those service adjustments,
and begin to take assets out, begin to downsize or rationalize the size of your coal support network, when do you begin
to do that? What do you have to see from a stability standpoint to really start to hammer the cost on the coal side if
stable is going to be what we get going forward?
<A - James A. Squires>: Let me start with the utility start of the franchise and give you some of our assumptions for
the balance of the year. And I'll be referring to utility tonnage here. We did 20.1 million tons of utility coal in the first
quarter. And our current forecast has that level of utility volume holding basically steady for the remainder of the year.
As I mentioned, we do believe that gas substitution with net gas in the current price range has run its course. There's
very little tonnage left to come out due to mets. Of course the implications of carbon regulation down the road are
somewhat unknown at this point. But in terms of mets, we'll maybe see 500,000 fewer tons this year.
And so at that level of volume, that's albeit significantly depressed from last year and even more so from years past, we
probably do not have an opportunity and would not want to take out significant infrastructure. On the other hand, we
can and already have downsized our equipment investments in our coal business. At this level of volume, we can make
do with our current coal car fleet for some time and have been relieved of a significant capital investment in coal cars.

That pertains really more to the export side of the business. So let me touch on that as well. We handled 5.3 million
tons of export coal in the first quarter. That's down significantly from last year first quarter, which was our peak quarter
for export coal. For the remainder of the year we are calling for 4.5 million to 5 million tons of export, feel pretty
confident on the thermal side of that.
If there's a downside potential it would be more on the met side. Our central lab producers are very challenged right
now. But again, at a $20 million annual run rate – 20 million ton annual run rate for export coal, we probably would not
want to significantly downsize our infrastructure. Although we do have the opportunity to reduce spending on
equipment and the people side of it is something we can modulate as well.
<Q - John Barnes>: All right. Thank you so much for your time.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks.

Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
<Q>: Good morning, guys. This is Prishad in for Chris. I apologize earlier. We're having a little headset issue here. I
realize we're running a little bit late in the call so I'll keep it brief. We're curious to know about the growth potential for
the core business. Taking apart, leaving aside fuel, surcharge and coal. If you get a coal number normalization, do you
think we could see the core grow in double digits? And in 2015, are really coal and services that's the biggest factors
preventing that. Is there any way to isolate either? Is that the right way to sort of think about that? Thanks.
<A - James A. Squires>: Well, if by core business you mean our merchandise business, our industrial products
businesses, yes, we do see growth potential there in 2015 and beyond, definitely. Now, there are always puts and takes.
We have some challenges in our metals and construction franchise right now due to very low steel prices and reduced
demand for pipe, in particular. Wall Street Journal quoted $444 per ton as the going price for hot rolled coil this
morning; now, that's down from $474 at the end of March.
So steel prices are very depressed and our capacity utilization is tracking below 70%. So we have some challenges on
that side of our met con franchise. On the other hand, still within met con aggregates were up significantly, construction
car loadings were up, cement traffic was up, all driven by housing and road construction. So there are definite bright
spots.
On the energy side of the core franchise as well we see continued opportunity. Over in chemicals, we were able to grow
NGLs improved by rail, we've already discussed. Our plastics businesses were up. Those are all indications of a pretty
healthy industrial economy and should be the drivers of significant growth in our industrial products franchise going
forward. Our ag volumes were up in the first quarter as well and we see continued promise there for the balance of the
year as well. So overall, we feel real good about our industrial products franchise, albeit there are always a few soft
spots.
And intermodal continues to grow, and on top of the volume growth this year we expect to see significant price
increases. I mentioned that our core prices were up in our intermodal business more than in any other business segment
in the first quarter and that's very, very encouraging.
<Q>: Great. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up, on the comp and employee issue, it looked like on a per average
employee basis the year-over-year change is just under about 2%, which kind of thinking about that and going forward
through the year on a year-over-year basis, how to think about that line item, are there offsets to the headwinds and
what are some of the initiatives that you guys see on the table maybe in terms of combating some of the headwinds you
pointed out in the slides?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, if you look at our comp right now, obviously, and we've discussed this before,
we have the labor agreements which cover about 85% of our workforce. We had the effectively an early pay increase as
a result of the last round of negotiations that kicked in in January rather than July 1, as Marta has discussed. As we look

at overall head count, clearly we're focused right now on getting the right number of people in our train and engine
service workforce to handle the traffic without delay.
I will say that as these numbers, and Mark showed you the conductors and engineers we expect to bring on in the next
couple of months, most of them are included in the head count today because they're trainees, at the end of the first
quarter. As they come on, they come off training status in which they're effectively paid a salary and start to be paid on
a trip rate, so that will then be proportional to our operations.
And then on the non-agreement side and in particular the G&A side, as Marta mentioned, we're always looking at ways
to do everything we need to do with a lower head count. And the Roanoke closure will help precipitate some of that.
We will continue to look at that and try and drive those costs down wherever we can.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Yeah. Let me just add a footnote to the Roanoke office closure question. Having spent a lot
of time with our marketing team in the last couple of months, I am really, really excited about having all of our sales
and marketing team under one roof here in Norfolk. That is going to allow us to produce a much more focused and
consistent approach to growing our top line and we'll have an opportunity to move people around between jobs that
they might not have been able to move around between in the past. And there will be similar synergies from a
workforce standpoint across all of the functions that are currently in Roanoke today, our IT and accounting
departments, for example.
<Q>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: On the operations side, what I would add is Wick is exactly right. The increases that Mark
described, we have – you see those reflected in the average head count, which was up sequentially from the fourth
quarter by 500 employees. And what we're projecting for the remainder of the year is another 500 employee increase.
Most of that will occur by the end of the third quarter and that is almost exclusively in the operating area. So by the end
of the year we think we'll be up 1,000 employees.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Morning.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: So just two quick ones. Jim, you mentioned a lot of the headwinds of the strong power and
some of the destructive imports that we're seeing in the steel, but you also mentioned you expect that ethanol and soy
beans to be up. So maybe if you could just kind of summarize why you think those are moving? And if overall do you
think the strong dollar is a positive factor or a negative, excluding coal, for the rest of the business if the strong dollar is
a positive or negative?
<A - James A. Squires>: Well, you know most of our business is U.S. domestic economy focused. So there are
certainly pockets of resistance in the revenue based on the stronger dollar. We highlighted a few of them. The most
prominent of which would be export coal and in pockets elsewhere as well. But I don't see an overall dampening effect
on total revenue necessarily, outside export coal from the much stronger dollar. In certain pockets of our business it'll
be an additional challenge, but we have enough drivers of revenue growth within the U.S. domestic economy to push
the top line higher based on our portfolio, even with the strong dollar.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Okay. Then just one follow-up on the export coal side. You mentioned you're pretty
confident on the thermal side and how that looks for the rest of the year, but I know the mix has kind of bounced
around a little bit. Can you just give us a refresher on what the mix was in the first quarter? And perhaps what you
expect for the rest of the year? Thanks.

<A - James A. Squires>: In the first quarter of this year, 64% of the export tons we handled was metallurgical and
36% was thermal. And that compares to last year's 69% met, 31% thermal. So we had a relatively high proportion of
thermal coal in the first quarter of this year. We think that will revert in the balance of the year to more the 75%/25%
split. Now, going back we were almost all metallurgical coal, but the last couple of years 70%, 80% met and the rest
thermal has been the common split. And we think we'll get back to something like that split.
I will say though that the demand feels firmer on the thermal side of the franchise right now, and Northern App
producers were able to jump on some opportunities there in the first quarter. That's why we saw the thermal part spike
somewhat relative to the metallurgical coal moving predominantly over Lambert's Point. And by the way, as you
probably know, most of the metallurgical coal we handle moves over Lambert's Point, and most of the thermal coal
moves over Baltimore.
If there's a potential downside in our assumptions of roughly 4.5 million to 5 million tons per quarter for export coal it
would be on the metallurgical coal, which in our case is coming out of Central App. And because of all of the factors
we mentioned, the very strong dollar, the global oversupply of coal, Queensland at $109 per MT and spot coal is
moving four prices below that, because of very low growth, bulk dry shipping rates, it's just an extremely difficult
environment for Central App producers in particular right now.

Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks. And good morning. I wanted to ask a question about PTC. As you've continued to roll out
this technology, how much of a disruption is this causing to the network? Is this a contributor to congestion in the rail
network today? Or would you say it's not a significant needle mover when you think about fluidity?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: It's something we're paying a whole lot of attention to, and it has everything to do with how
well we plan it. Those PTC cutovers take place on a regular basis each month. The good thing is that our Signal &
Communication group are doing a very good job of reducing the amount of disruption that takes place with each of the
events. And case in point at the – when we started this out, and we've been doing it for a while now, but when we
started these out, the outages were in the neighborhood of 12 hours. And of course we do a lot of scheduling and
planning around that to really minimize the disruption.
But as we've gone along here, outages have gone to eight hours, and now in more cases down to six hours, and we've
got some things going on where we think we can reduce them even below six, some of them down to as little as four
hours. So a lot of planning and schedule work arounds. So the disruption factor will be minimized going forward but
still something we do a lot of planning around.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I'll add one thing to that. I think it's a very good question – and we have not talked
about that in any detail, nor have the other railroads, but I will say that we got a lot of the really problematic areas on
the railroad in terms of traffic disruption done last year. We still have some more to go and my analogy for it last year
is it was – we were almost – it was almost like we were constantly running a low grade fever. We had a lot of work to
do out there and a lot of significant disruption that as Mark said we planned around it, we did everything we could. But
nonetheless it was disruptive and it's something that as Mark has described we continue to work on and in fact it's a real
point of focus for us right now as we look at restoring our network velocity.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. Great. That's helpful color. And I'll just sneak one more in on intermodal. I was curious, are
you getting a lot of pushback from your customers and your IMCs on the intermodal price increases you're going out
with today? And also as of today how much of your book of business in intermodal has been repriced at higher levels,
call it that mid-single digit range, over the past year?

<A - James A. Squires>: We are not getting a lot of pushback on price increases. We are aligned with our intermodal
partners in a view of the marketplace and a desire to take prices higher at this point. Now if you look at our equipment
by line of business as an indicator of where we have the opportunity to lean into price most, EMP is about 70% of the
total book by volume and that's where – as the rail owned fleet rail equipment on fleet is, that's where we have the most
ability to take prices up on a spot basis. And also on the Triple Crown side of things at 10% of our total book by
volume, we can lean into rates there as well.

Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Brandon R. Oglenski>: Good morning, everyone. And thanks for getting my question in here in the second hour
of the call. Jim, welcome to the hot seat. And as you guys know we've been supportive of the stock here so I'm going to
try to be constructive with these questions, but I do think it's worth it for your shareholders to ask some of the difficult
questions here though, too. And granted I've never run a train we just live in Excel models so please tell us where we're
wrong. But this quarter volume was up 2%, you had 3% growth in merchandise, intermodal's up 5% and yet earnings
are down 15% on what was a pretty easy comp from last year given all the weather disruption. So I mean that's a lot of
the frustration I think with your shareholders.
And if I listen to the strategies to drive improvement going forward, it's getting price above inflation which we got this
quarter, it's getting growth in those intermodal and merchandise segments and it's stability in the coal book. But I guess
my concern here is where is the profitability outside of coal? I think you've even said it, and Wick said it in the past,
coal is a very profitable segment for you. But where are the margins and returns on intermodal and merchandise, and is
that going to be enough to drive future earnings growth for this company? Or do we have all these continual cost
pressures and fuel surcharge headwinds where we're just not going to be able to see a lot of earnings expansion even
with those pretty robust growth rates outside of coal?
<A - James A. Squires>: So let must just add, we appreciate the candor. And by all means ask the tough questions.
And we demonstrated last year that we can drop the operating ratio significantly based on solid general merchandise
volume growth and intermodal volume growth even with coal headwinds. Now when you're talking about coal volumes
down 7% overall in the quarter, that's a pretty strong headwind. And that is more difficult and we lost ground this
quarter, no doubt about it. But that will stabilize. We will see a bottom on coal volumes and as we've discussed on this
call, we think we may be there already.
And then we have the opportunity to see continued growth in many areas of our merchandise franchise and in our
intermodal franchise. Put on top of that significant price increases and you do have a recipe for growing earnings. It's
essential that we get the network back up to speed. We have a plan to do that. We have the resources coming on line.
There will be some cost headwinds to get from here to there in the short term.
But once the network is back up to 2012, 2013 service levels, we will see significant costs drop out as well. So it's the
combination of that basic efficiency and the cost reduction that comes from running a faster network, bottoming out of
coal volumes and the combination of volume growth and price in our general merchandise and intermodal businesses.
<Q - Brandon R. Oglenski>: Okay. Well, you're not the only railroad to see some pretty challenging coal numbers.
And I do agree with Wick's assessment that, you know, there's differences between the east, the west and Canada. But
there are some similarities between the west and Canada, at least in terms of achieving a mid- to low-60%s OR for a lot
of these carriers with public targets to get there. And if I'm hearing you correctly, Jim, it sounds like we need to have
stability in coal before we can get any real traction on the operating ratio.
But I think there would be a lot of skeptics on the buy side at least or your investor base where if we look at natural gas
being sub $5 in the future, there's still some incremental gas capacity in the east. And on top of it the export market
doesn't look all that solid as you've confirmed on this call. So can Norfolk get traction on margins even if coal

continues to be maybe a modest headwind heading forward?
<A - James A. Squires>: I think we can. I really do. This is going to be a tough year. We will start to see the top line
grow again in the fourth quarter we think based on our current forecast. Until we get the top line moving it will be
difficult for us to make a lot of improvement. That's coming. These mix effects that you saw in the first quarter are
somewhat transitory. Coal volumes will bottom out. Now, we cannot say with total assurance that we have hit bottom
in terms of coal volume today but we've studied our utility franchise pretty carefully. And we do believe gas
substitution becomes more difficult at this point with gas plants running full out. Now the export side of things, there
are headwinds there but there are opportunities as well, particularly on the thermal side of that franchise.
So we think we can do it. You know we've got a couple of tough quarters ahead of us with the fuel surcharge headwind,
with some additional costs out there to get service back up. But once we're there on the service, once we see coal
volumes stabilize and we get past this fuel surcharge headwind we're in great shape to improve our financial
performance.

Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Kenneth S. Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. Thanks for the time. You know I'm going to take a little bit of a
different tact on some of the same questions there. But it looks like service is starting to show some improvement, still
the mid-70s operating ratio for the quarter. Why such a contrast, maybe if I could address this to Mark, between your
need to add the 650 employees between the conductors and engineers, the 200 some odd locomotives? And when you
look at Canadian Pacific's plan to cut resources, which creates a lot of capacity. Maybe Mark can you just describe
maybe a little bit of the differences in the operations or how you're running it so we can understand why we can see
such a great contrast between one creating capacity and the ability to move more versus what, how you're structuring
the operations?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, as far as the resources that we're adding, we know that when we're in the process of
ramping up you need a, it's almost like you can't have enough locomotives. You need a certain number of locomotives
just to spin yourself up. And that's what we're in the process of doing. And in fact, I've got my sights set on storing
locomotives before long. In fact we'll probably get into that by May and give ourselves a surge fleet of – we'll see how
far we go – 100 to 200 locomotives.
And the same thing on the people side. I mean, you need a certain number of people to man your trains and it is activity
based. We pay them when they work. So we need to take on more people. We will stabilize on the people side by the
end of the second quarter and from there on we are essentially – outside of business growth opportunities as we get into
the second half, we're going to be leveled off on people, and we'll be hiring for attrition. So we don't see ourselves
doing anything particularly differently than what the other railroads do as far as that goes.
<Q - Kenneth S. Hoexter>: So I guess maybe just to keep digging into there, to take it a step further, is it the network
resets you've done a few times over the long weekends? Or is it changing the operating plan which creates that extra
capacity?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: No. It's the – we said last year that depending on the severity of the winter that we would do
as we typically do, as we come out of these winter events as a – these are big network systems, and they ramp-up on a
gradual basis. That is what has been happening ever since March. And so we're seeing some nice ramp-up now. I'm
sure you look at our numbers as well, you see our cars online going down, you see our bad order ratio going down, our
train performance is improving, our connection performance improves, the number of locomotives available improves.
All that drives overall network velocity, but it happens in a gradual way. And we'll see that – we will continue day in
and day out to see that gradual improvement take place through May, through June, and I think by the end of June we'll

see some pretty darn good numbers.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Just in the overall theme, let me say one more thing about that, and it goes back to
this idea every franchise is different, every railroad is different. And the eastern carriers obviously are, as all of you
know, shorter haul, complex networks. And that's fine. For one thing we live where all the people are, and we think that
has a lot of positives in terms of growing. But the overall belief that I think everyone in the railroad industry shares is
that velocity creates capacity, and that's where we're going.
The first thing you do is get your velocity where you want it to be, where we've had ours in the past. As you see
velocity go up, as Mark mentioned, cars online go down, our terminals get more and more fluid, and that's what then
drives further operating and cost improvements. And that's the path we're on. And if you look at some of the things
we've done in the past here, we've done a lot of work on our terminals in terms of we closed two significant yards.
We've expanded one to make up for that and to make up for changes in our traffic base. So the pattern – the patterns
may look somewhat different based on the franchise but the theme is always the same in terms of constantly improving
the velocity of your railroad no matter whose railroad it is, in order to create cost efficiencies and create further
capacity.
<Q - Kenneth S. Hoexter>: Wonderful. And if I could get the follow-up I guess, Jim, as you prepare to takeover in
two months or so. What are your thoughts on M&A? Obviously we've heard Wick's kind of thesis in the past. I'm just
wondering how you view the world. And obviously given that discussions that we've heard from some of the Canadians
and maybe your peer on the east in the past, I just want get your insight and whether you think it's possible? And if not,
why not? And then if not now, does that mean something could happen in the future? Maybe just some thoughts on
that?
<A - James A. Squires>: Sure. Well I'll share a few thoughts and then I'll invite Wick to chime in as well. First of all,
let me say...
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: We'll see how well I've trained him.
<A - James A. Squires>: Let me start by saying that we are a public company, we're obviously here to serve our
shareholders, so there are no categorical answers in that regard. On the other hand we do see significant challenges
associated with further consolidation. The regulatory review process for consolidations in this industry is very, very
time consuming, onerous and risky and I say that as one who practically lived at the service transportation board for a
year and a half or so as we were going through Conrail.
It's a very unpredictable process and it is a very costly and risky process as well. And there are relatively few synergies
to be achieved in exchange for those risks as well, the remaining combinations in this industry are end-to-end and by
definition fewer synergies available. So we don't think it's a good idea and we think we have a great business plan to
run this company on a standalone basis, and that what we can do with this company is better than anything that could
be achieved in combinations.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Jim and I agree completely about this but I think Jim's first caveat obviously is
important. We're a publicly traded company. We are interested in long-term welfare and benefits to our shareholders.
That is our job and we understand that very clearly. But I think that what is sometimes really underestimated by those
who don't live or immerse themselves in the regulatory environment in the way that we do is just how hard it would be,
A, to have any kind of transaction approved particularly under the new merger rules where by definition it has to be
pro-competitive, whatever that means and no one has defined that.
And second, the enormous risks that the conditions imposed, if you were even able to get a merger approved by the
STP, would negate any and all benefits and beyond of the transaction itself. There would be an enormous amount of
resistance on a certain parts of our customer base. We just think that you never say never, and the time may well come,
but right now is not a time where trying to do a transaction of any size makes any sense.
<Q - Kenneth S. Hoexter>: I appreciate everybody's insight and takeaways. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Hey, everybody. Thanks for getting me in at the end here. I want to ask a question on a
different aspect of the coal franchise. Given that most U.S. based calls are well out of the money, globally, and given
that the utility inventories remain quite high, I think up until now everybody is focused mainly on the volume aspect of
the coal franchise. But I guess the question becomes at what point do either the coal producers or utility customers say
if we want to keep the coal moving we need a pound of flesh, and let's revisit the pricing so that we can keep coal
competitive and keep coal moving?
When we look at your contracts, both for export and domestic, can you give us an idea of when they get repriced, come
up for renewal? And how much confidence do you have in this kind of environment that we won't have this new leg
down this fall when these contracts, or next year, go to reprice?
<A - James A. Squires>: We believe we continue to have a compelling value proposition in our ability to deliver coal
from various basins and in various ways to our utility and export customers. And we're going to price that on a value
basis. So on the export side there just isn't that much we could do, unfortunately. Our major customers are finding it
very difficult to place coals into the global market, particularly on the metallurgical side. So our goal, as is the case
across our franchise, is to obtain the maximum value for the dollar for the value that we provide our customers, and
we'll continue to do that in the coal business, as well as throughout our franchise.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Okay. And domestic?
<A - James A. Squires>: Same story. As I said, we think natural gas substitution, which has been the driving factor in
the decline in utility volumes, has largely run its course. And we are in position to continue to deliver coals to our
utility customers. Now, a normal summer weather is critical to our assumptions in that regard though. Another very
cool summer and we could see further declines, but provided we have a normal summer we think we're in good shape
to manage a pretty consistent run rate on utility coal this year.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Okay. It's been a long call. Thank you for your answer.

Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Thank you. And, guys, thank you for getting me in here. Two quick ones, one, can you talk a
little bit about your ability to price as your service levels start coming up, because clearly you're getting price now and
service is – well let's call it less than optimal, is there any relation between rail service and pricing or should we not
look at it that way?
<A - James A. Squires>: Clearly, there is. And our pricing potential will only improve with better service levels. In
the long run, you have to give the customer something more in order to obtain price increases and that's one of the big
reasons we are spending now to get service back up, so that we will be able to grow volumes, but also so that in the
long run we'll be able to take prices up for a better and better product delivered to the customer.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. And I guess my follow-up – and I apologize if you guys already covered because there
were some overlapping calls this morning – we haven't seen any announcements out there in terms of getting Don's
position filled. I was wondering where you guys are at there, and are you reviewing outside candidates as well as

Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Good morning. Hey, Marta, first question for you. How much additional borrowing
capacity do you have? And have you gotten more comfortable raising the overall borrowing and leverage profile of the
business going forward?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Yes. We have quite a bit of additional borrowing capacity. As I mentioned earlier and as I'm
sure you know, we didn't issue any debt last year so we are planning to issue debt this year and we're comfortable
bringing up our leverage levels but staying within our current credit ratings band, BBB+, Baa1.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Is there like a target level of coverage that you're shooting for?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Well, the target is to stay within the credit rating's band. Because last year we didn't issue,
we floated down a little bit from within the band. We're still within the band but floated down a bit. So we're
comfortable ramping-up towards the upper end of that band but staying within it.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: All right. Thanks. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, a Jim or Mark, I guess –
have you guys given any thought into how much of the service-related costs you guys are pouring into the network
right now actually do come down? I get the velocity driven improvements allow you to pull some costs down, but I
would also think that the change in freight flows across your network are requiring a different level of resource than
you've had in the past. The change in like the haul, longer haul, intermodal, less short-haul, coal, that kind of stuff.
How much of the extra investment you're putting in should we expect to actually come out?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: We're expecting the $42 million that we highlighted in the first quarter, we think is going to
moderate to $25 million in roughly the same categories that I outlined. A little bit less percentage wise in
compensation, because the compensation part in the first quarter had a transportation part and a maintenance away part
related to the weather. So percentage-wise, the comp part will come down a little bit, and the total will be $25 million.
And then we believe if we get up to the train speed levels that Mark described in the second half, we think we will not
have service [indiscernible] (01:28:40). So that $25 million in other words would go away in the third and fourth
quarters.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: But do you get the $42 million or the $25 million back next year? Or do you think
there's going to be some of that cost that's just going to be in the network?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Oh, no. I think those costs are the costs that we view as purely transitory in nature.
And the answer to your other question is that, yeah, as we see business mix change, we can see some shifting in
resource requirements, particularly in terms of maybe where we need train crews. But net-net, I don't think that those
changes are material in terms of overall crew requirements or train operating costs.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Even though with the difference in length of haul on coal, you'd think that would just
take more labor hours but ...
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, you're looking at length of haul on coal changing as basins change. As Illinois
Basin coal comes on, we haul the coal longer, farther, as the mix changes within coal. In intermodal we've done a pretty
good job, and expect to continue to. We're really not necessarily running a lot more trains, but just getting more and
more containers on each one of the trains through stacking and additional train length. So as I say, Mark, I don't think
net-net that amounts to a whole lot, do you?

The next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Good morning and thank you for your time. My first question relates to call. So I appreciate that
we may be looking at a stabilization in quarterly run rates on the domestic and maybe the export front as well. But still
this year we're looking to, it sounds like, 10% decline in the domestic volume and maybe mid-teens in exports. So what
does coal alone do to your operating margin or to your operating ratio this year in terms of the headwind?
<A - James A. Squires>: It unquestionably is a headwind. When we see the kind of year-over-year declines that we
experienced in the first quarter of 2015 and projecting for the balance of the year, so, yes, we think a steadier run rate in
both utility and export coal tonnage. But the comparisons are difficult. Second quarter of 2014 was our peak quarter for
utility coal volume, and so we're comping that very difficult comparison. And similarly, in the third quarter, as utilities
rebuild stockpiles into the third quarter, we're facing some difficult comps. Now, by the time we get to the fourth
quarter it gets a little bit easier. And we would expect to see lesser year-over-year volume declines.
On the export side of the franchise, as we've discussed, the comparisons really get easier in the second half, beginning
in the second half, and again, particularly in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of 2014 total export tonnage was 4.8
million, so it dropped below 5 million tons by the fourth quarter of last year. So a tough middle part of the year, a tough
couple of quarters coming. By the fourth quarter we start to see growth resume.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Can you say maybe if you face specific challenges in your franchise compared to your eastern
peer and how we can think about the operating ratio impact?
<A - James A. Squires>: No, we don't think we face peculiar or particular challenges relative to our eastern
competitors regarding that.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Okay. And also on your operating ratio, if you'd like to quantify or maybe just say you're not
prepared to maybe assess the impact of coal, that's fine, but on the ex coal and ex- the fuel surcharge hit this year,
would you comment as to whether you see mix, just below the top line being a tailwind or a headwind on the operating
income level? I mean, we're focusing so much on the top line, but surely there must be benefit in growing intermodal
and merchandise, right? If you can help frame that for us, that would be very helpful.
<A - James A. Squires>: Absolutely. And we've said in the past and it's still true today that our general merchandise
businesses, particularly volume moving in our scheduled network are our highest incremental margin businesses. You
layer it on top of the natural, spontaneous favorable economics of volume growth in those businesses a significant core
price increases and that's really a key driver of improvement for us. Now, much of this, unfortunately, will be masked
in the middle part of the year by the fuel surcharge headwind, which will be significant.
And with the kinds of deltas to last year, we're talking about in the top line from fuel surcharge alone, we will probably
see margin pressure in the second and third quarter, unlike in the first quarter where the decline in fuel expense actually
exceeded the decline in fuel surcharge revenue. That will flip most likely given the magnitude of the fuel surcharge
revenue headwind in the second and the third quarter.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Thank you. I appreciate it.

Well thanks, everyone, for bearing with us on what has been a somewhat long call, but hopefully we have given you a
lot of data and a lot of color on what we're doing. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to talking to you next
