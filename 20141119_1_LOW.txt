Good morning and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. I am pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter.
Comparable sales were 5.1%, driven by an increase in comp average ticket of 3.4% and an increase in comp
transactions of 1.7%. We saw a balanced performance this quarter across our three business areas. Building and
Maintenance, Home Décor and Seasonal has all delivered comps within a tight range. We had positive comps in all 12
product categories with particular strength in fashion fixtures, kitchen appliances, millwork and outdoor power
equipment. Sales across the country were balanced as well with all three divisions, the North, South and West, all
generating comps in the mid-single digits. In fact, all 14 regions had positive comps.
We saw continued strength in our ProServices business, which outperformed the company average during the quarter,
and I'm pleased to share that our team in Canada delivered double-digit comps in local currency for the sixth
consecutive quarter. We remain focused on improving our profitability, even while investing in key capabilities to drive
sales growth. For the quarter, we drove 81 basis points of operating margin expansion and earnings per share of $0.59,
a 25.5% increase over last year's third quarter.
Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $900 million of
stock and paid $229 million in dividends. We're pleased with our performance in the third quarter and continue to be
cautiously optimistic about the home improvement landscape. Disposable personal income and revolving credit usage,
which are key drivers of discretionary consumer spending, appear to be improving above the relatively weak trends
experienced during most of the recovery to date and the consumer is also benefiting from lower interest rates and
falling fuel prices.
Existing home sales remain on a modest uptrend and the latest reading on the broadest measure of home price growth,
FHFA, improved modestly from last quarter suggesting home price appreciation in small to mid-sized markets
continues, which bodes well for consumers in Lowe's footprint. These positive trends align with recent consumer
confidence readings and the results of our third quarter Consumer Sentiment Survey, which revealed that homeowners'
views around personal finances and home values continue to improve.
In fact, confidence in both local and national housing markets increased to pre-recession highs this quarter. In addition,
to the improvement in sentiment, homeowners disclosed that now more than any time since 2006, they are looking to
invest in their homes. And while most consumers planned projects are still small ticket, we are seeing a rise in
big-ticket projects, which is encouraging.
Continued improvement in the macroeconomic landscape, together with our strengthening execution, strategic
priorities, and keen focus on productivity and flow-through give us confidence in our business outlook for 2014. I
would like to thank our more than 260,000 employees for their efforts in achieving this quarter's strong results and for
their unwavering commitment to serving customers while we further transform our business model. We look forward to
sharing our long-term vision for the business at our Analyst & Investor Conference on December 11.
Thanks again for your interest, and with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.
Michael A. Jones
Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone. As Robert shared with you, we had a strong quarter with positive comps
across all regions in all product categories. We continue to capitalize on an improving macro backdrop through our
enhanced sales and operations planning process, improve our relevance with the Pro, and develop Customer Experience
Design capabilities.
Our outdoor power equipment category experienced the strongest growth in the quarter with double-digit comps. A
milder summer helped launch a healthy well into the fall and we're prepared to meet strong demand for mowers and
trimmers with great national brands like Husqvarna, John Deere and Troy-Bilt, supplemented with the launch of our
Kobalt line of battery-powered handheld outdoor power equipment. In addition, concerns about another cold, wet
winter prompt many customers to buy snow throwers and other winter products earlier this year. We're able to meet
that early demand, thanks to strong vendor partnerships and a robust distribution network.

We also drove above average comps in millwork, kitchens and appliances, and fashion fixtures. All three categories
benefited from customers' increasing interest in refreshing both the exterior and interior of their homes. We encourage
them to choose Lowe's for their project needs through target promotions and our investment in project sales specialists.
We have project sales specialists that focus on the exterior of the home available across all U.S. stores and we're
continuing to expand our interior project sales specialist program as well.
Our project sales specialists are simplifying the process by guiding customers through inspiration, design and
installation. Customers have responded positively to these programs and we are pleased with their performance.
Fashion fixtures also benefited from the strong sales of light bulbs particularly our home-centered exclusive line of
OSRAM SYLVANIA LED bulbs, a brand customers know and trust.
As Robert mentioned, our pro business continued to perform well. In fact, our pro comps outpaced the company
average for the 13th consecutive quarter. The pro continues to grow faster than the rest of the home improvement
market and we strive to provide pros with great service that makes doing business with Lowe's as quick and convenient
as possible. We engage with pros through multiple channels in store where we have dedicated specialists to answer
questions and dedicated loaders to help pros get back to the job quickly.
At the pros' place of business where account executives help maintenance, repair, and operation customers order and
replenish products regionally, through our national account representatives who assist pros who do business with
Lowe's across the country, and online where we are also committed to providing convenient services to pros. In fact,
our beta test of LowesForPros.com is going very well. This dedicated platform is fully transactional and will also
provide pros useful functionality such as the ability to develop requisitions lists, and the ability to see their purchase
history, as well as customized product categories. This site can also be integrated with many purchasing systems that
pros use to manage their business, further streamlining their day-to-day operation and helping pros work more
effectively. We have been expanding our test group and have received positive feedback on the site's flexibility and
ease of use. We expect a soft launch late in the fourth quarter.
We also continue to work with vendors to add brands that our pros know and trust. I'd like to provide one specific
example to convey the opportunity we believe we have with the pro. In August of this year, we introduced the Henry
Coating brand of roof repair and driveway sealer products to stores in Southern California, Nevada and Arizona. Henry
Coatings is a leading and relevant brand among pros on the West Coast. We use it for both residential and commercial
application. In fact, our store employees told us that many pros in these markets request the Henry brand, which they
prefer for its durability and ease of application.
Since adding the Henry brand, we have measured double-digit comp sales of roof repair and driveway sealer products
in the markets where this relevant brand was added to our assortment. As we improve our service and product offering
for the pros, it will become increasingly important for us to reconnect with pros who have not recently purchased from
Lowe's and show them what's changed in our stores and online. One way we do this is through pro-focused events. For
instance, September was Pro Appreciation Month in all of our U.S. stores. During the event, we offered better
demonstrations, special values on core pro products throughout the store, and introductory credit offers. Pro
appreciation events help us strengthen partnerships by generating new business. We will continue to use events like
these as well as targeted marketing to drive awareness as we make further progress in addressing product and service
opportunities for the pro.
As we have shared with you previously, our enhanced sales and operations planning process has enabled us to improve
seasonal planning, including the cadence of inventory allocation, staffing, associate training and marketing. This
quarter, this process helped us stay connected and address customer needs for the fall such as planning, home
renovation and exterior maintenance.
We are now transitioning to a holiday focus as customers refresh their homes for holiday guests, decorate and organize
their homes after the holiday. In fact, we have re-purposed the space used for the outdoor living experience to create a
holiday décor experience like no other in a home improvement; one which inspires customers to decorate, raise the
awareness of the breadth of our holiday décor and our gift offerings, and provides project solutions relevant to the
holiday micro seasons.

But it starts even before the customers reach our stores with inspiration through our marketing and online resources,
including Lowes.com, Creative Ideas, Vine videos, and Pinterest boards. When customers arrive at our store parking
lot, inflatables and live Christmas trees set the holiday mood. Then, as they enter the store, they are met with our full
holiday story. This space initially created for our outdoor living experience, which delivered strong results and is made
possible by a larger store format, provides an inspirational holiday showroom where customers can see everything from
poinsettias and artificial trees to indoor and outdoor decorations and gifts. And our feature display sets the stage,
inspiring customers to start dressing up their homes by showcasing coordinated trend-right holiday decorating
solutions.
In our cases, whether to feature display or the artificial trees, the vignettes are clearly tagged to help customers
coordinate style and easily find nearby take-with inventory. We have also consolidated our gift wrap stack-outs as well
as our electric stack-outs to make it easier for customers to identify all the products they would need to wrap gifts and
hang lights. There's more, but you get the point. It's bold and it's rooted in research which indicates that customers want
help coordinating holiday themes.
We are also excited about the exclusive innovations we continue to bring to market, many of which will make great
holiday gifts. These include the Pilot brand InstaBoost Jump Starter, powerful enough to jumpstart cars, SUVs and
pickup trucks, yet small enough to fit in your glove compartment, even with the attached jumper cables; the new
Troy-Bilt Vortex three-state snow-blower with its top rating from a leading consumer magazine; and our new Kohler
Purefresh line of toilet and toilet seats which neutralizes odors while providing a night light, slow-close lid, and other
features.
In addition to our efforts to provide top-line growth, we are focused on driving productivity and profitability. During
the third quarter, our stores did an effective job of managing payroll hours as comp sales accelerated resulting in
roughly 50 basis points of payroll expense leverage. Additionally, last year as part of our value improvement initiative,
we re-invested in our inventory to provide greater depth of high velocity items in more job-like quantities to pros.
We've held inventory per store roughly constant in the third quarter even while increasing comp sales. We are pleased
with the progress we're making this year on sales, productivity, and operating profitability and we continue to look for
ways to improve even further.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's. And now, I'll turn the call over to Bob.
Robert F. Hull
Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $13.7 billion, an increase of 5.6% driven
primarily by comp sales. Total average ticket increased 2.9% to $65.97 and total customer transactions increased 2.6%.
We've anniversaried the Orchard acquisition, so these stores are now considered comp.
For the quarter, comp sales were 5.1%. The monthly comps were 3.5% in August, 5.2% in September, and 6.6% in
October. When compared to last year, the monthly two-year stack was relatively consistent across the quarter. Please
refer to page 7 in the supplemental slides for further details.
For the quarter, comp average ticket increased 3.4% and comp transactions increased 1.7%. Year-to-date, sales of $43.7
billion were up 4.6% versus the first three quarters of 2013, driven by a 3.5% increase in comp sales, the addition of
Orchard, and new stores.
Gross margin for the quarter was 34.49% of sales, which decreased nine basis points from Q3 last year. The decrease
was driven primarily by targeted promotions and the mix of products sold. These items were mostly offset by continued
benefits from value improvement and better sell-through of seasonal goods as a result of our Customer Experience
Design efforts.
Year-to-date, gross margin was 34.82% of sales, an increase of 25 basis points over last year.

SG&A for Q3 was 23.8% of sales, which leveraged 76 basis points. So payroll leveraged 48 basis points as we
continue to optimize hours against customer traffic. Bonus expense leveraged 24 basis points due to lower expected
attainment levels relative to last year. Also, recent expenses leveraged 13 basis points, the result of elevated expenses in
Q3 last year. Year-to-date, SG&A was 23.15% of sales, which leveraged 37 basis points versus last year.
Depreciation for the quarter was $375 million, which is 2.74% of sales and leveraged 14 basis points compared to last
year's third quarter as a result of sales growth. In Q3, earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT margin, increased 81
basis points to 7.95% of sales. For the first three quarters of 2014, EBIT margin was 9.1% of sales, which was 67 basis
points higher than the same period last year.
For the quarter, interest expense was $134 million and de-leveraged one basis point to last year as a percentage of sales.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.6%, which was higher than last year's 37.6%. The higher rate, which was
consistent with our expectations, was the result of tax programs that expired at the end of last year.
Net earnings were $585 million for the quarter, an increase of 17.3% over Q3 2013. Earnings per share of $0.59 for the
quarter were up 25.5% to last year. This is roughly $0.05 higher than our expectations, driven by both higher sales and
better expense leverage. For the first nine months of 2014, earnings per share of $2.24 represented a 21.7% increase
over the same period last year.
Now to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Our cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the
quarter was just under $1.6 billion. Our inventory balance of $9.8 billion increased $169 million, or 1.8% versus Q3
last year. Inventory turnover was up two basis points over last year at 3.73 times. Asset turnover increased nine basis
points to 1.65.
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet, accounts payable of $6.5 billion represented 11.8% increase
over Q3 last year caused by the timing of purchases year-over-year. In the third quarter, we issued $1.25 billion of
unsecured bonds. The bonds consisted of 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year issuances with a weighted average interest rate
of 2.55%. At the end of the third quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.21 times. Return on invested capital
increased 176 basis points for the quarter to 13.02%.
Now looking at the statement of cash flows, cash flow from operations was almost $4.7 billion, an increase of $825
million over last year, largely due to working capital as well as growth in net earnings. Capital expenditures were $587
million, down nearly 4% from last year. Year-to-date free cash flow of $4.1 billion was 26% higher than last year.
In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 17 million shares for $900 million. Also in the quarter, we received 2.3
million shares as part of the final settlement associated with accelerated share repurchase program executed in Q2. We
have approximately $3.4 billion remaining under share repurchase authorization.
Looking ahead, let me share our business outlook. We have combined our year-to-date performance with our previous
assumptions for the fourth quarter. We now expect total sales increase of 4.5% to 5%, driven by comp sales increase of
3.5% to 4% and the opening of six home improvement stores and four Orchard locations. We're anticipating an EBIT
margin increase of 70 basis points to 75 basis points, and expect that the improvement will come from both gross
margin expansion and expense leverage. The effective tax rate is expected to be 37.2% for the year, and we expect
earnings per share of approximately $2.68 for the year, which represents an increase of 25.2% over 2013. We're
forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $4.2 billion. Our capital forecast for 2014 is approximately
$1 billion. This will result in an estimated free cash flow with $3.2 billion for 2014.
Our capital allocation priorities are to, first, invest in the business where we believe we can add value; second, pay
dividends, we are currently targeting a 35% payout ratio; and lastly, to repurchase shares. Our CapEx forecast for 2014
is less than originally planned. As a result, we are increasing our share repurchase assumption by $300 million to $3.7
billion for the year.
Regina, we are now ready for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies & Company. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Morning, Dan.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: My question was related to two things. First was on ticket. Was there any significant
inflation, or was it primarily just in any of the categories like lumber, or was it primarily just big ticket doing better that
drove the ticket growth?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Dan, it was primarily big ticket categories doing better in the quarter, as Mike talked about
strength in OPE. We had good performance in appliances, flooring, and millwork. As it relates to inflation/deflation,
we did see inflation in lumber but that was largely offset by deflation in OSB boards and copper, so essentially no net
inflation impact on the quarter.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: And then you noted target promotions for a little bit of the weakness in gross margin. Is there
a plan to continue that? And what categories do you expect that to be in?
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Good morning. Yeah, we do expect to – we think the impact of promotions in the fourth
quarter will be pretty much the same as it was in the third quarter, largely focused around appliances.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Yeah. So, Dan, the target promotions were largely matching competitor offers, nothing initiated
by Lowe's in the quarter. We do expect a similar promotional cadence Q4 relative to Q3. The impact is probably less
than Q3 as a result of the industry largely going to full promotions for the month of November primarily in appliances.
So roughly 25 basis point impact in Q3, probably a 15 basis point impact in Q4. So less drag in Q4.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: And Q3 was appliances as well?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Appliances and big tickets.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Thank you, Dan.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Yeah, hi. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So the spread between your
comp and Home Depot's U.S. comp narrowed to its lowest level in four years. It's obvious to the question about
whether you think you benefited from the breach at Home Depot. So if you look at the stores that are in close proximity
to the Home Depot stores, did those stores comp better than the others? And if they did, you obviously deserve credit
for capitalizing on some of the disruption.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Mike, this is Robert. I think as we look across the business, we really attribute our strong
performance to the internal initiatives that we've been working on combined with the strengthening macro backdrop.
As I talked about in my comments, the FHFA numbers continue to improve, which means that you're seeing
improvement in home values in the small/mid-sized markets, which I think, as I said, lines up well with our footprint.
So we're focused on our strategic priorities and I think if you look at it on your – to your direct question that probably
90% plus of our stores are in close proximity to the competition. So we wouldn't have seen anything noticeable by
trying to carve that out. So...
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay. And given the cadence of when all that happened, it was hard to discern as well?

<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Correct.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay. My other question is on payroll expenses leveraging 50 basis points, that's a good result.
Do you think that you can maintain that type of performance moving forward? Or was there something unique in this
quarter that won't let it continue?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Michael, we made investment in weekday teams in 2013 and really worked to optimize
those beginning second half of 2013 into 2015. If you look at last year, we actually had some modest payroll
de-leverage, Q3 2013, which drove some outsized leverage Q3 this year. We've got some good tools in place that allow
us to continue to optimize payroll. We do expect further leverage into Q4 and into 2015 but probably not to the same
degree we saw in the third quarter.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: And, Bob, just to follow up on that, are you seeing a benefit to your conversion as a result? Or
was the traffic really driven by draw?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So we have seen improvement in conversion rates. It's really everything we've been doing for
DIYs and pros as it relates to the payroll investment I noted. The inventory investment last year, the line review process
that we went through with value improvement to really get rooted in the products that the customer cares about. We
saw roughly 100 basis point improvement in conversion rate in the third quarter.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay. That's very helpful and good luck with the holiday.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thanks, Mike.

Your next question will come from the line of David Strasser with Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - David S. Strasser>: Thank you very much. Congratulations on a great quarter.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thanks, Dave.
<Q - David S. Strasser>: When you look at your business versus 2005 during the last peak period of time, how
different do you see the store? And I guess what I'm trying to look at is when you think about sales on a per square foot
basis, how dramatic have newer products been to the overall mix? And if you were kind of just looking at it just from a
mix-to-mix standpoint, how much more opportunity do you think there would be in driving those sales on a
like-for-like basis?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Dave, I'll start. Yeah, first of all, when we think about comparing the business all the way
back to 2005, certainly it's a dramatically different environment today, one from an overall macro environment how
strong housing was back then and what it was driving but then two, this whole omni-channel world that we're in today,
so it's – so customers – our real focus is we've got a great footprint of stores out there that is the nucleus of where we're
going with our strategy.
But we're building on that with obviously our own – improving our online capabilities through our contact center for
those who want to talk directly with an agent or through in the home where we've got project specialist exteriors in all
markets and we're rolling out our PSI program, which is capitalizing on a recovering housing market. So I think all of
those things set us up somewhat different from where we were back in 2005. One of the other things that I will talk
about, as Mike alluded to in his comments, is we also think that brands are important particularly with our pro
initiative. And so that is a focal point. The team has been working on to ensure that we have the right brands really in
the store to resonate with our customer and I think that will also help us improving the metrics as well. So...
<Q - David S. Strasser>: Okay. And when you just look at, I guess just from a dot-com standpoint, and you've talked
about this a bunch, from an incremental standpoint, and I'm – how much do you think that can ultimately help

productivity in the store? I know it's a big question. I'm just kind of trying to think of just a little bit bigger picture.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Well, I think it would be significant because I think today, in today's world, from where
we're at from a technology and a customer expectations standpoint, I don't think it can be relevant if you don't have a
website that one is functional, feasible from the consumer's standpoint but also well connected to your other channels
of business. That's why we're after an omni, it's not just multiple channel but it's an omni-channel where these work
together because that really gets back to being able to be there and meet the customer whenever and wherever they
choose to engage in a simple and seamless manner. That's what we believe our customers are looking for. So even
though it might be a small percentage of the actual transaction online, it's heavily induced by people starting to research
online, like 80% or 90% of people that start on mobile, there's only about – 10% of them conclude a transaction there,
but they are looking for what's available in store when they're visiting in.
<A - Michael A. Jones>: So if you think about a holiday décor experience, think about a holiday décor experience I
talked to the fact that it starts online with interest, starts online on Lowes.com and starts online with buying to drive
inspiration and they come into the store. And likewise we saw the same thing happen over the spring with our outdoor
spring experience.
<Q - David S. Strasser>: Yeah. I think the holiday looks fantastic. Anyway, thank you very much. It just looks really
good in the store right now.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thanks, Dave.

Your next question will come from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Hey, guys. I know you highlighted strength in the pro and I think Mike mentioned some
specific initiatives you guys are doing to drive market share, your friends in Atlanta are also focused on this pretty
important customer base and also doing well. I guess my question is, do you think there is a lot less competition out
there to serve the pro than what we had maybe a couple of years ago due to the downturn, which I'm assuming took out
a lot of competitive capacity, number one? Number two, how should we think about your opportunity in the segment
going forward?
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Yeah, I don't know that I could say there's less competition. There's been some consolidation
of some of the small local and regional players, but I don't know that I would think about the competitive set any
different. The example I used was Henry coating in my address earlier where we have the right brands, where we have
the right inventory, where we have the right localization, we see growth. And so we're excited about it. And we'll talk
more about some of our pro initiatives at the upcoming AIC meeting.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: And, Scot, this is Rob. I think it kind of dovetail into our last question when you think about
competition. Yeah, there may have been consolidation, maybe fewer this dedicated pro lumber and building material
yards and they were before the downturn, but also think about technology and how that's changed how, for example,
online and the availability now of being able to interact with the DIY or pro customer online. So that's why we're
focused on launching our LowesForPros.com, because, yes, they may be different but it's still a competitive market.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: So as you guys can invest more in technology and have those systems and capabilities, in
theory, you should be able to continue to gain market share with that customer base.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Correct. And that's why obviously I would continue to have plans to invest funds in those
areas. So...
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Got it. Thanks, guys.

Your next question will come from the line of Laura Champine with Canaccord. Please go ahead.
<Q - Laura A. Champine>: Good morning. Robert, could you just comment on how much Orchard Supply added to
your comp this quarter?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: It basically added nothing to comps for the quarter. We think about the size of the business,
technically it was only in the comp base for two months, so really with or without Orchard, the comp number would
not have changed, Laura.
<Q - Laura A. Champine>: Thanks. And then could you also comment on what drove the appliance business, because
we're particularly surprised by the strength that you saw there in the quarter?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: A couple of – we spoke to being semi-promotional at the same level as our competitors set
in the appliance business a few minutes ago. I like our footprint in appliances. I like the amount of space that we
dedicated to the floor for appliances. We're proud of the fact that we have large stores so we can dedicate space to
appliances and not have to detract space from other important categories like cabinets that helps the consumer pull the
entire project together, and I like our brands. I also like the fact that as we think about building out better experiences,
we own that appliance experience with our customer all the way through to the last three feet. We deliver the
appliances, we facilitate the installation, we really do own that experience. So we feel good about our position. We
think that that the way we're merchandising appliances, our partnerships with key brands like Bosch, Whirlpool, GE,
Electrolux allows us to offer everything the consumers need and it's an area that we're pretty well focused on.

Your next question will come from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: Good morning and congratulations on a good quarter.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thanks, Seth.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: My first question is around some of these big ticket category drivers for the quarter. Would
you care to quantify how much appliances and OPE added to the comp?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: I don't have exact quantification. As Mike spoke of, OPE was in the mid-teens from a comp
perspective, appliances was above the company average. So both were certainly drivers, Seth. If you look at tickets
above $900, that's going to be above $500, comp was up a little higher than 9%. So certainly big ticket was a driver of
the comp in the quarter, led by the categories we spoke about previously.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: Got it. And as you roll into Q4 with continued promotional environment in appliances, do you
expect to see the same level of comp contribution from that category?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: I think as we spoke about earlier, last year was just kind of a Black November from appliance
perspective, so the – while the level of intensity will be more consistent, the impact will be muted because we're
comping against efforts for last year. Therefore, I think we'll see more balanced performance. We do see continued
strength in OPE, but probably not to the degree we saw in Q3. So I would expect a little bit more balanced performance
across categories in Q4.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: Got it. Thank you very much.

Your next question will come from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q>: Good morning. This is [ph] David (37:30) on for Budd. Congratulations on a good quarter. I had a question just
about inventory levels and supply chains. You had your competitors mention seeing – being in a good in-stock position
going into the holidays, but definitely seeing some troubles, I guess you could say, in their supply chain, notably some
congestion at the ports and also issues with driver shortages. Can you comment on if you're seeing any of that?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: This is Robert. I'll start, [ph] Dave (38:03), and when you think about Black Friday and we
think about the holiday season, we think we're in great shape with the inventory already landed and either in our stores
or in our distribution networks, certainly, with what's going on in the ports on the West Coast keeping a close eye on it.
Our team is heavily focused on that and working to develop contingency plans based on how that situation unfolds
going forward. We've been through this before, and so it may cost more to get the freight in but we'll do what we need
to as we think about looking ahead to spring. And keep in mind when you think about our network of distribution
centers, our distribution centers aren't just for cross-docking. They also hold inventory. So that gives us great flexibility
as product is landed to go ahead and bring it in either in our import centers or in our distribution centers to have it
available then to push out to our stores. So we're in great shape as we head into Black Friday into the holiday season
this year. Yeah, there has been a little bit of pressure when you think about higher costs from driver availability and
stuff like that but fortunately with lower fuel prices that's helped to offset some of that cost to what we've experienced
to date.
<Q>: Okay, great. Thanks for that color. And one more question on the modeling going forward, in terms of the 70
basis points to 75 basis points of operating margin expansion you see, can you give us an idea of what that – the
contribution split would be roughly between gross margin and SG&A? Is it going to be similar to what we saw this
quarter? Or a little bit more balanced?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: I assume you're talking about Q4?
<Q>: Yes. Yeah, Q4. Or – yes.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So for the year, we expect the gross margin to be roughly consistent with where we are to date.
The Q3 quarters of performance felt at the last year the lion's share of the expansion is going to come from expense
leverage. As you've heard us talk about, we're really focused on driving productivity and flow-through, so good
expense productivity. We'll see even more of that in the fourth quarter driving productivity. We talked about payroll,
we'll leverage bonus expense in the quarter. We also had some impairment in Q4 last year, we don't expect to recur this
year so we'll have some healthy expense leverage in the fourth quarter.
<Q>: Great. Thanks a lot, guys.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Yeah, thank you, [ph] David (40:30).

Your next question will come from the line of Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Hi. Thanks. Just focusing on that margin, in the past, you've talked about a rule of thumb of 20
basis points of margin expansion for every 1% comp, above 1%. Your guidance this year is ahead of that closer to 25%
to 30%. So my question is how do we think about that going forward? Is your efficiency and productivity such now that
that rule of thumb should go higher?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Yes, we believe so. So the – we think back to where we've been over the past number of years,
the focus initially was on stabilizing the revenue then shifting gears towards productivity and profitability. So we're in
that phase of focus on productivity and profitability. We expect 2015 hopefully looks a lot like 2014. We're in the
throes of developing our plans for 2015 like 2014. We hope to grow comps with flattish payroll hours and flat

inventory dollars. We'll give you more details on 2015 on the Q4 call in February.
<Q - Michael Baker>: So I guess the follow-up question is, does that – with that higher rule of thumb and thinking it
might occur next year, does that give you visibility into that 9.7% operating margin for 2015 that you guys talked about
in December 2012?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Certainly. So that's been part of the plan all along. That's why we've not wavered from the 9.7%
as we need to grow both top-line and productivity. We are getting better flow-through now as you suggested, Mike, in
the 25 basis point to 30 basis point range. We'd like to see if that's hopefully towards the high-end of that range in 2015
but again, more to come.

Your next question will come from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hey, guys. My question is on kind of the pro versus DIY when we think about it from a
margin perspective. Can you talk to kind of the average margin profile of a pro basket versus the average DIY basket?
How materially does it differ?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Peter, this is Robert. I'll start and let the others add on. But when you think about it as we
talk about the pro and the pros that generally we target that shop our stores, they are generally buying across the store.
So you generally are not seeing a significant difference in the basket, margin rate on the basket of what they're buying
versus what our typical DIY customer would be purchasing.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. And then how about the average spend per year? Have you guys kind of benchmarked
that in terms of what you think your pros are spending on average?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: The average pro spend is probably in the $2,000 range. As Robert indicated, they're buying
across the store. There's a healthy margin mix and we feel good about the game plan to serve the pros.

<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thanks.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: A couple questions, one long, one short. For the long one, a lot of talk from you and others
about this pretty significant market share shift we're seeing in the appliance business. You're clearly benefiting from it.
As you look at your customer data, you're getting that maybe that potentially that new customer now buying appliance
at Lowe's, is that someone that's new to Lowe's stores or is it an existing customer now they're expanding their share of

wallet, so to say? And then how sticky has that customer been, if there's any way to determine that?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Well, I think I'll start, Brian. And then I'll maybe get to Mike or others to jump in.
Certainly, as we continue to improve the way we go to market, even improving things like website functionality and the
website search and those type of things, we're making sure that when the customer is in the market to buy an appliance,
we're top in the consideration. And still the majority of the appliances or a significant amount of the appliances that we
sell are still replacement of an appliance that's in a distressed situation. So being there at the right time. But you also
know that as the remodeling market is coming back, consumers are going to put in a new kitchen, we also want to put
in the kitchen we want to sell them the appliances. Well, so the thing about a lot of our targeted efforts, whether that's
our PSI program and those type of things that are really working on a better, in a more effective way with the consumer
in improving their home. I think all of that helps us to have the right products, the right brands, making sure that we are
there when the customer needs us. And on an omni-channel basis, I think helps and that we've got all the key brands
out there, as Mike indicated earlier in his comments. So I think it just positions us well given that the majority of the
customers that come in our store every day are homeowners. When it is time for an appliance, they're familiar with the
brand, they know Lowe's and it sets us up well to continue to gain share in the appliance industry. So...
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Yeah, I'd add a couple things to that. If you think about our ability to help the consumer pull
together that project by deploying our project specialists to their home, that's going to help us expand our relevance
with customers that we have, and gain some new customers. In addition to that, you think about the way we're building
out better experiences, starting online, going into the store, we think that also helps us both make the customers that we
have more sticky as well as start to lean into some new customers. So we look at it – we don't look at it as either or we
look at it as you've got to go after both.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Got it. Okay. Thanks for all the color there. And the second, shorter question and I don't think
you've mentioned this yet, but any comment on sales trends thus far in Q4 recognizing we're early in a back-end
weighted period?
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Yeah. So, Brian, we're off to a great start. In fact we're very impressed with our results thus
far. But it's still very early in the quarter and there is weather risk in January. So at this point, we're comfortable with
the guidance we provided thus far.

Your next question will come from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Two questions. First of all, in terms of market share, your performance this quarter looks
improved from what you've posted recently. I know you've talked a bit about appliances and outdoor power, but from a
bigger picture perspective, Mike or Robert, what do you think is changing? And is that sustainable in terms of your
market share performance?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Eric, I'll start and then I'll get Mike to jump in. But yeah, I think it's a lot of heavy-lifting
we've been doing over the past few years, past few quarters, whether it's line review process, whether it's the
incremental inventory that we put in the stores, whether it's the customer experience work that we've been doing to
bring better experiences. It's improvements that Mike and his team have been working on for the website to make a
better experience, better connected. And then it's things like, it was talked about earlier on the call with the weekday
teams, yeah, we launched those a couple years ago. As those people can get more experience as we get their hours
adjusted in the right part of the store at the right time to meet the consumers' needs, yeah, it feels good particularly and
as we talked about with the environment and home prices improving on a broader scale sets up well for our footprint

and then some of the work that the team is doing to really focus more on the opportunity of that pro customer. Yeah, it
does feel like we've got opportunity to continue to gain market share and to be able to deliver better performance.
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Yeah, I think – good morning, Eric. I'd agree. It's difficult to measure share. You have four
for 40, you have to use a lot of different data to get your perspective. But we also believe that we're gaining share at a
couple things. I think our associates are doing a phenomenal job, they're energized, they're engaged, and they're
meeting the needs of our customers. And so we're so appreciative of what they do. Our outdoor selling teams, our pro
teams, are doing a phenomenal job. The project specialists continue to do a fantastic job. But to Robert's point, our
initiatives are really starting to gain good traction.
We talked about sales and operations planning where we start to plan out the upcoming selling season six months to a
year in advance that helps make sure that we have the inventory we need so we can meet the customers' needs. We
talked about our better utilization of our larger stores, which we believe to be a distinct competitive advantage where
we can show products like our innovations on our innovation end caps. And I don't want to miss our vendor
partnerships, so, so critical. We've got great vendor partnerships that are bringing us innovations and first-to-markets
and working with us to make sure that we have the right brand portfolio to meet both the needs of the pro as well as the
need of the do-it-yourself customer. So a lot of things going well. I know that in your shops, Eric, you've heard lots of
things from our merchandising team and how engaged they are, and they're doing a phenomenal job as well. So just a
lot of things going well, and we're proud of the teams.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Great. That's helpful. And then secondly, in terms of the margin progression and, Bob, your
commentary in sticking with the 9.7% next year, I know there was a period of time where there was a – it felt like a
larger gross margin emphasis in the company. It feels like there's now perhaps a – recognizing an opportunity to better
lever SG&A. I'm just wondered if you can give us a little bit more color on your thought of the slope of margin
improvement from here, and other than sales progress, is there something incremental you're accomplishing that allows
you to lever or improve margin at a better rate than you've done in the past?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Eric, what I'd say is that we guide to EBIT because there's pushes and pulls with margin and
expenses. We want to manage the business with flexibility to respond to competitive actions. We want to have the
flexibility to manage our initiatives and put our initiatives into place. So I'm not sure if the mindset's necessarily
different, Eric. We certainly would expect to have both gross margin improvement and SG&A leverage. It just so
happens we're at the point where we're identifying a lot of productivity opportunities that happen to be expense-related
at this juncture. As the merchant teams go through round two and round three of value improvement, there's still
opportunity to bring value to the consumer, as Mike discussed, partners with our vendors. We think there's additional
gross margin opportunities from that going forward. So just so happens at this juncture we're seeing a little bit more
opportunity from expense.

Your next question will come from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot. I've got a couple of follow-ups. First of all, can you talk to us if you look
through some of the ticket metrics for this quarter, which have some one-offs like OPE, what is the ticket cadence and
the customer traffic in some of the bigger ticket areas telling you about where the customer is in the home investment
cycle relative to the past couple of years? Are you seeing a deepening of interest in some of the bigger-ticket
project-oriented areas? Or are we still talking about more of the repair and maintenance categories driving the business
today?

comments, as we see the consumer getting engaged in home and home improvement, and their thoughts around the

home, their confidence in both local and national housing market and the value of their homes improve, we are seeing
continue to get engaged in taking on discretionary projects. Today, most of those are still in the smaller projects, which
we label as $500 or less, but we did see an uptick versus the same quarter last year and a willingness to take on larger
projects, which we think bodes well going forward as we continue to see home values continue to improve and
consumer finances continue to improve. So...
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Okay. And then the second level of my question, just following up and, Bob, you
addressed a moment ago that the merchants would go back and take a look at other opportunities for value
improvement. What you think is left? Are there quantifiably more areas of the business that you feel you maybe didn't
optimize in the first round as you look at gross margin opportunity?
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Yeah, this is Mike Jones. First, from a value improvement perspective, we view this as the
way we work, so it's not something that will be done. We're going to continue to use that process and continue to work
with our vendor partners to create more value for our customers and so we've gone through round two this year and
made great progress and can be, when we finish round two, there'll be a round three, followed by round four, followed
by round five. So as we continue to look at our business, we continue to find opportunities where [indiscernible]
(53:54) to partner with our vendor partners to take out more costs, quite frankly, both from our side and from their side
and deliver more value to our customers. So this to me, this is not a one and done. We'll be doing this in perpetuity.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: And then, Matt, I would add, just think about 400 line reviews and the average line review had
four clusters. There's no way we got 1,600 clusters right, so there's an opportunity to go back and refine the approach,
dig into the demographics, the customer data, the performance to continue to refine the stats.

<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: I had a feeling it was going to be me. Bob, I got your reference, I'm glad you're impressed
with the start to November, so just so you know. One kind of softer question and then one more specific. You seem like
you're on a good glide path where your comps are now equal to the competition, maybe even better in October. Your
DSIs are down, your DSPs are up. Your business seems to be stable. Can you just tell us about the feeling of the
organization, and I know that wins sometimes beget more wins, so I'm just kind of curious whether or not you're at that
stage of maybe building momentum internally?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Aram, this is Robert. Yeah, you nailed it. I mean momentum is a powerful thing. I think we
see a lot of bounce in people's steps with a lot of initiatives that we've been working on. There's been a lot of
heavy-lifting over the past couple years, all the way across the organization, both in stores and in corporate offices. We
repositioned the company to more of an omni-channel environment, made some great strides and great improvements.
It's starting to come together, and you are seeing a lot of bounce in people's steps and a lot of wanting to deliver, even
better performance in the future.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: Great. We'll be sure to wear our sneakers to the Analyst Day. And my other question is just
on the pro. Tool rental is something that we've heard is near and dear, or at least of interest to pro customers and I think
you guys don't really have that in terribly many stores. Can you talk about whether or not that's something you're
working on, or if you just don't see the merit in it? Thank you.
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Aram, this is Mike. Yeah, we've got it in few – a handful of locations. It's something that we
continue to put on a list to evaluate, but quite frankly with all the other things that we had to get done over the past
couple years, we had other things that we thought were higher priority. So it's something that's on the list, we'll
continue to evaluate it. It's something we may look at doing in a better way in the future. But as of today, we've not
