MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, my name is Keisha and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Charter Communications 2011 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on
mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.
[Operator Instructions]
Thank you. Ms. Moehle, you may begin your conference.
Mary Jo Moehle, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications
Thank you. Good morning. And thanks for joining our conference call as we report Charter's earnings for the first
quarter of 2011. The results we're reporting this morning are included in the news release we issued over PR Newswire
at 8 AM Eastern Time and posted on our website, charter.com. The website also contains the presentation that
accompanies today's comments.
Before we proceed, I'd like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements
contained in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. We'll not review those risk factors and other
cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.
Various remarks we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause
actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's
current view only and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional
forward-looking statements in the future.

During the course of today's call, we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in this morning's
earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar
titles used by other companies.
In today's earnings release we reported results in accordance with GAAP as well as pro forma results for 2010. The pro
forma results reflect the divestitures of cable systems in 2010 as if they had occurred on January 1, 2010, unless
otherwise noted.
The year-over-year growth rates we'll be referring to you on this morning's call are on a pro forma basis. In addition to
first quarter results, this morning we also announced the launch of a senior note offering at CCOH. We'll be holding a
call later this morning to discuss that transaction. We will not be addressing questions for that offering on this call.
Joining me on today's call are Mike Lovett, President and CEO, Chris Winfrey, our CFO, and Don Detampel, EVP of
Technology and President, Commercial services.
I'll now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. With solid financial performance in the first quarter, we're pleased with
our start to 2011. In the first quarter, we continued to deliver solid and consistent growth. Revenue grew 3.1% as we
remained disciplined in driving volume. This approach and the continuing shift to delivery of more high-margin
products more than offset increased programming and marketing costs, resulting in adjusted EBITDA growth of 4.7%.
Once again, adjusted EBITDA growth outpaced revenue growth, with margin rising to 37.5%. We have a solid
platform for growth and our strategies are focused on a few key areas.
We're, one, leveraging our speed advantage to create new relationships. Two, continuing to deploy strategic bandwidth
initiatives and developing next-generation services to enhance our video product. And three, investing in our
commercial platform to capture additional market opportunity. The foundation of our success and what we believe will
truly differentiate us from our competitors is delivering a quality customer experience.
Before I go into more detail on our results, I'd like to share some of our successes on improving the customer
experience. Beyond new leadership and a cultural shift, which is beginning to take hold, over the past few months
we've been conducting several pilot programs across our footprint focused on improvements on a number of fronts. I
will walk through some examples of wins we're seeing in terms of customer satisfaction and operational efficiencies
based on these efforts. Our customer on [ph] boarding (3:55) pilot focuses on making the first months of our customers'
experience with us the best it can be, from order to install to bill and beyond.
In this pilot area, we have seen reductions in trouble-calls, truck rolls, billing repair calls, post-installation. We continue
to focus on first contact resolution and have made meaningful improvements on that front. And now, we are preparing
to rollout various identified process improvements across the footprint. These efforts, combined with greater service
reliability, product enhancements, and increased value have resulted in significantly higher satisfaction scores by our
new customers.
When customers feel they've made a choice in coming to Charter and given our continued improvements in service,
they're more satisfied. In parallel with service improvements, we're making investments in enhancing our brand
positioning, putting our marketing efforts towards more than simply acquisitions spend. The combination of these
efforts is starting to move our overall satisfaction scores up.
Our new practices are not only improving the way our customers interact with and perceive Charter, but they are
creating additional operational efficiencies and we are already seen concrete benefits in lower service costs and higher
retention. We are in the early stages of our customer experience transformation, and there is much work to be done, but
we believe we are on the right path and our customers and financial results will benefit over the long term.

Looking at slide five, on the residential side of the business, we're seeing continued increases in customers across
digital, video, internet and phone, as well as lift in residential ARPU driven by the benefits of the bundle, advanced
services and moderate price adjustments. Leveraging our market leadership in internet speed and bundle value, we
added nearly 90,000 primary service units, or PSUs, during the first quarter and created more than 20,000 new
customer relationships. And we see room for additional growth.
We continued to enhance our video product, and many of our customers are already seeing the benefits of STV as we
launch additional HD channels across the footprint. Our work with TiVo is progressing and we're preparing to deploy
the service in select markets later this year. I really believe NexGen TV will be a game changer for us, and we look
forward to delivering enhanced experience to our customers.
As we continued to expand our HD and on-demand content and promote the value of bundled services, digital
penetration has grown to 75%. Advanced services penetration has risen to 54%, and ARPU has climbed steadily.
Historic results have proven at bundling and advanced services improve satisfaction and increase retention and we are
taking a number of approaches to promote these offers.
As you can see in the chart on slide seven, internet and phone customer growth continues. We have a significant
opportunity for new customer relationships in the 7 million currently unserved homes our network passes. In the first
quarter, we accelerated our deployment of DOCSIS 3.0 and by leveraging the strength of our internet product,
non-video customers increased nearly 50,000 during the first quarter.
Discipline around promotional yet attractive offers and benefits from home networking have kept internet ARPU
steady with the fourth quarter of 2010. More than 20% of our internet customers now rely on our home networking
service and sell-in to new customers is even higher. This reinforces our strategy to become the home entertainment and
communications solution provider for our customers.
As I stated earlier, we remain disciplined, carefully balancing rate and volume and are seeing an increase in lifetime
value and a reduction in associated operating expenses. We believe our approach is playing out well and benefits us
over the near and long term.
Moving to the ad sales business, which is by nature cyclical, revenue increased 7%, primarily driven by growth in the
automotive sector. We continue to look at new innovative ways to increase opportunity in the ad sales space and add
value for our advertising customers.
I will now turn it over to Don, who has more than three decades of experience in internet infrastructure,
telecommunications and web technology to cover the commercial services result and talk about how we approach that
business.
Don Detampel, Executive Vice President, Technology and President,
Commercial Services
Thanks, Mike. When I joined Charter six months ago, I was pleased to find a commercial team with many of the
fundamental elements of success already in place. Over the past two quarters, we've refined our commercial strategy
and approach to further accelerate our growth.
I'm pleased to report that commercial revenue growth ramped at 17% in the first quarter. This is an increase of five
percentage points from the fourth quarter of 2010. This growth reflects customer increases in the small, medium and
large business segments as well as our wholesale carrier business. Not included in the PSU growth Mike mentioned
earlier, we increased commercial internet and phone PSUs year-over-year by nearly 25%, obviously, at a much higher
revenue per month.
And at the end of the first quarter, we had roughly 900 cell tower sites in service, so the pipeline remained solid. But
more importantly than where we've been is where we're going. We have initiatives in place to increase sales force
productivity and enhance our services, and we are aggressively going after the $8.5 billion market opportunity in our

footprint.
I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through the types of businesses we're serving and with what products. We
essentially look at the commercial services phase in four segments. Small, medium and large business and carrier
wholesale. Small business services are for companies with less than 20 employees and the services are very similar to
our residential offerings. This is where we really got started in commercial services, and we estimate there is $1 billion
market opportunity here. Our goal is to achieve significant market share in this segment.
Medium businesses have more complex needs and sometimes multiple sites. Our strategy in this segment is to offer
select targeted products such as fiber internet with downstream speeds up to 100 megabits per second, Metro Ethernet
and voice trunking services, such as primary rate interface, or PRI. We believe medium businesses in our market spend
about a $1 billion a year on communication services.
Large businesses with multiple sites require more specialized solutions and we often build custom fiber networks to
serve these customers. We concentrate on customers that have a large regional presence in verticals such as healthcare,
education and government. The customized solutions in this segment include services such as Metro and long-haul
Ethernet, high-speed internet connectivity and voice trunking products. Sales tactics and channels are more targeted for
this segment. There is about a $3 billion market opportunity here.
And finally, carrier wholesale, which includes cell backhaul services. Given our largely tier-two footprint, we believe
we are in a unique position to enable high-capacity last mile services for wholesale providers. For the latter two
segments, there is an especially long lead time from the sales effort to installation and billable revenue and you will
continue to see some quarter-to-quarter variability in both revenue and CapEx for the commercial side of the house.
As we've said before, we see significant growth opportunity in each of these commercial segments, and I believe we're
making the right investments to capitalize on that opportunity.
With that, I'll turn it over to Chris.
Christopher L. Winfrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Don. Let me begin by briefly highlighting some of the changes we made this quarter to our earnings materials.
We've added some new residential and commercial customer metrics in the trending schedules as well as a bridge
between primary service units for PSU's to RGUs, hopefully providing improved visibility and comparability for
investors.
If you look to slide 11 in the first quarter, we continue to grow our higher-margin Internet, phone and commercial
products and remain disciplined in how we achieved that growth. We delivered 3.1% year-on-year top-line growth with
only 2.1% higher operating expenses, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA growth of 4.7%. The focus remains to develop
new relationships and upsell existing customers to a higher value bundle. And although video revenue is down slightly
due to customer losses we have seen growth in advanced digital services, premium revenue and overall bundling of
video customers.
Internet revenue increased 5.1% over the prior year and penetration is now 29% as we bundle video customers and
increasingly target those non-video households using our speed superiority. Phone revenue followed a similar trend,
with 7.1% growth on prior year, benefiting from the success of triple play with price guarantee bundles.
In the commercial space, we clearly saw the benefits of our fourth quarter installation and preinstall CapEx. Revenue
grew by 17% to $137 million in the first quarter, versus the 11% growth delivered in 2010. Advertising revenue, as
Mike mentioned, increased 7% year-on-year, with benefits coming from the automotive sector. If you compare our
sequential revenue development, keep in mind the significant political advertising in the fourth quarter and advertising
seasonality generally.
Turning now to cost and adjusted EBITDA. I'd like to provide some color on the key factors driving our growth and
margin. Total operating expenses increased 2.1% from last year, reflecting higher programming, marketing and labor

expenses. Programming expenses grew by 3.1% as contractual increases were partially offset by customer losses and
we expect that pressure to continue through 2011.
We increased our marketing expense for residential and commercial customers by just over 15% as we continued to
shift our spend to a healthy mix of branding and with acquisition tactics really focused on customer lifetime value.
Labor expenses also rose by 3% as we invest in marketing, commercial growth and the customer experience. Offsetting
the increases, we're clearly benefiting from the disciplined acquisition and retention strategies implemented in 2010
along with service improvements. And we've seen a significant improvement in overall retention rates and greater than
10% decline in bad debt year-over-year.
Combined with our investments in customer experience, we're also seeing fewer service and repair cost, as well as
truck rolls, which beyond the obvious customer satisfaction point, really benefits the bottom line. Net-net adjusted
EBITDA grew 4.7% to $663 million in the quarter, with margin of 37.5%. And we remained focused on profitable
customer growth, making the right service investments and continued expense discipline.
Moving to CapEx on slide 13. Total capital expenditures for Q1 were $356 million, up 15% over the year-ago period
and increasing to roughly 85% success-based in a seasonally strong quarter. Also compared to last year's first quarter,
we've accelerated our bandwidth initiatives reaching approximately 70% DOCSIS 3.0 homes passed and 64% switched
digital video deployed.
Commercial CapEx also increased by 50% for current and future growth and increasingly we see ROI positive
opportunities for near-net extensions into business parks. Our estimate for CapEx for 2011 remains at $1.3 billion to
$1.4 billion. Though we saw growth in adjusted EBITDA and revenue, net loss was $110 million in the first quarter of
2011, compared to income of $20 million in the first quarter of 2010.
The year-over-year change is largely the result of $67 million non-cash loss in extinguishment of debt in 2011 and a
non-recurring tax benefit of $69 million in the first-quarter 2010. As a reminder, our taxes are predominantly non-cash
due to our significant tax basis and loss carry-forward position. The key point here is we do not expect to be a
significant cash taxpayer until after 2017.
We generated free cash flow for the fifth consecutive quarter, as shown on slide 15. Free cash flow for the first quarter
of 2011 was $72 million, down approximately $130 million from 2010, and that's really driven by $48 million in
CapEx acceleration offsetting $30 million of adjusted EBITDA growth, $50 million of higher cash interest coming
from both the timing of payments and maturity extensions and the remaining key variants for last year, $74 million of
working capital, of which $27 million negative impact in the quarter came from payments timing along with a $47
million one-time benefit in Q1 2010, primarily from increased payables and reduced prepaid to post emergence.
In looking at our capital structure and free cash flow, we remain comfortable with our liquidity, our maturity profile
and our leverage target. Our leverage target, as a reminder, remains four to four and a half times, and we are
comfortable plus or minus to half turn either way to enable strategic opportunities.
In terms of using our free cash flow, we're prepared to invest in ROI positive projects, be it organic growth
opportunities inside the business or M&A to enhance the business and further establish our foundation for growth. And
absent these opportunities, we will evaluate the best return on capital to shareholders through buybacks or dividends or
a combination.
Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Chris. I'd like to add a little color to that point. Q1 was a good example of executing that financial strategy as
we completed an opportunistic buyback of 4.5 million shares, and we recently signed agreements to acquire both cable
systems and fiber assets, strengthening our footprint and taking advantage of revenue and cost synergies.
While completed M&A in the past year has been more tack-on acquisitions or non-core disposals, we are actively
evaluating opportunities and expect to remain disciplined in using qualitative and quantitative filters for any transaction

improves our footprint, impacts free cash flow and overall valuation and any other opportunity costs in relation to our
other operating and strategic priorities.
The key point is we intend to uphold a balanced and consistent financial strategy to deploy capital and take advantage
of market opportunities, be it organic, inorganic or shareholder return practices.
So before we open it up to questions, I'd like to introduce our head of Investor Relations. Robin Gutzler joined Charter
this week from Monsanto, where she has held a variety of leadership roles in finance for the past 14 years. Many of you
have worked with Mary Jo while she has had our IR efforts for the last 11 years. She'll now focus her efforts more fully
on internal communications and media relations and will be working closely with Robin as she gets up to speed.
Mary Jo and Robin have worked together previously, and I'm confident there will be a smooth transition. Please feel
free to me talk to Mary Jo or Robin if you have any questions following this morning's call.
Operator, we're happy to take questions now.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne [Morgan Stanley].
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Hey, good morning, everyone. This is Ben Swinburne. I wanted to ask Mike about the
competitive environment. Last quarter you called out some AT&T offers and DSL and talk about how you were
managing through that, balancing rate and volume. Could you just give us a sense for Q1, how you guys executed on
that plan and what the competitive moves looked like either or data or video or both?
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Yeah. As we mentioned, Ben, and you highlighted in Q4, we saw some pretty aggressive
pricing from satellite and particularly from AT&T in the U-verse footprint and also in the DSL overlap. We saw a
$14.95 price point for what, I believe, was three meg product. And for the first time, we saw it as a naked DSL, it
wasn't required to bundle other services. We didn't chase them on price.
What we did in Q1 is we put together packages to counter the marketplace and give beacon pricing on video at $29.99.
So, a digital package that requires a triple play bundle and a price guarantee commit for two years, we did the same
thing on our the broadband product, we put a $14.99 price point in the marketplace.
And as we've done historically, we leveraged the sales capabilities in our call centers to upsell into higher tiers and
packages. And that's served us very well. We saw a significant, rather dramatic frankly, share flow shift from what we
saw in Q4, favorable to us and across all the Charter footprints in Q1 relative to DSL. So, we feel like we put the right
strategies in place to counter the aggressive discounting that we've seen from some of our competitors.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Do you guys have any view on the ARPU trend as we move through the year? It looks
like the data ARPU probably was impacted by some of that promotional pricing that you just highlighted. I'm just
wondering as you roll out DOCSIS 3.0 and get the uptick to higher tiers, if you expect the ARPU to start growing again
later this year?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, we're balancing the ARPU and it did have
an impact, the pricing that we saw from the competitors certainly had an impact, but we also strategically made a
decision for the second time within 12 months to go with what we call our free fast campaign where we upgrade all of
our existing customers with higher speeds. And we did that strategically because we see significant movement in net
promoter score and a decline in brand rejection.
And obviously, there's a balancing act here between customer lifetime value and near-term ARPU. So we'll continue to
take that balanced approach. I do think there is some opportunity and we are making some minor rate adjustments on
equipment rental, et cetera, in the latter part of this year, but I don't think that will have a dramatic impact on ARPU.

So, it's a balance between share flow and rate.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thanks a lot.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak [Pivotal Research Group LLC].
<Q - Jeff Wlodarczak>: Good morning, guys. It's Jeff Wlodarczak. Can you talk about trends so far in the second
quarter, and then, specifically, I guess beyond second quarter, how you plan to re-accelerate residential phone editions?
And I've got one more.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. The trends in the second quarter, we're going
to continue to take a balanced approach on segments and targeting segments. And I think you can see over the last year,
we've talked quite a bit about this, Jeff, we're looking at those higher-risk decile households and treating them very
differently than we have historically.
All volume isn't necessarily good volume. And I think you can see the benefits of that flowing through the P&L.
Certainly, from a customer lifetime value standpoint we're targeting higher-end households, but you're also seeing it on
the OpEx and the CapEx side of the P&L. So, we're not going to change the strategy. Again, I'd go back to the
marketing and the pricing of the packages that we put into place in Q1. I think we are on the right path there.
<Q - Jeff Wlodarczak>: And then, specifically on phone, how you get that reaccelerated?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. On the phone side, it's still about the bundle.
I think, if you look at our growth on non-video households, we're continuing to focus on trying to drive new
relationships, not necessarily driven by video and data is the key driver of that, but attaching phones to the value
proposition is also part of the success.
<Q - Jeff Wlodarczak>: Some of your peers, I guess specifically Cablevision and Time Warner Cable recently did this
in half of their footprint, are moving to this model where, if you have triple play customers and they elect to turn down
a double play, they're effectively telling them it's more expensive as a way of maintaining phone service. Is that
something you've thought about doing?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, we've looked at it. And we haven't looked at
rolling that out, but we're keenly interested in what some of our peers are doing. I don't know from a customer
experience standpoint if that is the right approach.
<Q - Jeff Wlodarczak>: Sure. And then the second question is, can you remind us what the negative OpEx impact was
in last year's first quarter from your DOCSIS 3.0 switched digital upgrade, versus what it was this year?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Hi, Jeff. This is Chris. I think it was really Q2. And, of course, this is prior to my
time. But it was really Q2 and Q3, where we saw the more dramatic impact. And then inside Q2, there was 1.2% was
the margin effect related to some of the rollouts of these strategic bandwidth initiatives, and Q3 it was about half that,
in Q4 it was about half that again.
And then inside this quarter, i.e., the first quarter, it was relatively negligible. And I'd highlight some of the reasons for
that is every time that you're making these upgrades you're touching a customer's home and their lineup or their service,
it just drives a higher opportunity for a customer to have issues with their service or related calls. That tends to be a
little bit higher during the summer months. So, while it was negligible in the first quarter, we're certainly keeping the
eye in terms of how we roll out the same initiatives through the course of this year.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think it's important to note while we finished the
quarter at 70% homes passed with DOCSIS 3.0 and 64% was switched digital video. So we, obviously, made –
continued make progress in deploying those strategic initiatives.

To Chris's point, there's seasonality in the business relative to service. So, OpEx specifically in Q2 and Q3, while
activity picks up from a seasonal standpoint, obviously, it's hard not to follow the press over the last two months
relative to the storms across the majority of our footprint. We saw storms in the upper Midwest, we saw storms in the
Southwest and certainly we saw storms here in St. Louis and throughout Alabama and Georgia. So, those type of
challenges along with the strategic bandwidth initiatives do have a short-term impact on overall service expense.
<Q - Jeff Wlodarczak>: All right. Think you very much. That's helpful.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Joyce [Miller Tabak & Co., LLC].
<Q - David Joyce>: Thank you. In the past – in the couple years and especially more recently, some of your peers and
competitors have invested in ILECs various cloud computing assets. Based on your acceleration in the commercial
arena, do you – what do you foresee in doing in that space, is it a build versus buy decision or are you happy with what
you've have got in place?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It's an interesting point. When we talk about M&A,
we don't talk specifically about cable properties. And I mentioned in the prepared comments before we went to Q&A
that in the recent quarter we announced that we not only bought some tack-on cable assets but also fiber assets, so
looking at opportunities to extend our commercial reach, we've bought some fiber assets that serve us well there. We'll
continue to look at opportunities beyond cable assets and, particularly, with a keen eye on commercial. And not so
much with looking at buying a revenue stream, but really buying capabilities that would serve us well in the segments
that we're targeting.
<Q - David Joyce>: Thanks. And if I could just tack on, when should we expect you to be done with the switched
digital, video and the DOCSIS 3.0 rollouts?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We will done by the end of this year.
<Q - David Joyce>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kim [Goldman Sachs].
<Q - Jason Kim>: Great. Thank you. Just sticking with the theme of M&A for a moment. If you can just talk
hypothetically, if you were to sell assets, how would you look to use the proceeds in terms of reinvesting in the
business or perhaps paying down debt?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Chris?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Jason. Look, it's all
hypothetical, but we're ready to do so. I think the first call of duty for us would be to take a look at our leverage target,
which as we've said is 4 to 4.5 times. I think around that a lot of people focus on the fact that we've said plus or minus
0.5 and they kind of pick up on the plus 0.5. You know, I'd highlight that we're equally comfortable at the minus 0.5, to
the extent that it enables strategic activity down the road. We obviously have provisions under our credit agreements,
which usually is a one-year investment period as it relates to the bank and possibly up to two years [inaudible] (27:40)
it's certainly been in compliance with that.
And then we would be taking a look at those reinvestment opportunities to satisfy that as it relates to other acquisitions.
And as we've always said, as it relates to our free cash flow that we have today to the extent we're having excess free
cash flow get into lower target leverage for a prolonged period of time, to the extent there's not better investment
opportunities either inside the business or through M&A opportunities, and it's at that point that we'd be taking a look at

a more formal return of capital.
<Q - Jason Kim>: Got it. And if I could just ask one more question about the capital structure, you guys spent a
tremendous amount of refinancing activities since you've exited bankruptcy. And now your [indiscernible] (28:20)
leverage is just around the mid to one times area pro forma for the deal that you guys announced this morning. So, that
[indiscernible] (28:27) seems to be in a very and clearly very manageable. And I'm wondering, how you're thinking
about the composition of your capital structure going forward? And I think a lot of us expected that the [indiscernible]
(28:37) piece to be refinanced with better -- with CCOH at some point, but at the CCO level, are you saving some first
in capacity to be able to address the second liens going forward?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think the first point which you've raised is is there
a specific target as it relates to the split between senior secured and more junior paper on the capital structure, and the
answer is no. I mean, we are going to be opportunistic similar to other fronts as it relates to the capital structure and do
the right thing at the time. So, there's no hard and fast target as it relates to senior leverage or junior leverage. There is
the 4 to 4.5 times plus or minus half on the overall leverage.
And I think to your point, what the transactions really that we've completed over the past year is the best way to
characterize that. What it does is it gives us a fair amount of senior capacity and provides a fair amount of flexibility for
a lot of different things, but including some of the more near-term maturities on non-bank paper.
<Q - Jason Kim>: Got it. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft [Evercore Partners].
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: Hi, thank you. Two questions. I guess first, can you just talk about how sustainable the margin
expansion is on the first quarter is as we go through the remainder of the year? And then secondly, just wonder if you
could talk about how you're handling the back-end infrastructure as you think about IP video or TV Everywhere, if you
want to call it that, as well as your video on demand delivery and the expansion of those assets. Are you building your
own facilities like Comcast and Time Warner Cable, or are you relying on other service providers to do that for you?
Thank you.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So, Brian, on the margin expansion, obviously,
everybody on this call understands that there are seasonal impacts, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, particularly in Q2
and Q3 with volume and also weather-related service issues. That, along with our aggressive push on the strategic
bandwidth initiatives may have some impact on margin in those quarters. But, we feel like the benefits that we're seeing
from our approach strategically, to marketing the right households and looking at customer lifetime value, continues to
flow through the P&L in a very positive way. That, in conjunction with the focus on customer experience, certainly has
a positive impact on churn.
We've seeing positive impact on bad debt, and then we see positive impacts when we have first contact resolution
increases. So, we have less non-revenue generating activity in the system. So, we continue to expect to get those
benefits, but there may be some choppiness relative to seasonality.
On the back-end infrastructure, we haven't disclosed our approach there yet, but I will say broadly one of the things that
I've always thought was a significant benefit in this industry is the collegial nature of investment in architecture and
technology. I look at historically what TCI did with [ph] his to (31:34) the home and how successful that was for the
entire industry. We would imagine that we would be in a position to benefit from some of the investments that our
larger peers are making and align with that architecture, and I think that will serve us well.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: Thanks. If I could just ask one follow-up. I mean, how do you feel about where you are, Mike, in
terms of getting expanded rights as you go through your programming contracts so that you can kind of follow some of
the other -- some of the larger peers in what they're doing with TV Everywhere, as well as some of the tablet

applications they have for in the home.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Our view is similar to what you've heard from
some of our peers that have already deployed tablets within the home. We feel like we have those rights today to have
what in essence is an additional outlet off the secure network within the household. So, it's simply another screen is
how we look at it, whether it's an iPad or another tablet or another device off of our wireless secured network within the
household. And we feel like we have those rights today.
Our first step is going to be, and we've announced the relationship that we have with TiVo, so, the first phase in next
generation television will be the TiVo product, which already has an iPad application. So, it has command functions
and some -- currently some limited capabilities to watch recorded content on the device.
The next phase will be going down the path, à la Cablevision as an example, where you use that device and extend it
within the secured network in the household. From a TV Everywhere standpoint, that's kind of on the chalkboard for
us. We don't have a strategy specifically laid out. But, I would imagine similar to what I talked about with the benefits
that we get from R&D from other larger peers and participating in CableLabs. And again, I think the collegial nature of
the business is a benefit for consumers that will follow that path.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: Great. Thank you, Mike.

Your next question comes from the line of [ph] Rich Tulo (33:26).
<Q>: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. First question, would a potential acquisition be contingent on the
divestiture, hypothetically speaking?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm sorry. Could you repeat that question?
<Q>: Would a potential acquisition within the core of your operating area be contingent on divestitures in non-core
assets?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No.
<Q>: Okay. And owing to the storms, how is that going to play out in terms of -- is that going to accelerate the rollout
of DOCSIS 3.0 and other CapEx plans, or is this just going to be a one quarter phenomena?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The storms don't have any impact on our approach
and our project plans for strategic initiatives.
<Q>: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Vineyard [RBC Capita Markets Equity Research].
<Q - Ryan Vineyard>: Thanks. So, with some of your peers acquiring content, whether it's sort of larger branded
content or even local sports rights. Could you talk a little bit about if you think content might at some point fit with
your business?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Our focus today is on being a pure distributor. So,
we haven't put anything on the burner relative to content in this phase. We think the opportunity for us strategically is
more on the distribution side of the business. And we think there's enough upside here for us to focus on that and not be
distracted by other strategies.

<Q - Ryan Vineyard>: Okay. And then, as you think about improving your video product and adding more HD
channels, do you think there's an opportunity to use IP streaming to accelerate or sort of leapfrog that process or you
know, what's been the typical timeframe to do that?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The way we've looked at improving our video
product, and I'll go back to the relationship we have, starting with the user interface with the TiVo product, so we've
got a very robust video-on-demand content library, but it's somewhat clunky today in the current user interface, so the
consumer's not getting the full benefit. We think the first phase of improving the video product is the bridge that TiVo
provides for us before we move to a fully-blown IP network. And we think that will have a tremendous impact, and I
personally am really excited about the impact it's going to have on our video business and allow us to start winning in
the marketplace, particularly with higher-end households.
Operator, next question?

Your next question comes from the line of [ph] Amy Young (35:59).
<Q>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess this question is more for Don. Should we see the growth accelerate in
the commercial segment over the next two quarters, and are you more aggressive of gaining share on the small,
medium or large segment?
<A - Don Detampel>: Good question. You know, first of all, as I mentioned in my comments, you know, the
commercial business is a bit choppy, especially with large business and the work we do with carriers. We certainly
hope to stay on the growth track that we're on and over time accelerate it.
As far as segments where we see the most opportunities, certainly, the small business segment, as I mentioned in my
comments, is a market where we believe we can achieve very high market share. That's very close to our DNA. Most of
it is served off our coax plant, which obviously has more coverage than our fiber plant, so we spend quite a bit of time
focusing on how we do a great job with small businesses. And then, we do have select products that work very well for
the medium and large business segment as well.
<Q>: Great. And can I have just a quick follow-up question on TiVo? Will this be available to all your subs and have
you talked about what the pricing will look like for this product?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, we're actually going to be running several
pilots with regards to how to go to market with the product, so haven't disclosed that yet. We'll be deploying in the
latter part of this year and then going into full production across the enterprise in 2012.
<Q>: Okay. Thanks.

Your last question comes from the line of Lance Vitanza [CRT Capital Group LLC].
<Q - Lance Vitanza>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the call. You list up the carrier wholesale opportunity at about $3
billion. I wanted to just focus, if I could, on the wireless backhaul piece of that. How big a piece of that $3 billion do
you see wireless backhaul?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We haven't, Lance, we haven't disclosed the
breakout of the segments. And at this point, we don't intend to, but I will say it is a sizable opportunity and it's a
near-term opportunity.

<Q - Lance Vitanza>: I know you mentioned earlier on the call, you are now on 900 cell sites, I believe it was. Can
you tell me how many total cell sites are in your footprint?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We haven't disclosed that either but I can tell you
we have a very, very robust pipeline.
<Q - Lance Vitanza>: And is there anything that you can say regarding revenue per site, either now or what you
expect to see based on what others have discussed, once you're fully ramped up?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Lance, look, I think they are
all very good questions. I think what we've tried to do in this quarter's earnings release is put a spotlight on the
commercial segment to really in fact, give a lot more disclosure than I think is being done in a lot of different places.
We've put two slides in particular, I don't know if you had a chance to look at the presentation that we used today, to
really highlight on the different segments.
As it goes to the cell backhaul price per site, you can imagine for competitive reasons that's not something we want to
be sitting here on this call really giving a whole lot of detail, but we wanted to just try to give people a lot more color,
give something people could actually touch as it relates to the commercial side of the business. I hope people have had
a chance to reflect on that and the additional color that we've provided in the trending schedules, if you can appreciate
we're trying to move this little bit forward.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Right. The one thing I would add and we've shared
this previously, that he returns associated with cell backhaul are very attractive, and they're very attractive with a single
tenant. And as you can imagine, once you have fat pipe up to their tower, there are multiple tenants that you can upsell
to.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: And I will also add, on the
way to those cell sites a lot of times we pass business parks and other opportunities, so we're very strategic on the way
we choose our routes to those towers.
<Q - Lance Vitanza>: Thanks, guys.
Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you. Well, I'd like to thank you all for participating this morning. Look for to talking to you again soon.
