Now it's my pleasure to turn our call over to Ryan.
Ryan M. Lance
Thank you, Ellen, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin my comments on Slide 3
and cover some of our key third quarter highlights. This quarter marked an exciting milestone, our first full quarter as
an independent E&P company. As you saw from this morning's release, we posted strong performance this quarter, and
hitting our numbers is critical to achieving the goals we have set for ourselves. Really a special thanks to our
employees who continue to step up and deliver. We continue to make progress on our divestiture program. Completing
this program will improve our portfolio, reset our base for future growth, and add financial flexibility to the company.
In the third quarter, we generated about $0.5 billion of proceeds from asset sales, including our interest in
NaryanMarNefteGaz, and we continued to advance our progress on other assets. Year-to-date we have generated $2.1
billion in proceeds from asset dispositions. A key part of our strategy is to grow organically.
Our exploration program continues to build momentum, both on the unconventional and conventional sides of the
business, and Matt will talk more about these programs shortly, but I am pleased to see these programs gaining speed.
Operationally, we achieved the high end of our estimated production range for the quarter at 1.525 million barrels
equivalent per day. This performance represents an important milestone for ConocoPhillips. We achieved 3%
year-on-year volume growth when adjusted for dispositions.
Key production highlights include ongoing strong performance from unconventional assets in the Lower 48, especially
the Eagle Ford, and from our oil sands in Canada. In addition, compared to a year ago, this quarter benefited from the
resumption of production at Peng Lai and in Libya. Our major projects are also progressing as planned, and Matt will
provide additional color on these in his comments.
As I move to the financial themes, we generated $1.8 billion of adjusted earnings or $1.44 per share. Our diversified
product mix and geographic mix continues to buffer us somewhat from ongoing weaker North American natural gas
and NGL prices. Excluding working capital, we achieved $3.9 billion in cash from operations. And finally, we
improved our balance sheet this quarter, lowering the debt-to-cap ratio to 31% from 33%.
So in summary, we had a strong quarter strategically, operationally and financially. We stayed focused and delivered
on the aspects of the business that we can control.
Now if you turn to Slide 4, I'll quickly address the state of the business and highlight our focus areas and priorities for
the rest of the year and into 2013. First and foremost, the business is running well. We completed our worldwide
seasonal turnaround activities on time and on budget. Our major projects and drilling programs are on track to deliver
volume and margin growth. These include our Lower 48 unconventional resource plays as well as our major growth
projects in the Canadian oil sands, the North Sea projects in the U.K. and Norway, APLNG, and our Malaysian
deepwater projects. These are the major projects that underpin our long-term goal to deliver 3% to 5% production
growth and margin expansion at flat prices.
As I mentioned a minute ago, our exploration program is continuing to gain momentum. We are currently testing
several unconventional and conventional opportunities, and are advancing others quickly to the drill-ready stage.
Earlier this week it was announced that we had acquired slots in a sixth generation rig to begin executing on our
operated deepwater Gulf of Mexico program by 2014.
Again, we are focused on completing our strategic asset disposition program. We have several packages on the market
and expect some of these assets will take a little bit of time to divest, but we're being patient, and we remain committed
to getting the program done at acceptable prices. We believe we're on track to deliver the $8 billion $10 billion of
proceeds by the end of 2013.
So with a quarter to go in the year, we now believe our capital spending will come in between $15.5 billion and $16
billion, a bit lower than we guided to in the second quarter. Where we end up in this range depends on whether or not

we find attractive opportunities to add unconventional acreage between now and year end. We continue to be
opportunistic in the market for acreage that fits well in our portfolio.
Maintaining our balance sheet strength is essential. We continue to keep a close eye on our financial position to ensure
that we have the flexibility and the capacity to execute our plan. And finally, we remain committed to our stated
strategic goals of profitable growth and sector-leading returns. And I believe this gives a good quarter and gives a good
evidence that we are executing on the parts of the business that we control, and have projects and programs in hand to
support these goals.
So now let me turn over the call to Jeff for a financial review.
Jeff W. Sheets
Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start out the review of our third quarter results with Slide 5, which
shows our total adjusted earnings and realized prices. We'll go through the detail in each of our segments in subsequent
slides, and I'll defer the operational detail and updates to Matt.
Total adjusted earnings were $1.8 billion this quarter compared to $1.5 billion in the prior period, and $1.9 billion in
the third quarter of 2011. Third quarter 2012 adjusted earnings exclude special items related to net gains on asset
dispositions, changes to tax laws in the U.K., pension settlement expenses, and some other items. Details of these
special items can be found in the supplemental data provided with our earnings release.
Our production came in at the high end of the estimate we provided last quarter. Total sales volumes for the quarter
were in excess of production, resulting in a favorable impact to earnings of approximately $80 million, and we'll
discuss these details as we go through the segments.
Sequentially prices weren't a huge driver in earnings. North American gas and bitumen prices increased, while
domestic crude and NGL prices decreased. Despite increases this quarter, North American natural gas prices remained
challenged, and this impact – we continued to offset this impact by shifting our investments towards liquids production.
Operating costs were consistent with our expectations.
Let's turn to Slide 6 and talk about our total production. Production of 1.525 million BOE per day was in line with our
expectations. Stepping through the waterfall, dispositions reduced production by 53,000 BOE per day compared to the
third quarter of last year. The dispositions included Vietnam, Statfjord, Alba, and some Western Canadian gas assets, as
well as the NaryanMarNefteGaz joint venture.
Downtime was heavier than normal this quarter, reducing production by 49,000 BOE per day compared to the same
quarter last year. We had major turnarounds this quarter in Alaska and in the U.K. Growth more than offset base
decline, accounting for 256,000 BOE per day of new production, with the majority of the growth coming from the
Lower 48 shale plays and our oil sands assets. We also had considerable production increases over these periods from
Libya and China.
In summary, volumes were up 3% adjusted for dispositions, but importantly the 3% growth was largely driven by a 7%
increase in liquids production, as shown on the dark blue bars on the slide. As we announced this morning, we now
expect our full year 2012 production volumes to average between 1.57 million and 1.58 million BOE per day.
Now I'll turn to the segment slides, beginning with the Lower 48 and Latin America on Slide 7. Production in this
segment was 462,000 BOE per day this quarter, an increase over prior periods, as we continue to successfully ramp up
production in our Lower 48 shale plays.
Total liquids production in the segment increased 21% over the same period a year ago, while natural gas production
decreased 3%. A year ago, liquids represented 40% of our production in this segment, and in the third quarter 2012,
liquids increased to approximately 46%. We expect this liquids percentage to continue to grow and drive our margin
expansion over time.

During the quarter, production was 76,000 per day at Eagle Ford, with 79% liquids, and 26,000 BOE per day in the
Bakken, with 88% liquids. Total production of 102,000 BOE per day from these two plays has doubled compared to the
same period last year.
Compared to the second quarter, the increased liquids production along with a 26% increase in realized gas prices
contributed positively to earnings in this segment, while continued declines in NGL prices negatively impacted
earnings. Despite the sequential increase in natural gas prices, the segment earnings continue be impacted by generally
weak natural gas prices.
Next we'll move to the Canada segment on Slide 8. Canadian production was 277,000 per day in the third quarter, with
the growth over prior periods being driven by the ramp-up at our oil sands assets. Liquids production increased 30%
year-over-year, while gas price decreased by 6%, and this shift will show up as improved margins over time.
Canada reported negative adjusted earnings this quarter, largely reflecting ongoing weak natural gas prices. However,
earnings were improved compared to the second quarter as natural gas and bitumen prices improved quarter over
quarter. We also saw the WTI/WCS differential improve late in the quarter and the price of diluent decrease, and this
resulted in an overall improvement in bitumen netbacks. And it should be noted that despite the negative earnings, the
Canada segment continues to generate strong cash flow.
Now let's move to the Alaska segment on Slide 9. Production in Alaska was 176,000 BOE per day this quarter, down
39,000 per day, but in line with our expectations. This production decline was largely due to major turnaround activity
all across our assets on the North Slope. The impact of lower production on earnings was offset by sales from inventory
this quarter, and these sales from inventories contributed approximately $120 million to the Alaska segment's earnings.
As a result, adjusted earnings of $535 million were roughly equivalent to the prior quarter, and improved from a year
ago.
I'll now turn to Slide 10 and talk about the Asia Pacific and the Middle East segment. Asia Pacific and Middle East
continue to be a strong performer for ConocoPhillips and provides important diversification to our portfolio. Production
in the segment was 306,000 BOE per day during the third quarter. Both the Bayu-Undan field and they Darwin LNG
plant were fully online this quarter after being down in the second quarter for planned maintenance. Production
continued to ramp up at Peng Lai, increasing 20,000 BOE per day over the prior quarter.
We exited the quarter with net production of 45,000 BOE per day, and we expect to maintain this level of production
during the fourth quarter. Now where we had a gain in Alaska on the last slide from sales out of inventory, Asia Pacific
and Middle East earnings were adversely impacted by about $60 million related to lift timings.
Europe's our next segment and we'll cover that on Slide 11. Production from the Europe segment was 191,000 per day
during the quarter, a sequential decrease of 45,000 per day. Natural field declines, downtime, and asset dispositions
contributed to the lower production this quarter. Downtime resulted in 28,000 BOE per day impact, primarily from
planned maintenance at the Judy, East Irish Sea, and Britannia platforms. The majority of production that was offline
during the third quarter due to downtime should be back online during the fourth quarter.
The disposition impact was about 8,000 per day from Statfjord and Alba. So adjusted earnings of $299 million declined
versus the prior quarter, primarily due to this lower production. It's important to note that we benefit in a portfolio sense
from having exposure to the stronger pricing in this segment.
Now I'll cover our next – final geographic segment, the Other International on Slide 12. So I'll remind you that this
segment includes our assets in Russia, the Caspian, and Africa. Production was 113,000 BOE per day, basically
maintaining the same level of production that we've seen over the past couple quarters since Libya came back online.
Adjusted earnings of $124 million this quarter were helped by favorable settlements of certain tax items. Prior quarter
earnings were negatively impacted by higher taxes, exploration expense, and adverse foreign exchange impacts.
Earnings were also impacted by the sale of NMNG in mid August. At the time of the sale, NMNG was producing about
11,000 BOE per day, and was dilutive to earnings.

The final reporting segment I'll cover quickly is our Corporate and Other segment on Slide 13. Adjusted corporate
expense during the quarter was $139 million. This is lower corporate expense then we expect to see going forward, as
the quarter benefited from licensing revenue as well as some favorable foreign exchange impacts. But for the company
overall, total foreign exchange was not a factor in the total quarter's earnings.
For the year, we estimate this segment's expense on an adjusted basis to be about $850 million. We repaid $2 billion of
debt during the quarter, bringing the total debt outstanding to $21.1 billion. At the end of the quarter, total debt-to-cap
was 31%, and our long-term target remains to be in the 25% to 30% range.
If you turn to Slide 14, I'll cover our operating segment margins and returns. This four-pack charts on this slide
summarizes our key financial metrics for the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, all four metrics were negatively
impacted by lower North American prices as well as our overall realized price declined by about $5 per BOE compared
to the third quarter of last year. Our income and cash contribution per BOE were helped this quarter by the inventory
sales in Alaska, but also reflected the operational and portfolio improvements that we're starting to make as a company.
And over time, we expect these metrics to improve as we deliver on our growth programs, our margin expansions, and
our continued focus on returns.
So I'll wrap up my remarks on Slide 15, which is our third quarter company cash flow. As Ryan mentioned in his
opening comments, we generated $3.9 billion in cash from operations this quarter, excluding working capital, and
working capital was a $412 million use of cash. We also generated $522 million in proceeds from asset dispositions.
We funded a $3.7 billion capital program, bringing our year-to-date capital program to $11.9 billion. We paid out
roughly $800 million in dividends, and reduced debt by about $2 billion.
During the quarter, excluding working capital, our cash from operations and proceeds from dispositions funded our
dividend payments and our capital program, and we used our restricted cash to pay down debt. We ended the quarter
with $3.7 billion in cash equivalents and restricted cash.
So our balance sheet and financial situation remains strong. We're well positioned execute on our program.
Importantly, we have capacity and flexibility to fund the programs that will generate volume and margin growth going
forward.
That concludes the review of our financial results, and I'll now turn the call over to Matt for an update on our
operations.
Matthew J. Fox
Thanks, Jeff. I'll take us back through our operating segments and provide some detail on our drilling programs, growth
projects, and both our conventional and unconventional exploration activities. I'll cover some highlights from the third
quarter, but I'll also update you on current activities and provide some color on what expect in the near future.
I'll start with the Lower 48 and Latin America segment on Slide 16. First I'll focus on two key areas, the Eagle Ford and
the Bakken. In the Eagle Ford, we have about 230,000 net acres, and our acreage is largely located in the condensate
fairway, which the industry recognizes as the best part of the play. And we have 14 rigs running in the play today.
In the third quarter, our production averaged 76,000 BOE per day, and we achieved a peak production rate of 86,000
BOE per day. In the fourth quarter, we expect to achieve a peak rate of 100,000 a day as we continue to drill and hook
up wells. And we're actively adding infrastructure in the play to create value. For example, we're adding stabilization
facilities like the ones shown on the top left to remove light ends, maximize our light crude sales at pipeline spec, and
to maximize our capture of NGLs.
We should have our entire Eagle Ford acreage position held by production by the middle of 2013, and that's important
because it allows us flexibility to find new technologies and thoughtfully determine the most capital efficient way to
develop our overall acreage position.

Switching now to the Bakken, we have more than 620,000 acres in this liquids rich play that's all held by production.
We exited the quarter with a production rate of 26,000 BOE per day. And as a result of incremental takeaway capacity
from new rail facilities, we've ramped up from five to eight rigs, and we'll see the benefits of this increased activity in
the fourth quarter and in 2013.
We also have significant exploration activity underway in other unconventional plays in the Lower 48, including the
Wolfcamp in the Delaware and Midland Basins, the Avalon Shale, the Lewis Shale in Wyoming, the Niobrara, and the
Mancos in the San Juan Basin. We expect to have results to discuss in these plays by early next year. And I should note
that these are just a few of the opportunities we're evaluating in our vast Lower 48 land position, and we continue to
identify other potential plays where we can acquire unconventional acreage at low entry prices.
Moving onto conventional exploration, we have some significant activities underway in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater
and continue to build a portfolio of future opportunities there. Just for some context, we have 1.5 million deepwater
acres in the Gulf, making ConocoPhillips the sixth largest deepwater acreage holder there. Our initial strategy for this
area has been to participate in non-operated wells while building a COP operated portfolio.
Currently we're drilling two non-operated wells, the Coronado prospect and a Shenandoah appraisal well. We're also
just about to spud a third well, Hummer, a [ph] sub-Pliocene (21:57) exploration well. And we anticipate four
additional exploration wells spudding in 2013 along with a Tiber appraisal well. And the potential for additional
appraisal wells exists if we have success with our exploration wells, so we're really excited about our 2013 program in
the Gulf of Mexico.
Our long-term strategy is to build an attractive operated lease position that will allow us to drill three to six wells a
year, and to advance our operating program that was announced on Tuesday that we've secured access to a new
deepwater drillship to use across our operated portfolio starting in 2014.
So please go to Slide 17 and we'll talk about the Canada segment. Our oil sands assets in Canada are a big part of our
growth story. In fact, we are currently the second largest SAGD producer in Canada, with 23% of total SAGD
production, and our assets continue to perform well. Christina Lake Phase D reached first production in July, three
months ahead of schedule. Foster Creek is performing well, and Surmont Phase 1 achieved record production in
September. As a result, third quarter bitumen production was 92,000 barrels per day net after royalty. And we expect
production to average over 100,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter.
Continued expansion at FCCL is ongoing, and construction of Surmont Phase 2 is progressing towards first production
in 2015. Surmont is a large scale development. When it's ramped up to full production, the project will produce at a
gross annual average rate of 110,000 BOE per day, equivalent to about three typical FCCL phases. And we continue to
expand. For example, the sanction of Narrows Lake Phase A and Christina Lake Phase E – or Phase F, sorry, are
anticipated by year end.
Now the application of new technology is critical to the development of SAGD because it can add significant value due
to the size of our resource base there. So we're starting an enhanced SAGD pilot in November, and we're actively
testing several other technologies that will increase rates and reduce steam/oil ratio.
Moving to our Western Canada business unit, here our drilling program is focused on liquids rich and light oil
opportunities in our portfolio. And we're also drilling or planning exploration wells in several of our unconventional
plays in Canada including the Duvernay, Montney, and Horn River. In addition to that, we're preparing for a winter
exploration program in the Canol oil play in the Northwest Territories, where we hold more than 200,000 net acres.
And like the lower 48, we hold a significant amount of land throughout Western Canada that's held by production, and
we believe some of this acreage could be prospective for additional tight oil and shale liquid plays.
So let's finish out North America with Alaska on Slide 18. Major turnarounds were successfully completed at Kuparuk,
Prudhoe, and Alpine this quarter. In fact, Kuparuk was completed 14 days ahead of schedule. In October, the
ConocoPhillips board approved the North Slope's Alpine West project, also known as CD5. The project is now pending
partner approval which we expect in November, and production will start from Alpine West in 2016.

As you may have seen in the press, we're working with the other producers in Alaska to evaluate LNG exports from the
North Slope. The producer group has been focusing on narrowing down development concepts and assessing the cost
of the major project components. In the Chukchi Sea, we're targeting drilling a Devil's Paw prospect in 2014. Now this
prospect is in 135 feet of water so it can be drilled with a jack up rig with surface BOPs and a pre-positioned capping
device on the sea floor.
Now we continue to invest around $1 billion a year of net capital such as Alpine West and infill drilling programs
across the North Slope. Significant additional oil development opportunities exist contingent upon more competitive
state fiscal terms.
So let's move to Slide 19, the Asia Pacific and Middle East segment. We produce more than 300,000 barrels per day
from this region and it's an area of significant growth for us over the next five years. We continue to make progress
with the Australia Pacific LNG project. The project remains on track with premise, scope and cost, and is on schedule
for the mid 2015 start up of Train 1 and 2016 startup of Train 2.
Now we track project progress in three main categories here: upstream, midstream, and downstream. In upstream, all
major contracts for gas processing and water treatment plants and associated gathering systems are fully executed, and
module fabrication and drilling are progressing. In midstream, the main pipeline work is in progress with right-of-way
clearing, grading and pipeline stringing proceeding as planned. The downstream development of the LNG site at Curtis
Island is also proceeding as planned, with engineering progress ahead of schedule and all construction access, dredging
and mainland facilities completed in third quarter.
At Poseidon, Boreas-1 was a successful appraisal well, reaching target depth on September 18 with encouraging
results. The well was drill stem tested at just over 30 million cubic feet a day against a flowing tubing head pressure of
3,300 PSI. Drilling operations will now begin on the second well of the program in November, and this is part of
five-well appraisal program that we'll conduct over the next two years.
In the Canning Basin, we drilled and cored our first well. The well was drilled to about 12,000 feet, and 1,400 feet of
core was collected. This is the first of a three-well program that will be completed by mid 2013.
In China, our net production at Peng Lai reached 45,000 BOE per day at the end of the third quarter, and production
should remain fairly steady at that level for the remainder of the year. The first well at our Panyu Growth project came
on in late September. Current Panyu production is about 8,000 barrels of oil per day net, and this project will add
another 8,000 barrels per day between now and 2014 as we drill additional wells from the two new platforms.
We now have four major projects in execution in Malaysia: Gumusut, Siakap North-Petai, KBB, and Malikai, which
was recently approved. First oil is expected from an early production system at Gumusut in the fourth quarter of this
year. SNP and Gumusut full production will start in late 2013. The startup of the others will be staggered between 2014
and 2017. We're also working on several other project developments in Malaysia, and we have the potential to
significantly grow this business over the next five to ten years.
Due to recently renegotiated gas sales contracts in Indonesia, we will see significant increases to our realized gas prices
for both our Natuna Sea Block B sales to Malaysia, and of Corridor Block sales to the Indonesian domestic market.
Now these price improvements positively impact the value of both assets, and increase the attractiveness of additional
investment in these PSCs.
Finally in this segment, conventional exploration in Bangladesh, there we've completed shooting seismic and we expect
to complete the processing this year.
Please turn to Slide 20 and I'll provide an update on our Europe segment. We are focused on progressing our major
projects in Europe. In the U.K., we completed a major turnaround at Judy that included preparing for the tie-in of the
Jasmine project, and we installed the associated pipeline and jackets. Development drilling results at Jasmine are
exceeding expectations and we expect first oil in the second half of 2013. In the U.K., we're also planning a five-well
exploration and appraisal program at Greater Clair.

In Norway, we installed jackets, bridges and bridge support for the Ekofisk South project, and commenced pre-drilling
activities this quarter. We've also progressed modifications to existing facilities on Ekofisk and Eldfisk in preparation
for tie-in of the new facilities. First production for Ekofisk South and Eldfisk II are expected in late 2013 and late 2014
respectively.
In Poland, we exercised our option to acquire a 70% interest in Lane Energy, and assumed operatorship of three
western Baltic Basin concessions for an additional exploration well that's currently being drilled.
The final segment I'll cover is Other International on Slide 21. As we mentioned earlier, we completed the sale of our
30% interest in NMNG. Our Libya production returned to pre-conflict levels. The third quarter average was 47,000
barrels per day. Additionally, the Faregh gas sales agreement was executed in early September, and this will result in a
production increase of about 4,000 BOE per day for the rest of 2012 and going forward.
In Kazakhstan, Kashagan production is expected to be online in the first half of 2013. We completed our seismic on
Angola blocks 36 and 37. Our blocks are immediately upward of the Cameia discovery in block 21, and we're
encouraged by what we've already seen in the seismic. Drilling is expected to start in 2014.
I'll conclude my prepared remarks by reiterating the things you've heard consistently today. Operationally the team is
staying focused on executing the base business, while successfully funding our emerging growth programs. We're also
seeing the payoff from the past few years of opportunity capture, both in our unconventional drilling programs and our
conventional major projects. Our exploration team is doing a great job not only building up our opportunity set, but
advancing our current inventory to a drill-ready stage. So I echo Ryan's earlier comments about how much there is to
look forward to over the next few quarters and beyond.
So now I'll turn the call back over to Ryan for some closing comments.
Ryan M. Lance
Thanks, Matt. And if I could get you all to turn to Slide 22 for some summary comments. The most important takeaway
I think from today's call is that the business is running well and that our plans are on track, and I'm pleased with our
performance in our first full quarter as an independent E&P company. We remain highly focused on executing our
major projects and our drilling programs, and we're also building and testing our conventional and unconventional
exploration portfolio. I think Matt's overview should give you confidence that we're making strong progress on these
activities.
We're also executing on the strategic asset disposition program. When complete, these asset sales will improve our
portfolio and create financial flexibility. This flexibility is core to our strategy, and you've heard from Jeff that
maintaining a strong balance sheet is and remains a top priority. The bottom line, our long-term value proposition
remains unchanged. We believe we have the portfolio and the programs to deliver 3% to 5% growth in production and
margins, with improving absolute financial returns and a sector-leading yield. This is our commitment, and we're on
track to deliver it.
We're also committed to keep you updated on our progress. We expect to announce our 2013 capital budget in
December, and our year end reserves and financial results early next year. And finally I'd like to encourage all of you to
save the date for our first Analyst Meeting as an independent E&P company. We'll host our meeting in New York on
February 28, and we'll provide a detailed update of our strategic plans for growth and value creation.
So thank you for your interest and participation this afternoon, and we look forward to your questions.

Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And at this time, we have a
question from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Hey, everyone, congratulations on the results, and it certainly feels that confidence in 2016
growth and that margin improvement is building. I guess I have a question just looking beyond 2016. I mean as you
look across the portfolio, do think non-conventional shale is enough? Or what should we focus most on do you think in
the sort of pre-drill potential of the offshore portfolio?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, thanks, Ed. I appreciate the comment. I think as we look out beyond 2016, that's the
work that Matt alluded to in the operating update, is we're working both on the conventional and the unconventional
side of the exploration business. So I think you'll watch both those spaces globally, in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater
and in North America, and we hope globally in the unconventional space as well. We're working that pretty hard right
now to load up the inventory for the latter half of this decade.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: And then a sort of more specific question just coming in on the Eagle Ford, obviously you've
got some good production performance there. Could you just remind us what acre spacing you're planning your
production on, and sort of any IP rate targets that are behind that target? Because it feels like if you're already up at 100
about 110,000 barrels a day guidance for 2013, that the well performance or the efficiency or something is changing.
That means you're ahead.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So we have 230,000 acres in total, and we're currently thinking that the ultimate spacing will
be about 80 acres, so that's what we're planning for. And that results in about 1.8 billion BOE associated with the play.
But we have pilot tests going on – several pilot tests going on in Eagle Ford where we're testing different technologies
and different spacing, so that might change over time as we learn more. Our IPs continue to be of the order of 1,200
plus barrels a day, and we're seeing strong IPs compared to the industry average. We think the completions are working
well there.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: And just to confirm those IPs, what time period?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Those would be 30 days.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Right, yeah, they would be pretty good. Okay, thanks very much.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Thank you, Ed.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Ed.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good afternoon, everybody, and also congratulations on your results.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Thank you, Doug.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Ryan, you mentioned a minute ago that underlying production growth was 3% in Q3, and it
looks like we're going to have another 3% gain in Q4. So the first question is whether or not that's your expectation for
Q4 as well? And then second, obviously higher production is important, but your profitability and returns were near the
highest level of the year during the third quarter as well. So I wanted to see if you could specify some of the functional
and/or geographical drivers behind the improvement in the returns as well?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, thanks, Doug. Yeah, we gave you kind of a range for the full year, and expect us to come
kind of in that range pretty well. So you can see the growth that's coming in the fourth quarter. And I think as we look
across the portfolio, we came out of the turnaround season pretty well. We've added rate in China and Libya, in the
Canadian business unit, and then the ramp-up in the unconventionals in the U.S. are providing a lot of the production
growth that we're seeing in the third and the fourth quarter.

And then those areas are also as we see prices bouncing around, differentials bouncing around as well, those same areas
have largely led to the income and the margin improvements that we're seeing as well, primarily China coming back,
and the growth in both North American unconventionals and the Canadian oil sands.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. And then also administratively, the exit rate for NMNG was 20,000, 25,000 barrels
per day, is that about right?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: No, the exit rate was probably closer to 11,000 for us...

Thank you. Our next question comes from John Herrlin from Société Générale. Please go ahead.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yes, hi, just some quick ones. With the Eagle Ford, how long are the laterals? And how many
drilled but unfracked wells do you have currently inventoried?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: The laterals are typically 5,000 feet. I don't know off the top of my head how many we have
drilled and not hooked up yet, but we have quite a few that we're waiting to hook up over the next quarter and into Q1.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay, that's great. In terms of your expenditures, if you're going to split it between
conventional and unconventional, is 40% a good estimate for unconventional CapEx exposure?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, that's a reasonable estimate for where we'll be going on our unconventionals in our
planning.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Last one for me is Poland shale, you've had other companies exit. Why are you
optimistic?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Well, we still see potential in that sort of Peri-Baltic region of Poland where we are drilling
just now. But time will tell. We're testing a different part of the play, moving a bit farther north towards the Baltic with
the well that we're drilling just now. And so we'll see how that works out.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Thanks, Matt.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, John.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Hi, everyone. Just right at the end there, you said something I just wanted to clarify which was
that you're targeting a sector-leading yield. Can you just kind of run through that? Because it's not actually on the slides
that I see.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, I think as we think about it, Paul, today we're yielding 4.5% or so, given where our stock
price is. And as we think about our peer group as a mix between independents and the major integrates, we think the

yield that the dividend will underpin for the stock will be at the upper end of all that peer group. Now some of the
European integrates will be a little bit higher, but where we are relative to a mix of peers in the integrated and the
independent side, we think it's one that falls at the top end. And it's an important part of our value proposition, and
we're committed to maintaining that kind of a dividend.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: So you're committed to maintaining the yield at the higher end of the range?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, I mean the yield will – I mean we expect the stock price to grow, so the yield will
probably come down a little bit. We're committed to maintaining the dividend that we've announced and where we're at
today.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Okay, I think we'll – you guys have got an Analysts Meeting next February, right? So – I'm just
not quite sure about the dividend policy, because I mean I think you've got dividend as your top cash priority, and you
have said that you want to grow the dividend. I'm not sure exactly what you said on the percentage aim for that, if
anything. And then I guess the yield is not – with all due respect, not quite what you meant. Because obviously it would
be a different thing if you were targeting a best in class or upper range yields.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, so let me – so, Paul, what we're talking about is – what we said is we'll allocate 20% to
25% of our cash flows on an ongoing basis back to the shareholder, and we'll do that primarily through the ordinary
dividend. And we expect over time as our production grows and our margins grow, that our cash flows are going to
grow as well. So I think what we say is we ought to expect modest increases in the dividend as we go forward over the
next five years and deliver on the program that we've outlined to the market.
It probably won't grow as fast as what the dividend has grown over the last ten years in the integrated company. But as
we look forward over the next five, as our cash flows grow and our margins grows, so shall our cash flows grow, and
our commitment to our shareholders remains the same. We're going to distribute that percentage of our cash back to
them.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yeah, that's great. I understand now.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: And the yield will be – hopefully the share price will increase and the yield might come down
a little bit.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yeah, sorry, I was just picking you up on that. But it wasn't actually written down so I couldn't
be sure that's – I understand now.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Okay.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Just my second follow-up, back to the Australia LNG, you kind of started down the road of
explaining where we were on costs and progress. Could you just remind us what the total project cost is expected to be,
when the critical moments are for activity? If I give you an example, Chevron's Gorgon Project will have its peak
activity level next Q2 2013. Could you talk about where the – if you like, the maximum level of risk lies and the
timeframe going forward, and where you see the overall project costs?
And you began to break that down between your three segments of where the costs lie. Can you talk a bit more around
those? And I think you talked about the extent to which you were contracted but I wondered if you could go through
some completions levels and so on. Thanks.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, I'll let Matt jump in as well. I mean we're still at a two train $20 billion project for
APLNG, and that's upstream, downstream, midstream, all combined up. We haven't seen any indication – that's without
FX considerations which might move around a little bit over the course of the next four to five years as we complete
the scope.
I'd say we're ramping up to peak kind of rates. I think we'd probably hit there end of 2013 and into 2014 is when we
start with our peak manpower, both on Curtis Island and what we're doing on the upstream side of the project as well.

<A - Matthew J. Fox>: I mean the project is on track in terms of the progress. The critical path's intact, and we're quite
comfortable with the way things are working just now on APLNG.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: And when's the – given the critical path, when will be the kind of maximum points of risk over
the next coming quarters or whenever?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: As we go through the critical path, I mean for example, one of the things on the critical path
for an LNG project is typically the LNG tanks themselves, and they're ahead of plan. They – basically as we work
through a critical path, there's always the sort of individual milestones that you want to meet, but we're comfortable that
we're on track to do that.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: And if we rolled that up into a project completion number so far, where would we be? I think
you might have said that actually, sorry.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Project completion number as in the capital cost?
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yeah, no, exactly. What percentage is kind of done?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Percent complete just now for the total project is about 20% I think.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: 20% to 25%.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Thanks, good afternoon.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Hello, Faisel.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Hello, Faisel.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Hi. When we look at what's going on in North America today, there seems to be a lot of asset
transactions taking place. I just want to get your guys' update on acquisitions. I know your divestiture plan is fairly
straightforward, but just want to get your update on how you're thinking about also acquisitions, given all the
transactions we've seen of late. And I have a follow-up after that.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, thanks, Faisel. I think on the acquisition side, we're mostly focused on acreage
acquisitions and have been over the last year or so. I think we've added a bit over 700,000 net acres to the portfolio in
the last year. So what we're focused on is trying to identify these unconventional plays early, so we can be a very early
mover and get in at a more of a ground floor type of opportunity, rather than getting in after pilots have been done and
the resource is then de-risked and drilling has started to occur to develop it. The price goes up pretty dramatically when
you reach that stage. So our effort's really been focused on the organic side and capturing our opportunities early.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: And in the Gulf of Mexico, are you pretty satisfied with your position? Or if assets were for
sale, would you take a look at them?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, I don't think we're ever satisfied with our position. We continually look for opportunities
to improve it or consolidate our positions, and bulk up what we like and farm out what we don't like.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, understood. And I'm looking at the Eagle Ford and the Bakken positions and in your
prepared remarks, I think you talked about how you're developing some infrastructure. What is that infrastructure spend
exactly? And when is that going to come to an end over the next – I guess in the future?

Page 13 of 17
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So this year we're spending around $600 million, $700 million on infrastructure. I'm not exactly
sure what numbers are for next year, but it's mostly a 2012/2013 expenditure to kind of build the backbone through our
acreage as we develop that whole acreage position.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. And then if I'm just thinking about the projects that have been sanctioned and kind of I'm
thinking about reserve bookings, it seems like you've got some additional sanctioning in Canada. You've got the I think
Alpine West you said, and then you also went forward with the second train of APLNG. Are those kind of the big
things I'm thinking about? And how would I also think about the Eagle Ford where you have 1.8 billion barrels of oil
equivalent in place?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, so we'll see reserve bookings at the end of the year associated with the ones that you
listed, plus we expect to see our proved preserves in Eagle Ford increase. We also sanctioned the Malikai project in
Malaysia, so we'll see reserves increase there. So – and there'll be some puts and takes on various other assets, but those
are the major reserve additions that we expect.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, got it. Great, thanks for the time, guys, appreciate it.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Folks, good afternoon, congratulations on the results. I had a couple for you. One's a little bit
more detail, but I noticed the Lower 48 natural gas production increased fairly sizably. And I'm trying to determine – I
know there was some gas that was previously shut in. Can you say whether that was a result of that gas coming back
online? Or maybe you could just answer where you stand today with regard to shut in gas?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So we don't have any significant volume shut in at all now. So some of that increase is gas
coming back online, but the majority of it is increases in associated gas production with our liquids rich plays, for
example Eagle Ford.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Okay, second question is on I guess oil sands in general. There's been a awful lot of press
reports on assets being marketed from you guys up there, and I know you're probably unwilling to share too much. But
I'm just curious if you could talk in general how the oil sands fits into the portfolio?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, I think the oil sands are important in our portfolio, they – important growth, the margins
are good, and they have a different profile obviously relative to some of the other assets, but important in
complementing a large portfolio like ConocoPhillips has. You have heard we have gone out looking at marketing some
of our oil sand positions, primarily some of our Surmont, and some of our 100% acreage we have outside of the area.
We got a lot of interest in it. And in fact, we got enough so that we got proposed a number of different structures. So
we're stepping back for a minute and taking a look at what might work best for ConocoPhillips as we think about our
options that we have with our position in Canada.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Okay, Ryan, but just to be clear, we shouldn't view that as potentially a full exit out of oil
sands, right?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: No.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Okay. And sorry, I'll sneak in one last one. I know you're I guess in the conceptual phase of
ANS Gas LNG out of Alaska. Obviously you have a fairly decent position up in Western Canada as well. I'm just

Thank you. Our next question comes from Iain Reid from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Yeah, hi, gentlemen – sorry, and lady. Just a couple questions please. I think you talked about
natural gas price improvements coming in Indonesia and Libya, and you can see that your Libyan realization picked up
substantially, so I was just interested in why that is? And also on the Indonesian side, is that something we've got to
look forward to, or is that something which has already happened?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: On Indonesia, it's really something that we have to look forward to, on both the Malaysia
contract and the domestic Indonesia contract. We should start to see those coming through the fourth quarter.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: And is that something structural or was it an oil price effect, or what is that?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: It's a renegotiation of the gas contract from Malaysia because PETRONAS wanted to secure
more gas, and because the Indonesian government wants to incentivize more development of domestic gas production
in Indonesia, so they're moving towards more market-based pricing. So those are really the drivers.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay. And what happened in Libya?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Faregh gas contract?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: I mean we had the Faregh gas contract, but that didn't happen until September.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Right...
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So we had a little bit of that in the third quarter which is the – if you're looking at the realized
price per MCF in Libya...
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Yeah.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: ...we started to sell gas under that contract.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay. Second question is I'm just wondering how you feel about your U.K. North Sea portfolio.
You've obviously got a couple of developments there, but you're also I think going to sell some assets over time with
the tax increases, et cetera. Are you a kind of net seller now of the U.K. or are you – after this disposal which is in the
works? Or is there something else coming?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, no, I think we've been pretty pleased. So the North Sea in the U.K. sector, you've got to
divide that into kind of three areas: the Central Graben, the stuff we have up West of Shetland with our Clair interest in
the East Irish Sea, and then the Southern North Sea that we have. We did try to market our Southern North Sea position
a little bit earlier in the year, but that got hung up with a bunch of changes that were occurring in the government in the
U.K. side with taxes and abandonment liability and some of those issues.
So – but the core area that we still like and remain – think there's still opportunity there are things like Jasmine
developments that tie into our existing infrastructure. So we see additional opportunity off the Britannia platform,
bringing more wells and additional satellites into production in the Britannia area. And we're currently exploring in the

<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay, all right, guys. Thanks very much.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Iain.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Thanks, Iain.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hey, guys, good afternoon.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Hi, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: I have a number of short questions – hopefully real short. Matt or Jeff, for the APLNG, the $20
billion, what's the percentage that is the Australian dollar base, and what FX rate that you used in the budget, if you can
remind me?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: It's somewhere between 50% and 60% Australian dollar, and I don't know that we have a
particular FX rate that we're going to quote in the budget.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: I see. Matt, how many well do you already drill in Poland? And is there any result that you can
share from those well?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: We've drilled a total of four wells, three in the Peri-Baltic region, and we've got one more that
we're drilling just now. But I'm not really ready to talk about the results that we've had on those wells yet.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: I see. Ryan, I know that you're going to give the budget in December. If you're looking at right
now that – do you expect the budget will be pretty similar to this year, or that it's going to be higher or lower?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: I'd say it's in the range of where we're at this year.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. Jeff, on the corporate expense, do you have a guidance there for 2013, 2014, what kind
of a quarterly run rate that a normal quarter may look like?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, maybe just a couple words about our corporate segment. So when we – with the spin and
the way we've realigned our segments, some of the things that didn't used to be in corporate are in corporate now, so –
particularly some of the technology operations, so that's going to introduce a little bit of volatility to corporate numbers.
But you think about kind of core corporate, which is made up primarily of net interest expense and kind of corporate
G&A, that's going to be around I would say $220 million a quarter, more or less. But there's going to be probably more
volatility in the corporate number than you might have been used to seeing in the past.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Jeff, that's a after tax number, right, $220 million?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, that's an after-tax income number, right, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. And, Matt, I'm just curious that, is there any core key difference between your
consolidate bitumen output and your [indiscernible] (58:41) bitumen output? So in other words, that when we're
looking at estimating the pricing on – the implied bitumen pricing, is there any core key differences that we should
assume that there would be differences?

<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Well, basically you can think of that in three different areas. Surmont produces a synbit, so the
bitumen is blended with a synthetic. The FCCL assets both blend with a condensate. So as condensate prices and
synthetic prices move around, that affects the netbacks. Within FCCL, Christina Lake has a higher TAN content than
Foster Creek so as a result, it sees a bit of a discount to the blend that it sells. But roughly speaking at current prices, the
netback at Surmont and at Foster Creek are about the same, and the netback at Christina Lake is a bit less because of
this high TAN content.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Matt, have you guys received a final approval to restart fully on Peng Lai from the Chinese?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: We've submitted a EIA application and overall development plan, revised overall development
plan. We expect the approval shortly for both of those.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. A final one, Jeff, on – from a inventory standpoint at the end of the third quarter, are you
guys still underlift, overlift, or should we assume that you're -pretty much that you're catch up by now?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, when you have an operation the size of ours, and you've got a lot of liftings happening –
oil liftings happening in places like Europe and Alaska and in Asia, every quarter you're going to have a little bit of
fluctuation between the amount that you sell and the amount that you produce...
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Sure.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: ...and it's going to go plus and minus. So I mean generally we're in a balanced position. But we
talked in the first quarter that we had about an $80 million negative impact from timing. We've come out this quarter,
we said about an $80 million positive impact from timing. We're likely to see that order of magnitude types of swings
can happen just because – through normal operations of timing of when...
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Sure, fully understand that. From a inventory standpoint you're pretty balanced at end of the
third quarter?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Right, but again, we'll have pluses and minuses, and particularly when you look at particular
segments, you can have pluses and minuses just as part of your normal operations.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Very good, thank you.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Paul.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov. Please go ahead.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Hey, guys, I want to go back to one of the earlier questions about the dividend, your
long-term growth target of 3% to 5% and your simultaneous target of having one of the highest dividends in the
industry. If you discover that both cannot be done at the same time, which do you choose?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, we've said our priority on our funding is with the dividend.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: So I guess what's the minimum acceptable level for organic growth? In other words, would
you be willing to take that down to 2% to 4%, 1% to 3%? Or is it just – or is the dividend unambiguously what you
would choose, regardless?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So we would like to be here in ten years saying we've had steady dividend raises every year over
an extended period of time. How fast we grow the dividend is going to be a function of how fast cash flows actually
grow. We sit today at one of the higher dividends, and we've had some very strong dividend growth over the past
decade.
I think what we're saying is we expect to have dividend growth going forward. It won't be at the same pace that it's
been the past, but that's a key part of our delivering to the shareholders. And we really can't sit here today and tell you

exactly what the dividend growth rate is going to be going forward. It's an important part of what we offer the
shareholders.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Okay, appreciate it, guys.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. That concludes the time that we have for the question and answer session. I'll now turn the call back to
Ellen DeSanctis for closing remarks.
Ellen R. DeSanctis
Thank you, Kim, and thank you, everybody. If there were folks in the queue that we didn't get to, Vlad [dela Cruz] and
I are obviously more than happy to cover off your questions offline. Thank you very much for your interest, and we
look forward to ongoing communication in December and certainly in the early part of the year. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now
