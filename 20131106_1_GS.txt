Ms. Miner, You may begin your conference.
Heather Kennedy Miner
Good afternoon. This is Heather Miner from Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our Fixed Income
Investor Conference Call.
Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future
events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial
condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion
of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results and financial condition, please see the
description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2012.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it
relates to our estimated capital ratios, estimated risk-weighted assets, total assets, and global core excess, and you
should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor
Relations portion of our website, www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group,
Inc., and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent.
Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will give a brief overview of the firm's year-to-date operating results,
balance sheet, and capital management strategy. And our Treasurer, Liz Robinson, will review the firm's liquidity

Harvey M. Schwartz
Thanks, Heather, and thanks to all of you for dialing in today. I apologize for starting a few minutes late. We know a
few of you are having a hard time dialing in and we just wanted to give everyone a chance to participate in the call. In
terms of today's discussion, Liz and I are going to walk you through some slides. They've been posted on the Investor
Relations website at gs.com.
Turning to the first page, we wanted to start with a quick overview of Goldman Sachs' financial profile by examining
our key credit characteristics. As you know, there's been a fundamental transformation of our balance sheet and credit
profile since 2007. As we'll discuss throughout this presentation, liquidity and capital are up significantly, while risk is
down. We continue to finance our assets with term funding across unsecured, secured and deposit channels.
Underpinning our strong credit profile is our risk management infrastructure. The risk infrastructure is built on
conservative limits, stress testing, and a single technology platform.
Before Liz and I delve deeper into credit-related topics, let's spend a moment on slide two, reviewing our year-to-date
performance. Year to date, we generated net revenues of $25.4 billion, net earnings of $5.7 million, and earnings per
diluted share of $10.89. This translated into an annualized return on common equity of 10.4%. You can see on the right
side of the slide, the revenue mix has been diverse and broad. While there were some headwinds in the third quarter,
our year-to-date performance remained solid in what continues to be a somewhat challenging macroenvironment.
This difficult operating environment has impacted client activity during the course of the year. In the U.S., clients have
focused on mixed economic data, political uncertainty, and the potential for changes in monetary policy. While Europe
has been less of a focus, at least compared to last year, the real European economy remains challenged. In Asia, we
have seen varied trends. There has been a significant shift in Japanese monetary policy, and concerns about growth in
China earlier in the year have moderated, given better recent economic data.
This somewhat complex and uneven backdrop for the macroeconomic outlook, combined with the uncertainty
surrounding central bank activity, has led to client risk aversion and lower activity levels at certain points of the year.
As a financial institution, we operate in a cyclical industry and the environment can fluctuate from year to year or
quarter to quarter, like this year. We can't control the operating environment, but we can control our financial profile
and our response to changing conditions.
Turning to slide three, we ended the third quarter with our balance sheet at $923 billion, down slightly this year. We
have shed certain assets, including our Americas reinsurance business, our investment in ICBC, and we are in the
process of selling our European insurance business. In addition, there continues to be less demand for our balance
sheet, given lower client activity levels and reduced risk appetite.
On the left side of the slide, we show the composition of our balance sheet as of the third quarter. The most important
point is that cash and secured client financing represent half of the balance sheet. The remainder is mainly institutional
client services, which represents our client-facing inventory.
On the right side of the slide, you can see the significant improvement in liquidity of our balance sheet since 2007.
Total assets are down 18%, and Level 3 assets are down nearly 40%. Although assets have declined, our global core
excess has nearly tripled. We continue to be vigilant about appropriately sizing our less liquid exposures. In addition,
we have a high velocity balance sheet, which, of course, is characteristic of market-making businesses.
Turning to slide four, you can see an update on our capital levels. At the top left, you can see our estimated,
fully-loaded Basel III Tier 1 common ratio under the advanced approach is 9.8% as of the third quarter. This is up 50
basis points from the second quarter.
We show our estimated risk weighted assets on the right side of the slide at approximately $590 billion, which breaks
down as follows: $345 billion in credit risk; $165 billion in market risk and about $80 billion in operational risk. As
you are aware, under the regulatory process, there are transitional provisions which phase in over time. Using these
provisions, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio is roughly 100 basis points higher.

On the bottom left side of the slide – excuse me, we show our best estimate for the supplementary leverage ratio. Based
on the U.S. rules, our estimated leverage ratio was approximately 5% for the firm and approximately 6% for the bank.
Of course, this is our best estimate and subject to change.
Like all other regulatory requirements, we will work closely with our regulators as they evaluate and finalize the rules.
We believe it is our obligation to support safety and soundness within the financial services industry, and more broadly,
the global financial system. As it relates to how we will run the business, similar to other regulatory metrics, the
supplementary leverage ratio will be an important input.
With that, I'll turn it over to Liz who will provide an update on our liquidity and funding strategy.
Liz Beshel Robinson
Thanks, Harvey. On slide five, maintaining abundant liquidity remains the single most important risk management
principle for the firm. As we discussed during our previous calls, we hold material quantities of cash and cash
equivalents to pre-fund potential liquidity needs in a stressed environment. Our liquidity pool continues to be a
significant portion of the balance sheet at $187 billion, on average, in the third quarter.
You can see the mix of our liquidity on the right side of the table. It remains largely unchanged, with the most
significant portion made up of U.S. Government obligations and overnight cash deposits, which are mainly at the
Federal Reserve.
There continues to be a focus in the market on Basel liquidity requirements and the liquidity coverage ratio. As you
know, the Federal Reserve recently released a proposal – a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the liquidity coverage
ratio. With $187 billion of average global core excess, our initial interpretation is that the firm is well-positioned to
meet the requirements. However, the proposed rule requires further clarification and, obviously, is subject to change as
we move through the rulemaking process.
Moving to slide six, let's turn to our secured funding. Our total on balance sheet collateralized financing of
approximately $204 billion, principally comprises liquid government securities and Federal agency obligations in our
interest rate business. Our firm-specific financing is approximately $100 billion for non-GCE eligible assets financed
from our principal broker-dealer entities.
As we have discussed in the past, we raise secured funding with a term that is appropriate for the liquidity risk
associated with the type of assets that are being financed. Given the high turnover of our assets, we believe a weighted
average maturity of greater than 100 days is appropriately conservative for our non-GCE secured funding.
A long-term strategic initiative, coming out of the financial crisis, has been to expand the number of counterparties who
finance our non-GCE secured funding book. Since 2008, this number has nearly tripled. We have seen significant
growth across a variety of sources, including insurance companies and pensions, endowments and foundations. Given
the significant reduction in the size of our non-GCE funding book post the crisis, as well as the growth in funding
counterparties, the average funding per counterparty has dropped by 75% from $2 billion to roughly $500 million.
Moving to slide seven, we show our long-term unsecured funding. Here we continue to focus on ensuring stability and
reducing refinancing requirements through appropriately long-dated and conservatively-spaced maturities. Given our
focus on term, our long-term unsecured debt currently has a weighted average maturity of eight years.
As you can see on the top right portion of the slide, our issuance over the past three years has roughly kept pace with
our maturities. Key issuance priorities continue to be diversification and maintaining manageable maturities in any
given year or quarter. In terms of diversification, we are focused on diversity across both currency and distribution
channels. We regularly assess pricing versus our U.S. dollar institutional funding curve to judge the attractiveness of
non-U.S. issuance.
As you can see on the bottom right part of the slide, the 2013 contribution of non-USD issuance has increased by 12
percentage points to 35% relative to 2012. We have also focused on growing our retail programs, with approximately

17% of the 2013 program issued through retail networks.
From a regulatory capital perspective, we have continued to opportunistically build towards future Basel III total
capital requirements and we executed a $1 billion non-cumulative perpetual preferred offering during the second
quarter. This follows our $850 million preferred offering in the fourth quarter of 2012.
As we think about our issuance strategy for 2014, we will remain opportunistic while being focused on diversification
by market and by distribution channel. Given the current size of our liquidity pool, we may not choose to match new
issuance with maturities.
Let me now turn it back to Harvey to wrap up.
Harvey M. Schwartz
Thanks, Liz. Slide eight is a wrap-up of all the credit characteristics we've discussed today. The evolution of our
balance sheet since the crisis has been material. Our liquidity pool is up nearly three times. Common equity has
increased 75% and Level 3 assets and leverage are down meaningfully. All in, a significantly stronger credit profile.
Before we conclude, let me take a step back and highlight a few broader points that we believe are important for debt
investors and U.S. financial institutions. In response to the crisis and regulatory change across the industry, all U.S.
firms are holding higher levels of capital and higher levels of liquidity. Obviously, a significant credit positive.
As we show on slide nine, the improvement in credit profiles across the industry has been reinforced by new regulatory
requirements. The cautious belt-and-suspender approach taken by regulators will help reduce systemic risk and
contribute to safer individual institutions for the foreseeable future. On capital, the industry is now subject to many
different requirements. Risk-based capital, leverage and CCAR. The goal of this multi-pronged approach is to reduce
risk; not only firm-specific risk but also system-wide risk.
On liquidity, the story is similar, with the introduction of conservative Basel requirements. Finally, there has been
considerable focus on recovering resolution. As global regulators add to recovery and resolution requirements for
individual firms, they are improving the safety and soundness of the entire system. Regulators focused on recovering
resolution will create small strong management incentives to act conservatively and will mandate early
communications to boards and regulators during periods of stress. Ultimately, the collective actions taken by individual
firms since the crisis combined with new regulations have fundamentally changed the risk profile and practices for the
financial services industry.
With that, Liz and I want to thank you for participating in today's call and we're happy to take your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of [ph] David McGowan with Morgan Stanley (14:30).
Please go ahead.
<Q>: Afternoon, folks. Thanks for taking the call.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure. Hey, [ph] Dave (14:35).
<Q>: One of the things we're starting to see increasingly in the credit markets is differentiation of business models and
that's now put you, put Goldman in a position as being priced by the markets as the riskiest of the big banks in terms of
spread. Wondered how you folks think about this from a funding cost perspective and is it a disadvantage that if it
persists, leads you to think about any sort of course correction?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So spread differentials, of course, [ph] Dave (15:07), it's not new. And it's always been
the case that there's been differences across different firms. From a strategy perspective, at the margin, it's not a
significant influencer for us, because the most important thing is how we focus on what we think our strengths are and
how we deliver our content, our execution to our clients globally. So it really is a question of where we think we can
add value and how we contribute at the margin to our clients.
Spread, as a factor in client decisions at the margin, hasn't been the most significant. And I think as a trend, I think it
will, for all firms, be less of a contributor because of the introduction of clearing and other aspects of the rulemaking
process. But we're not seeing anything in it.
<Q>: Appreciate it, Harvey. If I could follow up on some comments you made on the regulatory front.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure.
<Q>: One of the things that maybe hasn't been getting as much attention is some of the nuances of what's proposed in
the LCR, what we saw on the final rule and then maybe in some of the other rules or I guess what I call attempts to
reduce interconnectedness by making sure financials aren't exposed to one another either via capital instruments or in
the LCR. They're excluded, I guess, from HQLA. Do you think any of that has the potential to be disruptive to you and
I guess across the industry?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So we don't see anything in any of the finalized rules or the proposed rules immediately
that I would certainly wouldn't describe as disruptive. I think if you take a step back and you think about all the
rulemaking that's occurring, I think as an overarching objective, I don't think the goal of reducing interconnectedness –
clearly, it's not a bad one. It's a good one. Because anything that looks to reduce systemic risk or even perceived
systemic risk, I think is something we should all study and embrace.
I do think that the regulators have also done a thoughtful thing that we've at least seen to-date, which they've given
people enough of a glide-path, if you will, in terms of the rulemaking process that, at least from where we sit, there's no
individual firm that will have a hard time adjusting, given the multi-year process and I think that's appropriate.
Now having said all that, I think there's two things. One, it's always hard to anticipate unintended consequences. And
so, for example, in kind of the generic leverage ratio, obviously, there's been a lot of discussion about not wanting to
incent people to hold the minimum regulatory requirement on certain liquidity. And I think that's a valuable discussion
for all market participants and regulators to have as you work through the rulemaking process.
And then there's a much bigger issue, which is, over time, striking the right balance between all the regulatory
measures that are occurring, which in aggregate are very hard to measure, and does that at the margin, that sort of hold
back economic growth globally? And so that's how I'm thinking about it.
<Q>: Thoughtful answer, Harvey. Thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks.

Your next question is from the line of Robert Smalley with UBS. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Hi. Thanks, Harvey and Liz, for having this call. Two questions.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure, Robert. Thank you.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Two questions, really following up on some of what [ph] Dave (18:41) had to say. When we
look at your results for the last quarter, we saw that the FICC line was down and we know the markets were definitely
challenged there. Number one, is this the kind of number that we should look at going forward, and is this more the, for
lack of a better term, de-risked FICC type of revenue we should expect to see? That's one part of that.

The second part is, I know in the past, you've said that there are certain regulatory changes, and we're not going to get
out of businesses until we're clear which ones we should be getting out of. Did we see any kind of exit from businesses
earlier this year that had that impact on the third quarter, and will you be exiting other parts of FICC over the next
couple of quarters?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So let me take the back half first. Good question. Absolutely no impact in terms of our
performance from exiting businesses, and there's no plan to exit businesses in the FICC business. In terms of how we
feel about it, we're quite committed to all of those businesses there. We have a tremendously long history in each one of
the more narrowly-defined FICC sub-segments, whether it's currencies or commodities, et cetera. And they're quite
important to our clients and our overall strategy.
In terms of the quarter, tough quarter for us and we weren't happy about it. There are a number of factors that I could
walk you through, in terms of contributors. The environment was certainly one that didn't lend itself to ease. If you
recall, when we came into the beginning of the quarter, there was a lot of focus on what tapering meant. Then there
were issues – political issues in the Middle East. And then, of course, there was perceptions around what would
tapering mean and a bit of a reversal. And all of this led to a pretty significant adjustment in client sentiment, at least
for the quarter. And I referenced that, at least high-level in the opening remarks today. And the client engagement level
between second quarter and third quarter, and what I'll call conviction, wasn't nearly as high.
Now having said that, in our business, all of our client engagement feels good. We just didn't do a great job in terms of
managing the inventory that quarter. But it's one quarter and in some quarters, we'll outperform. In some quarters, we
won't perform as well, and that was the third quarter.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Understood. Thanks. And second question, on the LCR, while we're all still digesting it, there's
clearly some impact on businesses because of haircuts, munis, for example. So if you could, one, talk about the impact
on your muni business? Two, your comments – today's question, you said that regulators weren't giving banks enough
runway to enact any necessary changes. We did see, with the LCR, an accelerated timeframe. So I'm assuming that
you're still – that those comments are good there, too? And so, on that basis, can you share with us some thoughts on
some of the metrics around that, what your numbers will be? Will you be in compliance with that? Where do you see
yourself right now? And if not, do you think – could you give us an idea of when you would be in compliance with the
minimums?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Sure. So I'm going to take the second part of that first. Look, we believe, based on
everything we know, that we're currently in excess of the fully phased-in minimum requirement. So the acceleration of
the timeframe is not an issue. Now, obviously, this is based on a number of assumptions that we've had to make. It's
based on our initial interpretation of the Fed's proposal. So, obviously, subject to our getting clarification on a number
of points in the NPR, and obviously also subject to those rules being finalized. But at this point, we believe we're in
excess of the fully phased-in minimum requirements.
In terms of impact on individual business lines, we are just starting to work through the very long document and think
about the impact on individual business lines. I don't think there are any really obvious issues that we've identified yet,
and we have not been – we have not yet started the process of really pushing down, as you know, we've done on other
areas like capital, to the individual business units the rule set or the cost of those rules being implemented, which we
expect will set the right incentives for businesses going forward.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Great.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, in terms of the timeline, the only other thing I would add is I just think, in general,
it was more of a general statement I was trying to make, it wasn't narrowly defined around the LCR proposal or not. I
just think that they've been generally thoughtful about the implementation plans. I mean, whether you look at clearing
or the Basel – advanced Basel III rules, in terms of that timeline, I think they've been pretty thoughtful about giving sort
of the global industry an opportunity to adjust, so that you don't see an impact in the near term.
In terms of FICC, again, in the quarter, it really was more a question of inventory management and derisking. And if
you actually look at the categories that we disclosed in our VaR calculations, we're pretty much down in risk, in risk

units across the board, with the exception of interest rates. So there wasn't one particular category. Our performance in
currencies, as I highlighted on the earnings call earlier when we came out with earnings, that was down more
significantly year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. But that was really – but I wouldn't highlight anything in munis.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No problem.
Operator
Your next question is from line of Larry Vitale with Moore Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Larry Vitale>: Hi. Thank you, Harvey and Liz, for doing this call today.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks, Larry.
<Q - Larry Vitale>: I have four questions. They're all pretty straightforward, so I'll ask them all at once and then let
you address them as you will. The first is, Harvey, if you could comment on the CCAR 2014? We got the framework, I
guess, it was last week. Was there anything in there that you feel is important to call out? Second, this one's probably
for Liz on OLA. Where do you guys stand on that? You talked about your overall debt footprint issuance plans. But if
you could put all of that in the context of what we understand OLA to be now and granted it's preliminary, that would
be helpful.
Third, and this is per the OCC derivatives data. The potential future exposure as a percent of bank capital is a lot higher
at GS Bank than it is at your peers and I'm wondering how that might inform the way you approach supplemental
leverage to the extent that some, hopefully not all, but some of the Basel proposals are adopted.
And then fourth, Liz, if you could address any changes in tone in the repo market, especially in the wake of the
Financial Stability Board's paper from a couple of months ago, that'd be great. Thanks very much.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So, well, why don't we just go in the order, Larry. So we've got one on CCAR, one on
OLA, the derivatives data and then the repo markets, right?
<Q - Larry Vitale>: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay. Great. So we'll take them all pretty quickly. In terms of the CCAR information that
was released in the market last week, the Federal Reserve has said that the test is going to be dynamic and so I think it's
a normal market expectation to see changes. Obviously, there was a change in the – shift in basically the rate curve in
terms of the scenario analysis. And again, the test I think remains quite credible as viewed by everyone. Market
participants broadly and regulators certainly and it remains a pretty stressful scenario. So in that sense, I don't think
there's any surprises because we should expect the test to be dynamic.
Actually, I'll turn it over to Liz in a second and she can handle the last two. But in terms of the derivatives data, quite
frankly, I haven't studied it, so we might come back to you offline with a little more detail. But I suspect it just looks
that way because of the collection of how different firms are organized in terms of what businesses sit in what parts of
various entities. And so for us, our interest rate derivative business sits in the bank. Certain other business lines don't sit
in the bank. And so you may see some disproportionate weighting there. Of course, we've disclosed what we think an
estimate is under the leverage ratio now and it's 6% for the bank. But we can get into it with you in more detail offline.
<Q - Larry Vitale>: Okay. Okay. All right.
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Okay. So in terms of issuance and OLA. On OLA more broadly, we've talked about this
on the last few calls and unfortunately I'm not sure we can say much more today than we've said on those prior calls
because we're still waiting for clarification in the rules. We continue to expect that we're going be subject to minimum
bail-in eligible liquidity requirements. Given the way we have traditionally been structured, we feel very
well-positioned for what we understand those are shaping up to be. So the fact that we've issued a lot of our long-term

unsecured debt out of our holding company positions us well, again, based on what we are hearing that rule said will
likely evolve into.
But since we are still waiting, we have not yet made any plans to change our issuance strategy around those rules. Now
just in terms of what we're thinking about for issuance, as you know, we have a pretty strong funding position today.
We feel pretty good about our refinancing requirements in 2014. We have just under $20 billion of long-term
unsecured debt maturing next year. And so as I said in my script, we'll remain very opportunistic, focused on term,
focused on diversity.
Ultimately, the amount and the type of funding that we issue over the course of the next year will be driven by our
balance sheet, the size, the composition, where we think it's going, the market, the environment and the continued
development of regulation. But I think we're really going to remain quite opportunistic as we go forward because of all
those unknowns.
<Q - Larry Vitale>: Wouldn't expect anything less. And then finally, on the repo.
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Yeah, so on the repo market, look, you pointed specifically to the FSB paper. I would say
there's been a tremendous amount of conversation about repo markets generally and a tremendous amount of
regulation, whether it's leverage, liquidity or capital that could, in some way, touch the repo markets. The way we've
been thinking about it, I guess, first, as the user of short-term funding, the LCR ratio clearly incentivizes us and the
other banks out there to term out our shorter-term funding, which is, as you know, very consistent with the approach
we've had over the last several years.
In terms of the lenders in that market, we're watching the reg reform very carefully. We're thinking about the potential
implications of all of those rules, all of those regulatory pronouncements on our lenders. We're talking a lot to our
funding counterparties. It's a group we know very well. We have strong relationships with, but, ultimately, as we watch
that play out, we're really continuing to focus on diversification. So as I highlighted in the script, we've materially
broadened out the pool of lenders in our repo book, including to a different universe, different types of lenders than
we've used in the past. And we always continue to focus on term to buy us time to deal with whatever changes come
our way. So it's still, I think, a work in progress, but something we have not yet seen a lot of changes, but we're
preparing certainly for evolution there.
<Q - Larry Vitale>: Okay. All right, good.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: The only thing I would add, Larry, more broadly, it kind of gets back to what I was
saying earlier, which is, again, it's this issue of balancing a safer system, both locally by individual institution, and
more broadly across the universe of global financial institutions, with what are the unintended consequences. And so
there's, obviously, been a lot of focus on the market and what it means for liquidity in the marketplace. If there's a
significant change to things like matchbooks and other, what I'll broadly defined as low ROA activity that is really a
provider of liquidity to the marketplace. And so that will get a lot of focus, obviously, by the regulatory community and
market participants as we go through the rulemaking process, as it should, but really hard to predict the marginal
impact or loss of liquidity in any particular asset class. But I think that's probably really more where the focus is.
<Q - Larry Vitale>: Right. Okay. All right, great. Thanks very much.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Great. So I think at this stage – oh sorry, at this stage, we don't see any more questions on
the line. Does anybody have any additional questions?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: All right. So it turns out my original suspicion was right. We don't have any more
questions. So I just wanted take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. [ph] Dave (31:50), are you back in the
line?

[ph] Mr. McGowan (31:54), your line is open. Please go ahead.
<Q>: Yeah, Harvey, thanks. If nobody else is back in, I figured – I was surprised that we didn't hear this one. Could
you comment on what's going on on the litigation front? It's all over the headlines now. It's obviously affected a
number of your peers to a much greater extent. So just give us a general sense on what you're facing up against, and
maybe what that means for litigation provisions going forward, which some of your competitors have talked about.
And thanks for letting me back in.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It's a good question, [ph] Dave (32:25). I'm glad you brought it up. So in terms of
litigation, obviously, we continue to reassess our own individual cases, and we incorporate all the available data we
can, our own settlements, our own discussions and, obviously, what we see away from the firm. You'll see in our 10-Q,
which will be out shortly, in the last quarter, we disclosed a reasonably possible loss of $3.5 billion at the end of June.
That will be up to $4 billion when you see the Q, and I'd just encourage everyone to, obviously, review the disclosure.
And the Q should be out in the next 24 hours, so you'll have it available. And to the extent to which obviously you have
any additional questions after you go through it, I'd just encourage you to reach out to Heather and Dane.
<Q>: And any look forward on provisions, Harvey?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, as I said, we assess them as we go through. So there's no assessment in terms of
forward-looking provisions.
<Q>: Great. All right. Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No problem.

Your next question is from the line of David Jiang with Prudential. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - David Jiang>: Hey, Harvey. I just had a real quick question. I'm sorry if this has been asked, but is there a stated
operating buffer that you intend to operate at over the SIFI surcharge?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Oh, are you talking about in terms of our Basel III capital target?
<Q - David Jiang>: Right.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yes. So historically, what we had said early in the process of working through the Basel
III effort was that we were going with 100 basis points over, which would bring us to 9.5% after you go through the
minimum of the capital conservation plus the SIFI surcharge. And as I said, we were at 9.8% at the end of the third
quarter, and that's before you get the immediate benefit of any transitional provisions. But we're living with it now, and
so we're going to continue to monitor it. But as I said, as we've said in the past, we were targeting 100. But that's going
to adjust over time, and really, it will be driven by market activity and client demand, and so we're over our minimum
target currently.
<Q - David Jiang>: I guess, if you have 100 basis points or more of buffer, operating buffer, does that preclude less of
a need for the other parts of the capital stack in terms of additional Tier 1 and Tier 2?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: So yes, we believe that you can use – if you have excess common equity, we can use that
to fill the lower capital buckets.
<Q - David Jiang>: Okay. Does that mean that you may want to optimize it that way?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I think at this stage, you'll really see it as we go through it, and a lot of it will depend,
again, by the operating environment. I mean, we've been in an operating environment for the last several years which I
could characterize as dynamic. But again, it's been a little bit of an economic environment globally where it's been two
steps forward, one step back. And so as we move into, hopefully, more of a stabilizing global recovery, which is really
the best thing for our business, we'd love to see more client demand across all of our business lines. And so, we'll
remain flexible on it.
<Q - David Jiang>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure.
Operator
And thank you, sir. Please go ahead with any closing remarks.
Harvey M. Schwartz
Okay. So I'll repeat my closing remarks for everybody who's still on the line. Again, Liz and I really appreciate
everyone taking the time to dial in, and to the extent to which there's any other follow-up, please reach out to Heather
and the team, and we're happy to engage. And I hope that Liz and I both get to spend time with all of you in the next
several months. Take care, and thanks again.
