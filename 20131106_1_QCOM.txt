Paul E. Jacobs
Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone.
I'm very pleased with Qualcomm's performance this past fiscal year. We delivered record revenues of $25 billion, up
30% versus last year. Earnings, total reported device sales and MSM chipset shipments also set records as our
technologies continue to underpin the global growth of wireless data and our semiconductor solutions are used across
the industry's flagship smartphones.
We increased our dividend for the 11th consecutive year and returned approximately $6.7 billion to stockholders in the
form of buybacks and cash dividends in fiscal year 2013. Looking at the fourth fiscal quarter, we also delivered record
revenues which came in near the high end of our guidance due to strength in both our licensing and semiconductor
businesses.
Earnings would have been well ahead of guidance if not for a legal charge we recorded in the fourth quarter. We're
pursuing post-trial motions in the District Court and we'll pursue all options on appeal as necessary and remain
confident in our positions.
We made excellent strategic and operational progress this year. We delivered our industry-leading third generation 3G
LTE multimode modem, grew our share of semiconductor content in a wide array of devices and expanded our
licensing program. Further, our strategy to support the LTE TDD migration path for the wireless operators in India was
successfully executed.
We just completed the final step in transferring full ownership of the Indian BWA entity that holds the 4G spectrum we
won in the 2010 spectrum auction to Bharti. We also announced the planned divestiture of Omnitracs.
As you know, Omnitracs was one of our first businesses and helped fund our investment in CDMA and I would really
like to thank all of the employees, suppliers and customers who helped contribute to the more than 25-year success of
the business. We really look forward to hearing about your future accomplishments.
We expect that transaction to be completed during our first fiscal quarter of 2014, but we haven't included the estimated
$0.22 to $0.25 per share gain on the sale in either our first fiscal quarter or annual guidance.
Looking at fiscal 2014, we're expecting solid growth, but at a lower rate than what we delivered in the last few years.
This is partially due to the exceptionally strong year we just completed, which included share gains and content share
gains in QCT. In fiscal 2014, we're facing some mix and demand factors, which we currently expect will moderate our
QCT growth.

In light of this, we're taking near-term actions company-wise to prioritize investments, stay focused on growth, but also
control expenses in order to deliver operating profit growth in excess of revenue growth. Fundamentally, we believe
our long-term growth drivers remain very much intact and we're aligning our resources to continue to capture those
opportunities.
We continue to see smartphone adoption grow at a rapid pace across the globe. According to Gartner, approximately
225 million smartphones were shipped in the second quarter of calendar 2013, representing a 47% year-over-year
increase. This is especially true in emerging regions where smartphone demand is being driven in part by the migration
from 2G to 3G.
Looking forward, Gartner is now expecting 1.8 billion smartphones will be shipped in 2017. In the September quarter,
we saw the launch of new devices with expanded capabilities based on QUALCOMM products. Some of these new
capabilities include the launch of Ultra HD video, LTE carrier aggregation and support for additional frequency bands
for global roaming.
We will continue to focus on expanding our share of content in devices and making good progress with our Wi-Fi and
RF front-end solutions. We see multimode 3G LTE as a catalyst for growth in network enhancements and smartphone
demand. According to GSMA Intelligence, approximately 100 million new LTE connections are expected to be added
in calendar year 2013, representing a 57% year-over-year increase from 2012 and it's approximately 22% of total net
new connections.
China remains an important opportunity for smartphones. With the upcoming launch of LTE, we expect increased
demand for smartphones across many tiers of devices. It's not just about smartphones. The impact of mobile on other
industries cannot be overstated. The mobile ecosystem is driving innovations in healthcare, automotive, education and
of course, computing, which is creating new opportunities for Qualcomm from both a chipset and a licensing
perspective.
Smartphone experiences are driving tablet designs as evidenced by the increased innovation and demand for 7 inch
tablets including Snapdragon-based tablets from Google and Amazon announced this quarter. In addition, several
operators have recently released new data plans that could be a positive catalyst for 3G/4G adoption in tablets and other
consumer electronics devices.
Now all these trends are helping to drive data demand globally, and in order to address the growth in data, operators
continue to evolve their 3G networks, upgrade to LTE, evaluate new spectrum opportunities, and evolve network
topologies to include the introduction of small cells.
This past June we announced our FSM solution that integrates our 3G and 4G technologies with advanced 802.11ac
and n Wi-Fi to enable fully-featured low-cost small cells that are designed to provide superior performance with greater
power efficiency.
We will discuss the many growth opportunities we see ahead and the strategies and actions we're pursuing to capitalize
on them during our upcoming New York analyst event. I look forward to seeing many of you there.
So to wrap up, we have completed another outstanding year at Qualcomm. I'd once again like to thank all of our
employees and partners for their commitment, innovation and leadership. We have tremendous opportunities ahead and
we're positioning the company to capitalize on these while carefully managing our cost structure. And overall,
Qualcomm remains well-positioned for continued growth. We have grown revenues at a compound annual rate of more
than 30% over the last three years, and building off of this very strong fiscal 2013 base year, going forward for the next
five years, we expect that revenues and earnings per share will grow at double digit compound annual growth rates. We
expect to return significant amounts of capital to stockholders consistent with this outlook.
I'll now turn the call over to Qualcomm's President and Chief Operating Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.

Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide some comments on both QTL and QCT businesses.
In fiscal 2013, QTL delivered record revenues and earnings up 19% and 18% year-over-year respectively, driven by
greater-than-expected 3G/4G device shipments and increased ASPs reported by our licensees. We now have over 250
royalty-bearing 3G licenses, over 90 single-mode OFDM licenses, and we believe our 3G and 4G portfolios are the
most widely licensed in the industry. Through our broad licensing program, we continue to foster innovation and
enable a large and growing ecosystem that benefits wireless consumers worldwide.
QCT also grew significantly in fiscal 2013, delivering record revenues and earnings, up 38% and 39% year-over-year
respectively, driven by successful share and content gains. During the year, we continued to lead in LTE with our
integrated modem solutions and delivered significant product enhancements across all key technology vectors
including the modem, processor, graphics, and connectivity with unmatched world-class integration.
For 2014, we are forecasting another year of strong growth in QTL. We expect 3G/4G device shipments by our
licensees to grow 15% at the midpoint in calendar 2014, and our fiscal 2014 3G/4G device ASPs are estimated to be
between $216 and $230, down slightly by $3 or 1% year-over-year at the midpoint.
Turning to QCT, our outlook for fiscal 2014 builds off the significant successes of fiscal 2013. Our leadership across
key technologies required for modems and SoCs for smartphones and mobile computing continues to position us well
across flagship designs and key customers. We expect fiscal 2014 QCT year-over-year growth to moderate somewhat
compared to recent years, including the very strong growth we delivered in fiscal 2013. Our position at the high tier and
with the big OEMs is strong, driven by modem and application processor leadership, and is expected to remain strong
through 2014. The high tier continues to be increasingly concentrated, however, which impacts our product mix as well
as our revenue and related operating margins.
We also expect strong growth in the low and mid tiers, driven by emerging regions including the anticipated launch of
LTE in China in the second half of the fiscal year. We continue to see growth in China across all smartphone tiers, and
what we refer to as our EA, or Emerging Accounts, exceeded $1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2013. Our participation in
the 1500 RMB and above smartphone tier is strong, enabled by both Chinese and multinational OEMs.
Fiscal 2014 is shaping up to be another favorable year with Chinese OEMs as we build on our strength in the high tier,
enabling OEMs to drive LTE solutions in the mid and low tiers during 2014 in China and other emerging regions. We
expect the launch of LTE in China to change the dynamics there as international OEMs leverage their worldwide LTE
leadership to increase their positions and Chinese domestic OEMs move up tier and leverage their LTE position in
China to export internationally.
Both of these expected trends are beneficial to QCT's position as all of our LTE chipsets include both the FDD and the
TDD mode. We are currently shipping integrated chipsets across multiple tiers to support initial volume expected to
start around the Chinese New Year.
In light of our near-term outlook moderating following a strong 2013, we are slowing the growth rate of our spending.
We believe we are now operating the QCT business at scale and with our expense management initiatives this year, we
forecast that we will exit fiscal 2014 at a lower operating expense run rate than we exited fiscal 2013.
In addition to operating expense initiatives, we have projects underway to improve product costs within QCT including
driving supply chain efficiencies and designing cost optimized solutions for the very price competitive low tier.
It is important to note that we expect 2014 quarterly QCT operating margins to trend differently this year as compared
to previous years and in particular, we expect them to strengthen in the second half of fiscal 2014. This reflects the
quarterly demand profile and product mix we expect including the growth of LTE in China as well as the anticipated
customer device launches throughout the year. In addition, the cumulative effect of the product cost and operating
expense initiatives we are undertaking improves the margin profile over time.
Accordingly, we expect to exit the fiscal year at a high point above 20% operating margin instead of peaking in the first
fiscal quarter as in prior years. Looking ahead, we believe we continue to be well-positioned versus our competition.

In fiscal year 2013, we delivered our third generation LTE solution well ahead of the competition. It features LTE
carrier aggregation with category 4, supports all major standards and voice and data mobility scenarios and is available
on a standalone or integrated basis.
Our LTE solutions now span the high end to the volume tier and are well positioned globally across FDD and TDD
opportunities. The LTE feature set required to be successful will continue to evolve at a fast pace, driven by
competitive dynamics in the United States and Asia, compounded by the number of RF bands required to deliver high
data rates and capacity to the consumers.
We continue to lead in mobile optimized application processors and this continues to be an area of investment for us, as
in the past. We have successfully grown our tablet design pipeline, including such notable designs as the Amazon
Kindle HDX, the Google Nexus 7, the LG G Pad, Sony Xperia Z and multiple tablets with Samsung and Nokia.
We see strong traction and a broad design pipeline for our RF360 front-end products, which include the envelope
tracker, antenna tuner, PA with integrated switch and RF POP. The envelope tracker has shipped commercially in
handsets since September and the remainder of the solutions are scheduled to launch as expected throughout the fiscal
year.
We also continue to make great progress with our mobile Wi-Fi and connectivity solutions, building off our successful
acquisition of Atheros. Our 802.11ac product continues to have strong design traction with over 150 smartphone design
wins including many with top tier OEMs.
Overall, our Wi-Fi attach rate on a unit basis is over 50% and we expect it to continue to grow throughout fiscal 2014.
To conclude, we see significant growth opportunities ahead for our business and we are managing our resources to
maintain our technology leadership and best position ourselves for the future.
I look forward to discussing this with many of you at the upcoming Analyst Day and I turn the call now over to George.
George S. Davis
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting strong financial results for both this
quarter and the full fiscal year. Fiscal fourth quarter revenues were a record, up 33% year-over-year and non-GAAP
operating income was up 20% year-over-year.
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.05 was up 18% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP results this quarter included a
$173 million or $0.10 per share litigation expense related to the recent ParkerVision verdict, which was not included in
our fiscal fourth quarter guidance.
Excluding this $0.10 charge, our non-GAAP EPS would have been $1.15 per share or $0.09 above the midpoint of our
prior guidance range and up 29% year-over-year. In addition to strong operating results, the impact of certain tax items,
share repurchases and investment portfolio performance accounted for approximately $0.06 per share in the quarter.
QTL total reported device sales by our licensees were $60.2 billion, just above the high end of our guidance range, with
the average selling price in line with last quarter, consistent with our expectations. QCT had record revenues and
MSMs in the quarter and implied revenue per MSM was down sequentially, reflecting increased low tier shipments
relative to expectations. QCT operating margin was 16%, at the low end of our guidance, also reflecting the low tier
product mix.
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses grew 6% sequentially, consistent with expectations. During the
fourth fiscal quarter, we returned approximately $3.9 billion to stockholders including approximately $600 million of
dividends paid and $3.3 billion in stock repurchases. As of the end of fiscal 2013, we had used $150 million of our new
$5 billion stock repurchase program announced in September.
Cash flow from operations was very strong at 39% of revenues, reflecting solid working capital performance,
particularly inventory draw down. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $29.4 billion. Our fiscal

fourth quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 16%.
Turning to our results for fiscal year 2013, revenues were a record, up 30% from last year on strengthening QCT share
at the high tier, strong 3G/4G device growth, and increasing ASPs in the QTL business. Non-GAAP operating income
was a record $8.66 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share were a record $4.51, both up 22% year-over-year.
QTL's 2013 revenues were a record, up 19% year-over-year, with operating margin of 87%, towards the high end of
our prior guidance range. We estimate that the fiscal 2013 3G/4G device average selling price was $226 at the
midpoint, up $7 or 3% year-over-year.
QCT's fiscal 2013 revenues were also a record, up 38% year-over-year. Earnings before tax was up 39%
year-over-year, and operating margin was 19% for QCT, in line with our full-year guidance.
Fiscal 2013 cash flow from operations was $8.8 billion, at 35% of revenues.
We returned approximately $6.7 billion or 86% of free cash flow to stockholders during fiscal 2013, paying $2.1 billion
of cash dividends and repurchasing $4.6 billion of our shares.
We are increasing our forecast for 3G/4G device shipments in calendar 2013 to between 1.075 billion to 1.125 billion
units, up 15% to 20% year-over-year, driven by strength in emerging regions, particularly China.
Now turning to our guidance for fiscal 2014, we estimate fiscal 2014 revenues to be in the range of approximately $26
billion to $27.5 billion, up 5% to 11% year-over-year. We expect QTL top and bottom line growth to remain strong,
driven by continued strength in 3G/4G device demand, stable replacement rates, and ASPs in developed regions, 2G to
3G migration in emerging regions, as well as LTE deployments in China and elsewhere. We are forecasting a modest
ASP decline in fiscal 2014, down $3 at the midpoint or 1% to $223.
We expect QCT to continue to benefit from technology leadership in modems and our Snapdragon family of products.
We expect QCT growth in fiscal 2014 to reflect strong end market demand, somewhat mitigated by the effects of OEM
concentration at the high tier. QCT has successfully established strong positions across all of the key top tier OEMs and
much of the medium tier smartphone accounts. QCT growth in fiscal 2014 is aligned with the growth trends in these
tiers.
In addition, we are seeing continued high OEM share concentration, particularly at the high tier, and this impacts our
product mix as well as our revenues and related operating margin. We are also seeing a tiering of products by these
large customers that is leading to a higher utilization of previous generation MSMs in their overall mix of products. We
see this effect mostly limited to QCT's product mix in the first half of fiscal 2014.
As Steve mentioned, we forecast improving trends in the second half of our fiscal year versus the first half. We expect
higher device ASPs for QTL and a better mix of leading parts in QCT including the impact of LTE in China. We also
forecast lower operating expenses and product costs contributing to a stronger second half.
We expect fiscal 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.95 to $5.15, up approximately 12%
year-over-year at the midpoint. As Paul mentioned, we have not included the estimated gain on the sale of Omnitracs in
our guidance. If this gain was included our fiscal 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share estimate would be up 17%
year-over-year at the midpoint.
For calendar 2014 global 3G/4G base device shipments we estimate that between 1.2 billion and 1.3 billion devices will
be shipped by our licensees, up approximately 11% to 18% year-over-year, reflecting increased shipments around the
world, particularly in emerging regions. We estimate fiscal 2014 QTL operating margins will be 87% to 89% and QCT
operating margins will be 18% to 20%, both stable year-over-year.
We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 17% to 19% for fiscal 2014. As Paul and Steve noted, we are slowing our level
of operating expense growth in fiscal 2014. We expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow
approximately 5% to 7% year-over-year in contrast to more than 20% annual growth over the past three years.

We are reducing a number of R&D project expenses in order to operate more efficiently and focus more fully on
growing our investments in key areas including modem technology, low cost chip designs, CPU and GPU, RF360,
connectivity and integrated SoCs as well as long term initiatives like displays, small cells and enterprise products. This
reduced expense growth is well-below recent years and aligns with the expected top line growth and our requirements
to drive the critical elements of our road map and new technology initiatives.
We also expect to continue an accelerated pace of return of capital to our shareholders. In fiscal 2014 we currently
expect to repurchase a minimum of $4 billion of stock and we have included this repurchase activity in our guidance.
We will provide further details of our capital return metrics at our New York Analyst Day in two weeks.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $6.3 billion to $6.9 billion,
up approximately 10% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our first fiscal
quarter to be approximately $1.10 to $1.20 per share, down 9% year-over-year at the midpoint. Versus the year ago
quarter, we are expecting increased shipments of thin modems and low and mid-tier products in QCT as well as the
impact of longer term pricing initiatives that were not in place in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and the impact of
higher operating expenses.
As you will recall, our first quarter results in fiscal 2013 were very strong with the resolution of our 28-nanometer
supply constraints, favorable product costs and low relative operating expenses. We anticipate first quarter non-GAAP
combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be flat sequentially with modest growth in R&D offset by lower spending in
SG&A.
In QTL we estimate that total reported device sales of $57.5 billion to $63.5 billion will be reported by our licensees in
the December quarter for shipments they made in the September quarter, up approximately 14% year-over-year at the
midpoint.
We estimate the QTL ASP to be down in our first fiscal quarter versus the prior quarter consistent with the increased
quarterly fluctuations we have seen during the last couple of years related to regional, OEM and product mix. We
expect the ASP for our fiscal second quarter to be flat to up quarter-over-quarter.
In QCT we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 195 million to 210 million units during the December quarter,
up approximately 11% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect revenue per MSM to be lower quarter-over-quarter
reflecting a greater mix of lower-priced modems. We expect QCT operating margin to be up sequentially and in the
range of 17% to 19%.
We see the first fiscal quarter trends being reflective of the first half of fiscal 2014 overall. We expect more favorable
top line trends as well as cost and expense improvements in the second half of the fiscal year.
That concludes my comments. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst Day on the 20th in New York
where we will provide further details and guidance points supporting our financial outlook for fiscal 2014 and beyond.
I will now turn the call back to Warren.

<Q - Mike Walkley>: Great, thanks. Steve, just going into the QCT, I calculate the guidance implies maybe a 5% to
10% drop for the Q1 in terms of revenue per MSM? How should we think about that both sequentially and then on a
full-year basis? Would you expect your revenue per MSM given what sounds like a more mixed to low-end to be down
relative to fiscal 2013 levels? Thank you.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Mike, yeah, I don't know if you're going to see a huge difference. It doesn't move
around all that much, actually. We are seeing a weaker mix, I would think, relative to what you would normally see in a
quarter like this, certainly relative to what you would have seen last year. But it still remains, I think, reasonably strong

Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi. Thank you. I just had a clarification first, which is does the 16% operating margin in
QCT include the litigation charge? And if we back that out, what would be the margin?
And then the question I had was it looks like the implied royalty rate declined to about 3.1% in the quarter. Can you
just go over some of the reasons for that and how we should think about that going forward?
<A - George S. Davis>: Simona, hi. This is George. The 16% did not include the litigation expense, which was taken
in corporate and other as it was shown on the other line in OpEx.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: This is Derek. So on the implied royalty rate, as you know, this thing tends to bounce around
quarterly and there's a number of moving parts in here. Probably, you know, some of the factors that affected the
decline from Q3 to Q4 included OEM mix shifts. Also, we had an increasing TRDS, the market, as well as lower
infrastructure royalties and so the fixed licensing fees tend to be a bit of a drag on the rate when that happens. And then
we also had actually the ASPs in the high tier during this quarter increased and so those are the types of devices at that
point that would be subject to caps. And then finally we had a couple of kind of one-time items including an
overpayment claim that came in in the quarter, and then some timing related to cash based revenue recognized licensee
payments.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Yeah, a couple questions. So, Steve, if you were to walk through what you're saying regarding
your mix improvement through the fiscal 2014, especially into the back half, what percent of that is coming from your
overall savings from mix getting better or perhaps that you save with the TDD LTE shipments in the back half of the
year? And how much of this is coming from just simply cost savings?
And then the comment you made earlier about $1 billion dollars in revenue from China in fiscal 2013, can you give us
an idea of what that rate of change was from 2012? Thank you.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Sure. George, why don't you start on the first one? I'll probably add a little color to it.
<A - George S. Davis>: Sure. Hi, Brian. I would say that the operating expense improvement certainly helps, but I
think it's the – I would put a little bit more weight on the product cost improvement. The – certainly China LTE coming
in actually helps from a mix standpoint as well, and we also see a little bit less of the kind of n-1 part issue that we're
seeing in the first half of the year.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: And that issue, just from for clarity, what that essentially means is you're seeing some
customers right now, I would say, downshifting to a lower tier product, although still a high tier product from the

perspective of how QTL would see it, but maybe a smaller – a lower product, a low – still a low high-tier product from
the perspective of QCT. So you're seeing some of that. We think that will reverse a bit going into the second half of the
year.
With respect to the $1 billion in China, the way to think about that is to take our business in China really in the new
channel, so remove Huawei and ZTE, kind of the international existing businesses. Just take the new channel that we
have been developing, and take away some of the higher-tier premium devices. Just take a look at that new kind of
QRD channel and what I would call the lower-tier channel. We've grown that really from nothing over the last several
years to now north of $1 billion. Last year it's probably doubled, I would say, over the year. I'd have to check that, but
it's pretty significant growth. We are expecting in China, the move toward LTE to be a good trend for us. So we think
that channel is now working and set up, and hopefully we can move it to LTE, which would be better for us, even
further.

Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - James E. Faucette>: Thank you. Sorry, just a quick couple of questions from me. First, looking at your long-term
outlook, you've extended your double-digit revenue and earnings growth again this year. I'm wondering, Paul, if you
can talk a little bit about what you see as potential long-term drivers on that at the longer end of that, that period, from
an end market perspective, and how we should think about that?
And then just a point of clarification, did I understand correctly, George, that we could expect to exit fiscal 2014 at a
lower [indiscernible] (34:52 – 34:55)?
<A - Paul E. Jacobs>: Okay. Let me start. So obviously we're still spending quite a bit in research and development,
so we've spent $5 billion in fiscal 2013. We have moderated the growth of that but it's still growing, and so there's
plenty of effort on new technologies, new products. Obviously the basic one of 2G to 3G and 4G migration, especially
in emerging markets, that's pretty fundamental for our growth. LTE spreading more, particularly China as we said,
we're really looking forward to that towards the end of the year. Tablets and other kinds of computing, Steve mentioned
the traction that we're getting on design wins on the tablet side.
We've talked a lot about small cells and that opportunity going forward. More content going into the devices, talking
already about RF front ends, Wi-Fi, but also display, sensor, integration, and other kinds of things. Clearly wearables,
machine-to-machine, these are new growth areas for us. Other growth is just more devices per person, whether it's in
compute or in their car, in their home. You know, machine-to-machine. So all of these kinds of things are very
significant growth opportunities for us going forward, so we're investing into those growth opportunities and a few
others that we haven't yet talked to you about.
<A - George S. Davis>: And on the – I think your question, you broke up a little bit, but the question, I believe, was
will we exit the year, fiscal 2014, at a lower run rate on OpEx than we entered it. And that was a point Steve was
making. We get through the – the, kind of, what we have been describing as a bubble of spending in the first half of this
year, and we will be exiting the year at a lower run rate than we entered.

margin?
And related to it, from an absolute level, we're probably on line with MediaTek's gross margins now in that business.
I'm just curious if you think we're bouncing along the bottom of an acceptable gross margin for QCT. Thank you.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Tim, this is Steve. I think you're seeing a couple of effects. One is you're seeing a mix
shift which obviously comes at a different gross margin. You are seeing the effect of concentration in the industry, with
clearly people have stronger buying power the more concentrated the industry is.
Kind of moving forward, although we don't give gross margin guidance, I would say that those things we expect to be
improving over time, moving forward both from a mix perspective, but also I mentioned some work that we're doing to
improve product costs, both at the supplier level as well as at the design level. So I think you're probably looking at a
relative minimum right now.

Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to – I know this is getting beaten to
death, but I wanted to come back to the QCT chip margins and just try to understand, because it feels like the high-end
shipments here in the end of the calendar year, your fiscal Q4, Q1, are probably lower than would have been
anticipated. And I just wanted to double-check, Steve, if that is, in fact, the case, and that's – what, is it part of the
reason that the guidance in fiscal Q1 is maybe a little weaker than we would have anticipated?
And I just wonder, the other question I've got on this is, shouldn't some of that volume come back to us in the
beginning of the year, or do you guys just think it's lost forever? Or are we just completely misinterpreting this, and it's
not really a mix-related issue at all in those chip margins?
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Well, Tim – or excuse me, Rod. First of all, the – we still think that tier is growing.
That's I think an important point, and we think it's going to continue to grow. Relative to what we would have thought a
couple of months ago or even more than a quarter ago, it's probably a little bit softer in some, or with OEMs, relative to
what we would have thought. And that's impacted the mix, and I would say the concentration of more thin modem
relative to some larger Snapdragon products you're probably seeing in the mix as well.
Moving forward, there are a couple of things that we mentioned, but I think one of the more important ones is that we
think the move to LTE in China is an important move for us. And I would say, if you look at our unit guidance for the
year, our unit plan, delivering on all of the operating metrics that we talked about, we're not really expecting a massive
uptick in terms of unit volume. We'll continue to have strong units, but I think the plan is pretty balanced there if I had
to comment on it.

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Stacy A. Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to drill into the, I guess, the China LTE
for a moment. You've got unit growth up about 15%, which, you're right, is not really a huge acceleration versus where
we are today. Do you have LTE starting, I guess, sometime second half of next year? How much of this do you foresee
as current, I guess, single-mode TD-SCDMA players who are making the migration from single-mode TD to
multi-mode TD-SCDMA and LTE? And is that incorporated in your unit guidance, or if it's not, do you expect to see
any of that in 2014? Or is that more of a 2015 horizon or longer?
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Stacy, this is Steve. I think one thing that we do consistent really, even with prior years,
is we tend not to take a very aggressive view on the beginning of launches. So we have, we have – we are assuming
that we will see really some international OEMs move into the LTE market in China, more consistent with, I would

say, a new up-tier product, obviously new for us because we don't really get any volume today, out of China Mobile,
even though it's the largest in the world. And we expect that to transition down into the lower tiers at some point, but
really our plan right now is that this will probably be a higher-tier product at first, versus a replacement for the tier that
I think you asked about.
Now I want to be clear, we are pushing through our chipset offerings a tiered roadmap into the market so that could
happen, but we've always been a little bit cautious in terms of the front end of any technology migration. But no, the
real work is happening right now, and you're going to see from us a multi-tiered strategy to push products worldwide in
this technology.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Alex D. Gauna>: Yes. Thanks very much for taking my question. Steve, I wanted to follow-up with exactly what
can you tell us about plans from China Mobile in terms of the readiness of the network when we'll actually start getting
deployments?
And then I wanted to clarify, it sounded like in your 2014 forecast you're basing your view on mid-tier and high-tier
growth, but you have also mentioned some of the entry level, the new emerging SKUs being important? Can you
reconcile those two statements, is the low end or penetration to low end upside to your guidance? Thank you.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Sure, Alex. So on the China question, it's difficult for me to talk about the plans of any
particular carrier or in this case multiple carriers. I will say that we are engaged actively as are others to help the launch
occur as quickly as we can. But I think the decision of when really falls outside of our hands. We are working with
some lead OEMs to support the timing that I mentioned in my script, which essentially is the Chinese New Year timing
and that does seem consistent with the quality of the technical work that we see.
With respect to low end and high end, I guess the point we wanted to make is number one, the high end continues to
grow. We're doing well there. We continue to expect that it will continue to grow and we will continue to have strong
share position there.
Now at the low tier, I think we're growing into that market as well as improving our cost structure into that market.
However, the number of dollars per device is pretty different than in the first category that I mentioned and as those
mixes change, it does impact our profitability. And you're probably seeing that more in the near term. That's really what
you see.
I think we're pleased to consider ourselves to be strong in both areas. In the lower tier we tend to be lower in units, but
probably higher in terms of gross margin dollars per unit than our competitor. And I think we're probably a little bit
better positioned going into LTE than what we expect to see from other people.

Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks for the question. I just want to clarify one thing, Steve. Sorry, a couple of things.
The first thing is just on the high end of the business, if I – I just want to – is what you're seeing that high end demand
in smartphones is – the market is still growing unlike some people have feared but some of those high end customers
are just buying lower ASP devices and the mix shift within them so that hurts your QCT level of profitability in the
near term but doesn't impact licensing? Is that the right way of thinking of it? That's my first clarification.
Then the second thing is that if there is this increased buying power in the high end, which is obvious, it's been there
now for at least a year I would argue, what is it that's now causing them to exert this pressure on you and why isn't this
a multi-quarter, even multi-year issue? Because frankly, I don't think those high end vendors are going to lose share any

time soon. I don't think anybody else thinks that either. So is there a risk that we get to six months or nine months' time
that maybe China LTE doesn't improve your mix in that segment of the business, but you've got this almost consistent
pressure on QCT? So the day that QCT actually shows any leverage keeps getting pushed out? Could you just comment
on those two? That would be very helpful.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Maybe I'll start with the last one first, which is our plan and even Paul's comments on
the double digit actually assume continued concentration in the industry. And one of the reasons why we're comfortable
in that besides growing the content in the device, as Paul mentioned, as well as some of the adjacent markets that we
talked about, is that we believe that our investments that we have made over the last several years and we're going to
continue to make in key areas are protecting us in this area.
Now one of the things that's happened over the last several years that has masked this effect a bit is that we have been
growing really into a growing market and growing share. Now we're at a point where I think the business is very much
at scale. We're continuing to grow at the high tier, but now we're moderating, I think, the size of our investments to
really show leverage in the business. And you'll start to see that, I think, more in the second half of the fiscal year as we
work through this bubble that George mentioned in terms of operating expenses.
Maybe I'll let Derek comment on the impact of licensing? He probably can cover that better than I could.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: This is Derek. So I think, as Steve pointed out, we're continuing to see growth and expect to
see growth in the high tier. You know, the high tier actually has a pretty wide spread of selling prices and so as Steve
pointed out, there might be a situation where some of our – not the highest tier but still a high-tier part, are going into
devices that still from a licensing perspective we would categorize as high-tier. And although as the selling prices come
down, we have things like caps that may cause a muted effect as some of the ASPs come down. So there will probably
be some impact on licensing, but I would expect it to be less than what's being seen right now in QCT.
<A - George S. Davis>: Kulbinder, this is George. I just wanted to add one other point. I think we're not – you had
asked about the dependency on China LTE in the second half, and I would just say that our actions on operating
expenses, our actions on product cost improvements both in the supply chain and internally, plus our view of where the
part mix goes based on the launches, all those are factors that are not dependent on that but help us in the second half of
the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Tavis C. McCourt>: Thanks for taking my question. A couple of them. First, specifically on the Snapdragon 200,
which I think was the first purpose-built design lower-end Snapdragon, where are you in terms of shipments related to
that? And is there more coming in terms of low-end designs, or is it that one design that's – that could help the margins
at the low end?
<A - Paul E. Jacobs>: Sure. So the 200 – I'm sorry, I don't have the actual numbers on that. That was a very successful
product for us and continues to do well. I just don't remember what the numbers are.
If you look at our product portfolio looking forward, I think we're pretty pleased actually with the design traction in the
lower part of the roadmap. Today we have a couple of products, the 8X10 and similar family, that I think is doing a
fairly good job in terms of design traction, particularly in international OEMs that are now looking at the growth in the
China market as a growth area, particularly when they see the same concentration in developed markets, and they're
going after that. And they tend to go after that with products that we're engaging with them on.
Additionally, we are coming out with a product that's already sampling. It's actually going to be in devices here soon,
which is essentially a lower-tier AP but also an LTE solution as well and we expect that to also be an important
product, not only in China but also worldwide. So we're continuing to, I think, put more focus on the low end versus
what we have had historically, and really refreshing that product line.

your line is open. Please ensure that your line isn't on mute.
<Q - Mark McKechnie>: Yes. Thank you. Sorry. It was on mute. My question is for Derek. On the implied royalty
rate for QTL, you brought up some of the factors that caused that to drop there in September. Could you give us a sense
for directionally how you see that moving throughout fiscal 2014? Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Okay, Mark. I was planning to give probably more color around that in New York. If you
look at last year for instance, at the beginning of the year, we thought our best guess at the outset was we would come
in maybe a little under the 3.38% range or so. But we said at the time that that was based on our current outlook of the
market, and as you know, the market grew significantly faster than we expected. And also, ASPs went up throughout
the year as you know, and so a couple of things that we noted was that if those things came through, it would likely be
a bit of a drag on the rate, which is kind of where we ended the year here, about 3.27%, taking into account the last
quarter.
So I'm planning to going through, kind of, what we see in New York in a couple of weeks, bearing in mind that there's
so many factors that impact the rate that it is pretty hard to forecast that far out.

<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Thanks. Steve, MSM units at the midpoint look like they're up about 6% in December, which is,
you know, below the growth rate we saw in December of last year and the year before. Can you talk a little bit about
channel inventories? How your biggest customers are managing supply? And I guess tied into that, how do we think
about seasonality for March?
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Okay. I'll start and maybe some of my colleagues can jump in as well. I think
particularly comparing to last year, last year was an exceptionally strong year. So I think comparing to last year is
difficult to do. I think from two perspectives, one, as we were coming off of a supply constrained environment, we also
had I think some very strong product launches that also impacted that last year.
This year I think you're seeing a combination of a little bit weaker mix than what we typically see and then people
trying to figure out how to deal with the concentration that is existing in the handset industry. And we're seeing that a
little bit in our orders.
The other thing I would caution too is that these things can change now pretty radically in terms of how the smartphone
business works. So this is our best estimate right now. We expect to see, you know, I think good unit growth. But these
dynamics can change pretty rapidly.

<Q - Vijay R. Rakesh>: Just two questions here, you mentioned the cost side, I was wondering – you are now at
28-nanometer. What's – do you have any active shrinks going on, on your product line as you look at 2014?
<A - Paul E. Jacobs>: The answer is yes. I would say we're in a constant state of deciding which products go to the
next node and cost optimizing them. Also, you know, a lot of work even on particularly in the low tier, how do we –
how do we change the packaging to make it more appropriate for the low tier, which is fairly different than what's in
the high tier.
So it's a constant effort for us to do that. As you know, we have multiple sources of supply and some of the suppliers
are a bit more focused on the lower cost nodes versus the high performance nodes, and you'll sometimes see us move
supply around consistent with those goals.

there programs to reduce your cost of goods particularly at the low end? I don't know if some of that would be high
tier? Trying to see how we can quantify improving contribution margins going forward and maybe where we are in
terms of extracting some further value from the supply chain? What programs that we can do on the gross profit side?
And then, Derek, I usually ask the same question on your comfort level to collect on TD-LTE?
<A - George S. Davis>: Clearly we see the actions that we're taking. This is obviously managing our costs. We're not
just focusing on OpEx. The supply chain, you know, you can affect it by how you design and you can also affect it by
how you interact with the supply chain. And we're obviously focused on all of those things. And as we cited, part of the
improvement that we see in the second half comes from some of the actions that we're taking above the line, not just
below the line.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: So this is Derek. On the LTE TDD question, I think probably not much changed from last
quarter. We continue to believe that we'll be able to successfully collect on LTE broadly, including in China. We
continue to add additional licensees over the course of the quarter on, sort of, single-mode LTE. Several of those came
from China as well. And we've actually seen recently in the last couple of months some positive statements from the

adoption you're seeing with the OEMs, and if you could frame it with any sort of design wins or any color, that would
be great. Thanks.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Sure, Blayne. This is Steve. The – on the Wi-Fi side, I think I mentioned that if you
look at unit share, which includes all of our OEMs, including ones which includes our modem solutions as well as our
MSM solutions, we're now roughly 50% or probably a little higher than that, and we think that's going to grow into
next year.
If you were to back out solutions that are essentially just the ones that are MSM, it's significantly higher than that. So
we're very pleased actually with how Wi-Fi has gone, and we've talked for many years that we thought it would go into
a similar way that connective – or excuse me, that Bluetooth and GPS have gone. It's just something that, it's just
advantageous to the customer for us to deliver it together. So that's – think that's worked out there quite well.
On RF360, I think the main point is it's on track. You've already seen the first products come out, and I think they've
been pretty well covered actually in the blogs, but there's some devices that you're probably well-known that have come
out with the first version which is ET, the ET solution.
Throughout fiscal year 2014, we will see additional products within that family start to launch, and that's again, as we
expected, they're on track, and we're pleased with how that goes. We think that's going to be an interesting business for
us, not only from the perspective of growing content in the device, but it's also important for us to be able to solve the
RF band problem which we think we're well ahead of the competition on. And that will help us not only in the
additional business, but also pull through, I think, our leadership in LTE.

This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Dr. Jacobs, do you have anything further to add before
adjourning the call?
Paul E. Jacobs
Yeah, thanks, everybody, for joining us, and I just want to say another really strong year, a strong quarter. I want to
thank our employees, thank our partners, and while I'm thanking people I want to also say thanks to the Omnitracs
employees, as I said earlier.
Obviously this coming year, the shape is a little more heavily weighted towards the end of the year, and we are doing
things to manage our expenses. But – and we spent $5 billion in research and development in fiscal 2013, so there's a
lot of new products and technologies coming. I'm also proud that we were able to return $6.7 billion in capital to
shareholders.
Looking forward all that growth, we believe it's there and we expect, as we said, double-digit CAGRs over the next five
years. So we're looking forward to a lot of opportunities in the future, we're prepared, I love our strategic position. We
look forward to talking to you more about that when we see you in New York, so I hope to see many of you there.
Thanks a lot.
