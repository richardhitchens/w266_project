MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Today's call is being recorded. At this time for introductions and opening comments, I would like to turn the call over
to Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Paula Waters. Please go ahead, Ma'am.
Paula Waters
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We'll begin this morning with comments from Entergy's Chairman and
CEO, Wayne Leonard, and then Leo Denault, our CFO, will review results. In an effort to accommodate everyone with
questions this morning, we request that each person ask no more than two questions. After the Q&A session, I will
close with the applicable legal statements. Wayne?
J. Wayne Leonard
Okay, thanks, Paula. Good morning, everybody. We know many of you are preparing for the EEI conference next
week. Many other companies in our sector are reporting this week also. With that in mind, our comments will be brief,
or at least relatively brief for us and limited to quarterly results and recent events. We will discuss strategic issues with
you at EEI.
Starting at the Utility, on October 28, the Arkansas Public Service Commission issued an order in its show-cause
proceeding on post-System Agreement transition issues for Entergy Arkansas. In its order the APSC decided that it is
prudent for Entergy Arkansas to join a regional transmission organization. However, the Commission did not make a
determination on the question of which RTO was in the best interest of Entergy Arkansas and its ratepayers, the
Midwest Independent System operator option or the Southwest Power Pool RTO option.
A decision on which RTO to join was not the original subject of this docket, which was opened in February 2010, and
as such, the APSC deferred any determination on Entergy Arkansas' proposal to join MISO until the company files an

application to transfer operational control of its transmission facilities to MISO. The APSC order provides helpful
guidance on the upcoming change of control filing that Entergy Arkansas will make in the next 30 days. Similar change
of control filings will be made in the other retail regulatory jurisdictions by yearend, starting with yesterday's filing
with the Louisiana Public Service Commission.
Upon its exit from the System Agreement, Entergy Arkansas proposed to join MISO, which would provide it, as well
as the other utility operating companies, more benefits from the commitment and dispatch of a larger system than
currently provided by the System Agreement. These benefits derive from joining in an RTO with substantial scale and
a Day 2 market. As you know, Day 2 refers to an RTO that includes day ahead and real-time energy markets. MISO
has a functioning Day 2 market today that will generate savings for our customers on day one. SPP does not. Even
though cost-benefit analysis completed to date optimistically assumes SPP will have one by December 2013, both
schedule and costs are highly uncertain, particularly in light of the challenges other RTOs have experienced in
transitioning to Day 2 markets. Even assuming an operational Day 2 market in SPP, MISO is expected to provide 25%
greater benefits than SPP.
The System Agreement was the subject of another ruling late last month by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission related to its 2005 bandwidth decision. FERC's 2005 decision established the requirement that each utility
operating company's production costs be roughly equal within plus or minus 11% of system average production costs
and set 2007 as the first year for payments based upon production costs for calendar year 2006. In its latest order, the
FERC rejected arguments to require refunds for a 20-month period spanning September 2001 through May 2003.
However, the FERC concluded the bandwidth remedy should have been implemented sooner by calculating bandwidth
remedy payments and receipts for the seven-month period starting June 1, 2005, the date of FERC's initial order, rather
than January 1, 2006.
We're currently reviewing the order and are in the process of calculating the amount of payments required between
utility operating companies. As is the case with bandwidth remedy and receipts, these payments and receipts will be
calculated based upon the detailed formula prescribed by the FERC staff. It is likely the effect of moving up the
implementation date for the bandwidth remedy will result in additional payments from Entergy Arkansas. But, as a
reminder, Entergy Arkansas has an existing rider approved by the APSC that provides full recovery of costs resulting
from the FERC 2005 orders and any subsequent modifications of these orders. Immediately after the FERC order on
rehearing in late 2005 Entergy Arkansas gave the required 96 months notice of its withdrawal from the System
Agreement. That exit is now 26 months away, and Entergy Arkansas is actively preparing for this exit.
In another development relating to the proposed move to MISO, a FERC ruling in late September provided important
procedural guidance regarding the path forward for obtaining certainty on key issues affecting the operating company's
participation in MISO. At issue was the transitional waiver requested by MISO regarding proposed transmission cost
allocation provisions associated with Entergy's integration into MISO. The FERC concluded that the waiver request
was not the appropriate vehicle for obtaining FERC approval for the proposed provisions. Instead, these type of
provisions should be sought through specific tariff changes and accompanied by additional detail. MISO recently made
public the proposed tariff changes, and is currently working through its stakeholder process to finalize and file the
appropriate changes. This approach will provide greater clarity for Entergy's retail regulators and customers on the cost
allocation policies that will be in effect for the operating company's customers as they integrate into MISO.
In other regulatory events at the Utility, formula rate plan filings for the 2010 test year were resolved in Louisiana and
New Orleans. At Entergy New Orleans, the City Council approved a settlement that will result in a $13.1 million
reduction in electric rates and a $1.6 million reduction in gas rates effective the first billing cycle in October. This is the
fourth straight year of rate reductions, due in part to continued sales strength from the city's rebirth following Hurricane
Katrina as well as unseasonable weather in 2010. The average residential electric rate for Entergy New Orleans
customers is now more than 22% below 2008 levels.
Also last month, Louisiana Public Service Commission approved formula rate plan report for Entergy Louisiana and
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana resolving their 2010 test year filings. The final reports reflect 2010 earnings consistent
with each company's authorized bandwidth returns, resulting in no cost of service changes. However, the LPSC

deferred to its November meeting motions for a one-year extension of the formula rate plans through the 2011 test year
as proposed by Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. As part of the proposed extension, each of the
Louisiana companies indicated that they would file a full rate case by May of 2013, primarily to determine cost of
service rate classes and the appropriate rate structure. At this time, we would also allow consideration of any potential
ratemaking issues associated with the proposed transition to MISO.
And in Texas, after completing an overall review of costs, Entergy Texas submitted a notice last week to the cities in its
jurisdiction of its intent to file a rate case. The rate case is expected to be filed by yearend, and under Texas law d final
decision is due within 185 days of filing.
Wrapping up at the Utility, in October Entergy called for review for a stay in implementation of the US Environmental
Protection Agency's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, or CSAPR, in the US Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia. In addition, Entergy filed directly with the EPA to request a delay in implementation and a reconsideration
of the basis for the final rule. Numerous utilities, states, and other parties also filed challenges to CSAPR, including the
Public Service Commissions in Louisiana and Mississippi and the State of Texas.
We believe the rule is well intended, but seriously flawed, due to insufficient modeling capability and inaccurate inputs
to that model. As a result, it incorporates some fundamental errors based upon inappropriate modeling applications that
could threaten the utility operating companies' ability to meet the needs of its customers without subjecting the
companies to the risk of large fines for noncompliance. The primary issue for Entergy is the potential inability to serve
our customers and to comply physically on the shortened timeline created by the final rule, especially if interstate
allowance trading is also limited.
The utility operating companies are still reviewing the rule as well as last month's proposed revisions to the rule.
Specifically, the items under review include likely allowance pricing, unit operations and dispatch options, and
potential installation of pollution control equipment that can be installed by next summer. Even with EPA's proposed
revisions to the rule, the Entergy states are still disadvantaged on allowances.
The revisions would be a step in the right direction and is more realistic because it takes into account the necessity for
some units around the country to operate due to load pocket needs and transmission constraints even if they don't run in
the model that EPA used. For example, it is well known in our serviced areas that the areas in Amite South and West of
the Atchafalaya Basin, or what we call WOTAB, present substantial service complexities. They are dead-ended to the
south by the Gulf of Mexico, and in the case of WOTAB, also to the west by ERCOT. These constraints limit the
amount of power that can be imported into the area and therefore make stable generation by existing facilities in the
load area essential to maintaining reliability. The revised rule would also allow unlimited interstate allowance trading
until 2014, thus increasing the liquidity in the allowance market. However, most of the states are still significantly short
allowances and methods for compliance are still under review. As it stands today, CSAPR is effective next year unless
the courts issue a stay. An Appeals Court decision could take 12 to 18 months.
In the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, in Vermont, a three-day trial was held in mid-September in our
federal lawsuit to block the state from forcing the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Plant to close in March of next year despite
the fact that the NRC has issued a license to operate for another 20 years. A ruling by the District Court should be
issued at any time now. However, this case is very likely headed to higher court regardless of the decision.
In New York, a hearing before the administrative law judges of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation, or the DEC, began on October 17. As we've previously discussed, at issue are several matters identified
in the Water Quality Certification and water discharge permit proceedings for Indian Point. Two issues will be covered
in the first phase: the efficacy or performance of our wastewater stream proposal, and whether the DEC staff properly
denied the WQC application based upon the impact, if any, of the leakage of radiological material into the groundwater
beneath Indian Point. Future hearing dates have not been set, but are expected to resume in December on other issues
such as what impact, if any, Indian Point has on the stated best use of the Hudson River and any endangered species
and the availability of cooling towers as the best technology available. Final decisions by the DEC could be up to two
years away and are appealable to the New York State Court.

With the expiration of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's operating license in September 2013 for Indian Point 2
and December 2015 for Indian Point 3, we're still in the early stages of these license renewal processes. That said, the
NRC issued a decision in early September denying intermediate requests filed in the aftermath of the Fukushima event
to suspend the license renewal processes for all plants, including those for Pilgrim and Indian Point. A similar late-filed
contention arising out of Fukushima by the Massachusetts Attorney General is the last item pending before the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board in Pilgrim's license renewal proceeding. There is no reason to believe that the contention
filed in the Pilgrim proceeding is any different from all the other similar requests that have been denied by the NRC.
Appeals by Pilgrim Watch of recent ASLB decisions denying contentions they raised also remain outstanding with the
NRC.
The NRC's stated target for reviewing license renewal applications is within 22 months if there is no hearing and within
30 months if a hearing is required. That was the case in Pilgrim. Over the course of more than 69 months, the longest
license renewal proceeding in history, the NRC staff has completed an in-depth review and the ASLB has resolved all
admitted contentions. On the basis of these two facts, in August we filed a motion that the Pilgrim license renewal is
justified under the NRC's immediate effectiveness rule and asked the NRC to direct its staff to immediately issue the
20-year license renewal. The NRC has not ruled on that motion yet.
As it relates to timing, the NRC Chairman stated in a letter sent last year to Senator Kerry that NRC regulations permit
operation beyond the expiration of the current license if a final determination on Pilgrim's license renewal application
has not yet been made. That refers to the timely renewal doctrine.
Wrapping up recent developments at EWC, last week we announced the acquisition of the Rhode Island State Energy
Center, a 550-megawatt combined-cycle gas-fired power plant located in the ISO New England market. The purchase
price was $346 million, approximately $593 per kilowatt, including a planned 33-megawatt uprate scheduled for
completion prior to acquisition. Consistent with our disciplined point of view-based strategy, this investment had
standalone economic value, but it also starts to diversify EWC's portfolio across fuel type and dispatch merit and
provides a valuable backstop against firm sales from Pilgrim or Vermont Yankee, thereby reducing unit contingent
discounts compared to levels we have experienced in the past.
The economic value of a unit has less to do with the cost to build it or replace it or even comparable units than you
might think. It has more to do with competitive positioning. How efficient is the unit compared to the general stack at
that location? What are the transmission constraints or availabilities under various scenarios? Who are the likely
customers and what are their product preferences? Besides outright economics, what are other barriers to entry into that
area? It's a long list, but it comes down to evaluating the plant on an option basis and the investment optionality it
provides your total portfolio. Closing is targeted for this year, pending federal regulatory approvals and other closing
conditions.
In closing, I'm proud to report that Entergy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index for 2011
and 2012. This marks the tenth consecutive year Entergy has received this prestigious recognition for its leadership in
sustainability. This year key categories where Entergy ranked among the very best were occupational health and safety,
corporate governance, price and risk management, scoreboard measurements, and, of course, climate strategy. Our
approach to climate change was also recognized in September by Entergy's inclusion in the Carbon Disclosure
Leadership Index for the seventh time in the last eight years.
Despite the challenges we are facing today, we continue to set new financial and operational records along with
continued leadership in sustainability. For example, Unit 1 of the Arkansas Nuclear One plant just completed 530 days
of continuous operation. That is a new record run for that site. And a $207 million securitization financing closed in
September for recovery of costs from the cancelled Little Gypsy project was at approximately 2% coupon rate. That
was one of the lowest fixed rate coupons ever achieved by Entergy or any of its subsidiaries. Also financially, our
revised 2011 earnings outlook is consistent with another record year in operational earnings per share. I believe that's
something like 12 of the 13 years that we've set a new record.
Now I turn the call over to Leo to review more of the specifics. Leo?

Leo P. Denault
Thank you, Wayne, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today I will cover third quarter results and cash flow
performance followed by a few comments on capital deployment and our updated 2011 earnings guidance. As Wayne
noted, we'll keep our comments brief and focused on the quarterly results and a few recent events. We'll see most of
you next week at EEI, where we'll discuss longer-term strategic issues.
Starting with our financial results on slide two, third quarter 2011 earnings were higher at the utility compared to a year
ago, while results were lower at EWC and parent and other. Third quarter earnings included accretion from share
repurchases. The lower share count is due to the effective repurchases completed in both 2011 and 2010. Operational
earnings were up significantly compared to third quarter 2010. This increase is due largely to a tax settlement
agreement with the IRS. The settlement covered several issues, the most significant related to the mark-to-market
income tax treatment of utility power purchase agreement.
Slide three summarizes the effects of the settlement. The net effect of the IRS tax settlement was $382 million
reduction of income tax expense. Entergy Louisiana will share a portion of the benefits with customers, consistent with
the intent of the original tax benefit sharing agreement. In a settlement approved last month by the Louisiana Public
Service Commission, Entergy Louisiana will make annual payments of approximately $20.2 million to customers over
the next 15 years. Accordingly, Entergy Louisiana recorded a $199 million regulatory charge net of tax and a
corresponding regulatory liability to reflect this obligation.
The factors driving quarter-on-quarter results for each of the segments are summarized on slide four. At the Utility, the
tax settlement and corresponding regulatory charge for the sharing arrangement were the primary drivers for
quarter-over-over earnings growth. Excluding these items, Utility net revenue was slightly lower than a year ago. Retail
sales increased 2.4% compared to the third quarter last year, or 2.6% on a weather-adjusted basis. However, net
revenue was down in spite of benefits from weather-adjusted sales growth and regulatory actions. Lower unbilled
revenues provided the offset due to milder weather in the unbilled sales period at the end of the quarter. Unbilled sales,
or the Utility sales statistics provided in table four of the release reflect billed sales, while revenue also includes the
effect of unbilled sales.
Weather was again a significant factor for the quarter. It was essentially flat for last year on an earnings per share basis.
This year was the warmest August on record, and our system saw several new records. System load for the month of
August was highest in Entergy's history, breaking the previous record set in August of 2000. Three of the operating
companies set new all-time peaks.
Most of the retail sales growth came in the industrial sector. Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Texas and Entergy Mississippi
had the strongest industrial sales growth for the quarter. The industrial sales trend was similar to what we've seen in
previous quarters, where expansion's continuing to drive the increase in industrial sales, partially offset by weakening
in paper, pipeline and wood products segments.
Year-to-date total retail sales growth for the Utility is 2.4% on a weather-adjusted basis, higher than the assumptions
used on our full-year guidance due to stronger industrial results. Regulatory actions also contributed to net revenue in
the current quarter. Results reflect a 2010 Entergy Texas base rate adjustment as well as the Entergy Louisiana
Regulatory Action associated with the Acadia acquisition earlier this year. These items were partially offset by the
October 2010 rate decrease at Entergy New Orleans.
Also contributing to the Utility earnings increase was lower non-fuel operation and maintenance expense. Decreased
O&M is due in part to lower compensation and benefits expenses, the absence of amortization of rate case expenses for
Entergy Texas in this quarter last year, and the deferral of previously expensed outage costs pursuant to the Entergy
New Orleans Regulatory Agreement.
Moving on to Entergy Wholesale Commodities, this year's third quarter results declined versus 2010 due primarily to
lower net revenue and a higher effective income tax rate. Net revenue for EWC's nuclear portfolio declined as a result
of lower energy and capacity pricing. For the EWC nuclear fleet, the average realized price for the third quarter this

year was approximately $56 per megawatt hour compared to $61 a year ago. Lower pricing was partially offset by
higher nuclear volume.
Operationally, EWC's nuclear fleet had an excellent quarter, producing a 98% capacity factor compared to 91% last
year. The third quarter of 2010 included a portion of the scheduled outage at FitzPatrick, while there were no
re-fuelings in the third quarter of this year. There were also a fewer unplanned outage days, 14 days in the current
quarter compared to 26 days in the same period a year ago.
A higher effective income tax rate also contributed to EWC's lower results. The higher rate was driven by the absence
of a reversal of a tax reserve and the net effect of consolidated tax adjustments. Both were recorded in the third quarter
of last year. You may recall that consolidated tax adjustments affect the individual lines of business, but net to zero at
the Entergy level. Partially offsetting these factors was lower non-fuel operation and maintenance expense partly due to
lower compensation and benefits expenses.
Finally, third quarter Parent & Other results were lower than a year ago due primarily to higher income tax expense at
Parent & Other activities. The income tax expense increase was due primarily to the absence of a reversal of a tax
reserve in the third quarter of last year, which resulted from a favorable tax court decision. The absence of consolidated
tax adjustments recorded last year also contributed to the income tax expense increase at Parent & Other.
Moving to slide five, we review operating cash flow performance for the quarter. While 2011 OCF was lower than last
year, the decrease was due to the absence of roughly $700 million in receipt of 2010 storm financing proceeds from
Louisiana. Absent that item, OCF increased largely due to higher deferred fuel collections. Intercompany tax payments
did contribute to the line of business variances, but were offsetting between Utility, EWC, and Parent & Other.
Now turning to slide six, we provide some additional details on our recent agreement to acquire the Rhode Island State
Energy Center, or RISEC, a 583-megawatt combined-cycle plant, including a planned upgrade to be completed prior to
our purchase. The RISEC acquisition aligns with our market-based point of view. This modern and efficient generation
asset is well positioned to benefit from expected market recovery, and it complements the existing business by allowing
more contracting flexibility for our portfolio of assets in the Northeast.
The agreed-upon purchase price is approximately $346 million, subject to closing adjustments. The acquisition will be
financed similar to other non-utility investments and will utilize available corporate resources. Assuming closing by
yearend, we expect the asset to produce earnings per share in the range of $0.07 in 2012 based on forward natural gas
and energy prices at the end of September 2011.
Just one point on our long-term financial outlook, Entergy has an outlook to deploy up to $4 billion to $5 billion
through dividends and share repurchases from 2010 through 2014 absent other attractive investment opportunities. We
continue to affirm that outlook.
Now turning to our share repurchase update summarized on slide seven, during the quarter we completed $75 million
of share repurchases, buying 1.1 million shares at an average price of $66 per share. All of the repurchases were made
through the existing $500 million Board-authorized program. Year-to-date we have completed $150 million of share
repurchases. Recall that no buybacks were assumed in 2011 guidance. Consistent with past practice, we will continue
to evaluate share repurchases against other capital deployment opportunities, considering current business conditions
and investment needs as well as liquidity and financial flexibility.
Slide eight details our updated 2011 earnings guidance. The net effect of the IRS and LPSC settlements discussed
earlier is significant enough by itself to move 2011 results outside our original guidance range. Therefore, we revised
our 2011 as-reported and operational earnings guidance to a range of $7.15 to $7.65 per share with a midpoint of $7.40.
The updated range takes into account year-to-date income tax expense adjustments above the level assumed in the
original guidance, including the IRS settlement agreement, net of the amount to be shared with the Entergy Louisiana
customers.
In closing, as Wayne said, we plan to review our longer-term outlook at the upcoming EEI conference next week,
similar to our past practice of the last two years. At that time, we also plan to initiate 2012 guidance and review the

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Hello?
Operator
Mr. Patterson, please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Can you hear me?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: We can hear you, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, sorry about that. Trying to, just when we go over the $1.02 of IRS benefit, you guys are
showing sort of an $0.80 increase. Is that because you guys had anticipated some sort of benefit, it just was a much
lower amount?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: That's correct, Paul, we had – we had – in our planning for the year and guidance, we typically
go through from a tax perspective what we believe may or may not show up during the course of the year to help set
not only the midpoint range, but the midpoint, but the guidance range. and so we had anticipated some level of tax
benefit showing up during the year, and the settlement is bigger than that, but we had about $40 million or so of tax
benefits already baked into our guidance, so this is – the $0.80 is the increment...
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay
<A - Leo P. Denault>: over what was already there.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Now I know you guys are going to be giving guidance and everything at EEI, and can't wait for
that, but just any sense as to how we should think about taxes, the potential tax situation or effective tax rate that we
should be thinking about for 2012?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, we'll bring that up when we get into the – into the guidance for 2012. It's kind of difficult
to talk about it in isolation without talking about earnings in general.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, just the other thing I just want to touch base with is on the growth of customers versus
sales. It does look like customers are using less outside the industrial area, and I was wondering if you guys thought
that was sort of a temporary thing, or whether or not you thought that that might rebound next year, or if you're seeing
something that you think might be more permanent, sort of the kind of stuff that we've seen on the gas side maybe?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Gary?
<A - Gary J. Taylor>: Yeah, this is Gary, Gary Taylor, yeah, I think what we have seen in, probably in a broader
context is pretty similar to what you've seen along the region, is when you think about residential, they tend to really
affect price elasticity quite a bit. Their bills were up about 10% to 15% with high heat. I think we've have seen an
impact of that playing through, so that's one factor. Energy efficiency is playing through as well in all classes, and we
factored that into our plan. And we're kind of seeing the same with commercial as well, where commercial has really
followed what you have seen in the economy. So as the economy recovers, we would expect commercial to come back.

Industrial has actually being very, very strong, as Leo said, actually stronger than we would've expected, and our
overall sales are a little bit above our existing plan. And if you think about how Entergy's positioned, I saw some EEI
data that basically says for the Southeast, sales weather-adjusted were up about 1.5% this year, and we're up about
2.5% overall. But what we should see is as price mediates a little bit, residential should come back up some, and
commercial is going to pretty much follow what we think the economy is going to do.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Great, thanks.
<A - Gary J. Taylor>: And we'll talk more at EEI what we expect as far as sales next year.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.

And next we'll go to Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Yeah. Hi, good morning, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: I guess two questions, first on the accretion from the transaction when – I mean obviously,
I think you generally finance this with cash on hand or debt, but in theory it also replaces other uses of cash like
potentially more buybacks. So when you're giving the accretion estimates, are you doing it, how are you kind of
thinking about the financing? And is it essentially accretive versus the other ways you would have used this money?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well it's – that's accretion on a whole excluding financing. And you're right. It's fungible in
terms of whether it comes out of incremental borrowings or utilizes dollars that we otherwise would have used for the
buyback. So, it's not net of that in terms of what we reported.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: So, it's not net of any financing costs, or just net of like debt – like use of the bank lines or
something?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yeah. It's not net of any real financing costs.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. And is this accretion including the benefit to the company on the local nuclear
plants in terms of maybe selling the power differently, or not?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: No, it's not.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. So it's not, so it's without financing costs, but also without changing the way you're
selling the nuc.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Correct.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. One other question, when you look at year-to-date the benefits, if you go to your
little table, the benefits of like sales and rate actions year-to-date, I think it's $0.15 a share versus last year from page
nine. And when you gave guidance I think that you had expected that to be $0.45. But it seems like sales have been
pretty good, and I'm not aware of any surprises on rate action, so I'm curious why that's trailing, or is it just – is there a
big fourth quarter catch-up?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, one aspect of it is the delay in Waterford 3 that was supposed to be in rates this year and
now will be next year.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: A delay in closing of Acadia by a month, and that was factored in as well.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Are you booking AFC on those things, so it's not really earnings impactful, or it is?

<A - Leo P. Denault>: It's not exactly as good as putting them in rates.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Acadia there was not, because it was an acquisition, but there would be fewer dollars because
of the spend being delayed in Waterford, the AFUDC will just be on the portion that's been expended as opposed to all
of it being in rates earlier this year.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. Okay, thanks so much.

[Operator Instructions] And next we'll go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Neil S. Mehta>: Hi, this is Neil Mehta here for Michael Lapides. Lots of O&M improvement in the quarter, can
you walk though again what the key levers were and if there were any unusual items embedded in that O&M?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: The key drivers for the O&M decrease is really lower compensation and benefits expenses has
been the biggest driver between this year and last year.
<Q - Neil S. Mehta>: Got it. And then separate question, your debt refinancing plans at the holding company,
especially related to the credit facility next year, can you provide any color related to that?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: You should see us probably start to take action on the credit facility here in pretty short order.
We've got until August of 2012 before that expires. So, certainly around the first part of the year, we'll get that taken
care of.
<Q - Neil S. Mehta>: All right, appreciate it guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Thanks.

And next we will go to Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Good morning. Congrats.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Leo, just going back to, so can we assume that as you had mentioned in your assumptions, that
weather was like $0.62 positive last year, and you expected that to, normal would have been a $0.62 variance negative,
that as weather has been pretty much flat year-over-year, we have kept majority of that $0.62 this year versus losing
any, would that be a fair comment?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: It's, you're right. Weather has been flat year-on-year. When we move guidance, Ashar, we
didn't take into effect anything other than the incremental tax position. So, we didn't incorporate anything into the move
for guidance for weather. We didn't include anything in it as it relates to reduced pricing in the Northeast. We didn't
include anything in there as it relates to the Waterford 3 delay that we were just talking about. So, you're correct that
we've seen about $0.57 of weather I think this year, which is pretty close to what we saw last year. I think you asked
about that actually on last quarter's call, and I think I told you not to count third quarter weather this year just like last
year, and I don't know what you knew about the weather that you would know it would come out exactly the same on
an earnings per share basis, but I think we had this $0.29 last year and this year both, so.

<Q - Ashar Khan>: Okay. And then just going back to Steve's question, as you said, you had factored in like $0.45,
and only, it seems like probably $0.20 would show up this year. Can we then assume that this $0.25 that didn't show up
this year is really as you're saying going into next year rather than this year? Is that a fair thing to say?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: In terms of the rate actions and load growth?
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Right. You had mentioned $0.45 for sales growth and rate actions. So, as you were saying,
year-to-date we might end up around $0.20 versus the $0.45. So, can we take the remaining $0.25 as you mentioned
some of the factors got delayed? Can we assume that they are then reflected next year?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, next year you will see the full year impact of Acadia, and when the assets that didn't get
in rates this year get in rates next year, you'll see that step up from there. Yes, that will be included in what we come
out with in guidance for 2012.
<A - Gary J. Taylor>: Yeah. And the other thing, the Waterford 3 steam generator project's not scheduled to be
completed until the end of 2012, so, you wouldn't see the impact of it until basically 2013.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Understood, but the amount that we lost, like $0.20 this year or so, they've been really delayed to
'12, right? That's what's happened.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, ...
<Q - Ashar Khan>: So it's not that they've gone to '13, or have some moved to '13 as well?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: The Waterford 3 will be toward the end of the year, next year.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Okay.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: So, you won't get a full year of it. You won't get as much in next year as we would have
had this year.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] And next we'll go to Reza Hitucki with Decade Capital.
<Q - Reza Hitucki>: On the weather question, so I guess since it's the great weather you've had this year is not
included in your revised earnings guidance, I guess how should we think about that as you finish the year? Is it just,
once you print your fourth quarter numbers, does it all of a sudden show up, or I'm kind of just confused on how to
think about that.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: There will be a variety of things, I guess, that will kind of get into the end of year number.
Again, we haven't made adjustments for weather, for lower capacity, and energy pricing in the Northeast, the Waterford
3 delay, et cetera, so I guess one way to think about it is that the low end of the range is probably not something that
we'd be looking at by the end of the year.
<Q - Reza Hitucki>: And I'm sorry if you answered this earlier, but O&M this year, I forget what the earnings impact
was when you originally guided in the last EEI, but how has that tracked versus your original guidance, and would you
consider maybe spending some O&M here to sort of offset the good weather you've had, bringing it forward, I guess?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, certainly when you have the kind of weather we've had, you'll have the situation where
the plants are running more, the system is stressed more, and so there will be O&M associated with that in both the
generation and T&D bases, so some of that might just be incremental, some of it certainly would be having to do
maintenance on facilities sooner than we otherwise would have thought had, we had to, because we're running the

system harder because of the weather. And that, actually it's two years in a row, so that's certainly a possibility that
you'd see O&M pick up to match the kind of operational characteristics of the system in this kind of weather.
<Q - Reza Hitucki>: Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.
