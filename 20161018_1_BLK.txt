MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Carmen, and I will be your conference facilitator here today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Incorporated third quarter 2016 earnings teleconference.
Our hosts for today's call will be: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer
Gary S. Shedlin; President Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel Christopher Meade. All lines have been placed on
mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.
[Operator Instructions]
Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.
Christopher J. Meade
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking
statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these
statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the
results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake
to update any such forward-looking statements.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Gary.

Gary S. Shedlin
Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2016. Before I
turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. While
our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our
as-adjusted results.
Our clients are facing significant challenges, driven by increased regulation, market volatility, record low interest rates,
and disruptive technology. And as a result, the asset management industry is changing rapidly. During these times, as
we've done in the past, we reexamined our strategic priorities and evolved our business model, with a goal of better
serving the needs of our clients and optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible for our shareholders.
Financial results for the third quarter of 2016 demonstrate the diversification and stability of our global investment and
technology platform and our commitment to investing for the future. We executed on each of the three components of
our framework for shareholder value creation this quarter: delivering organic growth; demonstrating operating
leverage; and systematically returning capital to our shareholders.
Third quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 3% lower than a year ago. However, on a constant-currency basis, we
estimate that quarterly was down approximately 1% year over year. Operating income of $1.2 billion declined 1%,
while earnings per share of $5.14 increased 3% versus the prior-year quarter.
Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $29 million of net investment gains, primarily attributable to net gains on
unhedged or partially hedged multi-asset and fixed income seed investments.
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 29.7%, reflecting the impact of several non-recurring items. We
continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2016, though the
actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring items that could arise in the future.
BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, representing an annualized organic
growth rate of 5%. Flows were positive in our active and index franchises and across asset classes and regions,
increasing the value of our broad-based diversified business model.
Third quarter base fees of $2.5 billion were up 4% year over year, driven primarily by organic growth, positive beta,
and higher securities lending revenue, which was positively impacted by widening asset spreads resulting from a rise in
short-term interest rates. Sequentially, base fees were up 2%.
While we continue to deliver strong organic growth, base fee growth has recently lagged growth in average assets
under management, as client risk appetite and portfolio construction decisions impact our business mix. In the current
environment, client mix shift has favored index over active, fixed income and cash over equities, and government funds
over prime funds in the money market space. While mix change amongst and within asset classes won't impact our
blended fee rate over time, we remain confident that our diverse business model is capable of generating differentiated
organic growth in a variety of market environments, and our scale enables us to prudently manage expense and defend
our operating margin.
Performance fees of $58 million declined 72% versus a year ago, driven by our single-strategy hedge fund platform.
Recall that performance fees in last year's third quarter benefited from a single European hedge fund that delivered
exceptional full-year performance.
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $174 million increased 4% year over year and 1% sequentially. Our Aladdin business,
which represented 87% of BRS revenue in the quarter, up from 81% a year ago, grew 13% year over year, driven by
new clients and several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform over the last year. Strong market demand for
Aladdin continues from institutional asset managers as well as retail intermediaries who are seeking sophisticated risk
analytics and portfolio construction tools to better serve their wealth management clients in the current regulatory
environment.

Other revenue was down $16 million year over year, primarily related to lower transition management activity in the
current quarter.
Total expense decreased 4% year over year and was flat sequentially, driven primarily by lower compensation expense.
Employee compensation expense was down $56 million or 6% year over year, reflecting lower incentive compensation,
primarily driven by lower performance fees versus a year ago.
G&A expense decreased $7 million or 2% from a year ago and $4 million or 1% sequentially, as we continue to
exercise discipline over our discretionary spend in the current environment. At present, we anticipate fourth quarter
G&A spend to be moderately lower than last year's normalized levels after adjusting for $23 million of quarterly
deal-related costs incurred a year ago.
Finally, distribution and servicing cost decreased 12% year over year or 5% sequentially, primarily related to the
acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management in April of this year.
Despite an overall decline in year-over-year revenues driven by a reduction in performance fees, we have delivered
3.5% organic growth over the last 12 months and expanded our as-adjusted operating margin versus a year ago,
evidencing our continued commitment to strike an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and
practical discretionary expense management.
In line with that commitment, earlier this month we reduced prices on 15 U.S. iShares Core ETFs and several actively
managed U.S. bond funds. We chose to use our scale and leadership position to invest on behalf of clients and financial
advisors as they adapt to the DOL's new fiduciary rule. In isolation, these price reductions will result in an estimated
$85 million annualized revenue reduction for BlackRock, representing less than 1% of our total base fees. However,
over the mid to long term, we expect this investment to be accretive to organic growth and additive to overall
shareholder value.
During the third quarter, we continued to return excess cash to shareholders and repurchased an additional $275 million
worth of BlackRock shares.
BlackRock generated $70 billion of total net inflows in the third quarter, including $55 billion of long-term net inflows
and $15 billion of cash management inflows. Cash management inflows demonstrate the breadth of our platform and
strength of our client relationships in the lead-up to U.S. money market reform. Since the beginning of the year, our
platform has experienced a remarkable shift from prime to government funds. BlackRock is now the second largest
SEC Rule 2a-7 money fund provider in the United States, and our diverse capabilities across SEP accounts, elective
trusts, and short-duration products position us well for continued future growth.
Global iShares generated $51 billion of net inflows during the quarter, representing 18% annualized organic growth.
Over the last 12 months, iShares has now generated over $140 billion in net inflows, representing 15% organic growth.
iShares's equity inflows of $26 billion for the quarter were driven by flows into U.S. and emerging markets, as
investors once again turned to iShares' Precision Exposures as their preferred vehicle to de-risk following the Brexit
vote.
Importantly, our ETF product segmentation strategy, which tailors products to different client segments, continues to
perform well. As an example, large institutional clients who value liquidity and often use derivative strategies drove $6
billion of quarterly flows into EEM, our flagship iShares emerging markets financial instrument. Longer-term
investors, who may be retail or institutional but are more price-sensitive, added nearly $3 billion into IEMG, our
iShares core emerging markets ETF.
Quarterly iShares fixed income inflows of $23 billion reflect an ongoing adoption of ETFs as a means of rapidly
accessing and investing in fixed income markets worldwide. Demand was particularly acute in investment-grade
corporates and emerging markets, as investors continue to search for sources of higher yield.
Our institutional client platforms saw $6 billion of long-term net inflows during the quarter, driven by active net
inflows of $8 billion, as clients increasingly look to partner with BlackRock to build customized solutions or generate
yield to meet their investment objectives. Inflows into multi-asset and solutions-oriented strategies, including our

LifePath Target Date series and active fixed income, were partially offset by outflows from active equity.
In addition, we had another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising $1 billion in new commitments.
Illiquid alternatives remain a key area of growth for BlackRock, as our institutional clients increasingly search for
additional sources of income and fund-correlated returns.
BlackRock's global retail franchise saw $2 billion of long-term net outflows, primarily due to outflows from equity and
multi-asset funds, in another challenging quarter for the active mutual fund industry. Outflows were concentrated in
European and U.S. equities and world allocation strategies.
Retail fixed income remained a pocket of strength, with diversified flows across our top-performing platform, including
strong flows into emerging markets, high-yield, municipals, and European and Asian fixed income. At September 30,
88% of BlackRock's taxable fixed income assets were at or above benchmark or peer median for the trailing five-year
period. In particular, our flagship Total Return Fund continues to generate best-in-class performance and is performing
in the top 5% of its peers for the trailing three and five-year periods.
Overall, our third quarter results reflected benefits of the investments we've made to build a diversified global business
model. Diversification across investment style, distribution channel, product, and region enables us to deliver
differentiated organic growth in a variety of market environments, while our scale allows us to make strategic
investments which deliver value for our clients and shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Laurence Douglas Fink
Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call.
BlackRock's business model was built to thrive in all market environments. And clients continue to trust BlackRock in
an environment characterized by macroeconomic and political uncertainties, slow global growth, and persistent low
rates.
In the third quarter, even as the industry-wide investor preferences continue to migrate from equities to fixed income
and cash and away from active strategies, the diversity of our platform drove nearly $70 billion of total net inflows. Our
$55 billion of long-term net inflows was positive across both active and index strategies and across every asset class in
every region.
We are seeing ongoing divergence in global monetary policy. While the U.S. signals a slow path to tightening, the UK,
Japan, and other central banks continue with accommodative monetary policy, keeping yields at historical low levels
and fueling widening asset/liability gaps for both large institutions and also individual savers. As monetary policy
reaches its limits in many regions, expansionary fiscal policy, particularly in the form of infrastructure investments,
will be necessary to ignite economic growth.
The lack of clarity around the outcomes of several upcoming political events, including the path forward on Brexit,
elections in the U.S., and the constitutional referendum in Italy, is contributing to growing tail risk and investor caution.
Despite underlying uncertainty, market volatility reached lows not seen since 1995. And equity markets rose in the
quarter, posting record highs in the United States and the United Kingdom.
Many clients are turning to BlackRock to help them understand the risk at the intersection of policy, markets, and
economics, as governments' actions continue to drive our markets. Both institutional and retail clients are increasingly
utilizing Aladdin risk management technology and portfolio construction tools, as well as turning to BlackRock for our
insights as a thought leader.
In the third quarter, the BlackRock Investment Institute hosted a call on the potential impact on financial markets of the
upcoming U.S. election, which had more than 1,000 participants.

These differentiators, and combined with our global active and index investments platform that BlackRock has built
over time, enables us to have a deeper and more meaningful conversation with our clients. And more than ever before,
clients value BlackRock's diverse global business model.
As Gary mentioned, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, representing a 5%
or organic asset growth and 5% organic base fee growth. The composition of our flows this quarter is representative of
global market conditions and investor sentiment. Across client segments, inflows were led by U.S. and emerging
markets equities and debt, as investors view the U.S. as a relatively haven, and emerging markets have gained
momentum as commodity prices stabilize. Meanwhile, we saw outflows from European equities amid political and
policy uncertainties both from the continent and the United Kingdom.
Institutional investors are slowly regaining confidence, and the third quarter was characterized by consistent, diverse
client flows rather than any one concentrated activity. Our institutional business saw $8 billion of active net inflows in
the quarter, driven by strong fixed income and multi-asset flows, primarily from defined contributions and insurance
clients.
Insurance clients face complex challenges as traditional asset allocation strategies are failing to support their business
models. With expertise in understanding the specific needs of insurance clients, BlackRock's Financial Institutions
group is putting the differentiated technology advantages on our Aladdin platform to work constructing and delivering
highly customized investment solutions, which incorporate both traditional and alternative asset classes across active
and index strategies.
Insurance companies are also increasingly employing fixed-income ETFs in a broad range of applications. A recent
study from Greenwich Associates found that ETF demand from insurers is likely to increase. Of insurers in this study,
52% of these companies expect to increase their use of fixed income ETFs in the next year. And BlackRock is well
positioned to work with large insurers as their investment strategies and techniques evolve.
Active fixed income flows from retail investors remained strong in the quarter at $5 billion, driven by flows into high
yield, emerging market debt, and Asia fixed income; again, reflecting investors moving out of the risk curve in search
of income as they struggle with historical low rates. At the same time, retail investors continue to pull back from active
equity investments, driven by a combination of challenging long-term performance track records and also accelerating
regulatory changes.
2016 U.S. active equity mutual funds have experienced more than $240 billion of year-to-date outflows, its worst year
on record, with more than $110 billion of outflows in the third quarter alone. At the same time, we have seen strong
flows from this client segment across our iShares equity ETFs, which I'll speak about in a moment.
Regulatory changes are having a material impact on the retail ecosystem. The Department of Labor fiduciary rule, RDR
[Retail Distribution Review], and MiFID [Markets in Financial Instruments Directive] are all impacting the way wealth
managers serve their clients. We are likely to see a historical shift on how assets are being managed and invested, as
our distribution partners are changing both their product preferences and their use of technology to adapt to these rule
changes.
We've been working closely with our distribution partners in the U.S. in advance of the Department of Labor rule
implementation. Aladdin for Wealth, our technology and risk management system designed specifically for wealth
managers, will be a key differentiator for BlackRock in helping our clients adapt, as financial advisers sharpen their
focus on the quality and cost efficiencies of funds. We also expect that they will use ETFs more and more at the center
of their portfolios.
Advisors are using ETFs alongside high-conviction active funds, and also they're using ETFs as an active tool to
manage their client assets.
Throughout BlackRock's history, we have anticipated a series of changes in the ecosystem and have taken strategic
actions to adapt. This has included: combining our active and index strategies on one platform through the BGI
acquisition in 2009; continuously enhancing our Aladdin risk and investment management technology; launching the

iShares Core series in 2012, which exceeded our expectations by growing at an average organic asset growth rate of
24% since inception; and most recently, acquiring FutureAdvisor. Each of these strategic actions represented an
investment to better serve our clients and to drive growth in our business.
As our ecosystem evolves further, asset managers can no longer rely on beta to subsidize investment spending.
BlackRock's diversified business and history of successful execution allows us to continue to invest when other firms
may not be able to. Whether using our balance sheet to seed new products, streamlining the organization to reallocate
investments to strategic initiatives, making tactical technology or product acquisitions, or leveraging our scales to
reprice product for our clients, we are committed to seeking out the most efficient ways to growing our business.
Earlier this month, we made a strategic investment in our U.S. iShares Core ETFs, reducing prices to meet our clients'
need for high-quality, long-term holdings. In doing so, we are taking steps to be the leader in the core segment by
providing clients with the best quality and value of any ETF sponsor and making iShares the clear ETF choice for
financial advisors building portfolios under the new fiduciary standard.
We are maximizing the benefit of our scale to drive the maximum value for our clients and our shareholders, and we
expect to see increased organic asset and revenue growth in the iShares Core series over time. We also expect this
investment to drive growth across our broader range of iShares Precision Exposures, where clients place significant
value on characteristics like liquidity and tax efficiency. And finally, we expect this investment to drive growth across
our active business as we deepen our relationships with all our distribution partners.
Our early results have been strong. Since the repricing action just last week, our U.S. core market share of net flows
have grown by 25 points to 59%, and our iShares outside the core have also been logging strong flows. iShares saw $51
billion of net inflows in the third quarter; and year to date, I'm speaking as of yesterday, close to $100 billion of inflows
in 2016.
Fixed income iShares continue to a substantial growth opportunity for BlackRock, and we achieved a significant
milestone in the quarter by reaching $100 billion in our European fixed income ETF AUM. iShares is a world-leading
ETF provider, holding the number one share of U.S., European, and global equity and fixed income ETF flows year to
date.
Going forward, in a lower beta environment, alpha generation has the opportunity to drive greater percentage of overall
investor returns. BlackRock saw positive active net inflows of $4 billion in the third quarter. Active flows were driven
by our leading global fixed income platform, where we have scale, product diversity, and strong long-term
performance, with 88% of our assets above benchmark or peer median for the five-year period.
The combination of active and index strategies will continue to play an important role in our clients' portfolio. And
BlackRock has all the components, unlike our peers, as well as portfolio construction capabilities, risk technology, and
better portfolios.
I've emphasized the importance of technology many times today. Technology is an essential component of adapting to
our regulatory changes, and more broadly a changing investor landscape. As advisors take on greater portfolio
construction responsibilities in a fee-based account, they are increasingly using BlackRock Solutions sophisticated
tools and risk analytics to build better portfolios. As a result, we are seeing strong interest for our Aladdin for our
Wealth, our iRetire platform, and our future advisor offerings.
Institutional clients facing persistent low rates and searching for yield require a deeper look into their entire portfolio,
and BlackRock's technology can help them see clearer and allocate more effectively. Aladdin continues to build
momentum with institutional clients, and revenues grew over 13% year over year.
We are committed to constantly innovating on our existing platform, as well as thinking of new ways that we can serve
our clients' needs with technology. This remains a key differentiator for BlackRock relative to any other firm in the
asset management industry.
In a time of significant change for the asset management industry, I believe BlackRock is better positioned than at any
time in our history, and we've never had more opportunity working with our clients than we do today. We are at a

pivotal point with uncertainty in politics, regulation, and market likely to play out over the coming months. Our clients
are apprehensive, but they are coming to BlackRock for advice, and our priorities remain helping them to meet their
investment goals in all environments.
We have a unique ability to use our scale, our breadth of active and index products, our global reach and our portfolio
construction, our risk management expertise, and technology advantages to meet our clients' needs, their evolving
needs, to drive their future growth and our future growth as a firm and future growth for our shareholders.
Now let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Alex.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Hi, good morning, everybody. Hi, good morning. So first, maybe we'll just start off with a
DOL question. It's been a couple of quarters, and I guess the distribution networks and the platforms had a chance to
digest the rules. And, Larry, you alluded to you guys are working closely with your distribution partners on helping
them adapt to these changes, so maybe a little bit more color from the perspective of what kind of changes are you
anticipating. Obviously, we saw the announcement from Merrill and Edward Jones a couple months ago. But more
specifically, I guess with respect to number products, fee structures, any more granularity I think will be helpful.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: I don't know that much more than what you just said. We witnessed the changes from
Merrill Lynch and Edward Jones. It is very clear, though, that the fiduciary rule is changing how our distribution
partners manage their clients' accounts. As you suggested and as stated by these public announcements, it's moving
more to a fee-based relationship, less commission-based relationship.
We also believe it's going to move more to a model-based relationship too, where you're going to see the CIO offices of
the various distribution platforms coming up with asset allocation strategies.
We certainly believe that in the DOL rules, it's going to mean fees are going to be very important, and that's obviously
one thing we can say with certainty. We don't know how that's going to play out. But we do believe as it moves more
towards managed portfolios, utilizing more centralization of models and corporate and asset allocation, it's going to
move quite a bit of money more towards passive strategies, utilization of ETFs. We do believe it will systematically
move assets away from active, and so we're trying to get prepared.
The one thing we can say with certainty in our conversations though, it leads to greater need of risk management tools.
And this is one of the reasons why we have adopted Aladdin, which historically was an enterprise system for large
institutional investment organizations. We have now adopted Aladdin for Wealth, and we could go down to individual
accounts and allowing the advisor and the organization to look at every relationship they have through the lens of risk
management.
And we believe under the DOL rules, having that oversight is going to be imperative. And this is one of the reasons
why we developed this technology. We're in dialogue with many, many distribution partners already related to Aladdin
for Wealth. We have signed up one institution already for Aladdin for Wealth, and we're in dialogue with many more,
utilizing the Aladdin system for the navigation of their clients' investment strategies.
So we look at this as a huge opportunity for us. We're in great position to navigate. I should add, I don't think any other
organization has those capabilities, and so it put us in a great position. By having that position, it allows us to have
more dialogue, not just more dialogue for passive strategies, but more dialogue in portfolio construction and models
and active strategies. So having this opportunity to be working with these institutions on the navigation of risk
management on behalf of all their individual clients will give us a unique opportunity to be working with these

institutions in a way that we never have been able to before.

Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hey, Craig.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Hey, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Gary.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Good morning.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: So I just want to follow up the last DOL question. I'm wondering. Have you tried to size up
the potential money that could be in motion in U.S. retail? And you're seeing a lot of money in motion outside of U.S.
retirement, which is supposed to be the focus of the DOL world, so really in traditional brokerage.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Let me give Rob that answer.
<A - Robert Steven Kapito>: So we have found that there is such a significant amount of cash that's on the sidelines
because rates are so low and equities have not returned what people have expected that the money that is potentially in
motion is probably the largest. We've done studies to show that globally there's $50 trillion-plus that's sitting in cash,
and I don't think anybody knows how big that can be relative to the size of the markets. So depending upon changes in
interest rates and changes in equity volatility, a lot of that money can come into motion.
So it's not only coming into areas of retirement. It's overall. And the studies that we show range anywhere from 38% to
60% of clients' portfolios are now sitting in cash. So we think that a lot of that money will start to move once people –
once we get through the election and once we get through the next decision on where interest rates are going to be.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Dan Bennett with Jefferies.
<Q - Dan Bennett>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Good morning.
<Q - Dan Bennett>: I guess just to follow up on the pricing changes, can you discuss the process of the product
selection and how we can think about your active product portfolio and potential pricing changes going forward to be
more competitive as you highlighted in the DOL world?
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: So that's a very large question. So, first of all, on the ETF side, this is a strategic investment
that we're making in the future growth of BlackRock. So where we focused and reduced our prices were in the U.S.
iShares Core ETF. And that was to meet specific demand by customers who wanted the high quality. They're long-term
holders, and a lot of them will be purchasing these either directly or through models because of what you had just
mentioned with Larry and the DOL opportunity. We want to be a leader in this segment, in the core segment. We want
to provide the clients with the best quality and value of any ETF sponsor and making sure that iShares is the clear ETF
choice for financial advisors that are looking to build their portfolios under the new fiduciary standard.
Now, when we talk about that in particular, 90% of our iShares we have not changed the price on. This is really
targeted at this specific segment that is very fee-sensitive. And as Larry mentioned in his opening remarks, we know
that people like the brand. And now price is becoming in that segment something that's very important to be included in
the models and focused on. So we responded directly to our clients in that specific segment.
When it comes to the mutual funds, we have a pretty large array of mutual funds. We have lowered the pricing in some
of our bond fund platform. We have 23 funds there. We took a look and we wanted to make sure that, especially in this

Your next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Great. Hey, how are you doing?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Good.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Great. I just wanted to circle back on DOL. Maybe the tempo of the changes that we'll be seeing
over the next couple of quarters with implementation happening largely before April. Do you sense that advisors are
ready to make these changes right now from mutual funds to ETFs, or do you think they're really still in preparation
mode in terms of both education and understanding allocation better? And maybe you can link that in with your
Aladdin for Wealth, the traction with your distribution partners, and whether you think that happens when they develop
their own rebo platforms? Thanks.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: I think everybody is still in a wait-and-see attitude, and yet behind the scenes they're
doing just an incredible amount of preparation for this. I don't think any one firm wants to get ahead of this because
they don't want to have a – they have to make serious changes to their relationships with their FAs and their clients.
They don't want to be at a competitive disadvantage with their FAs, one from another. So I think you're going to see a
lot of kabuki in which a lot of people are going to be shadow dancing until they have to come up with a strategy.
But behind the scenes, all of them are looking at many of the different possible outcomes, whether it could be a slow
transition to more, what I would say, managed portfolios or it's going to be sudden. I'm under the view that the changes
are going to be more rapid. I think most of my team believes those changes are going to be more evolutionary. And so I
think there's even a debate here at BlackRock related to how these changes are going to be. But I do believe the legal
responsibilities that each firm has under the DOL is going to probably move towards these changes.
But let me be clear. These are not our decisions. These are our distribution partners' decisions. Each firm has to do
whatever is the right strategy for them under the new rules, the new laws on behalf of their clients. And I'm sure they're
all going to be working on behalf of their clients. I'm not trying to suggest they're focusing on their own specific needs.
What we're trying to do with our scale and our platform and the ability to have a dialogue using our active and passive
strategy, but more importantly, introducing Aladdin for Wealth, we're helping our distribution platforms to focus on
what should they be doing towards their implementation in the new DOL rule.
I do believe one thing is going to be constant, though. The need for more risk tools is going to be imperative to making
sure that there's better oversight to protecting the firm, making sure they're living under the new DOL rules. I do
believe you're going to see, as you saw from Merrill and Edward Jones, more managed accounts. But in the key
questions that you asked, Brian, in the composition of the managed account, how will those portfolio allocations be?
Quite frankly, we've heard a whole array of that I do believe over a cycle is going to be a much greater utilization in the
passive strategies and ETFs than active strategies, and I think that's where it's going.
So, we believe, because of our positioning of Aladdin for Wealth, and because of our ability to work with our
distribution platforms in the utilization of beta and active strategies, we're in a very good position; and that's how we
are trying to position it.
I want to be clear. These are not our decisions. We're responding to the ecosystem changes of our distribution partners,
and we're trying to be additive. We have to be a partner with them. And what I can say is, at this time, we are in

Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi there.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Good morning.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Good morning, maybe a quick follow-up. On this front, I agree with you. I don't think anyone
has done more or has more to offer the distributors than BlackRock. But at its core, the offshoot of all this, I think, is
distribution is harder to come by. There are tighter rules around it, and distributors lose some revenues along the way,
and the likely reaction is to ask for more from their asset management partners, whether it be commissions, revenue
share, marketing support payments. So I'm curious if you agree with that comment that asset managers in general will
need to pay more to access the key distribution channels.
<A - Robert Steven Kapito>: I think that's going to be pretty obvious going forward. When you have trades like this,
everybody goes to their vendors or distributors and asks for some sort of fee concessions. So with the DOL rule,
certainly there's going to be pressure on all of the vendors and all of the expenses that people have. And so for us, I
don't think it means less distribution, I just think it means more efficient distribution, and that pricing is going to be an
issue. I expect that we as a firm are going to go to art vendors as well and expect some fee concessions.
And then also as a company, we have to watch our own expenses, and I think you've seen that over the last couple
quarters that we're making sure that we're much more efficient. And I feel very confident for our future, and this is
because of our technology we can be much more efficient than many of the asset managers out there.
So I think you're right on the mark. This is going to be very good for the clients, and we have found in the history of
BlackRock, when it's good for the clients, it's also good for us.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Let me just echo that. I think it's very important. If clients believe they have a fair
opportunity to be in the market to build a better financial future for themselves, if they believe the Department of Labor
rules gives them that security that people are working on their behalf, and they put more money to work and keep
getting moving money out of all this cash into bank deposits into the financial markets, we will be the best positioned
firm for that. So we welcome these changes. We welcome a better environment to allow our clients to feel just in fair
and being involved in the global capital markets to help their financial future.

<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Bill, we saw leading up to the October ruling about $1 trillion of money moving. I
think this has been underreported, but $1 trillion of money has moved from prime funds to government funds. This is
an incredible amount of money by one government change. This is one of the great examples where government action
can truly change an ecosystem. And so we saw this huge movement out of prime funds to government funds. We were
very well positioned to accommodate our clients on that. We saw about $60 billion in our own prime funds going into
government funds, but the key thing for us was we actually picked up a little more than 1% market share in these
events. And we had $15 billion in net inflows.
We look at the money market fund industry as a great business. Obviously, we are earning lower fees in government
funds than we did in the prime funds, and I think that's obviously a circumstance that everybody is going to be facing.
But I do believe as clients feel more comfortable and as they navigate with their risk committees the whole idea of what
is a prime fund, I think you will see money eventually move back into prime, not the whole $1 trillion. But I think as
clients understand what prime funds are and that they can pick up more return with quite a bit less risk than they ever
would have had in a prime fund because prime funds rules have changed quite considerably too, how we report our
NAV, how we report our position. So they are far less risky than they were in a 2007 and 2008 environment.
So I do believe it's going to take some time as clients become a little bit more circumspect about the difference of the
two funds. In many cases, they're going to have to go to their risk committees to get it changed because – with the fact
that there is no certainty about a dollar NAV, some clients just can't do it unless they change their rules.
We are working with many clients right now on that, helping clients understand the trade-offs. But the knee-jerk
reaction was very clear. People did not have time to focus on how to work with their risk committee in terms of getting
these changes, but I do believe over time clients will do that. We are working – once again, this is one of the great
characteristics of BlackRock. We are working with our clients and helping them assess those types of risk and the
opportunities.
But clearly, from our opinion, when you start seeing changes in central bank behavior, when you start seeing widening
credit spreads, the advantage of a prime fund versus a government fund may be quite large enough, which will
accelerate more people seeking the differences and getting the changes from their boards and risk committee boards
and being able to invest their liquidity in a client fund even without the constant dollar NAV.

Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So first, just to follow-up on
Gary's point on the price cuts and the core ETFs being long-term accretive, maybe is there a timeline or AUM threshold
that allows you to cross into that accretion level?
And then more broadly speaking, could you help us think about the profitability trade-off within BlackRock? Because
generally, most folks agree that you'll gain share in your iShares and likely fixed income business but see pressure in
active equity. So is there a growth ratio in the AUM in between that iShares business and the active equity business that
we could think about that represents a DMZ or a breakeven line? Because I'm sure it's not just about revenue growth. It
seems more complicated than that. Thanks a lot.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Sure, Brennan. So I would think it's – there's a lot going on. We've literally spent the last –
five of the first six questions were on changes that basically drive – being driven by regulatory change and a whole host
of other things in terms of the current environment.
And I think that we look at the business in its totality more broadly. We're not really looking at a product-by-product
analysis and a breakeven on a product-by-product analysis. It's really about the diversification and the breadth of the
entire platform and how all of the products fit together at the end of the day into a set of solutions for the clients. We're
constantly making decisions in the best interests of the clients, and we're trying to basically bring forth the benefits of
the platform, whether it's in its breadth, its globality, or its scale to basically drive better outcomes for clients and at the

end of the day better outcomes for our shareholders.
So while we're mindful when we talk about theoretical breakevens, which look, you can calculate those as well, you
know what the change in the fees are, and basically do the math to see how quickly we can capture the incremental
revenue. It's really much more importantly about balancing everything that the firm has to offer, a top-10 manager in
active, a top-10 manager in passive, a top-10 manager in alts [alternatives] all wrapped up with the differentiation of
Aladdin and the technology platform, really to drive a much more comprehensive set of solutions ultimately for the
clients, and to leverage the scale not only on behalf of those clients, but also on the behalf of our shareholders at the
end of the day.

Your next question is from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Michael J. Cyprys>: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to shift gears a little bit. If
you could, just talk a little bit about seed capital, how you're deploying that today versus, say, one or two years ago.
And just given some of the limited resources that you and the industry have on seed capital, I was just curious how
you're thinking about maximizing that value, and what are you prioritizing today.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: So our seed capital portfolio today is in excess of $1 billion. We continue to grow that as we
think about our commitment to invest in the business first. That's a significant part of our story, leveraging our scale
and the stability of our cash flow to invest in products that we think is going to drive, again, better outcomes for our
clients and growth in the future.
I would say that we do believe that if you look at where we're seeding money, it's basically, again, today, significantly
more in multi-assets, significantly more on fixed income, trying to be smarter around cash solutions that may basically
change in the future. Obviously, our illiquid business, which takes the form of co-invest as opposed to what we call
seed, but we're really trying to basically think two, three years down the road to try and figure out where the new
blockbuster opportunities are in a way that can really differentiate the strengths that we have. Obviously, factors, smart
beta in terms of our style advantage products and the like are also getting a lot of seed capital.
We really want to try and leverage, again, back to scale and stability. We think that we can seed in significantly larger
amounts than potentially our competitors as a function of our very stable cash flow, which is in excess of $3.5 billion a
year. And we think our ability to seed more frequently and in larger scale allows us to show greater commitment to the
product and reduce time to market in a way that allows us to leverage market opportunities significantly quicker.

Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Good morning, Michael.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Hi, good morning. Thanks, guys. Larry, we spent a decent amount of time on DOL. I
just wanted to shift over to some of the SEC proposals; we got the liquidity rule and then also in Europe, MiFID II. I
just wanted to get your updated thoughts on any I guess hurdles that you see for BlackRock and the industry. I know
some ETFs got exemptions on the liquidity rule, but just your thoughts on the liquidity rule and then also on where
MiFID II is headed.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: This is consistent – my answer is going to be consistent with everything else we see
with some of the regulatory changes. As the regulatory changes enhance clients' willingness to invest, we're a big
beneficiary of it. So we've been very supportive of the rules that have this investor protection. We had circumstances
earlier in the past few years related to liquidity and the impact of some of the mutual funds where they had to be frozen.

Obviously, it hurts the whole industry. It raises questions of uncertainty. So the SEC tried to find a solution. I think
they found a pretty good solution under the circumstances.
I also do believe we welcome the SEC's role in this. We think the SEC needs to play a larger role in helping ensure the
sanctity of the capital markets. As more and more money moves to the capital markets, the need for safety in the capital
markets only has increased. So we worked very closely with all the regulators in Europe related to MiFID and MiFID
II. And we worked very closely – let me restate it. We provided comment letters. I can't say we worked closely. That's
probably the wrong way of putting it, but we provided our input in helping the regulatory agencies to come up with a
solution.
We believe MiFID II liquidity rules, the SEC, as I said earlier, is going to lead for greater needs for risk management
tools. And clearly, if we have rules like the liquidity rule, as I said, it increases the need for risk management, which is
playing up to BlackRock's strength. We built this organization technology with all these things in mind, making sure
that we focus on the protection of our clients.
I don't think it changes that much in terms of investment management behaviors. In terms of how we invest, we have
never been on the edge of investing in illiquid products and our 40-F products or our USIT products. And so it doesn't
change our behaviors at BlackRock at all. It may change some investors' behaviors, obviously, some who were
emphasizing very illiquid buckets in their platform.
But where MiFID II is going where the liquidity risk rules are going to the SEC, these are just a work in progress. I
believe we are going to see more and more regulatory oversight of our capital markets, ensuring that we have the
proper safeguard for investors to invest. And that's critical. I can't say enough about the need to making sure we have
the proper safeguards. If we have the proper safeguards, all the money that Rob Kapito was talking about sitting on the
sidelines would be implemented.
I don't believe the people are sitting there because they're just worried about the next event. A lot of people just don't
feel like investing has been that fair to them. And by putting these rules in place, it allows more retail investors to feel
that they are protected. They have more safety and through that safety they probably will have a little more security,
which probably will lead to greater investing into the capital markets, and we'll all be benefited by it.
The details related to the SEC liquidity rules, obviously, it's a 1,000-page rule. It's going to take our lawyers and every
lawyer a long time to making sure that we understand all the intricacies of how we are going to implement it and how
we're going to manage it. It is very clear in our brief reading it means a lot more risk management needs, making sure
that you can live under these new liquidity rules day to day and abide by them. So it requires greater risk tools, which
we have. Even about a year ago, we added a lot of liquidity components to the Aladdin risk models to helping our
portfolio managers navigate this.
And then in terms of MiFID, this is going to take time working with the European regulators. This is scheduled for
2018, so we do have some time before it's implemented. And hopefully, we'll have better clarity on making sure that
we're living under these new rules. So, as I think I said earlier, all of this will lead for the asset management industry
probably a greater need for reliance on risk tools, which will lead for some of the asset managers greater expenses to
build those tools.
I think I'm losing my voice now, so I'll end it there.

Yes, please. I think our third quarter results once again highlight the benefits of our scale. It certainly benefits why you
need diversity of product. And also I think it also speaks quite loudly why you need a global platform. And I think
BlackRock has that platform of scale, diversity of products, and global nature.
I would say probably the biggest theme that I could think about in terms of the third quarter was we're seeing an impact
on the strategic investments we made in our platform over the last few years. I think it is because of those investments
we made, the investments we made from BGI's acquisition. The investments we made in the Core series in 2012. The
investments we made in our infrastructure products, our ESG products, our investments now in big data and factors,
our investment now in technology related to Aladdin for Wealth, our investment in FutureAdvisor.
I believe it all speaks loudly that we are staying ahead of the needs of our clients trying to anticipate the needs. And I
do believe we – the third quarter, when you think about how we handled this adversity of the markets that we've been
able to position ourselves quite well in this environment. I could certainly say again these investments we made, the
investments we're going to continue to make are allowing us to have a deeper broader relationship with our clients in
retail and a deeper and broader relationship with our clients institutionally.
We need to continue to stay ahead of our clients' needs or we're not going to provide the service for our clients. So
that's the paranoia that BlackRock possesses, staying in front of our clients' needs and trying to respond to our clients'
needs. And I think that is the key characteristic and the key differentiator that has positioned BlackRock so well in the
past and why I think it's going to be a key characteristic why we're still well positioned for our future.
With that, I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and your continued interest in BlackRock.
