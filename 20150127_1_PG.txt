MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call. Today's discussion will include a
number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see
a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As
required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of
references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable
information on the underlying growth trends of the business.
Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where
applicable. Adjusted free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding tax
payments for the pet care divestiture. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net
earnings adjusted for impairment charges. Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure
adjusted for certain items. Currency neutral refers to the equivalent GAAP measure excluding the impact of foreign
exchange rate changes. P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other
financial measures.
Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.

October to December was another challenging quarter from a macro standpoint with significant foreign exchange
headwinds, modest market growth and continued political and economic volatility. Against this backdrop, we were able
to deliver organic top line growth and currency neutral core earnings growth that were in line with our going in
expectations. Organic sales grew 2%. Four of five business segments, Baby, Feminine and Family Care; Grooming;
Health Care; and Fabric and Home Care reported growth versus the prior year.
Top line growth trends improved as we moved sequentially through the quarter, finishing with mid single digit organic
sales growth in December. Organic volume was in line with the prior year. Organic volume was up 1 point in
developed markets. Developing market volume was down slightly as we took pricing to offset foreign exchange
devaluation across several countries. Pricing and mix each added 1 point to sales growth.
Overall, we held or grew worldwide share on businesses representing about half of company sales and about 60% of
sales in the home U.S. market. We continue to grow share in Latin America and held share in Europe and India, Middle
East and Africa. We lost some share in Asia, principally in China and Japan. As we reported at the Analyst Meeting in
November, we are growing share on more of our category leading brands in countries where it matters most, Pampers,
Tide, Gillette and Pantene in the United States, for example. We have opportunities on other important businesses like
family care in the U.S. and in countries like China.
On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share were up 6%, in line with our expectations, keeping us on track for
double digit constant currency core earnings per share growth for the fiscal year. Virtually every currency in the world
devalued versus the dollar with the Russian ruble leading the way. While we continue to make steady progress on
strategic business and company brand and product initiatives, and continue to increase and accelerate productivity
savings, the progress has not been sufficient enough to offset FX. All in, sales were down 4% versus the prior year,
including a 5 point headwind from foreign exchange and a 1 point reduction from minor brand divestitures. Including
FX, which was a 14 percentage point drag on the quarter, core earnings per share were $1.06, down 8% versus the prior
year.
Given the magnitude of the impact, I thought it might be helpful to briefly recount how FX impacts reported results. I'll
use the example of the ruble, which depreciated 53% versus the dollar during the quarter and was down 78% for the
first half of the fiscal year. The declining ruble impacts reported earnings in three ways, for a total fiscal year hurt of
about $550 million after-tax. Here are the building blocks of how they break down.
First, transaction impacts increase the cost of non-ruble denominated inputs. We import, as an example, Gillette blades
and razors into Russia from Germany. Widening of the cross rate between the euro and the ruble increases the Russian
units' costs of razors and reduces profit. Similarly, the local cost of plastic bottles, which are denominated in euros and
imported into Russia for the production of fabric care and hair care products, have increased significantly. This
transaction cost impact affects all manufacturers, multinational and local. [ph] Food (5:21) materials or finished
products are imported from similar sources and are similarly denominated. We attempt to recover these cost increases
through pricing when local legal requirements and market realities allow it, though there is a lag between the time a
currency devalues, the costs are incurred and the pricing is taken and executed through our channels of distribution.
Second, we need to revalue transaction related foreign currency working capital balances. This includes the revaluation
of working capital balances related to transactions between P&G legal entities that operate in different currencies. To
continue the prior example, while razors produced in Germany are being transported and are moving through the
customs process into Russia, our Russian book hold a euro-denominated payable. At the end of every quarter, working
capital balances are revalued at current spot rates. Gains or losses from revaluing transactional working capital balances
typically flow through SG&A and are included in core earnings per share. The only exception is the case of a fixed
exchange rate currency that is also hyper inflationary. In this case, we need to revalue not just the foreign currency
transactional balances but also the local currency working capital balances. All of these impacts are reported in
non-core earnings. The Venezuelan bolivar is the only currency that currently fits this definition.
Third, income statements of foreign subsidiaries like Russia that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency
are translated back to U.S. dollars at new exchange rates. Just the Russian ruble transaction balance sheet revaluation
and translation impacts have been and are projected to be significant at about $150 million, $100 million and $300

million after tax respectively, for a total of, as I said earlier, $550 million after tax for the year.
Across all currencies, foreign exchange hurts totaled $450 million after tax in the December quarter, $650 million fiscal
year-to-date and are forecast to be a $1.4 billion after tax profit hurt over the course of the fiscal year. This is the most
significant fiscal year currency impact we have ever incurred.
The currencies of six countries, Russia, the Ukraine, Venezuela, Argentina, Japan, and now Switzerland, account for
over $1 billion of the $1.4 billion after tax headwind from FX. In the first five of these markets, we have larger
businesses than nearly all of our multinational competitors, and we have a large Swiss franc exposure from our
European headquarters in Geneva. In aggregate, we have more than $8.8 billion of sales in these markets, two to three
times our next largest competitor. Of the $1.4 billion hurt, about 30% is from transaction, about 20% is from balance
sheet revaluation, and the remaining 50% is from translation.
Because of these impacts, the outlook for the fiscal year will remain challenging. We have and will continue to offset as
much of this currency impact as we can through pricing and productivity cost savings. At the same time, we'll continue
to invest in our businesses, brands, product innovation and capabilities, because it's the right thing to do for the mid and
long term. We'll adjust fiscal year targets accordingly as I'll cover when we get to guidance.
Now as these FX impacts flow through the income statement, they obviously impact margins. Core gross margin was
down 20 basis points in the December quarter. Excluding foreign exchange, it was up 40 basis points. Cost savings of
approximately 190 basis points and 60 basis points of improvement from higher pricing were offset by 110 basis points
of mix, 50 points from innovation and capacity investments, and 50 basis points from commodity cost increases.
While we're beginning to benefit from lower fuel prices, which reduce transportation costs, the costs of materials such
as resin and other specialty chemicals were still higher in the December quarter than in the prior year. Pulp is also up
year-on-year. If oil stays at or around current levels, these material cost headwinds should turn to tailwinds by the
fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
Core SG&A costs as a percentage of sales increased about 30 basis points. Excluding FX, they were down 80 basis
points. 70 basis points of overhead savings and 70 basis points of marketing savings, mainly from non-media cost
efficiencies, were more than offset by 120 basis points of foreign exchange impact and 50 basis points of organizational
capability investments in R&D and sales.
Productivity savings and cost of goods sold and SG&A totaled 330 basis points, as we continue to meet or beat all of
our productivity objectives. Core operating margin was down 60 basis points versus the prior year including FX, and
was up 120 basis points excluding FX. The effective tax rate on core earnings was 22.3%, 130 basis points above last
year's rate. This keeps us on track with our fiscal year outlook of about 21%.
December quarter all-in GAAP earnings per share were $0.82, which include approximately $0.03 per share of
non-core restructuring charges and a $0.06 per share benefit from earnings of the discontinued batteries and pet care
operations. Also included is a $0.26 per share one time non-core non-cash charge, as we explained during our Analyst
Day in November, to adjust the carrying value of the battery business.
It was a strong cash quarter. We generated $3.4 billion in operating cash flow and $3 billion in adjusted free cash flow
with 95% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We returned $3.7 billion of cash to shareholders, $1.8 billion in
dividends and $1.9 billion in share repurchase. Fiscal year-to-date, we've returned $7.9 billion to shareholders, $3.6
billion in dividends and $4.3 billion in share repurchase.
In summary, second quarter organic sales and constant currency core earnings growth were in line with going in
expectations. Productivity savings continued at or ahead of plans, with constant currency growth and operating margins
well ahead of year ago, and we continued our strong track record of cash productivity and cash return to shareholders.
We are maintaining the investments necessary to support our brands and product innovations. These include continuing
strategic investments and breakthrough product innovations, like Gillette ProGlide FlexBall and our entry into the adult
incontinence category with Always Discreet, as well as investments to restore the competitive value equation of the
leading brands like Bounty and Charmin. We will strike what we believe to be the appropriate balance between short

term FX cost recovery and investment to support the mid and long term health of our business.
We will continue our efforts to focus our portfolio to lead business model and product innovation, to become ever more
productive and cost efficient and to execute with excellence. As we announced in August, we are taking a significant
strategic step forward to streamline, simplify and strengthen the company's business and brand portfolio. We will
become a simpler, more focused company of 70 to 80 category leading, competitively advantaged brands organized
into about a dozen business units and four industry-based sectors. We will compete in businesses that are structurally
attractive and that play to P&G's strengths where we can achieve sustainable advantage.
Every brand we plan to keep is strategic with the potential to grow and create value. The 70 to 80 brands are leaders in
their industries, categories or segments where brand shoppers buy, consumers use and customers support. They are
leaders in brand equity, awareness, trial, purchase and loyalty. They are leaders in product performance and product
innovation and leaders in growth and value creation. Within these brands, we will operate with more efficient brand
product line and SKU offerings, reducing SKUs 15% to 20% over the next two years.
We will create a faster growing, more profitable company that is far simpler to operate. We have been progressing this
work at a healthy pace. In November we announced plans to exit the Duracell business through a split transaction in
which we will exchange a recapitalized Duracell Company for Berkshire Hathaway's shares of P&G stock. We expect
to complete the deal in the second half of this calendar year. While we're progressing very well, those of you who have
built your fiscal 2016 models assuming a July 1 closing and related share count reduction are probably a quarter or two
too aggressive. In late December, we closed the divestiture of the European pet care business to Spectrum Brands. We
also signed and communicated a deal to divest Camay and Zest soap brands. To date, we have divested, discontinued or
consolidated 35 brands.
As we continue to strengthen our category and brand portfolio, we will focus our brand building and product
innovation support and investment against the biggest consumer and market opportunities. We are committed to be, or
become the brand and product innovation leader in the categories in which we compete. Year after year, decade after
decade, successful brand building and product innovation have grown our categories, created entirely new categories,
built our business and have been a major source of value creation. Innovation combats commoditization, stimulates
category growth and builds a cumulative advantage of our brands over time.
Our biggest business by far is baby care and the Pampers brand. Our biggest country is the United States. As first
reported last month at Analyst Day, we continue to stimulate category growth at 2% to 3% over the last year, reversing
a multi-year decline. The Pampers business model that focuses on stimulating point of market entry demand and
trade-up to mom-preferred, better performing and premium priced products like the unique Swaddlers innovation, and
better performing, better value point of entry products from Luvs, have resulted in broad and sustainable category
growth that benefits retailers, suppliers and manufacturers and has grown share for P&G. Our U.S. diaper share is now
44%, up two points versus a year ago. We've turned a 10 point share disadvantage into an eight point category
leadership advantage over the past five years.
Both Pampers and Luvs are growing share. Pampers Swaddlers share is up three points to an absolute category share of
12%. We are bringing diaper pants to market. We just introduced Pampers Premium Care Pants in Russia, where the
platform accounts for 23% of the market. Pampers Pants provide exceptional skin comfort and dryness benefits in an
underwear-like design. The Russia launch is off to a very good start, with shipments about 50% ahead of target. We'll
be bringing Pants to China this month and Latin America next quarter. Achieving fair share of the global diaper-pant
market represents up to a $2 billion growth opportunity.
Our strategy for fabric care in the U.S., our second biggest business, is having a similar positive impact for P&G and
for category growth. It begins with creating and delivering a consumer preferred mix of brands, products and values.
Nearly a year ago, we introduced a strengthened fabric care brand and product lineup that significantly broadened
consumer appeal. Essentially we offered shoppers a full range of brands and products priced from about $0.15 to $0.28
a laundry load, including broadened POD offerings, new and improved liquid detergent options and Tide Simply Clean
& Fresh, a preferred brand of product for consumers interested in value at an affordable price.

As a result, Tide and Gain have both grown market share over the past 52, 26, 13 and 4 week periods. Tide now holds a
40% share. Gain is the number two brand at a 16% share. PODS have reached an 11% share of the U.S. market and
P&G's share of that segment has grown above 80%. We are seeing the first indication of category sales stability and
even growth in recent weeks, which is good for retailers, suppliers and manufacturers. This is the first category growth
in seven years. We continue to expand PODS around the world into developed and developing markets and we expect
unit-dose detergents to reach $1.5 billion in retail sales this fiscal year.
We're following a similar strategy in the fabric conditioner category, a smaller but even faster growing core strategic
business. The business model stimulates category growth by trading more consumers into the discretionary fabric
conditioner product category via meaningful product innovation like scent beads and liquid products that deliver better
functional and sensory benefits. Beads alone will deliver $400 million in global sales this fiscal year. We continue to
grow our Downy and Lenor brands in established markets while we expand selectively into new countries where the
size of the prize and the value creation return are attractive.
P&G fabric conditioners are growing at about a 7% compound average growth rate, approaching the $3 billion in
global sales. We're growing the grooming category and P&G's share behind the Gillette FlexBall innovation. The male
razor segment is up 17% on a unit volume basis over the last six months. Gillette's razor volume share was up 7% in
the December quarter. As expected, we are beginning to see strong razor sales translate into an improved blade or
cartridge share, which was up two points in the December quarter. We're expanding FlexBall right now to Europe, the
Middle East and Africa. And we're extending this breakthrough to women with Venus Swirl, which began shipping in
the U.S. this month. Women and men are telling us that they significantly prefer these products. It looks like FlexBall
may be the biggest, most consumer obvious new shaving system innovation ever introduced by Gillette.
Our hair care business is now growing share in both the U.S. and China. Pantene has now grown shares seven months
in a row in the U.S. and Head & Shoulders is up about 0.5 points in both markets. Both brands are responding to
improved products and better brand building. These brands in this category have a full pipeline of product innovation
that will come to market this year and in the years ahead. Pantene is shipping its new product line with formulations
that work from the inside out to deliver on Pantene's promise of delivering the most beautiful, healthy hair so you
shine. Head & Shoulders new product line delivers 100% dandruff-free results and an improved in-use experience that
enables consumers to feel the product working instantly.
We are accelerating the growth of the adult incontinence category with Always Discreet. Women are not fully satisfied
with current category product offerings. One in three women over 18 years old suffers from incontinence, but only one
in nine uses an incontinence product. Always Discreet pad and pants style offerings deliver significantly better fit and
protection from Always, a brand that women trust and prefer.
We began shipments of Always Discreet in the UK in July and the U.S., Canada and France in August. In the UK, the
adult incontinence category is growing double digits, roughly 50% faster since our entry. In the U.S., the category
growth rate has more than doubled to around 9%, and our shipments are running ahead of target in both markets with
value share of over 7% in each. We are continuing the expansion of Always Discreet with launches in Germany,
Switzerland and Austria this quarter. We're committed to be the innovation leader in our categories, to drive category
growth and the growth of our businesses, and we're increasing investment where we have consumer preferred brands
and products.
In addition to innovation, productivity will continue to drive total shareholder return. The best companies in any
industry find a way to lead both innovation and productivity. We're turning productivity into a core strength at P&G,
making it a systemic, enduring value creation pillar alongside innovation. We have significantly accelerated and will
significantly exceed the $10 billion cost savings goal we set 2.5 years ago. We're driving cost of goods savings well
above the original target run rate of $1.2 billion a year, with $1.6 billion of savings this fiscal year.
We expect to improve manufacturing productivity by at least 6% again this year, reducing staffing even as we add
capacity and start up new production modules. We have begun work on what is probably the biggest supply chain
redesign in the company's history. We are transforming our distribution network in the United States, consolidating
customer shipments into fewer distribution centers. These centers are strategically located closer to key customers and

key population centers, enabling 80% of the business to be within one day of the store shelf and the shopper. All six of
the new mixing centers will be operational by the end of February, on or ahead of schedule, and we expect to complete
the conversion out of legacy locations this calendar year.
The distribution network projects will allow both P&G and our retail partners to optimize inventory levels, while still
improving service and on-shelf availability and reducing in-store out of stocks. We have established a $1 billion to $2
billion value creation target from the global supply chain reinvention effort. We are targeting to deliver $400 million to
$600 million in annual cost savings, building to this level over the next three to five years. These savings are
incremental to the $6 billion of cost of goods savings we originally communicated and are on track to exceed.
We expect additional top and bottom line benefits from improved service levels. We continue to invest strategically in
additional capacity for critical developing markets, and we continue to rationalize our manufacturing processes so that
common, simpler and more global standard making impactive platforms support accelerated product innovation at
lower cash, capital and operating costs. This enables not only better and cheaper, but also more agile, flexible and
faster.
We've reduced non-manufacturing or overhead enrollment by nearly 18%, 80% more than we initially envisioned when
we launched our restructuring program. We continue to evolve the organization design so that it is business focused,
starting with consumers and customers, and so that it is simpler and more effective, more responsive and more
efficient. We've organized around industry-based sectors. We're streamlining and de-duplicating the work of the
business units and selling operations. We've consolidated four brand building functions into one. Each of these changes
reduces complexity and each creates clear accountability for performance and results. A more focused portfolio of
brands and businesses will enable further changes. We should be close to the high end of our estimated 16% to 22%
non-manufacturing enrollment reduction range by the end of this fiscal year, more than a year ahead of plan.
We have additional opportunity to improve marketing efficiency in both media and non-media areas, while increasing
overall marketing effectiveness and the strength of our programs. We'll continue to drive marketing productivity
through an optimized mix driven by new, more efficient digital media. We have quietly strengthened and invested in all
of our digital capabilities, including mobile search and social, with a wide range of partners. More than 30% of our
working media is now digital. We have developed proprietary systems to target digital media more precisely and more
efficiently. Three of our brand communications designed specifically for digital were among the top 10 YouTube
viewings in 2014. These efficiencies are enabling us to maintain strong media weights despite the cost pressure we're
facing from foreign exchange.
We are focused on driving productivity improvement up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet.
Disciplined working capital management, strong execution of our supply chain financing program, and a scarcity
mentality in capital spending are driving strong cash flow results.
One of the productivity related questions we often hear concerns developing market margins. We are growing constant
currency earnings margins in developing markets. Constant currency earnings grew 2 times faster than sales in 2013, 4
times faster than sales in 2014, and are forecast to grow 4 times faster than sales again this year. Over those three years,
we'll have grown constant currency earnings 12%, 26% and 26% respectively.
Even with the unprecedented FX impact, we're making progress. Our margin all-in in Latin America is forecast to be
up more than 1 point this year. In the BRIC markets, Brazil and India should each be up about up 4 points, and China
should hold its industry-leading margin. Russia is forecast to be down a few points because the pricing intended to
recover the FX impacts will not be fully in place until the spring. In total though, we're forecasting developing market
margins including FX to be up about 60 basis points for the year.
The final priority area I'll touch on this morning is execution, the only strategy our consumers and customers actually
see. For many of our big brands, building trial is still a huge opportunity. For example, repurchase rates on unit dose
laundry detergents are over 50%, but trial rates are barely double digits. We have a number of programs underway to
increase trial on our brands. In several categories in many countries, we have an opportunity to improve coverage,
dedication and in-store merchandising of our brands. We're investing selectively in dedicated sales coverage of

merchandising to improve execution for shoppers in store and online. This should lead to improved distribution,
shelving, merchandising and pricing execution to consistently win at the first moment of truth. We're also continuing to
grow our e-commerce business with omni-channel and pure play e-tailers as shoppers evolve their shopping
preferences and habits.
As we look beyond the January-March quarter, we are hopeful that industry and company tailwinds will begin to
improve. Productivity should continue to grow. The benefits from portfolio strengthening and simplification should
continue to build. Pricing should help. Oil-based commodity costs should become a tailwind by the fourth quarter.
Beyond the cost benefit, lower energy prices will hopefully become a stimulant to demand in petroleum importing
countries. The world's top 15 oil importing countries, which include the U.S., China, Japan and many Western
European markets, account for nearly two-thirds of P&G's global sales and an even higher share of profits. Interest
rates should remain low and we hold out hope for a sequentially stronger economy in the United States, our largest
market.
But there will continue to be headwinds. Foreign exchange is obviously at the top of the list and has a significant short
term impact. Pricing to recover that impact taken by both P&G and other industry players is likely to result in some
market contraction and reduce consumption in several countries. Lower commodity costs will create a consumption
headwind in energy producing countries, and political instability will continue to result in some ongoing amount of
market level disruption.
In a time of unprecedented currency devaluation that impacts our company more than any other in our industry, it's
important to stay balanced. We need the balance doing what's right for the short, mid and long term. We need to
balance the focus on delivering operating cash flow in the short term and continuing to deliver good returns for
shareholders with continuing to invest in our businesses, brands, products, capabilities and people for the mid and long
term health of the company.
We are maintaining our forecast for organic sales growth of low to mid single digits for the fiscal year. We delivered
2% organic sales growth in the first half of the year and we can see a modest acceleration in the second half. Pricing
should be a larger contributor to sales growth in the second half as price increases are more fully reflected in our
results. We're seeing positive trends in big core businesses like U.S. baby care, fabric care, grooming and hair care and
we are continuing to expand several important product innovations, Pants, PODS, beads, FlexBall and Swirl, upgraded
hair care products, Always Discreet.
We're also maintaining our outlook for double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth for the fiscal
year. We expect foreign exchange to have a 12 point impact on core earnings per share growth for the year. This is
more than double what we had estimated last quarter, and more than 5 times the impact we expected at the beginning of
the fiscal year. Including FX, we now expect core earnings per share to be in line to down low single digits versus last
year core's earnings per share of $4.09. We are now forecasting all-in sales to be down 3% to 4% for the fiscal year.
This includes a 5 point drag from foreign exchange and a 1 point impact for minor brand divestitures.
We expect all-in GAAP earnings per share to be down mid teens versus the prior fiscal year. Essentially, all of the
year-to-year reduction in GAAP earnings per share is due to the $0.58 of one time non-cash battery impairments. In
total, current year GAAP earnings per share includes $0.67 per share of non-core items. In addition to impairments, the
other main items are $0.20 per share of restructuring costs and about $0.14 of gains in discontinued operations from the
combination of the Duracell and pet businesses.
We're currently forecasting 96% adjusted free cash flow productivity, above guidance of at least 90%. We're
maintaining our outlook for cash return to shareholders. We plan to return cash to share owners through dividend
payments of about $7 billion and share repurchase in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion, $10 billion to $12 billion
dollars all in.
This forecast and guidance range assumes mid-January spot rates for foreign exchange. Further significant currency
weakness including Venezuela is not anticipated within our guidance range. Our outlook is based on current market
growth rates, which we are monitoring closely, especially in markets where we are taking large price increases to offset

currency impacts. We also continue to monitor unrest in several markets in the Middle East, Russia and the Ukraine,
and we continue to closely monitor markets like Venezuela and Argentina where pricing controls, import restrictions
and access to dollars can present risk. On the flip side, our guidance does not reflect some potential tailwinds. Our
results can improve if currencies ease, if markets begin to expand in a sustainable way or if U.S. economic growth
accelerates.
There are a few things you should keep in mind as you construct your models for the second half of the year. Our
organic sales comps ease a bit in the back half of the year and we are taking significant pricing to offset foreign
exchange impacts. We expect significant top and bottom line headwinds from foreign exchange in the back half of the
year, including a large negative impact from balance sheet revaluation related to the Swiss franc in the March quarter.
There is also a quarterly translation hit to earnings as we are operationally net short the Swiss franc due to the
significant local cost structure related to our Europe and India, Middle East and Africa headquarters in Geneva.
Productivity savings will build as the year progresses and we expect sequential improvement in commodity costs as we
go through the remainder of the year.
Stepping back, we're not only investing in our brands and products, but also in critical company capabilities that will
enable much better consumer and customer responsiveness with systems that are more agile, faster, better and cheaper.
We've talked about the supply chain. The overall goal is a seamless and synchronized flow of information and product
with shoppers, customers, retailers and e-tailers. Our strategies continue to sharpen. Our category and brand business
models continue to improve. Our product innovation pipeline continues to fill. Our productivity yield continues to grow
with several more years of significant cash and cost savings ahead. We are operationalizing plans more consistently and
executing them more broadly and reliably.
We continue to invest strategically in additional capacity for critical developing markets and we continue to rationalize
our manufacturing processes so that common, simpler and more globally standard, making big packing platforms
support accelerated product innovation at lower cash capital and operating costs. We continue to evolve the
organization design so that it is business focused, starting with consumers and customers, simpler, more effective, more
responsive and more efficient. We continue to invest selectively in sales coverages and merchandising to improve
execution for shoppers in stores and online. And we continue to invest in product innovation technologies and product
initiative acceleration.
Through this transformation, we are creating a more in touch, agile, coordinated and integrated organization that puts
winning with the consumer first. We are sharpening our strategies and business models. We are operationalizing plans
and executing with more consistency and excellence. These are the choices and capabilities that will enable balanced
growth and value creation in the mid and long term, as we work our way through the currency devaluations in the short
term.
That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our
press release and will be available in slides which we posted on our website, www.pg.com following the call. With that,
I'd be happy to take questions.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson from Citi.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi, good morning. My question has to do with the sort of multiplier effect between the
currency pressure on your top line and your bottom line, because it's just so much bigger than we see at any other
company. And my question is, how much of that is going to go away? And this is sort of a long term strategic issue.
How much of that is going to go away as you get your new plants and new manufacturing facilities online in emerging
markets? Or is that just a structural thing where we're never going to have more than three razors and blades plants, and
so we are always going to see a disproportionate, significantly disproportionate impact on earnings? Thanks.

<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So, clearly as it is apparent you understand from your question the difference between the top
line and bottom line impact at FX is driven by sourcing and where product is coming, where products being
manufactured and imported to. And it also has to do with where we're disproportionately sized versus our competitors
just in terms of our business footprint. We're disproportionately impacted due to our business size and market position
in countries that have seen some of the highest levels of devaluation. In Venezuela, Russia, the Ukraine and Japan, we
have significant businesses and we estimate that in those markets, our top and bottom line impacts are more than
double our top multinational competitors. And then, we're also importing significant amount of product into markets
like Venezuela, into markets like Argentina, into markets like Russia and into Japan.
We are working, as you rightly point out, to further localize our manufacturing supply chain over time, and that should
help as we go forward. We're building roughly 20 new manufacturing facilities, all of which are in developing markets,
which are the ones that had been most impacted by foreign exchange. As we do that, and even with our existing
manufacturing platforms, we're working to localize our suppliers with us. As I mentioned in the example on the ruble,
this is both a cost in terms of importing finished product, but also importing materials. And the more that we can
localize both of those components of the supply chain, the better off we are going to be in terms of being operationally
hedged to FX.
The issue will never go away in its entirety. Again, I think you mentioned a very good example on blades and razors.
We are not going to have 180 blades and razors manufacturing facilities, but we are localizing to a greater extent even
that supply chain with significant investments we have made, for example, in Mexico. So hopefully, this will continue
to reduce as we move forward, but it is not likely to ever completely disappear.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Hey, thanks. Jon, I guess obviously FX drives a need for pricing and I think you said you're
going to be more aggressively taking pricing in the back half. But I guess the question is with crude at $45, is there a
risk that we get into a situation like 2008, 2009 where you priced more than peers and ended up losing share?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: A fair question, and that's obviously something we are going to watch very carefully. The good
news, if you want to call it that, is in markets where the most significant pricing is needed, the currency impacts far
overwhelm the energy cost impacts. So again, going back to our example of Russia with 78% currency devaluation, we
might not be able to recover all of that, and certainly we're going to have to take into account both competitive
consumer dynamics, which will reflect the commodity cost environment as well. So we'll watch that carefully. That's
also why, as I talk about the efforts to offset FX, I always mention as well productivity and cost savings. There is going
to have to be a higher component of that this time around for the reason you cite, as well as for the simple reason that
our euro and yen domiciled competitors don't have as much of a headwind as we have. So we are going to have to
approach this very deliberately, very carefully, but still I think there is a significant opportunity for pricing.

Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Yes. Good morning, thank you. I want to talk a little bit about the organic revenue growth
guidance here. And you talk about an improving trend in the second quarter. Can you talk about sort of what you're
seeing? Can you give us any sort of clue in terms of what you're seeing in the third? And then going back to I guess
looking at this -- mid single, why not just take it down to low singles, I guess, from that standpoint? Not that I think
many people are pricing in it, but seems a little overly optimistic.
And then sort of looking at Chris's question here, what's the outlook as you look at things getting better sequentially in
terms of the volume versus pricing breakdown? Is it all going to be pricing as things get better in the back half of the

year, or do you think you can get volumes improving? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So first of all, low single digit organic sales growth is, as you know, covered within our
guidance range, and we're going to have to see. There is both tailwinds and headwinds going forward here. We have
seen some pickup in the U.S. market. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, volume was up two points in developed
markets in the quarter and we have seen an increase in the market growth rate in the U.S. And if that continues, that's
obviously our biggest market and our most profitable market. That could be a real benefit to the top line.
We have several businesses where we have admittedly struggled recently, but where we believe the fix is right around
the corner. I mentioned in our prepared remarks the family care business. That's a big business for us in North America
where we have been losing share. We have adjusted pricing on that business and are starting to see both volume and
sales respond, so hopefully that picks up for us.
Another big business that I didn't mention in the prepared remarks is Mexico. If we look at sales in Mexico, we're down
almost 20% on the quarter. It constitutes almost a full point of organic sales growth. So were it not for Mexico, we
would have rounded to 3%. And the driver there is a combination of three things. There is a consumption tax increase
which was put in place January a year ago, so that's annualizing and the consumption impacts of that are annualizing.
We also took pricing to deal with a devalue in peso and we changed some of our trade terms to increase pricing
transparency in the marketplace. All of that should begin to annualize here very shortly.
So if we can continue to make progress, if we can continue the growth that we have on some of our big brands, if we
can address a few of the admitted challenges that we have – I mentioned China as another example – there is no reason
we couldn't get up into, or let's just say it this way: pick up another point of growth. And then we'll have to see what
happens as we price, as Chris mentioned and as you have rightly mentioned, to market sizes in some of these other
markets. I would say quite honestly there is more uncertainty in the top line than there has been in some time, just
because of all these variables, but there's both positive variables and variables to watch out for.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks. Good morning. I guess two things. One was just to clarify on that last point,
Jon, that when you say pick up another point of growth that you meant another point in the back half, not another point
on the full year from the 2% run rate.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Yes. Yes.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Okay, perfect. Okay, good. I didn't want to get cut off. I'm scared of the operator
cutting me off if I stop talking. The other thing was in just on the promotional environment in the U.S. Unilever's
comments were pretty direct around their sort of -- quote -- savings, be it on commodities or obviously currency
benefits being reinvested and passed back to the consumer. So was curious about your view of the promotional
environment, particularly in the U.S. And then also specifically looking at beauty, it just feels like there's – this is
anecdotal – but it feels like the year has started off in a very, very promotional way. So I was just curious about
particularly on beauty. That'd be great. Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Okay. I'm going to start way macro and I'll get down to micro including beauty. In general as
you know, promotion is the last place we'd like, in most cases, to spend a dollar. We'd rather spend it on equity or
innovation. And if you just look at the drivers of our top line growth over time, I think it bears that out. So in the
quarter we just completed, pricing inclusive of promotion was a one point benefit to the top line. It's been a benefit for
16 consecutive quarters. It's been a benefit for 10 consecutive years. So that doesn't mean that we won't have individual
product categories that are up and down at any given time, given both the trial needs of innovation we are bringing to
the market and the competitive situation, but broadly that is not our game.

Reflecting just on the U.S. market, to the first point of your question, if we look at the indices for percentage of volume
sold on promotion over the last four quarters, the indices sequentially have been a 101. This all business, not --so it's
category business, not just P&G, 101, 103, 101 and 98. So broadly, that's not indicative of an environment that's
heavily promotional. Now again, within individual product categories, of course, there are differences. And to be fair,
those figures that I just provided you don't include couponing. But they don't include couponing in the base period
either. So they are kind of free of that.
On P&G beauty, we did increase promotion a little bit, particularly on hair care behind some of the products I
mentioned that are driving share growth on Pantene and Head & Shoulders. It's very important, particularly on Pantene,
given some of the struggle that we went through prior to the last seven months, that we give opportunities to consumers
to experience and re-experience and retry our brands. So there has been some level of promotional increase, but again,
most of our spending is on equity building and innovation and will remain that way.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks, Jon. On M&A and the paring down of your portfolio, do the current
market dynamics change your thinking in any way around brands or businesses that might be up for divestiture or
harvesting, including the timing of said moves? And conversely, as you speak with potential acquirers, especially that
might be overseas, without going into specifics, have your discussions been impacted any way as the math changes for
them?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: We view the strategic move we're making on the portfolio as a long term strategic move. And
so, the impact of one year in FX, either positive or negative, doesn't dramatically change that. And in my conversations
with potential buyers, they seem to be similarly oriented. They are looking at longer periods of time.
Now, you can imagine that there are specific situations where, let's say, you have a large component of a business that
happens to be operating in Russia or the Ukraine or name a couple markets. That certainly -- I wouldn't say that it
affects buyers' strategic interests, but it affects obviously the tone of the overall conversation, as it should. But I view
that really as on the margin. On the whole, as the year's evolved and as the currency situation has worsened, honestly I
can't think of one conversation that we have been holding with potential buyers that has changed dramatically in terms
of its tone as a result of currency. So I think we're full steam ahead.

Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara, please go ahead. Your line is
open.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Sorry, I was on mute there. Jon, you highlighted the recent volume pickup in the U.S. and
it looks clearly like retail sales growth has accelerated the last couple of months in the scanner data, including through
mid-January released today. That being said, the two year averages look relatively stable, given easier comps the last
couple of months in the scanner data. So, I just want to get a sense from you on how much of the recent U.S. top line
rebound in your mind is due to a more sustainable U.S. consumer recovery. Or is it more easier comps?
And then second on pricing, can you give us a bit more granularity on how much of the FX pressure this year you think
you can eventually recover through pricing? And also, from a commodity standpoint, given it's expected to turn to a
tailwind by Q4, do you expect to get a margin windfall at some point looking out to fiscal 2016? Or do you think that
will be priced back into the marketplace? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Sorry, I'm struggling to remember all the components of this. I'm going to start from the back
and go to the front. On commodities, if oil stayed at current prices, we would expect an annualized benefit of about
$600 million before tax. That should start flowing through in the fourth quarter. If you look at the combination of our

contractual lags and our inventories, on average they are six to seven weeks, so the recent moves should start coming
through really by the very end of this quarter, but more fully in the fourth quarter. And we'll just have to see what
happens in terms of what competitors do relative to pricing.
Having the FX issues at the same time though, directionally moves us in a position of expecting more pricing rather
than less. But you're right to point it out as something that we need to watch. Historically, in FX moves like this, not
identical to this because this is one of the bigger ones we have ever seen, but historically we have been able to recover
over time about 50% to two-thirds of the impact through pricing, and then we get the balance through productivity
savings. My sense is, we are going to have to move that balance and maybe this time we'll get 40% or 50%. We'll see.
And we're going to have to depend more on productivity savings to get there. The good news is we've got a very strong
productivity program that we have visibility on for a couple of years going out. So that's how I look at pricing in
general.
On your question on the U.S. of how much of that is just better comps and how much of it is market, again, I'd just
point to the market growth rates, which are up about 0.5 points in the U.S. So at least that portion of it is due to the
market. And then I mentioned that we are holding or building share in businesses representing more than 60% of sales.
So there is an element there of share growth as well. All of that combined with the easier comps driving the data.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hi, good morning guys.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Morning, Bill.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Can you, a couple, three questions. The first is, is there a concrete turnaround plan in China?
Because it seems like it's been two or three years now with share losses in a lot of big categories, and I know you guys
understand that there is a problem there, but I haven't really heard anything sort of concretely of what you're going to
do to turn it around. And then on the divestitures, I know you said 35 brands have been sold. Can you tell us what
percentage of the 10% of sales you're done with there? And then the last one which is more technical, like how big
magnitude-wise is going to be the Swiss franc impact in the March quarter? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So again, I'll start with the last one. There should be about an 80 basis point, or excuse me, $80
million after tax balance sheet revaluation impact from the Swiss franc in the third quarter. And then we'll have the
translation issue as well. As I mentioned, we're short the franc overall, and that's just driven by the fact that we have a
very large cost base there. Our European and Eastern European, Middle East, Africa headquarters are there. And
Switzerland is a small country, so we have proportionately less volume. So that will be an impact from a balance sheet
revaluation in the third quarter and from a translation standpoint in both the third and the fourth quarters.
On China, we've built that business. We've grown about 50% over the last four years. It's now our second largest
business in both sales and profit. There are two things that we are working to improve in China. One quite frankly is the
amount of price transparency that exists in the marketplace. I think the market in general has become, over the last year
or so, last two years, a little bit too promotional in nature, which tends to happen when you have major changes in
consumption patterns. But it's created a degree of opacity in terms of consumers and customers understanding the true
value equation that exists, and we need to fix that. I think in general, the industry is working to fix that and that's why
you see some of the impacts that you see from some of the other manufacturers in terms of their results in China as
well. And I would say that we're in the fifth inning in terms of getting that squared around.
And then as I mentioned in several category discussions previously, there is just a massive opportunity in China as that
market premiumizes. If you look at that market by price tier, the premium and super premium price tiers, so the top two
price tiers now represent 50% of consumption in the market, so across competitors, and those tiers are growing at 11%.
The balance of the market is flat. And in some categories we haven't followed the consumer as quickly as we needed to
up that price ladder. That's part of the issue on Olay. We're not yet where we want to be for instance on Pampers,

though as I mentioned, a premium pant product coming to market this month will help significantly. So those are really
two of the areas generally that we're focused on, on dealing with China. But again, there's huge opportunity in that
market.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from UBS.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Yes. Hi, good morning. Jon, a question on beauty, maybe following up a little bit about your
comments there just on Olay. I guess it continues to be a work in progress with organic growth negative, despite
successes like Pantene domestically. Can you talk just a little bit more about the key initiatives there? And what is
likely to change versus stay the same given David Taylor's new appointment to that segment? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: I mentioned the progress on Pantene and the hair care portfolio broadly, which we are very
encouraged by. On Olay, we actually did fairly well in the U.S. in the last quarter. I think we were up about 3%. John
can get that number right for you afterwards, but I think that's pretty close. But we are still working in several other
parts of the world, as I mentioned, to increase the salience of the brand in terms of both the channels, the price tiers and
the product benefits that consumers are looking for in skin care products. And that's work that takes some time. I would
say we're still in the early days there. We have people working on that business who have deep experience in skin care,
have been associated historically with the better days on Olay. And so we continue to be very hopeful that that will
come around. David frankly brings a new set of eyes, which can only help, and has tremendous brand building
experience across many of our product categories. He's managed in the beauty business before. He managed our hair
care business in China when he and I were working in China together in the mid 1990s. And so that's only good.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi, RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Yes, good morning, guys. Just most of my questions were asked. But I was curious, Jon, if you
can talk about pricing analytics at P&G and over the last couple of years, if you have seen an evolution or increased
sophistication, more accuracy? Because if you go back the last couple of years on the pricing, it really led to
multi-quarter kind of string of share losses. So I'm just curious if you've kind of sharpened some of the analytics on the
pricing side. Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Yes. I mean, first thing I would say, Nik, is the primary metric that we are looking at as we
analyze pricing choices, both up and down, is value creation. And that may mean, and I don't want to overstate this,
that there may be some situations where it's right to accept some share loss to get the structural economics to an
attractive place on our brands. In terms of though knowing if value creation is the primary metric, whether we are
delivering that or not on a real time basis, we have been constantly working to improve our analytical capability. I
won't say that we are all the way to where we need to be, and I mentioned investment in capabilities, and this is one of
the area analytics in general that we are investing in.
But, simple things like our sales force being in the field, as opposed to being in the office working on brand work, will
only help in terms of understanding what's happening on a real time basis. Also as I mentioned I think in response to
John's question, we're going to be depending just as much on productivity as we are pricing to try to deal with this FX
issue. And that was not the case in the years that John mentioned. We didn't have productivity program and certainly
didn't have it at the level that we have now, so we were more dependent on pricing as a way to restore those structural
economics.
But this is obviously something that we have to stay close to, as you rightly point out, and as several others have, and
it's something we will. We will not get it right every time. We cannot predict competitive behavior. We can't
completely predict consumer behavior. And so there will be some steps forward and some steps backward, but

Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Hi, good morning everyone. My question is on beauty, particularly on prestige. It seems like
it led the decline of the GBU this quarter. And more broadly, when you talk about the portfolio, you basically said it's
structurally attractive categories that play to Proctor's strengths. And I wonder whether you would say that channels, so
as specific as prestige beauty and professional hair care, do you think that plays to Proctor's strengths or not? Thank
you.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Javier. A large part of the trend in prestige is driven by a very strong base period,
where we had a very strong innovation program. So that is primarily what's going on there. I think your question on fit
with P&G's core capabilities and strengths is a good question and an appropriate question. I'll just provide a quick
refresher on those capabilities and strengths because they do provide, along with structural attractiveness and track
record, the screens through which we look at our portfolio strategy. And those core strengths are branding, innovation,
consumer understanding, go-to-market, and benefiting where appropriate from our scale.
And I've given the example before in our pharmaceuticals business, where if you go across those capabilities, consumer
understanding, not terribly relevant; brand building advertising only legally permissible in three countries in the world;
innovation challenged just because of the model in the industry; go-to-market, grocery stores, mass merchants, doctors.
That's a clear example of a business that doesn't benefit from our core capabilities. Our job in that case becomes to find
somebody who does have those capabilities, who can create more value than we can create and then monetize some of
that value for our shareholders.
We have gotten out of businesses because of channel fit in the past. I would argue that the pet care choice was in part
related to that. There was a specialty pet channel. There was an influencer channel with both breeders and veterinarians
that we did not have broader company expertise in. So those are the kinds of things that we will be looking at as we
finalize portfolio choices.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Steib with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Good morning, Jon. My question relates to how you expect mix to impact earnings going
forward in the second half in particular. It was obviously a tailwind on the top line growth this quarter, but a drag on
gross margin. I wonder why that is and how you expect that to drive earnings going forward.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Basically, if in a scenario where we have relatively similar growth rates between developed and
developing markets, and where we have relatively similar growth rates across our product segments, so in other words
beauty grows faster than it did in the last quarter, the mix impact is not significant. In quarters where one of those two
things aren't true, so where developing markets grow disproportionately, or where our higher margin businesses like
beauty don't grow as fast as the rest of the portfolio, will have mix impact on the bottom line. And so it really comes
down to your estimation of those two drivers going forward as to what the mix impact is going to be.

Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.

about all the components of an FX impact. And in that context, I'm wondering why you're still reporting your results at

the official rate given where SICAD II is and where the parallel rate is. So can you quantify for us the move of your
Venezuela results from SICAD I to SICAD II?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: We provide all of our exposures in our disclosures because we know this is an important item
for investors. So you can get there. I haven't actually done the math, but you can. The reason that we continue to
translate our results at a combination of SICAD I, and which is 11 bolivars to 12 bolivars. And then, the 6.3 bolivar
official rate is simply because those are the rates at which we're transacting business in Venezuela. We're getting
dollars at those rates for imports of both finished product and raw materials. We're told that dividends and royalties
would be paid, for example, at the SICAD I rate. Right now as I think you may be aware, the government of Venezuela
is working through, as I understand it, modifications to the exchange regime. I don't have transparency or visibility into
that. Obviously, we'll look at that and understand really what's the rate at which we are going to be transacting business,
and that's the rate that we should be translating our results at. Importantly, I'm in no way suggesting that others will
come to different outcomes or do anything that's wrong or incorrect. It should, for them, it should reflect what rates
they are transacting business at.

Your next questions comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James.
<Q - Joe N. Altobello>: Thanks. Good morning. Just two quick ones. I guess first, how much of the pricing you've
taken so far or announced to the trade has been matched by competitors? And here I'm specifically talking about the
developed world, not developing. And then secondly, was there anything unusual in the month of December organic
growth of 5%? Because previous to that, I guess if you look at October/November, it looks like you were flat to
modestly down going into that month and I would imagine there was probably some pre-buying or pull forward ahead
of some price increases. Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Joe, broadly without going into detail because we can't do that, our pricing is going to be
centered on the developing markets. There is not a lot of developed market pricing that is planned. As a result, and
because of the timing of certain moves, it's still early days in terms of understanding both what the competitive and
what the consumer dynamic is going to be. So maybe we'll have an update for you at CAGNY, but even then it will
probably be too soon. We're in the early days there. But again, the main point is most of this we focused on developing
markets, not on developed markets.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: Thanks. Good morning. Just actually a follow-up on Bill Schmitz's question, which I'm
not sure I got the answer to. Percentage of sales that the 35 brands that you have divested or consolidated represents, of
kind of that total 10%, and whether that 10% number has actually changed as you've started to look at the portfolio a
little bit closer. And then also, with regards, I didn't really understand what you were saying in terms of the timing of
the shares coming back in a little bit later from the Duracell divestiture. So maybe can you help me understand that too?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Yes. All helpful and thanks for reminding me of the other part of Bill's question. In terms of,
you know what the Duracell sales are, you know what the pet sales are. They've all been moved to discontinued
operations and we have given you the amounts of those moves have been made. And those are the two largest, and then
there is a bunch of smaller things. So I think you can get pretty close to an estimate with a little bit of thumb in the air
on where we're at.
The number is not a static number. It does change. We have said very clearly that we intend to create value as we exit
businesses. It doesn't make any sense to exit a business if we can't create value in the process. So by definition, we
haven't made definitive choices on what goes and what stays, as we're still working to negotiate terms and see if we

can, in fact, create sufficient value in some instances. So that's not a static figure. That was a figure that was designed
to get us close.
Sorry, I'm -
<A>: Shares.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Oh, shares. Thank you. I mentioned that, as I've read several of your updates from the sell side,
we obviously haven't given you a lot of direction other than saying sometime in the second half we'll close the
transaction with Berkshire Hathaway on Duracell and retire those shares. And so I've seen a number of the estimates
understandably picking different time points, one of them being July 1. And my only point is while we are making
good progress, I don't expect that this will be complete by July 1. I do expect it will be completed in the second half of
the calendar year, but I think July 1 is aggressive as you model the retiring of those shares.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Sanford C. Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. So believe it or not, I still have a question around FX, and look, I get that you're guiding
everything organically effectively the same and you're attributing the guide down into FX alone, but I guess why is that
good enough? So why aren't we seeing things like some of your peers are doing that's more aggressive internally to
offset some of those impacts? We've talked a little bit about pricing or productivity. Doesn't seem like it's ramping up,
at least doesn't look like it yet. You certainly look like you're investing in some areas in SG&A. And I'm certainly
mindful of the word that you used earlier, balance, but what are you doing internally to pull in the belt a little bit more
given the headwinds from currency that you're facing?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Good question. First of all, I think if we step back and look at constant currency earnings
growth that we are forecasting for the year and guiding to, it's double digit. So that's not an insignificant number. And I
get asked just as frequently, and I think appropriately, if that isn't too much as I do if that isn't too little. And it all
comes back to this balance point. If you look at our competitors, I mentioned I think in response to Wendy's question,
whether we like it or not, our impacts from FX are more significant than some of our competitors, simply because of
our footprint. And obviously we have others that are, as you know, either euro or yen domiciled or have largely a U.S.
focus of their footprint. And so that even with that double digit constant currency earnings per share growth, we end up
at or slightly below year ago.
We will pull forward, not necessarily – I mean we will execute any smart cost savings program. I mentioned the fact
that we are going to be close to the top end of our range on overhead reduction by the end of this year. That's more than
a year ahead of pace, and again, it's at the top of the six point range. So we are continuing to move pretty aggressively.
But as you rightly point out, and as we have tried to communicate, we need to do that in a balanced way. We just have
so many things that present opportunity, both in the way that we operate in our long term cost structure, in delighting
consumers with some of our brands, products and technologies, that it would be the wrong answer to pull back from
those.
So we'll continue to be balanced. We will continue to be diligent and aggressive in terms of the identification of savings
opportunities. Another one for example that we have talked about, granted it doesn't happen all this year, but getting
those six mixing centers set up and operational by the end of February, that was acceleration of a project that we did
specifically to help deal with the current reality and we'll look for more opportunities like that.

<Q - Jon R. Andersen>: Thanks for taking the question. Jon, I think you mentioned earlier that the volume actually
declined in developing markets in the quarter and I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about that. Is that a
reflection of further slowing in consumption in developing markets? Or do you attribute it to this FX-related pricing
that you discussed and what your expectations are there going forward?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Jon. Quarter to quarter there was a no significant change in developing markets growth
from a market standpoint. The one exception to that, which is very difficult to sort out, is Russia, which when you look
at it, actually the growth rate increased. But I think that's in large part purchase ahead of pricing that people know are
coming. But I would say the market is not a big driver of the small volume reduction we had in developing markets.
One driver is one that you rightly point out, which is foreign exchange, where we haven't priced yet on some of the
most recent moves, like the big ruble move. We have been pricing in places like the Ukraine, Mexico, Argentina,
Brazil, Venezuela obviously, when that was legally allowed and so that is having some impact. And typically we see
that having an impact in most cases for about a 12 month period. In more significant cases like Russia, maybe a longer
period of time.
The other impact is what I indicated, which is some issues we've had in both Mexico, that was sales were down 20%.
I'm not sure what the volume was but it was significant, and in China, where we have been kind of flattish. So those are
two situations where we are working to improve. But really, markets with the exception of the unknown in Russia
pretty much holding quarter to quarter.
