The quarter was not without its challenges, including headwinds in coal and grain volumes and severe flooding in
Colorado that caused network disruptions and shipment delays. But at the end of the day, that's all part of running a
railroad. We managed our network efficiently, overcoming these challenges and continued to benefit from the strength
of our diverse franchise.
When combined with real core pricing and productivity gains, we more than offset the flat volumes to generate a new
best ever quarterly operating ratio of 64.8%. We feel very good about our accomplishments this quarter. We're
leveraging our capital investments to strengthen the UP franchise and further enhance our value proposition in the
marketplace. We remain focused on delivering safe, efficient, high quality service that generates value for our
customers and increased financial returns for our shareholders.
So with that, let's get started this morning. I'll turn it over to Eric.
Eric L. Butler
Thanks, Jack and good morning. In the third quarter, the value and diversity of our franchise allowed volume to finish
flat compared to last year, despite volume declines in three of the business groups. Industrial Products, Automotive and
Chemicals led the way with growth. Offsetting that good news were the clients in Intermodal, Ag and Coal.
Core pricing gains of 3.5%, which combined with a modest benefit from positive mix, produced a 5% improvement in
average revenue per car. The combination of flat volume and improved average revenue per car pushed freight revenue
to a record $5.2 billion.
Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue declined 2%, with third quarter volume
down 4% and a 2% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain carloadings continue to reflect the impact of last
year's drought with third quarter volume down 9%.
Domestic feed grain shipments declined, as tight U.S. corn supply led to reductions in livestock feeding and increased
reliance on local feed crops. Export feed grains also declined with improved world supply and the higher U.S. prices.
Partially offsetting these declines was an increase in wheat Gulf exports primarily destined to Brazil.
Grain products volume was up 3%, driven by the 11% in ethanol shipments, as the discounts of gasoline led refineries
to replenish low ethanol inventories. Declines in import beer and barley led to a 4% decrease in food and refrigerated
volume.
Automotive volume grew 8%, which combined with the 9% average revenue per car, produced a 17% increase in
revenue. Growth rates in auto production and sales remain strong in the third quarter, driven by pent-up demand to
replace aging vehicles. Even so, the average age of vehicles on the road continue to increase, reaching 11.4 years; with
customers replacing them with new models offering improved technology and fuel efficiency.
UP finished vehicle shipments grew 5% as sales continue to grow with seasonally-adjusted annual sales rate reaching
15.7 million in the third quarter, the highest quarterly level in five years. Parts volume increased 12% while pricing
gains in the previously announced Pacer network logistics management arrangement increased average revenue per car.
Turning now to Coal, you could see from the chart that weekly carloadings and volumes picked up from the second
quarter as expected, but tracked 7% below last year. Core pricing gains and favorable mix led to a 10% improvement in
average revenue per car and produced a 2% increase in revenue. Tonnage from the Southern Powder River Basin
decreased 8% as mild summer weather led to a 3% reduction in year-over-year electricity generation in UP-served
territories.
Also contributing to the decline was the continued impact of a contract loss from the beginning of the year.
Colorado/Utah tonnage declined 17% as soft domestic demand and mine production issues offset growth in West Coast
exports. Also hampering loadings in the third quarter was the September Colorado floods. Providing some good news,
tonnage from other coal-producing regions increased 19% from a relatively small base, driven by gains from Southern
Wyoming and Illinois loadings.

Before we move on, note the slide shows the steep decline early in the fourth quarter as volumes were impacted by
nearly three feet of unseasonably early snow in the Powder River Basin during the first week in October. This has
impacted volumes through the first half of the month, but we expect the majority of shipments to be made throughout
the remainder of the fourth quarter.
In Industrial Products, a 9% increase in volume and a 2% improvement in average revenue per car, despite unfavorable
mix, produced revenue growth of 11%. Non-metallic minerals volume was up 21% as continued growth in
shale-related drilling increased frac sand shipments by 27%. Our construction-related volumes grew 11%, driven by the
11% improvement in rock shipments with increased construction activity, mostly in the Texas and California markets,
which also contributed to 12% growth in cement volume.
Metals volume was up 8% as pipeline projects picked up following a slow start to the year. We also saw an increase in
export iron ore shipments, with the resolution of mine production issues that limited shipments last year. Growth in
housing and home improvements continued to increase the demand for lumber with shipments up 6%. Although the
housing market continued to strengthen, lumber's growth eased early in the third quarter as falling lumber prices and
excess inventory slowed lumber shipments.
Offsetting some of the strength in other industrial products market was a 4% decline in government and waste volume.
As in previous quarters, reduced government funding limited military shipments and delays in extending the Federal
Production Tax Credit led to a decline in win moves.
Intermodal revenue was flat, as a 2% increase in average revenue per unit offset a 1% decline in volume. With the
economic recovery continuing its slow pace, retailers proceeded cautiously in the third quarter. Our international
intermodal volumes declined 5% due to market share shifts within the ocean carrier industry and increased port
transloading activity. Continued success converting highway business to rail drove 4% growth in domestic intermodal.
Chemicals revenue grew 5%, reflecting the 3% increase in volume and the 2% increase in average revenue per car.
Industrial Chemicals volume was up 9%, driven by strength in end user markets such as housing and automotive.
Increased demand in new business led to a 10% increase in petroleum products volume. Dampening the good news was
a 5% decline in crude oil volume compared to the third quarter of last year, although crude oil shipments in St. James,
Louisiana continued to grow compared to 2012.
Before we move on to our outlook for the fourth quarter, I'd like to give a brief update on our Crude-By-Rail business
which accounts for about 40% of our shale-related volume and about 2% of our overall volume.
As we've said, we've been expecting our 2013 crude oil volumes to increase at a moderate pace year over year, though
not with the dramatic ramp-up seen in the year before; particularly, given the lack of significant destination capacity
expansion this year.
As you can see in the blue portion of the bar chart, so far this year, we've seen the benefit of very steady demand into
St. James, Louisiana, which continues to be a premier rail destination. Additional opportunities have come from other
areas, such as West Texas and Oklahoma and these volumes, in particular, have been somewhat more volatile as the
domestic crude oil market continues to evolve and reflect the dynamics inherent in the commodity marketplace.
As you know, pricing spreads are one of the influences on traffic flows, as producers look to maximize netbacks. With
the narrowing of the WTI discount to Brent, we've seen a resulting volume decrease into areas with readily available
pipeline access, primarily Texas and Oklahoma, which also have been impacted by increased pipeline capacity.
We've also seen a smaller decline in shipments from the Bakken to Texas, as tighter spreads have made it more
attractive to ship Bakken crude oil to the East, where new facilities have increased Crude-By-Rail capacity. Going
forward, we expect the economics of crude oil spreads to continue to be a driver of traffic flows, particularly in areas
such as Texas. Other markets such as Canadian crude should provide new opportunities as Crude-By-Rail continues to
evolve. Meanwhile, our franchise strength in the South will continue to provide a solid foundation to our business,
giving customers attractive access to important Gulf destinations.

While crude oil volumes will always be subject to the ups and downs of market spreads, we believe the long-term
fundamentals of Crude-By-Rail remain attractive. Increasing crude production, limited pipeline infrastructure and the
flexibility rail provides will enable us to leverage our value proposition and develop new opportunities ahead.
Let me close with what we see for the fourth quarter. Our current outlook is for the economy to continue its slow
improvement, although there is uncertainty in the marketplace. No matter what the economy does, we'll continue to
focus on strengthening our value proposition, attracting new customers and supporting our existing customers as they
work to grow their business.
Given that, here's what we see across our business for the next few months, both the challenges and the opportunities.
With the effects of last year's drought behind us, an improved full harvest is expected to provide opportunity for Ag
growth.
Global Insight raised their full-year light vehicle sales estimate to 15.5 million vehicles, which is good news for our
automotive business. Crude oil spreads will continue to impact our Crude-By-Rail volumes, but strength in other
chemicals markets is expected to drive solid performance we've seen throughout the year.
With the challenges previously mentioned in our Coal business, we now expect full-year volumes to be down in the
high single-digit range, which includes the loss contract of about 5% of our Coal volumes. Industrial products should
continue to benefit from shale-related growth, with increased drilling activity that supports frac sand and pipeline
projects. An improving housing market is expected to drive demand for lumber shipments. And growth in construction
is expected to support increases in rock, metals and other related markets. International Intermodal volume is expected
to be down slightly compared to last year, while highway conversions will continue to drive domestic intermodal
growth.
For the full year, our strong value proposition and diverse franchise will again support business development
opportunities across the broad portfolio of business. Assuming the economy does not slow down, we're well on track to
deliver profitable revenue growth again this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.
Lance M. Fritz
Thank you, Eric. Good morning. Starting with safety, year-to-date results nearly matched our 2012 record results on the
strength of a record low third quarter reportable personal injury rate. I expect our total safety culture, risk identification
and mitigation process and robust training programs to drive continued improvement as we go forward.
Our ultimate focus is making sure every one of our 50,000 employees returns home safely at the end of each day. Rail
equipment incidents or derailments improved 3% year to date versus 2012. This is a direct reflection of the investments
we've made to harden our infrastructure and to leverage advanced defect detection technology, which combined have
reduced track and equipment-induced derailments. We're also making progress on human factor incidents through
enhanced skills training and root cause resolutions.
Moving to public safety, our year-to-date grade crossing incident rate improved 7% versus 2012, reflecting our
continued focus on improving our closing high-risk crossings and reinforcing public awareness. We achieved
year-over-year improvement in five of the last six months, including a record third quarter rate. Our focus on grade
crossing risk in the south has generated an 18% year-to-date improvement in that region.
Our safety strategy helps keep our network strong and resilient and as a result, our network remains fluid and is
operating at very efficient levels. Velocity in the third quarter improved 1% compared to 2012 and improved 2%
sequentially from the second quarter. Despite flooding that severed numerous corridors in Colorado, we rerouted traffic
and developed contingency plans during the event to support our affected customers and rapidly restored service on the
lines that were washed out.
Our agility in the face of these outages prevented any year-over-year deterioration in our Service Delivery Index. The
measure, which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments improved sequentially from the

second quarter would have improved year over year if not for tighter service commitments to our customers. We
continue to provide outstanding local service to our customers with the best ever 96% industry spot and pull, which
measures the delivery or pulling of a car to or from a customer.
Infrastructure investments and process efficiencies have improved our ability to recover after incidents, reducing their
impact on the network. We continue to invest in capacity across our network, most notably in the South, where
volumes are growing across our diverse portfolio. Overall, our network remains well-positioned to handle volume
growth.
Moving on to network productivity, slow order miles declined 38% to a best ever third quarter level. As a result, our
network is in excellent shape, reflecting investment in replacement capital that hardened our infrastructure and reduced
service failures. We continue to identify and realize efficiencies that contributed to our record 64.8% operating ratio
this quarter.
Locomotive productivity as defined by gross ton miles per horsepower day improved 1%. Network planning and
improved locomotive reliability drove this improvement in spite of a 2.5 to 3 percentage point headwind associated
with the mix shift from lower pull shipments and higher manifest shipments. During the quarter, we continued to
reposition resources to align with the traffic mix trend of growing southern region and manifest volumes, which require
additional manpower versus the average of the network.
The chart on the lower right demonstrates our ability to reduce growing manifest volumes through UP's extensive
terminal infrastructure. We switched 1.5% more cars while keeping yard and local employee days flat. This resulted in
an all-time quarterly record in terminal productivity. The improvement was particularly evident in our Southern region
where cars switched per employee day was up 3%. These results reflect employee engagement which is an important
part of our operating strategy. Our employees are bringing their expertise to bear on improving safety, service and
efficiency by standardizing work and reducing variability.
To recap, our operating performance in the third quarter was solid, improving nicely from second quarter levels. We
remain vigilant in our commitment to operate a safer and more efficient railroad for the benefit of our employees,
customers, the public and shareholders. We've demonstrated the ability to successfully flex network resources in
response to dynamic market shifts and unexpected events, including weather.
As I touched on last quarter, we've successfully completed a number of significant capital track programs both on the
replacement and capacity side. Overall, these projects were completed with minimal network disruptions and resulted
in measurable enhancements to our franchise. We will continue to make smart capital investments that generate
attractive returns and that keep the network fluid and safe. With strong network fundamentals, we are well positioned
for future growth while enhancing UP's value proposition.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Rob?
Robert M. Knight
Thanks, Lance and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue grew 4% to an
all-time quarterly record of nearly $5.6 billion, driven mainly by solid core pricing gains. Operating expense totaled
$3.6 billion, increasing 1.5%. Operating income grew 10% to $1.96 billion also hitting a best ever quarterly mark.
Below the line, other income totaled $28 million, basically flat with 2012. For the full year, we would expect other
income to be in the $110 million to $120 million range, barring any unusual adjustments. Interest expense of $138
million was up 1% from last year.
However, it includes about $7 million of net, one-time costs associated with our recent debt exchange. Income tax
expense increased to $701 million, driven by higher pre-tax earnings. Net income grew 10% versus 2012, while the
outstanding share balance declined 2% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to
produce a best ever quarterly earnings of $2.48 per share, up 13% versus 2012.

Turning to our top line, freight revenue grew 4.6% to more than $5.2 billion, driven by solid core pricing gains of 3.5%
and favorable mix of a little more than 1 point. A decline in lower average revenue per car intermodal shipments,
combined with freight revenue impact from the Pacer arrangement drove the positive mix. But these items were
partially offset by double-digit growth in rock shipments, which typically move less than 200 miles and a decline in
longer haul grain moves.
Moving on to the expense side, slide 21 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense which was up
1% compared to 2012. Inflationary pressures and higher training costs drove the increase, largely offset by productivity
gains. Work force levels increased 1% in the quarter, about half of the increase was driven by more individuals in the
training pipeline and the other half was due to capital projects, including positive train control activity.
When you think ahead to the fourth quarter, remember that we saw the benefit of a one-time $20 million payroll tax
refund that is reflected in last year's fourth quarter comp and benefits expense. Turning to the next slide, fuel expense
totaled $866 million, decreasing 2% versus 2012, primarily driven by lower average diesel fuel price. In addition, gross
ton miles declined 2% due to lower coal and grain shipments. This mix impact also contributed to the 1% increase in
our fuel consumption rate compared to 2012.
Moving on to our other expense categories, purchase, services and materials expense increased 8% to $588 million due
to higher locomotive and freight car contract repair expenses and joint facility maintenance expense. And we're
incurring logistics management fees associated with the 2012 Pacer agreement, which are recouped in our automotive
freight revenue line. Depreciation expense was $447 million, basically flat compared to last year. The impact of
increased capital spending in recent years was offset by a new equipment rate study that went into effect at the
beginning of this year.
Looking at the full year, we expect depreciation to be up about 1% versus 2012, slightly lower than our previous
projections. However, for 2014, full-year depreciation expense should increase at a more normalized rate, more likely
in the 5% to 7% range.
Slide 24 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $309 million,
up 3% compared to 2012. Increased container expenses associated with the Pacer contract and growth in automotive
shipments drove higher freight car rental expense. Other expenses came in at $205 million, up $5 million versus last
year. Higher property taxes and freight damage costs drove expenses up compared to 2012. A moderate reduction in
personal injury expense and effective cost control measures, partially offset these increases. For the fourth quarter, we
would expect the other expense line to be more in the neighborhood of $215 million, excluding any unusual items.
Turning to our operating ratio performance, we achieved an all-time best operating ratio of 64.8% this quarter,
improving 1.8 points compared to last year. Our performance highlights the positive impact of solid core pricing gains
and network efficiencies, despite flat volumes.
Through the first nine months of this year, we generated an operating ratio of 66.5%, improving 1.5 points from 2012,
clearly illustrating the strength and value proposition of the Union Pacific franchise. Union Pacific's record year-to-date
earnings drove strong cash from operations of nearly $4.9 billion up 12% compared to 2012. Free cash flow of $1.3
billion reflects the growing profitability of the franchise and includes a 13% accretion in cash dividend payments
versus 2012.
Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting our investment grade credit rating. At quarter end, our adjusted debt to
cap ratio was roughly 39%, which includes the impact of adding over $450 million to our balance sheet debt since year
end 2012.
Opportunistic share re-purchases continue to play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation. In the
third quarter, we bought back nearly 3.7 million shares totaling $575 million. Year-to-date, we've purchased more than
9.6 million shares totaling over $1.4 billion, already matching our full-year spend from last career. Looking ahead, we
have around 5.4 million shares remaining under our current authorization program which expires March 31, 2014.

So that's a recap of our third quarter results. As we move through the rest of the year, we're mindful of the economic
uncertainty in the marketplace. For the fourth quarter, we expect to see modest volume growth, mainly driven by
improved grain shipments. Assuming the economy doesn't slow down for the rest of the year, we would also expect to
see continued growth in other market sectors. Given flat volumes in the third quarter, it's unlikely that our full-year
volumes will be positive, even with our modest growth assumptions in the fourth quarter. However, we will have to see
how the rest of the year plays out. In addition, we should see solid core pricing gains, roughly similar to the third
quarter results. All in, the fourth quarter should round out another record financial year for Union Pacific.
Now let's take a preliminary look at next year, realizing that it's still very early. From where we sit today, we're
expecting modest volume growth, if the economy continues along a slow growth trajectory. We think there will be
some markets that will be stronger than others. We should see strength in grain shipments and if the economy holds,
there should be positive growth in other business sectors. Mexico-related traffic should also generate volume gains for
us next year.
Our Coal business is a little more difficult to predict, but we can tell you that we retained and renewed roughly 50% of
next year's $100 million legacy business. The lost legacy business, which is currently not moving at re-investable levels
will create about a 2% headwind on our Coal volumes in 2014. But as always, weather and the economy will be the
driving factors for our Coal business next year.
Although 2014 is a legacy light year, we'll continue to generate real core pricing gains. However, we don't expect to
match 2013's levels, which as you know, include about 1.5 point of legacy replacing that won't repeat next year. In
addition, inflation-related escalators are expected to be lower next year including those used to calculate the A-lift cost
escalator.
At the end of the day, our fundamental strategy and focus on pricing for returns has not changed. While we won't see a
legacy benefit next year and inflation escalators are expected to be modestly lower, pricing on the rest of our business
in 2014 remains strong. When you add it all up, we expect to achieve core pricing above inflation next year.
Overall, we're forecasting another record financial year in 2014, if the economy cooperates. In addition to our pricing
initiatives, ongoing productivity gains and volume leverage opportunities should help drive continued margin
improvement. We feel very good about our outlook going forward. The fundamentals are strong, supported by a diverse
franchise that allows to us pursue new, attractive market opportunities. We'll continue to move the ball forward
focusing on improved returns to support capital investments that will strengthen and enhance our network, create value
for our customers and drive increased returns for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it back to Jack.
John J. Koraleski
Okay. Thanks, Rob. So as Eric mentioned, we had a bit of a tough start here to the fourth quarter with the early blizzard
slowing coal volumes of the Powder River Basin. But the good news is there's still a lot of quarter ahead of us as we
did in the third quarter, we'll manage through the obstacles to ensure our customer commitments are met and our
network is protected.
More broadly, we continue to monitor the economic landscape and the ongoing saga in Washington, but supported by
our diverse franchise, we remain agile and well-positioned for economic recovery.
The 50,000 men and women of Union Pacific stand ready to leverage the opportunities while navigating through the
challenges. We'll continue focusing on re-investable pricing, attracting new, profitable growth opportunities and
running a safe, efficient and reliable network that generates greater value for both our customers and shareholders
going forward.
So with that, let's open up the line for questions.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan. Please proceed where your question.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Hi, yeah, good morning.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Good morning, Tom.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Hi, Jack. I wanted to kind of – I guess a broad framework that seems to be shaping up
for 2014 is that there are pretty good reasons to think that your volume growth may be a bit stronger. Obviously, grain,
maybe coal is less of a headwind, hopefully the economy, but you're going to get the slower pace of pricing gains, less
legacy contract. So how would you frame the results of that in terms of margin improvement? Do you end up with a
kind of a similar framework for margin expansion opportunity? Is it more challenging if it's kind of more volume and
less price? How did you think about margin opportunity in 2014?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, Tom, I think overall, we're in a good position. We've not varied at all from our
guidance that says we're going to get to an operating ratio sub-65%. So it will be a little more difficult. I'll let Rob give
you some technicolor here.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: So I would just add to Jack's point. It's moving the ball forward. As you know, volume is
always our friend because we're able to leverage that from a productivity standpoint. But you're right, without the
benefit of the legacy re-pricing, we expect to continue to move the ball forward. And that's going to be continued focus
on providing good service, leveraging volume where we can to squeeze out additional productivity initiatives and
continue to fairly price the business. You add all that up, we continue – expect to continue to make progress on our
overall margins.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay, great. And then a follow-up on coal, I know it's probably really challenging to
have much visibility on coal. But are there any, I guess, parameters that we should consider, that you would consider?
Stockpile levels, any activity you're seeing in the East, plants shutdowns? How would you put things to together in
terms of, is it more likely your coal tonnage is up in 2014 or more realistic to expect it down? Just a little more detail on
framing coal, if you can?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure, you know, I think overall, Tom, if you look at energy and the Coal business, the two
biggest factors are always going to be energy consumption, how much electricity is generated and what the weather is
going to be like. We've seen the stockpile levels on a national basis come down a bit. But you always have to be careful
because even within that mix of business, you have some that are a little higher, some that are a little lower.
Eric, do you want to put some technicolor around that?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I think that's exactly right. Stockpiles have come down. They're about 20 days below where they
were last year. And actually, a couple of days below what would be considered historical norms. And what Jack said is
exactly correct. Factors are what's electrical consumption, generation, what's weather. Those are always going to be the
key factors.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. Thanks for the time.

<Q - Allison Landry>: Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on Tom's question a little bit, but more with regard to
rail inflation in 2014. So if we're assuming this year inflation was around 2.5% to 3%, is it fair to think about next year

being, you know, closer to 2% to 2.5%?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. Allison, we would, at this point in time, and of course, things can change, we would
expect that inflation looks like it's going to be more around, all in, 2%-ish.
<Q - Allison Landry>: 2%-ish. Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up question on the Crude-By-Rail and looking
towards next year, without getting too granular, I was wondering if you can maybe comment on some volume growth
that you see that is less spread dependent and also within the context of new origination terminals that you have coming
on line in the Niobrara and some new destination terminals in Louisiana and Texas that are UP-served?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. Eric, do you want to do the rundown on what we're looking at for 2014?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. So we still believe we will see moderate growth in 2014. As we indicated in our
comments, it's dependent upon a lot of market dynamics, including the spreads, the timing of additional capacity,
production levels, overall demand. We're still very optimistic as we look at destination opportunities in California.
Those destinations are still coming on line. Some of them have long lead times just getting through the normal
construction process that you typically go through in that region of the country. But again, kind of the normal vagaries
of market dynamics will drive kind of what happens next year.
<Q - Allison Landry>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Morning, guys.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Good morning. I want to just follow up on, Rob, your comment around pricing for next year.
And understanding its legacy-light, but when we think about 3.5% pricing that you got in the third quarter, how much
legacy do you think in third quarter, you actually got because I'm guessing with coal, that was down, you didn't get a
full point and a half from that. I just want to get maybe kind of what the base is tracking right now, ex-legacy. And
then, maybe if you can give any color on how you think mix could help or hurt next year with grain coming back and
maybe some of the other moving parts when we think about overall yields next year.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Scott. In the third quarter, our reported 3.5% price, included call it roughly a point
and a half of legacy. But to your point, the 3.5% did not include probably less than half a point of coal re-priced
business because the coal didn't move. So kind of do the math on that. As you look forward in 2014, yes, it's a
legacy-light year and yes, mix will play a part. I mean, if the volume of business that we've re-priced, whether it be in
coal or grain, and if it happens to move before we laps the renewal of a contract, then we should see the benefit of the
price on our price calculation.
But as I always point out, if the business moves after we've lapped the re-pricing, while it may not show up in our core
pricing number that we report, it will show up in our margin. So it's a net benefit to us, clearly. So I guess I would just
summarize by saying that we head into 2014 as optimistic as ever on our ability to price, but we just won't have that
benefit of that, call it 1.5% legacy charge.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just another question for you, Rob, on the balance sheet. So
you mentioned that we're going to need to reauthorize share re-purchase next year. If I look, you guys are about a full
turn less of leverage than most of the other rails and your returns are better than average for sure. Do you think that
there's an opportunity now that we're through legacy and we need some other parts to the story that – is there an
opportunity to more aggressively take on some leverage and more aggressively buy back stock?

<A - Robert M. Knight>: Scott, as you know, we always take a balanced approach and as I've said many times, we're
comfortable in the range we are right now in our net debt to cap ratio, as to how we manage the business, but that's kind
of a guiding light. So we always take a look at it. But that has served us well to be in that range. And in terms of, will
we look at more or less, we will continue to be – hope to be continually optimistic in terms of our share re-purchase.
We did this year, as you know, buy at a higher rate of share buyback this year than we did last year. So we have been
ramping that up. And I think that speaks to sort of our thought process.

Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. If I can hit Eric up, I guess, a bit on Intermodal. Looking at
domestic, is this the kind of run rate here, the low single digits on the domestic side on the highway adoptions. And
then internationally, you noted some losses. When do you grandfather that and should we see growth going forward in
the fourth quarter into next year, when do you start looking at kind of the environment on the international side as well?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Let me start with the international. The international, what I mentioned was some market share
shifts among the steamship carriers. And so as you know, there's excess steamship capacity and there's natural shifts
that are going on amongst them. And as the bid season happens every year, those shifts will happen in the steamship
arena outside of the rail arena. In terms of the domestic Intermodal side, 4%, we're proud of, but we think there's
upside. We think there's still a large over-the-road truck market out there for us to convert. We think we have the right
products. We have the right strategies. We're investing in our franchise. We've talked publicly about our new facility
outside of El Paso, Texas that will be coming on line next year. We think that that will help us penetrate significantly,
the Maquiladora market there around El Paso and also allow us to put some new products and services in place. So we
are excited about the upside for continued domestic, over-the-road conversions.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great and if I could just get a follow-up, I guess with Rob on the productivity side. As you
look toward maybe a little bit less coming from yields and maybe more of that improvement coming from productivity,
do you still see accelerating opportunities to continue to gain on the productivity side? How do you look at that
opportunity?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. I mean, you know, Ken, we never run out of opportunities to squeeze out
productivity. And Lance and his team are continually looking at the mix shifts that take place in the business. And we
challenge ourselves and you've heard me say this many times, to offset 100% of inflation with productivity, if we get
half, offset half of inflation with productivity, we're doing pretty well. And our track record has spoken very strongly, I
think, in doing so, even without the benefit of volume. So if we get positive volumes that certainly will help. So you
know, we'll continue to look for every opportunity we can.

for you guys, how your average book is structured right now with your customers and kind of what the pace of contract
renewal is going to look like on a go-forward basis and how we should expect that that gets attacked. So as I look out

<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Hey, Justin, I'm not sure quite what you're asking. We talked historically in the past that at any
one given time, about 70% of our contracts, or our pricings are locked in for the next year. As we go into the future,
there's a natural evolution of pace of things that come up. You go through different markets and we're, as Rob said and
I think as Jack said, we're continuing to be excited about the value of our franchise and the value proposition that we
sell and ability to get price as we go forward.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: But as we – Eric, I think what he's talking about is and Justin chime in here, buddy, about
40% typically, 40% to 45% of our business is tied up in multi-year contracts that in our current world, three to five
years is probably the timeframe of those. About a third of the business or 30% is tied up in one-year like letter quotes
and deals and the other 30% is roughly tariff that we have 20 days' notice in terms of changing price. At any one point
in time, we have our business constantly being evaluated and looking for market opportunities where we can take
advantage of price increases.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: That was exactly what I was looking to get at. So thanks for the clarification, Jack. And as
I think about the guidance here looking out to 2017, I was just, Rob, wanting to get an idea, obviously, volume's been
more challenged in the near term because of coal. But as I look out from 2015 and beyond, there's some expected
positives on the chem side of your business, specifically on petrochem, I would think. So wanted to get a sense, as you
guys think about mix within that long-term guidance, what type of volume CAGR you think you need to have,
cognizant of what we just talked about in terms of the pace of pricing going forward and that being more of kind of an
inflation plus as opposed to having that bump from the point and a half of legacy that we're seeing right now?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. Justin, this is Rob. The guidance just as we said, the guidance on the operating ratio is
to by full year 2017 to achieve a sub full year 65% operating ratio. And volume is our friend and when we give that sort
of guidance, we're assuming that the economy will cooperate and that volumes will be on the positive side of the
ledger, if you will. But we know that we can't predict precisely exactly what the mix is going to look like. So we're
going to have to deal with the hand that the economy plays us between now and then and we're confident that if the
economy cooperates that the mix will enable us to achieve that target.
But as I've said all along, each measure, each metric we've given as we've been working down from the mid-80s
operating ratio years ago, we're going to get there as soon as we can, as efficiently as we can. We're not going to stop,
so the sub-65% is not an end game. It's just the next rung on the ladder if you will, and we'll get there as efficiently
leveraging volume if we can, leveraging productivity and leveraging strong price.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: So seeing volume growth that's sub-GDP right now across your franchise and still being
able to leverage that into margin improvement, which is something you guys have been able to do, do you think you
can do even as we start to see more legacy wear off?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yes.

<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Thank you. Good morning. Just maybe following up on the longer term OR guidance as
you think out, I think you have a few years now left to hit a target which is a few hundred or a couple hundred basis
points away from sort of the run rate that you're at right now. So when you think about the setup, is there anything that
we should be thinking about, absent mix, that would be preventing kind of the continued progress that you've been
making steadily over the last couple of years? Obviously, legacy comes into all that, but I just want to make sure from
an operational perspective or any other challenges we may need to think about, strikes me as being a bit on the
conservative side which is good but I just kind of want to get a sense if there's something I'm missing in there on that

guidance.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: I think overall, Chris, when you look at it, we look at it from the perspective that we're going
to achieve those goals. We're going to achieve them despite whatever hand we're dealt in terms of the economic
activity. That's the commitment we're making, but you can never say never in terms of what happens if you have
another 2008, what happens if the Washington situation melts down and consumer confidence wanes and we kind of do
a double dip here. We're not looking forward to that. But I think the thing that you can feel good about is if you go back
and you look at our results and you look at our track record, when those things happen, we marshal very effectively.
We deal with it and we move on.
So I don't know – Rob, do you have any other kind of like big, one-time things or things...I mean, we've got
productivity gains that we're absolutely focused on, Lance and his team. Rob always uses the term squeeze. I actually
think of it more positively than just a squeeze. We have a lot of people working hard to do things better, to drive
bottom line results and you see that reflected in our 64.8% operating ratio. Eric and his team are very effectively
deploying business development strategies and taking advantage of price opportunities in the markets where we have
the opportunity to go above and beyond what would be considered inflationary and that's good for us. So everybody's
kind of focused on that. Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: You're exactly right. Now clearly, going from mid-80s to a mid-60s rate of improvement is
one slope. Going from where we are today to sub-65%, the slope of the line is different but the tenets of how we get
there are unchanged.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Sure. Sure. That makes sense. That's helpful. And then when you think about the capital
spending side of it, in context of that target and sort of the slope of the line, as you say, over the course of the next
couple of years, I think you updated us with guidance last year around this time for how we should be thinking about
CapEx. Anything you need to change as you think about that, as you're further into that? Obviously, PTC is still in the
picture and probably will be for at least a few years to come, but just kind of curious your thoughts around that, for
2014 and beyond.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: We're watching our capital spending very closely. We had reduced our 17% to 18% to 16%
to 17%. Clearly, that implies we're going to see some volume growth. If we don't see the volume growth, we'll be
paring back capital. We'll be making the right decisions from a return perspective as we see the needs across our
network. PTC is still in there. At some point in time, we may or may not change those numbers. But at least right now,
we're comfortable with the 16% to 17% kind of number we put out there last year.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Great. Thanks very much, guys. I appreciate it.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yeah, good morning, everyone. I want to come back to the pricing discussion. In
the past, you guys have been pretty successful at getting rates up to re-investable levels. Is there any way to quantify for
us today what percentage of the business or in broad strokes, that remains at un-investable rates that has a lot of pricing
upside in the future?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Hey Rob, why don't you take a shot at that?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Brandon, I know what you're asking and it's not just a number we provide. Other than to say
that we're confident across our entire book of business, there are opportunities for us to price to market and make sure
that we are at the re-investable level. So you know, it's as detailed as we get on that.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Okay. And maybe a follow-up for Eric, when we look at grain dynamics heading
into 2014, what's the mix looking like right now from a domestic grain perspective or an export perspective or even
ethanol and how is that going to impact mix and revenue and volume for you going forward?

<A - Eric L. Butler>: So as you know with the drought and high U.S. corn prices, U.S. grain on the world markets
really took a hit, just because we were a high price relative to what the other prices were in other growing markets
around the world. It looks as if, and as you know, the USDA websites have been down for the last several weeks, but
the last public report looks as if this would be a near record year for corn production. And so I think that will make U.S.
exports, corn, on the bean side and even wheat exports more competitive on world markets. I think you should see
some growth in export opportunities vis-à-vis this year should go into next year.

<A - John J. Koraleski>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Rob and Jack, you've always sort of described your longer term OR guidance as not really a
target and an ending point, but things can go beyond that. And I think something that we've all sort of struggled with
over the years is thinking about kind of what structure of a network kind of limits how good margins can get. When
you look at the Union Pacific network and you see what you've been able to achieve over the last five to seven years,
which in margin terms is kind of breathtaking, is there anything about the network that makes you say, yeah it's going
to be hard for us to ever achieve sort of record profitability relative to our peers in the industry? Is there anything about
your network structure that limits how good you can be?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Man, I can't think of anything, Rob. Can you?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: No, Bill, there's not like a mountain that's in our way that's not in other people's way. We all
have the same challenges and it's a great theoretical question in terms of how low can you get and we get that question.
A sub-65% is pretty good performance. We think we can go below that. While at the same time, of course, that's just a
measure we use, a shorthand, if you will, because at the same time, what we are very focused on, of course, is
improving returns, improving income, driving larger cash, et cetera. So at the end of the day, that's what we're really
focused on. How low can the margins go, we'll see.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Yeah. Okay. Eric, a follow-up for you on Intermodal. Do you feel like the new hours of service
rules so far have had any impact on your growth rate there or is this kind of something that will take longer to show up?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. Any impact right now has been negligible. Certainly, the truckers probably are seeing
some impact on their expense lines, but in terms of conversion rates to Intermodal, it's been negligible so far. We do
expect over the long term that it will drive more business to Intermodal to the rails. And as I mentioned before, we still
are pretty excited about the upside opportunity in terms of over-the-road conversions.

won't let it damage too much our relationship. Or are we seeing more and more customers saying that it looks like
you've been able to reroute quite well. Do you see that as a competitive advantage versus other railroads that might or
might not be able to reroute as well due to whatever network constraints they have? In other words, do you view that
your rerouting capacity as a competitive advantage and perhaps, Lance, you could answer that and maybe Eric, in your
customer conversations, are they attaching more and more importance to that ability to reroute?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah. Walter, I'll let Lance and Eric chime in here, but let me just kind of, from an overview
perspective, I think our team did a remarkable job of working with customers, rerouting trains and ensuring that their
freight moved to their marketplace as quickly and efficiently as possible and doing it in a way that they knew we're
working hard to keep them ahead of the trouble and out of harm's way. And then to get the whole process back up and
running again, get the railroad back up and running in a record amount of time. I think customers appreciate that. We
spend a lot of time talking to them about our strategy as basically to create value for them and we consider that a
strategic advantage of ours in terms of being able to demonstrate what does value mean and this was a great time to do
that. And that's not to say we were perfect in all cases, but I think our customers are giving us high marks for that.
Lance or Eric, do you want to chime in on that?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, Jack. So we do talk about how our franchise is a wonderful thing and it showed through
in how we reacted to what happened in Denver. We had alternative routes that we could use and to Jack's point, support
our customers while they were going through some of the same issues. So I think that's a great manifestation of the
franchise strength basically
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Do you think it's better than your competitor?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: I won't speak to whether it's better than our competitor. We focus on providing our customers
outstanding service. So they fall in love with Union Pacific and think of us first.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: One of the things that Lance and Eric's team does that I love, and I think the customers do as
well, is they do a post-mortem on every one of these events and go back and say what did we learn from this? What
would we be prepared to do differently the next time the cards line up this way? So that we always learn, we always –
the next time mother nature takes a swipe at us, we're better prepared and more experienced in terms of how to deal
with it and minimize any disruptive situations to our customers?
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: That makes a lot of sense. My follow-up question, I guess, is on – your Crude-By-Rail, you
mentioned St. James seems to be showing a little bit more resiliency. Other areas seem to be more impacted by the
differential. My question, I guess is to what extent can your St. James destinations be insulated from that differential,
and perhaps talk a little bit about the differences as to why that is and at what level does, indeed, your St. James
destination also be impacted by differentials?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yes. So we talked in the past about the reason for St. James being such a premier rail destination
and it's really the connectivity, the pipeline connectivity, the connectivity to multiple refiners, the ability to do blending
there. And so it has become really a premier destination for crude, light sweet crude going to the Gulf. And we think
that that resiliency will remain.
As you know, the oil will move to where the market dictates based on spreads. But we think that the factors we've
historically talked about with St. James, makes it a premier destination and we'll see that resiliency remain for the
future.

<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Eric, maybe if you could give us a
little more color on the legacy retention issues. Are we done sort of settling up the legacy book for next year? Were
there plants that did not get renewed, did they shut down or was it a share loss? And whether this was PRB or Rocky
Mountain coal?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: As you know, we don't get into customer-specific negotiations or discussions other than what we
said before, we had about $100 million of legacy renewal, we retained about half of those and the half we didn't retain
was not at re-investable levels.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Was some of the losses perhaps due to the plants just being shut down? Or was it – if
you don't want to comment, that's fine, I'm just trying to understand what was driving the loss.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Our calculation of legacy does not include plants that are shut down. There are lots of shutdowns
going on in the East in terms of mine shutdowns. But in terms of our serving territory, there's not any measurable mine
shutdowns that are occurring in our serving territory, not this year and not for the foreseeable future.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: All right, great. And then maybe as a quick follow-up, how do you feel about the
viability of the Colorado and Rocky Mountain coals that were moving East relative to the Illinois Basin going forward?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: That's a good question. Utilities that are looking to convert, they can decide to convert to Illinois
Basin or Colorado, Utah coal. And there's a different sweet spot depending on the mechanical burn capability and the
scrubber capability of the utilities, and they have an economic profile that they drive them one place or the other.
We intend to participate in both markets. We have service products in both markets. We still see Colorado and Utah
coal having a strong place in the marketplace, particularly, the export market. And I think going forward, there are
export market opportunities for Colorado/Utah, probably largely than even the Illinois Basin export coal opportunities.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Great. Appreciate the time.

Our next question is from the line of Anthony Gallo of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Thank you. Good morning, all. I thought I heard you mention that transloading was a bit of a
headwind for Intermodal. I was hoping you could expand on why that is and that doesn't look like a trend that's about to
reverse. So some color there, please.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: As you know, some of the BCOs are looking at landing product on the West Coast and
transloading it into a domestic Intermodal container as opposed to using the steamship container to move the product
all the way inland. That is a trend that appears to have ramped up in the last year or so. And there's some benefits for
some customers to do that, there's some benefits for some customers to keep the steamship carrier, what we call IPI
option to move all the way inland. Our view of the world is we're going to participate in both markets and we're going
to provide [effective] products and services no matter how the shipper decides to ship the product.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Okay. Great. I'm hoping you can either confirm or deny the chatter we've heard from some
of the IMCs that part of the issue with Intermodal growth in your network is lack of access to equipment. And I think
they're talking specifically about chassis. Can you put any detail behind that? Thank you.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Well, Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. I think it's just chatter. We do not have a lack of access issue on our network. I think it's
just chatter.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: That's perfect. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Justin Long of Stephens. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks and good morning. You touched briefly on the Santa Teresa intermodal facility earlier and
it sounds like that's still on track to open early next year. But could you provide any details on the capacity of that
facility and how we should think about the potential ramp in volumes in 2014 and beyond that?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. So our investment in that facility, it's going to do a couple things for us. One, as you
know, the El Paso-Juárez area has huge Maquiladora opportunities. I think there's something like 250 customers that
have manufacturing facilities in that region. And today, a large portion of that is moving by truck over the road. We are
capacity-constrained in our current El Paso intermodal facility to take advantage of that. And so with the opening of
this new facility, we'll immediately be able to double our capacity. But we're not limited by that, we'll have the
footprint to go beyond that as we have market opportunities.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, Justin, the initial buildout should handle 250,000 lifts a year and we have plenty of space
available to go way beyond that in addition to it being our new fueling facility.
<Q - Justin Long>: Great. That's helpful. And second question, I was wondering how much visibility you have on the
potential impact from the new automotive production that's coming on line in Mexico the next couple of years. Is that
something that should be a meaningful tailwind as we head into next year or is it still too hard to tell how much of that
volume can move on your network at this time?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Well, if you're referring to kind of the large announced facilities by Nissan and Volkswagen,
those opening dates are beyond next year. We, along with the Mexican railroads, both the FXE and the KCS, we're
working to develop service products and offerings so that we can get our fair share of participation in those. But those
facility operation opening dates are beyond 2014.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: If I could just add on that, Justin, because you've heard me say this many times. No
franchise matches the Union Pacific in and out of Mexico. We're the only railroad that has six border crossing points.
And today, we enjoy in excess of call it around 80% market share of all auto business in and out of Mexico. While we
haven't given a precise number of what the market share is going to look like after these plants go, we feel very good
about the franchise we have north of the border and the fact that we are the only rail that crosses those six border points
that we will get our fair share of business that wants to move north and south.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. Great. I appreciate the time this morning.

Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Thanks very much and good morning. It's been a long call, so I'll just ask one. I was just
struck by the massive decrease you've had over the last couple of years in slow order miles. And just wondered if you
could elaborate a little bit on what's driving that and where else that shows up in your operational metrics and in the
cost structure?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Did Lance pay you to ask that question?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: I love that question
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah. Go for it, buddy.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: So Cherilyn, it reflects our capital programs which are pretty sophisticated in trying to figure
out where to spend the money and what to spend it on. So you see us investing $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion directly into
track infrastructure renewal for about the last, call it, six or seven years. And that slow order mile decrease is a direct

reflection of that appropriate investment. And when you think about the impact it has, it has an impact on every aspect
the customers service, because those slow order miles are throughout the network and they basically have the network
when they're present operating a level that's below design. And any improvement we make in slow orders, generally
speaking, has a direct and immediate impact on the reliability of our service and the absolute magnitude of the service
we can provide.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Thank you. That's it for me.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Hey, guys. Eric, a quick question on Intermodal. Could you give us a sense of what
you believe the discount to the product vis-à-vis a like-for-like truckload move would be today?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: We've talked before that it's lane-dependent, lane-specific. But a 15% number is probably a
reasonable number, 15% to 20% in terms of the all-in cost of Intermodal versus an equivalent over-the-road long-haul
truck. But you know, again, that's lane-dependent, lane-specific.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Of course. And when you talk about some of the optimism that comes from that
network being able to even reaccelerate the 4% volume growth, is it under the context of being able to continue to
narrow that gap as well and accelerate volume growth? Or do you anticipate that differential to be constant and expect
volume growth to potentially accelerate? How should we think about that?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, so, a couple of factors. One, the question was asked before about the hours of service. So
that is going to continue to have a cost impact on truckers, so their prices are going to increase. So we'll continue to
grow our pricing even without narrowing the gap. I do think that there are places where we can narrow that gap and
still convert. And fundamentally, we've done some work and analysis that basically says there's still a pretty large,
untapped market of people who just haven't tried Intermodal and haven't used it. And so it's an ideal market, sales
opportunity for us to penetrate. There's lots of upside opportunities and we can get it even by narrowing the gap, we can
still grow.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: And we also have new service products that your team's been working on with Lance and his
team in terms of providing great service, some new market destinations and some originations. And as the network
continues to evolve and develop, that's an opportunity for us as well.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Helpful, thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Good morning, guys. Two quick ones here, when I look at coal out into 2014 and look at the
ARC or the yield, given that you've retained sort of 50% of that legacy business, how should we look at how that
ARC's going to move? Or was the 50% retained longer length of haul, about average?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Just trying to get a sense of the number that we're going to see going forward, all things being
equal.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: For planning purposes, I'd look at it as an average. But we're not going to give detailed ARC
projections for coal. And by the way, it will be dependent upon mix. I mean, in terms of – we're confident in our ability
to continue to price our overall book of business. We won't obviously have the legacy tailwind that we called out, but

the ARC will move based on the mix of the coal traffic that actually moved. So I can't give you a projection on that.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Right. But all I'm saying is that the mix that you retain at it, that 50%, that wasn't overall vastly
different from your normalized mix?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: I'd call it in the normal range.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: In the normal range. Okay, great. And just a quick follow-up question on Intermodal, I hear you
guys in terms of the hours of service and truckload rates eventually have to go up. But we've waiting for that for a
while and we haven't really seen much progress on that. Sort of how do you look at sort of gaining market share off the
highway if we're still stuck in this sort of very muted truckload pricing environment?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yes. So, again, hours and service just went into effect on July 1. So that's why when I answered
earlier about negligible impacts, it really is just recent. If you look at what we've said before, we are putting in place
lots of products, new offerings. There's an opportunity to – what we've seen is large shippers really have a great
understanding of the Intermodal value proposition and they're heavy users of the Intermodal value proposition. There's
some market segmentation opportunities for the other guys other than the Wal-Marts, the Targets of the world. And
that's why I think we continue to be very optimistic about the ability to penetrate Intermodal, get growth and get price.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Thanks for the time as always, guys. I appreciate it.

Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morning Star. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks. I think a couple of us have hinted at how conservative it seems, the sub-65% goal
by 2017. And I mean no insult because you guys have identified conservative goals in the past and hit them again and
again. But are there a couple of threats, what would be the top couple of threats that could disrupt this progress?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: I think when you just step back and look at it, certainly what we just went through in
Washington, D.C. and the fact that it wasn't really resolved, it was just moved ahead, is still out there and it's very
concerning for us, given that 70% of the economy's driven by consumer spending. And so anything that would cause
the housing market to go back down for people to stop buying cars, those have all been big benefits to us in the
recovery piece of that and that's a concern for us. I don't know of any other, quite honestly. Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: I would just add to that, you're right and you're also right that we're not going to stop at that
and get there as efficiently as we can. But the things that can impact you clearly, in addition to the economy as Jack
points out, would be the fuel price, just the math of the operating ratio performance is heavily – can be heavily
impacted by fuel. But beyond that, it's sort of business as usual, if you will, in terms of the tenets of what are going to
get us from here to there.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: So it sounds like you identified fuel price and consumer spending are a couple of principal
ones and maybe legislation. But I noticed that you didn't mention sort of regulatory environment. Is that less of a threat
than might have previously been discussed?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Well, you never say never. Because there are a number of pieces of legislation that we're
watching, either legislation or from the Surface Transportation Board. But we work very hard to make sure that we're
telling our story clearly, that we're creating value for customers, that we're investing heavily in our network and
infrastructure and anything that gets done on the regulatory front, we've been very clear that if it caps our ability to
generate a return for our shareholders, it's going to curtail capital spending and investment.
Nobody really wants to see that happen and most people in Washington want to see more jobs and growth. So I never
want to say we're not concerned about it, but we're working it as hard as we can to make sure it's not a major issue to
for us.

Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kaufman of Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much. I know it's been a long call, so I'll be brief. What should we be
thinking about in terms of – I'm looking at cash flows here, tax rate and with the reversal of some of the bonus
depreciation items over the last year, what should we be thinking about in terms of the deferred taxes and the
depreciation of the cash flow side?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Jeff. I mean, you're right. Bonus depreciation, we've had that benefit for several year
now and we don't anticipate that we'll see that benefit continue into 2014. And as I've said, that impact in 2014 is going
to be in the several hundred million dollar range, but we don't think – it's not going to impact our capital structure or
our plans that we've outlined. But it's going to be kind of in that neighborhood.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Okay. So in terms of modeling free cash flow, how should I think about the difference
between the income statement depreciation, cash flow depreciation and what tax rate should I be thinking about?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: From a tax rate standpoint, I'd use around 38%.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Okay. All right. Thank you very much and congratulations.

Thank you. Our final question this morning is from the line of Don Broughton of Avondale Partners. Please proceed
with your questions.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my call. Question, in your assumptions
and longer term and it's still a little ways away, what kind of assumptions have you made on international Intermodal
post the opening of the wider Panama Canal? So in the latter half of 2015 and in 2016 and in 2017, are you looking for
international Intermodal volumes to be flattish, just diminished rates of growth or actually go negative for you?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So we have talked publicly before and we still think it holds that today about a third of the
business or about 30% of the business goes all water to the East Coast versus West Coast destinations. We think that
that might grow by a percent or two to 31%, 32%, but it won't be beyond that.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: Thank you very much.
