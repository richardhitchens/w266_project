At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.
Ursula M. Burns
Good morning, and thanks for joining our call. Today, we reported the second quarter results that are largely in line
with our guidance. During the call, we will update you on our strategy, provide details on the second quarter, and share
the areas where we are intensifying our focus throughout the balance of the year.
Let's start with our strategy. Our direction has been consistent. We are making progress in some areas, but we know we
can and should do better in other areas. Our direction is unchanged. We are making several shifts in the way that we
execute against it. First, we have taken steps to create much greater focus in our Services business. We completed the

divestiture of our ITO business, enabling a clear focus on the BPO and Document Outsourcing businesses.
Last Friday, we announced a major change in our Government Healthcare strategy. We are focused on ensuring the
success of the existing Health Enterprise implementations by limiting new pursuits with this platform. Second, we are
modifying our acquisition expectations for the year, setting an achievable spend level given our progress to date. Third,
the Services leadership team is in place with our last industry leader appointed in April.
Our capabilities are fully staffed and sales resources are in place to market our full portfolio of services. Collectively,
these actions result in a sharpened focus on achieving organic improvements in our Services business. We have also
announced changes to our 2015 capital allocation plan. For the full-year, we will increase our share repurchase by $300
million to $1.3 billion, and we will return $300 million to shareholders in dividends, that's unchanged.
In summary, we have the right business strategy. We are reprioritizing investments, and accelerating our restructuring
actions in Services to improve revenue and margin. While we have more work to do, we are making decisions and
changes that will deliver attractive returns for our investors.
Now let's look at quarter two. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.22. That's in line with our guidance,
which excludes the previously announced healthcare software impairment charges of $0.08. Total revenue was $4.6
billion, which is down 3% in constant currency. We grew Services revenue modestly in constant currency. That was
driven by strong performance in Document Outsourcing and we delivered on our Services margin guidance.
And there are a few highlights in Services that I'd like to share. We are seeing indications that our new Services
go-to-market model is taking root. Our opportunity pipeline is up sequentially and we are seeing more cross-selling and
better customer engagement. We made some important strides in innovation, introducing new levels of robotic
automation to support our BPO offerings. For example, we recently announced ClearSight Automated Intelligence and
ClearSight Case Management. We also introduced managed print services innovations with the next generation
offerings and workflow automation solutions to reinforce our leadership in the industry. And for internal productivity,
we are driving transformational change in our own capability operations with the Call Center of the Future program.
Now moving on to Document Technology, revenue was down 7% in constant currency, which is modestly lower than
what we had expected. Including DO though, total document-related revenues were down 4% in constant currency.
That's consistent with the trend that we've seen over the last several quarters. Document Technology margins were in
line with expectations.
Here are some highlights on Doc Tech. We retained our number one position in equipment sales revenue market share
for the 22nd straight quarter. We were pleased with install performance in the quarter as most product segments
improved, especially in the high-end of our business. The new product introductions during the quarter and the launch
of the iGen 5 earlier this month, will enable us to continue in our leader position.
Finally, we used our strong free cash flow, $349 million in the quarter, to acquire Health Communities Institute (sic)
[Healthy Communities Institute] (5:39) and Conestoga Business Solutions. We repurchased shares and supported our
dividend program.
Now I'll turn it over to Kathy to go over some details on the quarter. I'll be back later to wrap things up. Kathy?
Kathryn A. Mikells
Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. Our bottom-line results were within our guidance for the quarter, with
Services profit in line, Tech profits a little light on modestly softer revenue, which was offset by a bit better
non-operating expenses. I will cover the segments in more detail in a minute but first, I will run through total company
results for the second quarter.
Total revenue in the quarter was down 7% at actual currency and 3% at constant currency. Growth in Services was
more than offset by declines in Document Technology, which accelerated modestly driven by continued weakness in
developing markets and higher declines in supplies revenue. The negative currency impact of four points on our topline

was consistent with our expectations and with first quarter results.
Gross margin of 31.1% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower Technology gross margin as well as
a greater mix of Services which carries a lower margin. RD&E was slightly lower year-over-year and SAG, in absolute
dollar terms, was down 6%, helped by currency. However, as a percent of revenue, SAG was up 30 basis points
year-over-year to 19.7%, as productivity benefits were more than offset by investments in Services. As a result, our
second quarter operating margin decreased 160 basis points year-over-year, and operating profit declined 22%. About a
quarter of the operating profit decline was driven by currency and developing markets, with the remainder of the
decline coming from the causals that I just discussed.
Moving down the income statement, adjusted other net expense was $26 million lower year-over-year, driven by lower
restructuring cost. Equity income was $29 million in the quarter, down $4 million year-over-year, driven by the
continued impact of negative translation currency. Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.8% was in the middle of
our guidance, and about a point lower year-over-year.
Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was in the middle of our guidance range, at $0.22. GAAP EPS from
continuing operations in the quarter was $0.09, and includes the $0.08 impact from the Government Healthcare
software impairment we announced last week, which was driven by the strategy change that Ursula already discussed.
As this was a very large non-cash charge, we excluded it from our adjusted results to better reflect underlying operating
performance.
I'll now move on to discuss our operating performance in Services. Services revenue declined 3% and was up 1% in
constant currency, which was consistent with the first quarter and a bit better than our guidance of roughly flat, driven
by 4% growth in Document Outsourcing. Growth in Document Outsourcing reflects continued strong Xerox Partner
Print Services growth, as well as good equipment revenue growth and enterprise accounts from recent strong signings.
BPO revenue was down 1%, reflecting the continued headwind from last year's larger contract losses, more than
offsetting lower new ramp from softer signings in previous quarters. We continue to expect BPO growth to improve in
the second half as we lap the larger contract losses. We completed two small acquisitions in the first half, and M&A
remains a variable factor. I'll talk about this more when I cover cash flow and capital allocation.
Total signings in the quarter were up 20%, and new business signings were up 9%, driven by strong signings in
Document Outsourcing as well as the recently signed New York Medicaid processing contract in BPO. We expect our
go-to-market investments and move to industry alignment will yield improved new business signings growth as we
progress through the year. Our pipeline continues to build and is up sequentially. Our renewal rate in the quarter was
82%, which was below our target range of 85% to 90%, and reflected in part lower renewal opportunities in the quarter.
Year-to-date renewal rate is 87%.
Turning to margin, segment margin was 7.5% in the quarter, which was down 100 basis points year-over-year and in
line with our expectations. As expected, margin was pressured by higher costs related to our Health Enterprise platform
implementations. As we acknowledged last quarter, costs are continuing to run high, and we have more work to do to
turn around financial performance in these accounts.
Additionally, investments in our new Services operating model are not yet being fully offset by enhanced productivity
from our operational initiatives, which are still ramping up. Partially offsetting these impacts was continued good
margins in Document Outsourcing, albeit lower year-over-year as expected, and a year-over-year compare benefit
related to the charge last year from the lost Nevada HIX business.
So in summary, the quarter was in line for Services. We have made significant changes over the past year to move our
Services business forward, and will be taking additional restructuring actions to ensure our productivity ramps up faster
throughout the second half. I'll discuss this more when we get to guidance.
I'll now turn to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue in the quarter was down 7% at constant
currency. As expected, currency had a five-point negative impact, with revenue at actual currency down 12%. As we
highlighted last quarter, we don't include developing markets in our constant currency calculation, but if we had,

revenue would've been down 6% at constant currency. So overall revenue trends remained fairly stable.
Looking at the details, equipment revenue declines moderated, down 6% at constant currency in the second quarter,
versus down 8% in the first quarter and 10% in the fourth quarter. The improving trend reflects benefits from recent
new product launches, especially within high-end. where equipment revenue grew in the quarter. Offsetting the positive
equipment trend were higher declines in supplies revenue, driven in part by developing markets, which were pressured
by softening economies and currency.
From an activity perspective, we saw improvements and growth in mid-range, high-end and higher volume entry
products, so overall, positive growth in installs across our product segments. Document Technology margin of 12.1%
was down year-over-year, but up sequentially and in the middle of our 11% to 13% range for 2015. Year-over-year
drivers included the anticipated higher pension expense and negative mix associated with improved equipment sales at
lower margins. These were partially offset by a retiree health curtailment gain. So in closing, revenues were a little
lighter than expected, but overall a reasonable quarter for technology, with equipment trends and high-end performance
being positive takeaways.
Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations was $349 million in the quarter, above last year's cash flow of $325
million. This reflects good overall performance despite weaker profits, as working capital was a lower net use versus
last year driven by the following factors. Accounts receivable was a source of $56 million in the quarter versus the use
last year, reflecting lower revenues and flat year-over-year DSO. Accounts payable and accrued compensation was a
$75 million lower use this year, reflecting timing of supplier payments. This was partially offset by a little higher
inventory due to timing of shipments.
Moving down the cash flow statement, investing cash flows were an $831 million source driven by proceeds of $930
million from the sale of the ITO business, this was partially offset by $102 million spent on CapEx and $20 million on
acquisitions. Cash flow from financing was a $423 million use which included $395 million spent on share repurchases
and $83 million used for preferred and common stock dividends. As well, it reflects an increase in Commercial Paper
offset by payments of $250 million on senior notes. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.6 billion, an
increase of $769 million since the end of the first quarter driven by the proceeds received on June 30 from the ITO
divesture. So cash flow is strong and continues to track our expectations.
Now I'll quickly go over capital structure. We ended the second quarter with $7.6 billion in debt, applying seven to one
leverage on customer financing assets. Our allocated financing debt at the end of the second quarter was $3.9 billion,
leaving core debt of $3.7 billion. We manage our core debt to maintain credit metrics consistent with our
investment-grade rating. Our capital structure remains fairly stable.
If we move to the next slide, I'll review where we are in terms of capital allocation. Through the first half, we have
repurchased $611 million in shares, spent $147 million on common stock dividends and $48 million on acquisitions.
Considering our first half performance, and the opportunities we see for the balance of the year, we're adjusting our
capital allocation plan. On acquisition, we have spent about $50 million year-to-date; we now expect to spend between
$100 million and $400 million for the full year. The bar is higher as we focus on organic improvement in Services for
the next few quarters. We're working to enhance our proactive business development capabilities and recently hired a
new leader for business development and M&A.
On share repurchase, we are increasing our full-year plan by $300 million to $1.3 billion. This reflects our view that
our shares are attractively priced and a good investment as well as our reduced near-term plans for acquisitions. This
leaves approximately $200 million unallocated that we will deploy opportunistically. On debt, we retired our last
tranche of debt coming due this year, $250 million in June and we continue to expect to end the year at a debt balance
of roughly $7.7 billion. Finally on dividends, we continue to expect to spend just over $300 million.
I'll now turn to a discussion of guidance. First, starting with revenue; Document Technology trends are stable as
expected improvements in high-end and financing have been offset by ongoing weakness in developing markets from
softening economies as well as from currency. As a result, we are planning for Document Technology revenue to be
down roughly 6% at constant currency in the second half and for the full-year. Additionally, we're spending less on

acquisitions than originally planned, dampening back half Services revenue acceleration. At the total company level,
we now anticipate full-year revenue at constant currency will be down approximately 2%, consistent with prior-year
and down one point from what we last communicated.
Turning to margin, we expect Services margin will be at the low-end of the 8.5% to 9% range for the year. With our
margin at 7.5% for the first half, we need to average about 9.5% in the second half of the year to hit that level. This
requires a step function change given the continued higher Health Enterprise implementation cost and margins not yet
improving in the business as a whole outside of Health Enterprise. While our productivity initiatives are beginning to
ramp, we need to further accelerate that to drive the second half improvement.
In addition to capturing attrition benefits, we are planning a restructuring initiative which combined will reduce head
count by approximately 3,000 people. We expect modest sequential Services margin improvement in the third quarter
with the fourth quarter clearly showing greatest benefit given the timing of additional workforce actions and
accelerating yield from our operating model changes. Seasonality in Document Outsourcing also aid sequential
improvement in the fourth quarter.
For Document Technology, we continue to expect margins between 11% to 13% for the full year, in part supported by
pension expense coming in lower than originally anticipated. In the first half, restructuring actions were focused on
Technology; in contrast, our second half actions will be focused on Services. As a result, we expect relatively low
restructuring costs due to natural attrition and relatively low average severance costs in Services.
So in summary, we now expect to be at the lower end of our $0.95 to $1.01 adjusted earnings per share range. For the
third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $0.22 and $0.24, reflecting normal seasonality and
approximately $0.01 of restructuring.
As I indicated earlier, operating cash flow was strong in the first half and we still expect to be within our $1.7 billion to
$1.9 billion range despite the lower earnings, reflecting both good working capital performance and lower restructuring
costs. We're committed to taking the needed actions to improve profitability and meet our 2015 earnings and cash flow
guidance and we're confident that we have the right plan in place to deliver that and create value for our shareholders.
With that, I'll hand it back to you, Ursula.
Ursula M. Burns
So, thanks, Kathy. And for the second quarter, as Kathy said, we largely met expectations. We're committed to
delivering our guidance and we're doing everything that we can to overachieve. In Services, we're accelerating cost
reduction actions and re-prioritizing investments in the second half to position the business for stronger financial
performance, while investing in the parts of the business that are critical to drive productivity and future growth. In
Document Technology, we're focused on leading in the most attractive segments of the market and on delivering strong
financial performance. So in short, it's all about focus at Xerox.
In addition to leading in the attractive Document segment markets, we are focused on making portfolio moves that
strengthen our business financially and strategically. We are focused on optimizing our new Services operating model
[inaudible] (22:02) productivity improvements across the business, we are focused on driving revenue and profit
growth in every line of the business. And most importantly, we are focused on our people and on our clients. We
remain committed to our business strategy and we are bullish about the markets that we serve and the opportunities that
lie ahead.
Thank you and now, let me turn it over to Leslie.

Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Kathy today is Bob Zapfel, Head of our Services business. Let me point out that we
have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today's
presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I'd ask participants to limit follow-on and multi-part
questions, so we can get to everyone.
At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Karen, you can please now open the
line for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First question for Kathy. In your margin performance guidance
for Services that's been updated, can you detail what you're assuming for margin performance outside of Government
Healthcare and what investments into Government Healthcare you're assuming in the second half?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Sure. If you look at what I discussed in terms of the overall progression in Services margin
in the second half, it's very clear that outside of the Health Enterprise accounts what we're expecting is ramping
productivity between the third quarter and the fourth quarter to basically accelerate our margin improvement over the
second half.
The other thing that's really important to recall is that Document Outsourcing is a meaningful part of our Services
business and as a percent of our Services business got larger when we divested the ITO business and that has a natural
seasonal pattern in the second half of the year where margins decline in the third quarter and then accelerate
sequentially in the fourth quarter. So, those are some of the important puts and takes in terms of the acceleration in the
back half of the year.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. I had a couple of Services questions as well. I mean, first, can you
talk a bit more about details on the restructuring program and specifically what I'm wondering is kind of what has
changed in how you're looking at the restructuring from last quarter to this quarter?
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Shannon, it's Bob. So a couple of things, first is, as was mentioned heavily focused on
Services rather than Doc Tech where we get kind of visibly more yield for restructuring dollars spent. And then inside
our Services restructuring, a combination of what I would call G&A part of – now that we've got our arms around
managing the set of people and our capabilities organization, but a combination of that and then not needing to back fill
and being able to take out a higher proportion of our delivery resources as a result of automation investments that we've
been making during the year, and as a result of really having improved the service level quality where we're confident.
We were trying to be a little bit careful to not go too quickly relative to optimizing our cost base without being sure that
we could maintain and continue to increase delivery quality. So, those would be the main summary points.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question – I'm sorry?
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: I was just asking Shannon if she had a follow up because she mentioned she had a couple of
questions.

Shannon, your line is open.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay, thank you. My only follow-up is just, can you talk a little bit – you started to retrain
and realign the sales force on the Services side. So, I'm curious as to what you're seeing in terms of any benefit from
that or how that's progressing.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Yes, we've largely completed the addition of resources in our sales teams, and we've got
good sequential pipeline improvements, so besides the fact that as was mentioned before, our signings were strong in
the quarter, we've seen our pipeline build out. And we're also seeing, which was part of the design of the new model of
going to market by industry, we're seeing a visible increase in the number of opportunities where we're bringing more
than one offering to the customer, so that it's leveraging Xerox Services broadly, rather than an isolated offering by
itself. So, those would be the primary points.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you.
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: Karen, I think we can move on to the next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, thank you. I had two as well. On the M&A pipeline, I understand completely that you
want to focus on kind of righting the ship. But if I think, about over the last year and a year-and-a-half, it seems like
Xerox hasn't been able to hit, identify targets associated with M&A in the Services area. And, in contrast, it seems like
I get an email a week from Accenture about adding deals or completing deals. I'm wondering, is this more Xerox
threshold, is it the pipeline, is it supply-demand imbalance? What has been the challenge associated with adding
Services revenue through inorganic means? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Okay. So, Keith, I'm going to start with, the way we have historically talked about this, we
tended to say an up-to number. So, as an example, when we started the year, we said M&A up to $900 million, and in
fact, we knew that was kind of quite a big number for us, especially relative to what we had typically been doing in the
past. And so, we also said, at the same time, that we expected we might roll some of that over until next year. I'd note,
in the recent guidance we just gave, we're giving a range, because it seems like when we said up-to, if we didn't hit the
top end of that number, people really dinged us for falling short, when M&A is a little difficult to call.
If I go to what we need to do to actually get more done, I'd say the core thing we need to do is improve our hit rate, and
the changes that we're looking to make is to pivot more of our activity to a proactive approach, rather than just looking
at deals that are being brokered in the market. That isn't something that happens overnight. I mentioned that we hired a
new leader recently in order to head up that business. And in the meantime, we're also clearly looking to hold the bar a
little higher, as we focus over the next couple of quarters on really getting our organic improvement in Services
accelerating.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: If I can just add something, we are clearly – part of our model is to fill out capabilities and
broaden our reach, particularly internationally. We need M&A. And so we're not pleased with the fact that we are at the
low end of our performance ranges here. But I also think it's kind of a fortuitous time, in the back half of the year, to be
focused on organic growth. We have all of the infrastructure in place. We've hired the capability leaders. We have the
sales force full. We have the line-of-business guys all in place. We have a good start to operating model, and focus here
is an important thing.
I don't want anyone to believe that we're walking away from M&A, that we're not going to do it, but based on the
reality of where we are, I think we're going to be in this $100 million to $400 million range. We're going to spend the
last half of the year trying to get that done, and then making sure that we have a foundation, a strong foundation, a kind

of unshakable foundation, in the organic side of the business. So, I know it's not where we want to end up, but it is
where we are.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Well I think Ursula, certainly the right thing to do is try to focus on the execution. I think
totally appropriate. My follow-up question, though, is on the printing side of the business. It does seem like there are
some challenges there, and I was wondering if you could add any color. In particular, the supply side seems a bit
weaker than I would have anticipated, and it seems to be a lingering problem. And is that just demand, or is there share
or is there – how is the Technology business seem to be facing incremental challenges, particularly on supplies? Thank
you.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: And so, specifically on supplies, I'm going to first kind of refer back to my commentary
when I talked about developing markets and the fact that we don't adjust currency out, right. So when we look at these
numbers and publish these numbers, it has developing markets at actual currency. If you make that adjustment in Tech
for supplies, it actually moves the number by about two points. And that would be the case for the last couple of
quarters, that currencies in developing markets have really been under pressure. So I think if you look at it that way, I
would say, overall supplies ebb and flow a little bit, but we don't see any kind of monumental shifts going on here. We
think the business is pretty stable.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: One other thing to add, Keith, if I can, is that our supplies mix is a little different than what
some of our peers or competitors are as well. It's a smaller portion of our business. Most of our supplies are bundled in
contracts. And what we're talking about here is supplies outside of that, and it's a lower portion by a lot of our business.
That's one.
And the other thing about supplies is that Kathy talked about the currency impact, but it is even outside of the currency,
DMO is just a basket of uncertainty there. We manage very tightly. We try to get our inventory levels lined up.
Everything has to be managed pretty tightly by us there, so we don't get too far over our skis. I think fundamentally, we
don't see massive changes in the marketplace, particularly when you look at currency, but we do pay a lot of attention
to it and also remember it's a small part of our business than some of our competitors.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: All right, fair enough, I will cede the floor. Many thanks.
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: Thanks, Keith.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup.
<Q - James D. Suva>: Thank you very much. My question is regarding the turnaround of operating services. If I do
the math correctly unless I'm mistaken, it looks like calendar Q4 will have operating margins 10% or above. Is my
math right and if so, can you help us with your confidence and conviction there because it was literally at your Investor
Day where Bob, literally we asked, does he [ph] bluff (34:14) these numbers? You've been at the company now for
nine months and looked at the contracts and kicked the tires and toured. And you said yes and then we had a takedown
as this year has progressed in this area. So, can you help us understand and do you actually have the visibility to kind of
put your name behind it all as it's been a challenging area.
And then my follow-up question is more probably for Kathy on the cash flow side [inaudible] (34:39) cash flow held
up this year despite all the stumblings and challenges that you've actually had this year and the takedown of lots of
different things from revenues to margins to M&A and all that not coming through. So, are there things that are helping
out cash flow one time this year whether it's pension or reversals or something like that that we should be aware that
are not sustainable? And the reason why is numbers have been perpetually been coming down lower but cash flows
held up. I just want to know is that cash flow still protected as we look forward long-term in the model? Thank you.

<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: So, Jim, it's Bob. I'll start. So first your math is accurate, so that for us to deliver the
commitments we've made, we would expect to drive a two-digit number in the fourth quarter. And I guess what I
would go back to is we've got a broad set of actions that drive that, if you will, hockey stick of improvement. They start
with the productivity that we talked about earlier and restructuring and taking costs out of our delivery model and cost
base. It also includes a lower level of losses in our Health Enterprise portfolio. We think we've got sufficient
contingency for the unpredictability that we would see there, but that is part of our design model.
I talked about the restructuring beyond delivery. We've got continued strong profitability in our Document Outsourcing
business, and it's got a seasonality that's heavier in the second half in terms of profit yield than the first half. And then
we're really committed to driving improved revenue dynamics. So we've been pretty visible all along that we thought
that we would be at the lower end of the two to four revenue range. We've run at one for the first half of the year, so
mathematically we'd obviously have to get to three in the second half. We've got headwinds that dissipate relative to
Texas in student loans, we've got New York ramping. On the other side of it we'll have less in the way of inorganic
revenue growth, but the combination of factors would get us to improved revenue dynamics in the second half and then
that profit increase is part of our model. So Kathy, do you want to address cash flow or provide more color on...?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: I'll go to cash flow. On cash flow I'd start with, as you mentioned, our cash flow has been
really strong for the first half of the year and we're very comfortable with where our guidance is. If you look at some of
the charges that we've taken this year, especially in Health Enterprise outside of the recent impairment charge which is
obviously non-cash, some of those charges are just spread over the contract period where we're doing the Health
Enterprise implementations, and so while they have some cash impact in the current year, the cash impact is really
spread over a multiple-year period.
As we see declines in our technology business that actually throws off reduction in working capital and so we get a
natural benefit there as well as actually just managing our working capital really well. And then finally the lower
segment results are in part offset with a little lower restructuring. So as we look out to the back half based on where
we've been tracking year-to-date this year, we feel very comfortable about where we're at in meeting our guidance.
Operator, next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew N. Cabral>: Yes, thank you. This is Matt Cabral in for Bill. So I wanted to better understand the
thought process behind the announcement last week to limit Health Enterprise to the six states you currently have under
contract. Was there anything that changed last quarter to necessitate this change? Are there any additional challenges
that you see in ramping those four states that aren't up and running yet that maybe weren't as clear three, six months
ago? And then related to that, just thinking to the longer-term revenue targets that you guys gave for the Services
business, how much of that was predicated on extending Health Enterprise into additional states beyond the six that you
currently have?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: So the decision to – I'm going to have Bob kind of follow up with the details, but I just
wanted to start out with the top level decisions. And the decision that we announced last Friday was one that was a
fundamental strategic change. And the change was not that we didn't want to be in Health Enterprise. We just wanted to
get what we had underway kind of [ph] vetted (39:52) down and tightly focused.
We have big States, New York and California. New York just starting, California kind of in the middle of its journey,
and what I asked the Services team to do is actually focus on those big implementations, the six states that we have let's
make sure we get those settled down and then we'll start to pursue the market again in the future if we think it's actually
useful. So I'm actually going to then have Bob get into the details of what we see in the States.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Yes, I would just add that, as Ursula shared, I mean we're really trying to focus on success in
those existing clients. And we've got the big states reference left to really deliver on long-term to grow. The best way to

grow is to have every customer completely satisfied. So we felt like our delivery capacity – you've got to remember,
New York really was just one at this point in the last conference call, and as we looked at how much capacity we had,
the work to do in California and New York, Montana, kind of across the remaining portfolio, we felt that we would be
better served to center our resources there. There aren't that many new bids that come up. It's not something where all
50 states are rebidding every year. We have [indiscernible] (41:23) have a long shelf life, so we felt that we would be
better both short-term and long-term to deliver world-class service in platforms with these accounts and then reassess
after that's done whether we would pursue more opportunities in the marketplace.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And long-term revenue dynamics, we do understand that we will have some back-end
pressure, back-end meaning out-year pressure. But as Bob said, the big thing here is that getting these six states done,
we found historically that additional business comes if you operate really well. The quicker we can get them done and
the quicker we can get them aligned, I think that we can actually balance the revenue in the out-years that would be
pressured if we didn't actually pursue. So I don't think that we're going to have significant issues in the out-years due to
this decision.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: And we'll have, just to reinforce, we'll have visible growth here next year...
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: ...as we ramp New York. So this portfolio of accounts is not going to be a low-growth
business for us in the short-term, but it is a longer-term question that we think we can manage.
<Q - Matthew N. Cabral>: Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thanks.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Thanks, Matt. Karen, next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Hi. Good morning. And thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if we could start
off, first of all, just revisiting the New York contract, and maybe Bob you just mentioned ramping in the next year.
Obviously we've known for quite some time that you've had this contract and you've been pre-spending, so to speak.
Maybe help me understand, or help us understand how you expect the trajectory of ramp for the benefits of that
contract to be realized by the company?
And then this kind of 18 months implementation timeline, when did that clock start ticking? Are you well ahead of
that? Or how do we think about hitting those goalposts and leveraging, you now I guess fundamentally complete
software development program, and how you can gain confidence so you can hit that timeframe?
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Okay. Let me start if I can, Brian, with the delivery plan with New York. So there are two
major release mileposts. One is that the first quarter of next year and the second is that the fourth quarter of 2016,
there's a set of deliverables along the way and we are on track across those deliverables. And the reason, not the only
reason, but a reason that we're off to a good start, as you referenced, is we invested ahead. So we took the financial hit a
little bit in the fourth and the first quarter from investing ahead. And our initial concept sessions with the state where
we confirm designs have been very collaborative, all going well. So at this point we're tracking well. And as you may
remember, New York is basically leveraging the platform that we built for New Hampshire, which was just certified by
CMS back in June. So it's now federally certified as a good platform. Relative to ramp on the revenues, Kathy, you
want to cover that?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Sure. So we just started the contract in the second quarter, and so it's going to be ramping
through the rest of the year. We should exit the year with New York just under a point, in terms of revenue growth for
overall Services.

<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Okay. Great. And then maybe if I could follow up the obligatory question on the Florida toll
road contract, any update there in terms of progression, or what you might expect in terms of a timeline?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, I'm going to take this one. We don't have an update of what we would expect, and the
only reason why is that we're out of predicting this. We have won the bid, and we've won the bid again. So we've won
this. It's not a question, but we now have an additional protest that's going to go through its cycle. And when it's done,
we'll get to business. We're not going to predict when that protest is going to be done, because every time we seem to
say something, it delays it. So we're just going to stand pat.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: But we do think this is the last remaining potential protestee. So hopefully, this is the last
part of the cycle.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Okay. Very helpful.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thanks, Brian.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Thanks, Brian. Karen, next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Hi. Thanks, guys. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I have two, if I could,
as well. I guess the first is, there seems to be a revenue component to the second-half guide down with BMO, and there
seems to be a Services margin component as well. Maybe the guide down for the second half of the year is a couple
pennies.
So the question is, what kind of tail should we expect these two dynamics to have as we think about going into 2016?
And to the extent that they do extend into 2016, can we make it up anywhere? And if not, should we feel – when we
start to think about 2016, I realize you're not going to give guidance, but if there's sort of a $0.02 tail – $0.02 impact of
these things in the second half of the year, should we think about their having some kind of impact as we move into
next year? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So, the overall revenue dynamics that we're seeing, really in Tech, are stable, and we had
been expecting to see Tech improve a little bit as a result of our execution in areas of growth. So while we're seeing
good execution in a place like high-end, it's being offset by developing markets, not stabilizing, but continuing to be a
little bit soft, both from soft economies in developing markets and from currency. And I mentioned the fact that we
don't adjust out developing markets for constant currency basis, and so that kind of heightens the decline for us a little
bit.
On Services, really the only change there is the fact that we're a little light on M&A, and so that will make us a tad bit
lighter, in terms of just trying to accelerate growth in the back half. But it's important to understand, the same way that
the Services segment margin kind of ramps over the course of the back half, we have a very similar dynamic going on
in revenue, in large part because we're going to start to lap some big contract losses. So you'll recall the loss of the
Texas Medicaid contract. If we look at first half over second half, that's worth about two points to us. So between that
and New York, we have quite good, I'd say, organic revenue growth dynamics kind of naturally, from half to half and
throughout the second half of the year.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And Ananda, I would just say, I know that we are guiding to the lower end of the range, but I
want to make sure that we understand that we are still in the range, and we're going to try to do everything we can to
overachieve that. But it's important. We're trying to hold ourselves to the commitments in the range that we have, in
both Services margin and in total EPS.

<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: And hopefully, the new restructuring actions and the new wins that you have in Services
can actually sort of scale up into the cost structure and help the revenue and the margins there as well. So those are both
good pickups. And then I guess, as my follow-up, just touching base on M&A again, as it was touched on earlier in the
Q&A, this is maybe the third year where you've been a little bit on the softer side of the target. My question is, at what
point do you guys start to get a little wary of what the longer-term top-line impact could be to the model? And then, are
you guys thinking of it in that context yet?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So, I think the things that we're doing to, I'd say, change our approach and execution in
M&A are what we need to do to actually get this engine kind of moving for us more consistently, and that's really
pivoting from being opportunistic, largely a pipeline of kind of brokered deals, to an M&A and business development
activity that's led by our strategic planning, and that strategic planning really yielding a team focus on where we have
gaps in our portfolio, and a proactive M&A activity where we proactively build our pipeline.
That, I'd say, shift in overall approach, not a shift in strategy for what we're trying to accomplish through M&A, but
shift in the execution approach, should help us to improve our hit rate. And if I had to kind of point to one soft
underbelly in M&A, it's that, with a large part of our pipeline coming through broker deals, our hit rate is not as high as
we would desire it to be. So we are taking actions in order to change our overall approach so that we can be both very
focused, right, and improve our hit rate. Okay. Thank you. Karen, next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I'll ask a derivative M&A question. I'm curious if all this
healthcare consolidation, especially in the healthcare payer space, does that have any impact to Xerox and your overall
healthcare business?
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: We're fortunate that we are providers to all of the players that are participating in the
consolidation dynamics. And kind of my business experience is, if you've got the acquiree as a client, that's not a good
place to be. When you have both the acquirer and the acquiree, you're better positioned. So I would expect – and we
don't do the exact same work with each side, if you will, in some of the big visibly-announced planned mergers. So I
think for us, there's always the chance that you're going to get – you're going to be part of the synergy savings play and
help those lead customers achieve their synergy savings. We think we're well positioned to participate in that because
we're on both sides of the visible transactions. We have very strong client referenceability and we tend to see the clients
wanting to consolidate and leverage providers where they would be more likely to even use us more broadly.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Got it. Makes sense, Bob.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Thank you.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Could I just ask – sorry, go ahead.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Certainly, one more question.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: I'm sorry. Just a quick one just on the signing side – thanks for letting me sneak one more in,
just on the Services signings front, I caught the Florida comment, obviously New York coming in. I'm curious, any
other larger deals that could be building up in the pipeline? Because thematically, it sounds like bigger deals are
coming back for this sector including within BPO. I'm curious if you're seeing that as well. Thank you. I'll drop off.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: We're not really seeing an increase in what I would call the big multi – or $100 million, $100
million-plus deals. But what we are seeing is we're seeing visible improvement in our pipeline including the
progression. So not just how many deals do we have to pursue, but where are they in the sales stage that we need to
then leverage to drive improved signings in the second half of the year, that's our plan.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Thank you. Next question, Karen.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Hi. Most of my questions have been asked and maybe I missed some of these things, but
can you just...
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Can you speak up a little bit, Kulbinder?
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Sorry. Most of my questions have been asked. I just wanted to ask, have you given a
number for the restructuring amount this year? And what's a normal level of restructuring going forward for the
company? And then also what tax rate should we be assuming? Thanks.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So, I think I'm going to try and repeat the question just because I'm not positive that I
heard you, was your first question just asking about the level of restructuring generally?
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Correct.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah. So we have tended to do, I'll call it, about $0.02 a quarter or between $0.01 and
$0.02 a quarter, that ebbs and flows in different quarters as we look at and assess our business. We specifically guided
to doing about $0.01 in the third quarter, and we'll assess the fourth quarter as we get closer, but we do have an
expectation that in the back half of the year, generally, our restructuring is going to be a little bit lighter. And I think
your second question was overall kind of tax rate. We haven't changed our tax rate guidance. We expect to be between
25% and 27%.
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: Thank you. I think we have time just for one last question.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna.
<Q - James E. Friedman>: Hi. Thanks for sneaking me in, Leslie. There's a reference in the press release, and it's sort
of deep down there, but with regard to the New Hampshire contract and it states in there that Medicaid – I'll just
paraphrase – that Medicaid certified you retroactively to the April 2013 implementation date. I guess, more generally, I
was just – what the status of New Hampshire is? I understand it's launched and live. But what does that certification
mean? And is there any financial implication to the fact that it's retroactive?
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: There really aren't financial implications to the retroactivity, but the certification really
means for the other states that as they look at and work with us, they [inaudible] (56:24) that platform not just that
we're selling with its features, but that the Feds and CMS agree that that's designed to meet the federal targets. It's a
very good thing. A very good thing.
<Q - James E. Friedman>: That sounds like a positive. Thank you.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Thanks, Jamie. So that's all the time we have for questions today. Ursula, wrap up?
Ursula M. Burns
So as I said earlier, the second quarter was in line, but we expect more and we're working to deliver more. We're
making choices that increased our short-term performance while retaining the ability to achieve our long-term goals.
We're focused on delivering better results and improving the performance of our business, and I thank you all for
joining us on the call.
