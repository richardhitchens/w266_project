With that, I'll conclude our discussion of the administrative details and turn the call over to Peter Ragauss. Peter?
Peter Ragauss
Thanks, Adam. Good morning. This morning we reported adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of $534 million, or
$1.22 per share. This excludes the previously reported non-cash impairment charge of $220 million after tax, or $0.50
per share, primarily associated with our decision to minimize the use of the BJ Services trade name as part of our
overall branding strategy for Baker Hughes. On a GAAP basis, net income to Baker Hughes for the fourth quarter was
therefore $314 million or $0.72 per diluted share.
Revenue for the fourth quarter was $5.4 billion, up 22% or $964 million from last year, and up 4% or $209 million
sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion, up 25% from last year and up 3% sequentially.
For the year, adjusted net income was $1.84 billion or $4.20 per share. This excludes certain charges totaling $102
million after tax, or $0.23 per share, which are non-operational in nature and reconciled in detail in Table 1 of our
earnings release. On a GAAP basis, net income to Baker Hughes for the year was therefore $1.74 billion, or $3.97 per
diluted share.
For the year, revenue was $19.8 billion, up 38% or $5.4 billion from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.31
billion, up 64% or up $1.7 billion from the prior year.
To help in your understanding on the moving pieces, I'll bridge Q4 last year EPS to this quarter's EPS. GAAP EPS a
year ago was $0.77 per share. Add $0.07 for charges incurred last year related to the acquisition of BJ Services.
Subtract $0.01 for higher net interest expense and net income attributed to non-controlling interests. Add $0.04 for the
lower income taxes. Operations added $0.35. This results in a $1.22 per share for adjusted net income for this quarter.
Then subtract $0.50 for the non-cash impairment primarily related to the decision to minimize the use of the BJ
Services trade name. That brings us to $0.72 per share on a GAAP basis.
Looking at the sequential quarters, GAAP EPS for last quarter was a $1.61 per share. Add $0.06 for the early
extinguishment of debt. Subtract $0.49 for the non-cash tax benefit from the reorganization of certain foreign
subsidiaries. This brings us to the adjusted $1.18 per share that we discussed in the third quarter.
In the current quarter, add $0.02 for lower corporate costs and add $0.02 per share from operations. This results in a
$1.22 per share for adjusted net income this quarter. Again, subtract $0.50 for the non-cash impairment primarily
related to the decision to minimize the use of the BJ Services trade name. That brings us to $0.72 per share on a GAAP
basis.
In Table 5a of our earnings release, we provide financial information excluding the $315 million pre-tax impact of the
non-cash impairment charge from each of the regions' Q4 results to provide more meaningful comparisons between
quarters. From this point on in the conference call, any comments on revenue, operating profit, and operating profit
margin refer explicitly to Table 5a.
Revenue in North America was $2.82 billion, up 28% compared to a year ago and up 4% sequentially. North America
operating profit was $527 million, up $49 million year-over-year and down $80 million sequentially. North America
operating margin was 19%, down 295 basis points from a year ago and down 367 basis points compared to the last
quarter.
The average Q4 North America rig count was 2,481, up 96 rigs or 4% sequentially, and up 389 rigs or 19%
year-over-year. We continued to see a shift in rigs from gas to oil with average gas rigs comprising only 42% of the
total North America rig count for the fourth quarter 2011. This compares to 54% just a year ago.
Average gas rigs in the U.S. for Q4 2011 declined 20 rigs, and average oil rigs increased 87 rigs versus the prior
quarter. Compared to Q4 2010, average gas rigs actually declined 78 rigs, while oil rigs increased 405 rigs.
In the Gulf of Mexico, the rig count continues to increase, but at a slow pace.

In U.S. Land and Canada, we have seen deterioration in margins in pressure pumping due to issues related to the
availability, costs, and transportation of materials. Our inability to sufficiently utilize increased head count and capacity
to meet growing market demand also impacted margins this quarter.
Moving to the international side, revenue was $2.25 billion, up 16% compared to a year ago and up 6% compared to
the prior quarter. International operating profit was $350 million, up $175 million year-on-year and up $90 million
from the prior quarter. International operating margin was 16%, up 650 basis points year-over-year and up 333 basis
points sequentially.
The average international rig count was up 18 rigs or 2% sequentially, and up 71 rigs or 6% year-over-year.
During the quarter, we saw continued growth in all international regions. Our supply chain stepped up and delivered
seasonal product sales during the quarter as intended. And as expected, the transitory cost issues that we mentioned in
the prior quarter in the Europe, Africa, Russia and Caspian region did not repeat this quarter.
For our Industrial Services and Other segment, revenue was $316 million, up 12% compared to last year and down 6%
sequentially due to typical seasonality. Operating profit was $28 million, which is unchanged compared to a year ago
and sequentially. Operating margin was 9%, down 110 basis points year-over-year and up 53 basis points sequentially.
Turning to the balance sheet, at quarter-end our total debt was $4.1 billion, up $169 million from the prior period. Our
total debt-to-capital ratio of 20% remained consistent with the prior quarter.
Our capital expenditures were $810 million this quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $2.46 billion. At the end of
the quarter, we had $1 billion in cash and short-term investments.
And finally, I will provide you with our outlook for 2012. We expect the average annual rig count for North America to
grow by 5%, from 2,293 in 2011 to 2,409 in 2012. However, the exit rate for Q4 2012 is expected to be flat to Q4 2011,
with gas rigs expected to decline by 218 rigs and oil rigs expected to increase by 220 rigs. In the near term, we expect
Q1 margins in North America to partially recover from Q4 levels, but Q2 will be negatively impacted by the Canada
breakup.
Internationally, the average rig count is anticipated to grow 11%, 1,167 rigs in 2011 to 1,295 rigs in 2012, led by Latin
America and the Middle East. Our international margins are expected to improve further in 2012, but as we've
historically seen, our revenue and margins will be meaningfully lower in the first quarter due to weather, geographical
mix changes, and seasonality in product sales. For the year, Industrial and Other will see continued growth; however,
we will see typical seasonal decline in Q1.
We expect interest expense to be between $230 million and $240 million for the full year, consistent with the Q4 run
rate. Corporate costs will be between $315 million and $325 million, including $39 million for the year, or $0.02 per
share per quarter, of non-cash amortization related to the remaining balance of the BJ Services trade name intangible
asset.
Therefore Q1 corporate costs are expected to be between $80 million and $85 million. Depreciation and amortization
expense is expected to be between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be
about $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion, consistent again with the Q4 run rate. Our tax rate is expected to be between 34% and
35% for the year.
I'll now turn the call over to Martin.
Martin S. Craighead
Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss the quarter, I'd like to take a minute and comment on the
leadership transition here at Baker Hughes. After assuming the CEO role on January 1, I made the following changes to
our Executive Management team: Derek Mathieson is now leading our Western Hemisphere Operations; Belgacem

Chariag continues leading our Eastern Hemisphere Operations; Art Soucy is leading our Global Products and Services
function; and Andy O'Donnell reports to me in an executive advisory role.
These names should be familiar to you as these changes are evolutionary in nature and in keeping with our long-range
succession plan. As all of you know, Chad Deaton remains Executive Chairman of the Board at Baker Hughes, and I
want to credit him and our board for executing what has been a smooth transition. Chad has a long legacy of driving
transformational change, and I'm committed to building on his progress.
Now to performance. The fourth quarter results were mixed. Our international operations performed well on all fronts
as activity was up, mix was favorable, and our delivery execution was strong. As we told you last quarter, making those
deliveries and getting our products and services into customers' hands was critical, and as expected, our employees
stepped up and met those challenges. As a result, our international business margins were up 650 basis points
year-over-year.
In North America, our results were disappointing as very strong performance in drilling systems, completions, and
artificial lift were more than offset by pressure pumping, where we've experienced a variety of cost and efficiency
challenges associated with ramping demand.
These cost challenges come in three categories. First, we experienced inefficiencies associated with our freight, fuel,
and other logistical operations. Second, there are significant shortages of specific sizes and qualities of proppants, gel,
and other materials. These shortages shifted the supply and demand curves, and as a result, our product costs escalated.
In addition, these shortages adversely impacted operational efficiency. Third, we incurred incremental costs associated
with adding new crews in the fourth quarter in anticipation of growth in 2012.
We clearly understand these issues, and while we expect this to take some time, we are taking the necessary steps to fix
these problems. We are currently investing in our existing fleet to make them more efficient. We will also invest in the
facilities necessary to more effectively support our fleet, store sand and other consumables, as well as provide more
flexibility for rail shipments. For example, we plan to open seven new major facilities in 2012 within North America
Land operations, each located in key unconventional basins.
In addition, we will accelerate our investment in the pressure pumping supply chain to drive efficiency, improve
logistics, and at the same time lower the high cost of freight and other items associated with improving the
infrastructure.
The underlying business in North America is very strong. The geology in the shale plays is obvious, and for that
reason, we intend to continue growing pressure pumping capacity this year. The increasing demand for high quality and
predictable operations and leading-edge reservoir characterization and completions technology aligns very well with
the capabilities of Baker Hughes. As such, we have every reason to be bullish on the long-term prospects of this
market.
Our customers have reported that they will increase capital spending this year. However, experience tells us that
customer spending patterns for North America onshore can change quickly. So we're prepared to balance our
investments accordingly.
Today in North America there are 964 rigs drilling for natural gas, and natural gas prices have reached a ten-year low.
Not surprisingly, the onshore natural gas rig count is dropping, and it's our expectation that it will continue to drop until
there is a meaningful increase in gas prices.
Concurrently, the oil rig count is higher than it has been in over 20 years. And assuming oil prices remain steady, we
see the increase in oil rigs offsetting the loss in gas rigs. As we've highlighted before, the Baker Hughes portfolio is
well positioned for this increasing and sustained emphasis on oil. In fact, 80% of our pressure pumping product line is
oriented towards oil-related completions.
Our production chemicals, completions, and artificial lift continue to be market leaders in oily basins. To further our
competitive leadership in artificial lift, we're expanding our investment in ESP research and development with a new
facility in Claremore, Oklahoma.

In Canada, our production-oriented businesses recorded improved results both sequentially and year-over-year. A
warmer than usual winter's had minimal impact on activity so far. We forecast Canada to average 569 rigs in the first
quarter, the second highest count in 35 years. But as highlighted in last quarter's call, labor shortages are limiting
growth.
Compared to Q4 2010, rig count was up 15% and footage drilled was up 17%. However, well count was down 11%,
further evidence that the Canadian drilling and completions market is growing in complexity.
On a recent well for a major Canadian operator, we combined our Reservoir Navigation Services with our AziTrak
resistivity tool and AutoTrak rotary steerable system to drill a complex horizontal well staying within 1.5 meters of the
reservoir ceiling, as well as delivering the well days ahead of original schedule.
All of the navigation and support services were provided via our remote, real-time BEACON support center in Calgary.
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, our customers are seeing improvement in the permitting process, which is good news
for the industry. And we expect to capitalize on this increase in activity over the next several quarters. As we've told
you in previous calls, the rig mix remains less than optimum and utilization rates are not yet where we'd like to see
them. Nevertheless, we continue to see improvement and demand for our services is picking up.
Additionally, the pricing environment in the Gulf of Mexico is improving, and we expect that to continue through
2012. Today, deepwater rig levels are roughly two-thirds of pre-moratorium activity, and we expect them to be back to
pre-moratorium levels by early Q1 2013.
Winning in the Gulf of Mexico will require differentiating execution. Over the past couple of calls, we've told you
about incremental costs associated with preparing our company for the post-moratorium regulatory requirements.
We've upgraded our competency assurance program and our material traceability capability, and we've invested in
information technology to facilitate and enable critical data management functionality. And last week, we announced
that Baker Hughes is the first integrated service company to receive full accreditation from the International
Association of Drilling Contractors for our efforts around competency management.
And we continue to differentiate with technology. During the quarter Baker Hughes completed the installation of the
world's first deepwater fixed-fiber integration into the sandface completion. This technology enables better
management of the reservoir to extend the life of the producing wells where reservoir compaction is a concern. Also,
after extensive joint research with a super-major, we provided an innovative subsea separation and boosting system for
the world's deepest water subsea well to extract oil using five specially designed Centrilift XP enhanced run life ESPs
embedded on the sea floor.
Now, moving over to Latin America, we had a good quarter overall with strong growth driven primarily by Brazil and
the Andean region. Our outlook for the region this year remains positive. We forecast the rig count to climb about 13%
to 481 rigs.
We also anticipate that Mexico will modestly improve in 2012 as both the offshore markets and the lab projects
continue to grow. We are the preferred provider of artificial lift systems throughout the region, and this has led to
significant contract extensions this quarter in Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, and Colombia.
And drilling technology is differentiating us as well. We are in the process of drilling the first horizontal well in the
pre-salt for Petrobras. This particular horizontal well has a 1,347-meter horizontal section, and the drilling and
directional performance are currently exceeding expectations.
Moving to the Middle East and Asia Pacific region, our geomarket structure is maturing and our customer intimacy
strategies are paying dividends, as we delivered strong results in every geomarket.
Looking forward, we see modest growth in these regions as the average rig count climbs over 9% this year. Much of
this growth will come from Saudi not only in Manifa, but also in other oil basins and natural gas fields throughout the
Kingdom.

In Iraq, Baker Hughes is in the process of finalizing an award from Eni for the Zubair field to manage a total of 4 rigs
and drill 60 wells.
Weekly pleased with our steady growth in Asia Pacific and encouraged by the seven new deepwater rigs that are
entering the market in 2012. Baker Hughes has a strong success rate on new deepwater projects in the region, and we
anticipate that that success will continue.
In Malaysia, we completed the first Baker Hughes Integrated Operations project for two wells in an undeveloped field.
This award was based on our capability to rapidly mobilize our crews and equipment.
In China, we completed the first shale-oil horizontal well utilizing a bundled Baker Hughes product offering that
included drill bits, rotary steerable systems, and completion tools.
Moving to the Europe, Africa, Russia Caspian region, we reported last quarter that results were negatively impacted by
a combination of high repair and maintenance costs, an increase in labor costs, and an unfavorable mix.
We're pleased to report that we've made good progress on resolving our R&M challenges, as our mix improved based
on strong seasonal product sales that fueled reasonable revenue growth with strong incrementals. In Norway, our
technology continues to differentiate as we successfully use the Kymera hybrid drill-bit technology in combination
with our AutoTrak rotary steerable system to drill further and faster than conventional bit technology. As a result, we
saved nearly two days of drilling time on a single well.
During the quarter we were also awarded a major coiled tubing and stimulation contract for a significant program in the
North Sea. And in Africa, we also had a strong quarter primarily driven by Nigeria, Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, and
exploration activity in Mozambique. Additionally, we were awarded a multiservice contract for two pre-salt offshore
rigs in Angola.
So in closing, let me summarize some key points about our results. First, we incurred increased costs and logistical
challenges related to pressure pumping. We are taking the actions to resolve these issues now. Second, excluding
pressure pumping, our D&E and C&P segments in North America delivered strong revenue growth and incremental
margins.
We continue to build on this growth and expand our multiproduct-line offering with our customers. And as a result, we
expect our revenue in North America to increase faster than the rig counts. This, combined with the continued shift to
oil-directed drilling, gives us every reason to be bullish on the long-term prospects throughout North America.
Third, our international business performed extremely well with exit margins of 16%. We're encouraged by our strong
results in Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific, as well as new opportunities in the Middle East and deepwater
markets.
And finally, Baker Hughes has a talented group of employees who are constantly focused on innovating and finding
solutions. Going forward, we will continue to build a sense of urgency in our efforts to deliver reliable products and
services, and we believe this is important as the market will reward differential reliability.
Baker Hughes has proven that we can respond to changing market conditions, and it is my expectation that we will be
the service company that best understands and anticipates our customers' needs.
So with that, Adam, let's open it up for some questions.
Adam B. Anderson
Thank you, Martin. At this point, I'll ask Regina to open the line for your questions. To give everyone a fair chance to
ask a question, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and one related follow-up question.
Regina, can we have the first question please?

Q&A
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of David Anderson with JPMorgan.
<Q - David Anderson>: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to delve into a little bit more on the supply chain issues
that you're facing in North America and how you're seeking to resolve it. Is there a particular region where this is most
acute? And I guess I'm just wondering, how much of a function of supply agreements was sand mines, or is it rail car
capacity?
Can you just kind of dig into it a little bit more? And I guess I'm just trying to understand, are you sourcing all of the
materials for your U.S. operations, or is it just some of them? Just trying to get a little bit more color on what the issues
are here.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Okay. Good morning, Dave. I would say that the issues are not the sand mines per say.
For us primarily the issue is related to getting it from our storage centers, or to, let's say, the first drop-off point to the
respective customer locations. This is a combination of rail cars as well as trucking fleets.
But you know the other issue around the supply chain is the infrastructure as well as processes and capabilities. And if I
had to look at – if I could, let's say, put it this way. The margin compression you could put it into two buckets. One is
the supply chain, and whether it's processes, a little bit of infrastructure, or capabilities, that's a longer-term issue to
resolve.
The other element of this, though, is, as Peter highlighted, some inflationary cost pressures on the materials, profit not
being the only one, fuel being one. And I expect that, relief on that, we'll see sooner, first half of the year.
<Q - David Anderson>: On a related topic, one of your main competitors yesterday was talking about their problems
with margins had to do with a lot of their customers moving out of gas basins and shifting into oil plays. And I guess
it's related also to your supply chain in different basins, but you didn't talk about this as a reason for some of your
weaker margins today, in today's call.
Is this something we should think is going to start coming into your numbers over the next quarter or two and could
lean on margins? I guess I'm just trying to understand, if pricing is stable, but it seems like there's going to be a
dislocation in this market, how are you kind of thinking about how everything's shifting here? And how do you stay in
front of this?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, actually, Dave, we, on the last call, we actually highlighted the fact that there's
costs associated with moving, and I think we used the example out of the Haynesville at the time. So, it's no surprise,
but frankly speaking, the other elements of our story are a little bit bigger than the costs associated with demobilizing
or repositioning some of these fleets.
So, yes, we experienced it; it's an element in there. But as I said, for us particularly, we had what I would consider to be
unusual challenges relative to the market associated with handling this ramping demand and some of the inefficiencies
associated with that.
<Q - David Anderson>: So – and then just lastly. So it sounds like margins are going to kind of see a little bit of a
slide over first quarter and second quarter, but you're expecting it to start recovering in the second half of the year. Did
I hear you correctly?
<A - Peter Ragauss>: Well, actually I think I said in my prepared remarks, Dave, that we expect a partial recovery in
Q1 in North America.
<Q - David Anderson>: I'm sorry.

<A - Peter Ragauss>: And that's, we think some of the costs, some of the transitory costs in pressure pumping won't
repeat in Q1, and we've also got Canada. Don't forget about Canada. It gets very strong in Q1, and that's going to help
the overall North American margin picture.
<Q - David Anderson>: But you'd expect the second half of the year to start seeing improvements on that side?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: On the supply chain, yes, Dave.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. Thank you, Martin.
Operator
Your next comes from the line of James West with Barclays Capital.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, James.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Just to follow up a little bit on Dave's question. For the second half of 2012, I know,
Martin, you're pretty confident that margins will come back. Do they come back to a level that you saw in 3Q of 2011,
as we think about kind of 3Q and 4Q 2012? Or are there some other issues that will linger and that maybe the more
normalized margin is a little bit lower than what you just saw last quarter?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: James, I think it's reasonable to expect that we could return to Q3 levels based on the,
resolving the issues, which we're fully confident that we will. Obviously market conditions have to remain constant.
But I think it's reasonable to assume that, market staying where it is, that we will get back to those, close to those
numbers, absolutely.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay. Fair enough. And then, how are you thinking about pressure pumping capacity
additions in 2012 versus the additions you made in 2011? Are we thinking higher, the same, lower? And then a related
question is, what kind of contract coverage do you currently have on your pressure pumping fleet in North America?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah. James, you have to remember for us, we had a slow start to 2011 in adding
pressure pumping capacity.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Right.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: And I would say that on a year-on-year basis, we will be up in terms of horsepower, but
we will be consistent with the run rate in the final, in this final quarter of last year, Q4. And then the second part of
your question, I'm sorry, was regarding?
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Contract coverage. I know historically you've had lower coverage on your pressure
pumping fleet, but it seems like your two bigger competitors have added a lot of coverage to their pressure pumping
assets over the last few months. I wanted to know if you'd essentially done the same thing?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes, ours has – it's increased. We're probably up to a little over 60% of what I consider to
be contract or pricing agreements. But that all said, I think as you've also heard, there are still pockets of improving
spot pricing, and we don't see that changing in the some of the oil basins.
So we're happy with our portfolio. Obviously it's not something that you can't change, but our strategy right now is to
have the mix that we have around, like I say, around 60% to 65%.
The other comment I want to make, since you asked about the capacity that's coming online, all of the fleets that we
have dedicated for U.S. Land are spoken for in terms of the basin and the customer at this point, James.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: So for all of 2012?

Your next question comes from the line of the Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Good morning. Martin, can you talk a little bit more about the – I want to ask about the
pressure pumping issues that took place. What part of the shortfall do you think was presentable that you should have
reacted quicker, whether it was lining up your proppants, gels, guar earlier? Or did you know you had these issues
when you acquired BJ and there was not much that you could have done?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, I think we should have done it all better, frankly. But the reality is that, Jim, one
way to look at this is, as the business is ramped, I think it's safe to say that the inefficiency grew along with it, given the
strain on the supply chain and the systems that we had in place. There's three areas around efficiency, I think: there's
people, there's assets, and there's products.
Our ability to get the people onboard certainly improved in the second half. Our ability to manage the assets in terms of
R&M and getting them at the right place has been a challenge. As I just mentioned to James and as you well know, we
were a little bit later to the supply addition or horsepower addition than we would have liked.
And then there's the key, is getting those products, particularly the consumables, to the right place and the right time.
And frankly, BJ just wasn't set up to scale up relative to what's happened in the market; it's that simple. And it's like I
say, though, if the issues are identified, we have resources dedicated to them.
We have absolutely no doubt that we'll get these issues fixed. As you know, we've done it on other tasks that we've had,
most recently the international project issues that we took on. So this is, we've been here before and we'll get through it.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Okay, now you indicated that you're addressing freight and fuel logistics and that you can
solve these over time. Can you, given the situation or maybe you could address again the issue of proppants, gel, guar,
shortages out there? Your supplier relationships that you have, are you at a disadvantage to your major competitors, and
can that be fixed as you go here in the next 6 months to 12 months?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's a good question, and it's been an element of, let's say, the investigative process in
Q4 as these results unfolded. I'll tell you, I'm really encouraged with just the change in our relationship status from
where we were in a different world with single vendors to multiple vendors now, on multiple of those consumable
fronts.
As well as engaging in the discussions that frankly weren't taking place like they needed to in terms of having our
suppliers respond and facilitate some of the logistical challenges that we've had. Those discussions just weren't – just as
we were probably a little late to getting horsepower into the market for a variety of reasons, I don't think we were
having the conversations that we needed to have relative to where the market was going.
So those type of things, our supply chain, a challenge, but I'm very encouraged so far with the progress we've made.
And so I don't think that's going to be a big disadvantage. The disadvantage relatively speaking will be in our own
capabilities of moving the stuff around and getting it where it needed to be, and making sure that we don't have a lot of
[ph] diverged (35:15) costs that we've incurred as a result of making similar mistakes.

Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Angie.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Martin, you guys did a very nice job of hitting your target on international margins here in
2011. Can you give us some thoughts looking forward into 2012 as far as the pace of margins, and any color on the
potential exit rate for the year?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I would expect that our exit rate will be better than it is, than what it was in Q4, Angie.
I'm encouraged by a couple of fronts internationally. One is our execution mechanisms. I mean we hit all cylinders. It
wasn't only supply chain, it was the service side. It was across all the regions and virtually all the geomarkets. I would
say that our international business is on very firm footing right now. So I'm very, very confident in our execution
ability.
The market is still a bit of a struggle. That all said, I would think that if you take an average of the environment in 2012
relative to 2011, I think it's going to be discernibly different. We're getting more pockets of tightness. I believe that the
behaviors out there in the competitive environment will be better; I generally believe that. We have some big tenders
that are still out there, and when those happen, there's heightened levels of aggressiveness. But I suspect our customers
across – beyond just the Middle East, which I think was one of the big drivers in 2011, are going increase their
spending and it'll tighten up resources pretty quick.
As well, if we don't see a softness in North America and if the Gulf of Mexico keeps moving in the direction it is, I
think you're going to find that international pricing is going to be a little bit more buoyant than it was in 2011.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay, very helpful. And then and obviously you've done a very good job of winning a number
of large awards in Iraq. Some of your peers, I mean, we could say you're going to see the same. Could you initially
have a negative impact on your margins in the first half of 2012 as you mobilize equipment into Iraq and have the
natural growing pains of starting up and ramping up those projects?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I think there's risk associated. Obviously, we've seen it on some of the projects we've
been on so far. And this award that you're referring to is the biggest awarded to-date in Iraq. So, yes, there is some risk,
but I'm not too worried about that. The way we've worked with both parties, the customer as well as the SOC, in
mapping out the rigs and getting the resources, I don't – we're not planning on seeing anything real impactful barring if
it goes according to a, I think, a pretty conservative plan.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay. Okay, thanks, very helpful.

count or are we going to perform in line or underperform the rig count?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: No, I – we're going to outperform the rig count. I made the reference in Canada in terms
of the complexity of all these wells.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Yeah.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: But the service intensity hasn't changed. It's only getting better. And let me just take the
opportunity with your question to say, this margin compression is I would venture to say very much our issue, Bill.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Right.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Okay? And I think that needs to be understood. This isn't a market-driven issue that we
can see at this stage.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay, that's clear. Thank you, Martin. And then secondly, with regard to your capital
spending budget, up pretty considerably year-over-year. And I'm struck by the magnitude of the increase considering
the digestion challenges you're having right now with regard to the supply chain and logistics and putting capacity to
work.
Walk me through the rationale there with regard to the 30% to 35% increase in capital spending. Is this purely to meet
growth? Is it part of a replacement cycle exercise in terms of freshening up your fleet and retiring more obsolete older
equipment, new lines of businesses? Walk me through the buckets of capital spending allocation.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, I'll give you as much I'm comfortable providing on this call.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: First of all, there is an element, an increased element from last year to this year of
replacement and also pressure pumping equipment that goes to the front line for efficiency enhancement. There is a
record level in this budget for non-pressure pumping CapEx.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Both in terms of rental tools as well as infrastructure.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Okay? So, it's not all a horsepower story on our CapEx. And then as I think I mentioned
on one of the previous questions, Bill, we're only staying pace with what we delivered in Q4. So, yes, it's a
year-on-year increase, but the first quarter particularly was completely unrepresentative of what we needed to be
delivering in the world of pressure pumping.
And so, yes, the fleets that hit in Q4 strain our organization, absolutely. But it's part of what we have to work through,
is being able to scale the other sides of the support, the people, the capabilities, and the infrastructure that handle those
fleets as they come onstream. So, we're comfortable where we are relative to that horsepower add.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. And just two very quick ones from me in terms of housekeeping items. Peter, you
mentioned Q1 margins, a partial recovery. Should we think about Q1 landing somewhere, in terms of North America,
should we think about North American margins in Q1 landing somewhere between Q4 and Q3?
<A - Peter Ragauss>: Yeah. Partial recovery I would say is less than half of the sort of basis points that we lost from
Q3 to Q4.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Peter Ragauss>: So, yeah, it definitely is between those two bookends, but I would say kind of the lower end of
those bookends. But we expect a meaningful partial recovery, if you will.

quite understand it. The meaningful uptick in corporate expense with regard to the guidance for 2012, what's driving
that?
<A - Peter Ragauss>: Part of that is the $10 million per quarter of the non-cash amortization of the BJ trade name,
which we put an 8-K out right before Christmas. And then Q4 was unusually low. We got down to $64 million or so,
and we still have SAP implementation going on worldwide for BJ. And also in Q1, you typically – you have
share-based comp hitting the corporate line as well, so it comes up in Q1.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Hill with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
<Q - Joe Hill>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joe Hill>: Martin, when I think about the seasonal improvement in international margin, I tend to think in terms
of around 150 basis points for the fourth quarter. But I know you guys had record orders on the books going into the
quarter, and I'm just curious as to whether or not we can try and dial in the level of seasonal headwind in Q1 a little bit,
given those record orders?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Joe, it wasn't record level orders. I'm not going to tell you what it was, but it's by no
means as it – is big as it's been in some of the previous years. Peter, you want to add something?
<A - Peter Ragauss>: Yeah, as it turns out, I'll try to answer that more specifically. We had about $50 million in
product sales that we don't expect to repeat in Q1. And then typically in Q1, you've got weather and mix. Weather
really hits you in Russia, the North Sea, Asia-Pac; that's probably of a similar magnitude. So add those up, you, maybe
$100 million or so of revenues impacting Q1 relative to Q4 with pretty healthy decrementals there.
<Q - Joe Hill>: Okay. That's very helpful. Just as a follow-up, Martin, I was wondering if you would talk about the
pricing environment by product line for, say, non-pressure pumping C&T and then for drilling and evaluation?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah, Joe, what I'm comfortable telling you, we still have very good price traction in – at
least being led by drilling services. Behind that would be artificial lift, and that would be followed by completion tools,
in that order. All of them up, and I would forecast all of them to be up this time next year.
And when we're talking price, I'm not talking new technology or anything else. I'm simply talking about the price
improvement we can get from the supply and demand situation, as well as the performance that's out there. And on the
– I'd say it's probably flat on areas such as drill bits and wireline services. That answers your question?
<Q - Joe Hill>: It does. Thanks a lot, Martin.

Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Hey, thank you very much. Just to follow-up on Joe's question, were those comments relating to
North America or were they global?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Ole, they were North America.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Okay. If we look a little bit overseas, what do you think will be the strongest regions for you next
year? You highlighted – you spoke very favorably on Latin America, yet Latin America seems to be the area where
your margins lagged a little bit in the recovery into the fourth quarter.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I would say that our most optimistic region is the Middle East. Not only Iraq, but just
given the announcements that have come out from a variety of the customers, as well as our increasing position there in
terms of I think share and relationships. The geo market model has most every region of Eastern Hemisphere, but I
think our geo market model there, our leadership that we have in place has done a excellent job of positioning Baker
Hughes concurrent with the increase in the spending environment.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Okay, and back to the Iraqi question again. Security seems to have gone from bad to worse. Are you
afraid that this party might disappoint a little bit by more slippage of start of the project?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I'm going to let Peter answer that. He was – just came back from there. Peter?
<A - Peter Ragauss>: Yeah, Ole, I was just there two months ago for the day, and security is – you've never seen
security like you have it there and it's required. But one thing I will say is that the security situation there, physical
security, hasn't changed at all in the past couple of months. In fact, I think it's remarkable that the Iraqi security forces
haven't had really any major events. You've had random acts of attacks probably at the same pace as you had for the
past seven years.
In fact, if anything they've come down in the region in which we operate, which is in the south near Basra. So I think
it's holding together pretty nicely. I think the biggest challenge is, the mother of all challenges in Iraq is just the
logistics and getting things through the bureaucracy, getting things through customs, moving things around in a safe
manner. And that hasn't – that, we expect to improve over time. So I think there's some unfounded fear, and so for the
past few months have been pretty uneventful, quite frankly.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: That's good to hear. Just finally, on the bridge from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, I mean
North America higher. It sounds like both the U.S. is rebounding a little bit on operations and Canada has its seasonal
positives. And then internationally you have the product sales and a few other things. So, could you help – how should
we think about sequential earnings into the first quarter, up or down?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Down. I think you could see flattish from oil field ops. But don't forget we've got
corporate cost increasing $20 million, as we mentioned. Tax rate, we said it was going to be between 34% and 35%,
and that compares to the 31% and change we had this quarter. So just those two items are $0.09 in and of themselves,
and we also said Industrial will be a little bit lower on an operating basis.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: So those down and oil field up a little bit sequentially, okay?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I said oil field flattish and a few other negatives.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Okay. Thank you very much for clarifying.

<Q - Bradley Handler>: Maybe to come back on a couple of issues quickly. I had gotten the impression that you were
– you had labor shortages as a challenge in Canada in Q4. I'm not sure we really addressed that on this call. But is that
case? And does that in any way hamper your opportunity in Q1 to take advantage of the winter season? It doesn't sound
like it, but I'm just curious for some more color on that?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: No, that's a good question, Brad. Labor is a big problem in the province of Alberta. I
think unemployment is probably like it is in the Bakken. So it's affecting everybody; it's a challenge. I think we're
working through it very well. Our organization up there is doing a terrific job of making sure that we're able to take
care of our customers.
But it certainly is a limiter, and I think it's very safe to say that all of us are going to experience – turn down work in Q1
in Canada, given the inability to staff every opportunity. But that's the way it is in a high peak environment like the
winter months of Canada, particularly prior to a drop off of Q2.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: But I guess it's your sense that you've made enough progress that you're not differentially
hurt?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: No, no, not at – in fact, I would say we're probably the least hurt. I think you're going to
find the industry very challenged up there, but given our size and the importance of the business to our customers up
there in terms of our position, we're not disadvantaged at all.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Okay. Have you guys done the backward calculation of what Q4 revenues sort of should
have looked like for you in North America, had you been able to get the materials where they needed to be?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Can you share that with us?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: No.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Okay. And then maybe if I could slip one more in, please. Could...
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Since I didn't answer that one, go ahead.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Yeah, right, that's what I figured. Revenue, if I think about that – sort of a similar question
maybe internationally, but how did revenue growth, how did revenues compare with your expectations in the fourth
quarter? I know the margins came through.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I'd say right in line, a little bit more favorable in terms of the product mix.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Okay.

Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Peter Ragauss>: Good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: [indiscernible] (54:00) Just wanted to try and get a general sense, you guys referenced that you
think you'd be able to grow your international revenues faster than the rig count; that's been a common refrain from the
other large competitors so far.
So, general sense, do you think that if we go back and kind of look at the growth rates relative to rig count in prior
periods, do you get a feeling that 2012 you guys can actually grow revenues faster than you have historically relative to
the rig count? Are there certain dynamics that we need to be aware of that would cause that? Do you think it might be
slower? Just trying to look at some relative sense of magnitude potentially on how to think about it for 2012.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Kurt, on the revenue side, I would say that the rig count – consistent with the rig count is
a safe bet. And I can't forecast any reasons why there'd be any variances up or down from what that is right now. If we
see any shock in pricing on the upside, then obviously that would change pretty quickly. But, I think, right down the
middle of the fairway with the rig counts is where to be.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: And then, you guys have been spot-on here with your execution and performance on the
international front, as you said, exiting 2011 here with a 16% kind of margin. With pricing as competitive as it is and
volume growing, what kind of incremental margins do you think you'll be able achieve on the international front going
out into 2012?
And I think at some point you may have referenced that 2012 exit rate; your target would be I think consistent with the
peer group average or something along those lines. So I was just wondering if you can give us an updated view on that?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I think you could, Kurt, model in 20% incrementals on the revenue next year, I think, is a
place to be.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. And then I just appreciate being that explicit, thanks. On the North American front, I don't
want to beat this one to death here, but from a pricing standpoint, we've heard pricing down in the gas basins and

pricing up in the oil and liquid basins, and we've heard a pretty consistent refrain on supply chain and cost inflation. So,
I understand all that. I was just wondering if you can give some order of magnitude of change in the pricing that you're
seeing in the gas basins in which you're still active, knowing that's going to be coming down in terms of volume.
And what the general range of price increments you're able to get out of the oil and liquids basins? Once again, just role
of magnitude. Is it like 10% down in gas, and 10% up in oil and liquid? Can you just give us some general sense of
what's going on in the market?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah, no, I appreciate the question and trying to get some greater transparency. What I'd
say at this stage is that the increases in the oil basins are offsetting the compression in the gas basins. Now obviously,
as you've heard, people are repositioning their fleets given the apparent – for the oncoming softness in some of the gas
basins.
The way we look at this is, this market is – I would say we're still in the very early stages of this unconventional – these
unconventional plays. And I know that might be very hard for a lot of people to understand given how rapidly they've
come on the scene. But in talking to our customers, tens of thousands of locations are coming up in these discussions to
be drilled in these plays like the Marcellus, the Eagle Ford, and even the Utica.
And, Kurt, when you see that kind of outlook, it's – you can't but conclude that adding additional capacity, and not only
in pressure pumping but also in roofline and rental tools, is absolutely the right way to go forward.
And so there may be a little bit of weakness in some of these basins until things settle down and you get the right
balance of supply and demand balance. But overall, collectively there's no softness in the price, and I wouldn't expect it
to be anything dramatic even if it does soften in a couple places.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. And then just final, on the horsepower you referenced practically every four weeks now,
so that supply chain's loosening. Was that just specific to the U.S. or what kind of allocation are you going to have
between the U.S., Canada, and international?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's our global capacity, and I don't want to share exactly what's dedicated, but as I did
say, we'll be delivering more. But I would tell you that a meaningful amount of it is skid-mounted and beyond what's
going international can be rerouted as necessary.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay, so not even a tidbit on the allocation to Canada maybe?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: No.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay, all right. Thanks for your candor. I appreciate it.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: You're welcome.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Martin, I was curious, as we think about international margin growth opportunities here, is
there anything left at this point as it relates to margin improvement from the move you've made from a product service
line to a geomarket model? And also anything on the supply chain that's left in the international markets here that could
be additive to margins during 2012?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: The answer is, on both of those, yes.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. Anything – is it quantifiable? Is it not, necessarily?

<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, no – I mean we quantified it as part of our continuous improvement plans with
regards to margins. But I wouldn't say is – I think what you're referring to, Bill, is that in the early stages of our
improvement process, there was a lot of internal – it was internally driven in terms of aligning cost structure with where
the market was.
That's played off in the second half and it's getting smaller, but it's still something that we're working towards. But it's –
the majority of any margin expansion is likely to come from mix improvements, price, or just volume as costs are
absorbed.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Sure. My follow-up would be, I guess, Martin, you've been candid here that this quarter
represented for you getting less out of BJ Services than I think you guys had hoped for.
I'm just curious as to the decision to minimize the use of the BJ Services trade name. Was that something that internally
you guys decided needed to be done because you were disappointed, if you will, in the progress there? Or was that
something really more externally driven by your customers? Can you just talk a little bit about that decision?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah, now look there's absolutely no connection between our decision, which is a
business decision, a long-term decision, with regards to the name. I mean, it's a powerful brand, obviously, as you can
tell by the numbers that are out here, quite a bit of value associated with it.
But it's in keeping with the movement from a product-line-driven company to a geographical-based company. Some of
our service names are no longer in the portfolio that you may have been familiar with before within Baker Hughes in
the legacy side. Some of the strong product names like Hughes Christensen and Centrilift, they still get the banner.
But the service lines have – the product line names have been deemphasized, and it's just in keeping with the Baker
Hughes strategy that took off two years ago when we reorganized the company.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. Thank you, Martin, for the time.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Very welcome.
<A - Adam B. Anderson>: Thanks, Bill. Regina, at this point, we'll take one final question.
Operator
Our final question will come from the line of Scott Gruber with Bernstein.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Yes, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Martin, a quick follow-up on your CapEx
guidance, is the growth rate in international CapEx more or less than the total if we utilize the midpoint of your
guidance range?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Could you ask that another way?
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Well, is the rate of international CapEx growth more or less than I think it was about 32%
growth year-on-year, if you use the midpoint of your CapEx guidance?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I'd say it's probably around that number; let's just say it's consistent with that.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Okay. And an unrelated follow-up, can you provide an update on the appetite for the
multistage completion systems that you've recently developed? Especially since some of these systems can help
improve operating efficiency, are the completion sleeves gaining traction outside of the Bakken?
And if you could also comment on the annular fracking, which I believe you've recently introduced in the U.S.?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah. Scott, these sliding sleeves, the product development folks have been just
incredible in terms of continually upgrading these. And we introduced it; we have the lion's share of the positions,

particularly in the Bakken. We've taken it to the next level with the DirectConnect teleport type of technology. In this
particular case, 32-stage capability, but within each stage, 10 sleeves open, more than twice the nearest competitor.
So I wouldn't want to say that you've got 300-some fracs on their capability, but a lot of initiation frontage on that
reservoir face. It's just really incredible technology, and I hand it to our North America guys and our product guys.
And on the OptiPort technology, which is an infinite number of stages capability. It's really, really, really strong in
Canada, and we've done a handful of jobs with very good success. And I expect it'll take off, but like a lot of things in
this business, they have longer take-off runs than we'd like. But it's going to give the customers another option in our
portfolio in completions.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Okay. So, it sounds like improvement over the course of 2012, but not a meaningful transition
towards some of these products, is that a fair assessment?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah, I wouldn't say it's a step change, but it's a continuation of the growth. We have
quite a bit of growth planned in that product line 2012 relative to 2011.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Okay, great. Thanks for the color.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: You're welcome.
