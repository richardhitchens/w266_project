And with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to Lachlan.
Lachlan Keith Murdoch
Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from today's earnings release, we have delivered a solid
fiscal year performance, driven by increases in affiliate revenues in both our domestic and international businesses, as
well as gains in advertising revenue. Despite continued foreign exchange headwinds and a particularly difficult film
comparison, we have grown our adjusted EBITDA and revenues for the year.
But before James and I provide further commentary on our financial results, let me first say a few words about Fox
News, which has been the news over recent weeks. Two weeks ago, we received and accepted Roger Ailes resignation
as the CEO of the business, and our father took up the responsibility of leading Fox News as Chairman and Acting
CEO.
Throughout this process, we have moved quickly and decisively to protect the business, to protect its employees, and to
protect the unique and important voice Fox News broadcasts. There is no one more dedicated or more able to transition
Fox News to new leadership, than its founder.
As Acting CEO, he joins an existing team that is extraordinarily strong and equally devoted to its success. The Fox
News Channel is on track to have its highest-rated year ever, and has led all of basic cable in both primetime and total
day for three full months this calendar year.
In fact, 2016 has been a pivotal year for the entire company. We executed well against our strategic objectives,
delivering standout creative output, advancing innovation for customers and further driving improvements in how we
monetize our content.
We have managed succession at both the top of the company and in our divisions, allowing us to drive fundamental
changes throughout the business. From the film studio to the network, from National Geographic to STAR TV, across
all our businesses, we are intensely focused on capturing the valuable opportunities that new technologies and
emerging mediums present us.
And these opportunities are significant. Downstream innovation has meaningfully increased both choice and
consumption for consumers. Demand for premium content, including live sports, news, and scripted entertainment has
never been stronger. In this environment, value will continue to accrue to the strongest video brands and to the
distinctive storytelling that defines Fox. The strengthening of our channel brands has been at the center of our strategy.
Over the last couple of years, increased programming investment across our portfolio, as well as the launches of FXX,
FOX Sports 1, and STAR Sports are now bearing fruit. The dividends these investments are yielding are clear.
As our core brands are fundamental to emerging streaming services like Sony and Sling TV, as well as Hulu's
forthcoming DMVPD service, which we expect will launch early next year. These services understand and value the
emergence of the core bundle that our brands underpin. These and other emerging platforms will aggregate the best
channels at reduced cost, offering unsurpassed user experience and economics to the consumer, while substantially
increasing the number of distributors competing for our content.
And today, we are excited to welcome Time Warner to Hulu as a shareholder. Since developing that era of Hulu 10
years ago, Hulu has grown from strength to strength and now serves over 11 million subscribers. Time Warner's
investment is a testament to all that the Hulu business has achieved, and we're confident Time Warner's brands will
play an important role in Hulu's ongoing success.
The handful of content creators with the breadth and scale that we have, clearly have the advantage in a world where
technological innovation is opening the door for new distribution. In 2016, we once again demonstrated our ability to
consistently create content that delivers audiences and acclaim. For example, our film studio set on a first time director
broke a box office record with Deadpool, which grossed $760 million on a modest production budget.

Our television studio delivered three of the season's top four broadcast series and we were recognized with a total of
144 Emmy nominations across primetime and sports. But, I'd be remised if I didn't also recognize that while you need
to measure the film business over a multi-year cycle, the recent three sequels we released clearly fell short of the
expectations we had going into them. It is our goal to be far more consistent with this output.
As I said earlier, the opportunities ahead of us are significant and the pursuing and participating in these opportunities,
we view our balance sheet, underpinned by our strong credit rating, to be a strategic asset of the company to be
deployed towards the highest long-term return initiatives.
With that in mind, today we announced a 20% increase to our annualized dividend and an additional buyback
authorization of $3 billion. However, we will be highly selective on the deployment of capital towards this
authorization over the next 12 months.
Our priority and how we annually allocate our capital will be to invest in accretive, long-term growth opportunities, to
investing in our existing businesses, new initiatives, or acquisitions with both financial and strategic benefits.
We are very focused on using our capital toward sustained long-term growth, but to the extent that opportunities do not
emerge, we have the flexibility to use excess cash towards buybacks, as we did with the $8 billion we received from the
sale of the Sky businesses.
I'll now turn it over to John.
John P. Nallen
Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Let me start with a full-year financial results focusing on total company adjusted
revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes in the prior-year the DBS businesses we sold to Sky.
For the full-year, total adjusted revenues were $27.3 billion, up 1% over last year and up 4% excluding the negative
impact from foreign exchange. These increases were from higher revenues at both our Cable Networks and Television
segments, partially offset by reductions at our Film business.
Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the full-year was $6.6 billion, a 2% increase over a year-ago, led by the Cable
Network segment, partially offset by lower results at our Film segment. Overall, unfavorable foreign currency rates
reduced our EBITDA results by approximately $380 million, and reduced our growth rate by 6 percentage points.
Reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders this year was $2.8 billion or $1.42 per share,
while adjusted EPS was $1.73 this year compared to last year's $1.72.
Now turning to the fourth quarter results, revenues increased 7% over last year and were up 9% excluding foreign
exchange, led by double-digit growth at our Cable Network segment. Total segment EBITDA for the fourth quarter
was $1.45 billion, a 6% decline from year-ago, which primarily reflects the expected lower contributions from our Film
segment and an approximate $50 million negative impact from foreign exchange, which contributed over half of the
quarterly decline.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported EPS of $0.30 in the fourth quarter, while adjusted EPS was $0.45, up
$0.15 from the comparable $0.39 last year. Included in this year's adjusted result is a $0.07 per share tax benefit
resulting from a ruling we received.
So, now let me provide some additional context on the performance at our operating segments in the fourth quarter
starting with the Cable Network segment, where total segment EBITDA of $1.2 billion was basically even with last
year on revenue growth of 10%. Excluding an approximate $40 million negative impact from currency rates, segment
EBITDA grew 3% in the quarter.
Domestic cable revenues increased 10% in total, from affiliate fee growth of 6% and 13% advertising growth. The
advertising growth reflects higher ratings and pricing at Fox News and our national sports channels as well as a 2

percentage point benefit from this year's consolidation of the acquired National Geographic businesses.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 7%, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially offset by contractual
sports right increases and streaming rights costs at the RSNs, higher political costs at Fox News, and the inclusion of
approximately $25 million of EBITDA losses in the recently acquired NatGeo businesses, principally resulting from
acquisition-related items recorded during this quarter.
Fourth quarter reported international cable revenues grew 10%, driven by a 9% increase in reported affiliate revenues,
which were up 19%, excluding currency impacts. Reported international advertising revenues were 6% lower than last
year as negative foreign currency movements more than offset low single-digit local advertising growth. Additionally
content revenues doubled, reflecting the syndication of soccer rights and the outcast series outside of our markets.
Reported international EBITDA decreased 25% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenue, offset by costs from
new sports rights, digital expansion initiatives, and increased marketing. The international EBITDA decline reduces by
half when factoring out the negative impact of currency movements.
Turning to our Television segment, fourth quarter EBITDA was $31 million above last year, largely reflecting a 9%
increase in the FOX Broadcast Network entertainment advertising revenues from higher pricing as well as increased
non-linear and retransmission consent revenues. These revenue gains were partially offset by increased entertainment
programming and marketing expenses.
At the Film segment, we reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $164 million, $105 million below last year. This
anticipated decline was primarily driven by the inclusion of significant releasing costs for the newest X-Men,
Independence Day and Ice Age theatrical releases as well as Mike and Dave.
From a capital standpoint, we ended the fiscal year with $4.4 billion in cash and approximately $19.7 billion in debt.
During the fiscal year, we delivered $5.5 billion in capital returns to shareholders, and as of today, we completed
slightly over 90% of our $5 billion share repurchase authorization. We expect to complete the balance of this
authorization over the year.
The absolute level of capital returns to shareholders has been robust over the last three years, well exceeding our annual
cash flow generation, and has us now sitting at the upper limit of our stated gross debt target of 2.5 to 3 times.
So, as we look to fiscal 2017, there were a few items worth drawing attention to, on which we have visibility. At our
Cable Networks, we have 15% to 20% of our domestic subscriber base coming up for renewal annually over the next
couple of years with the next round of renewals scheduled for early calendar 2017. Therefore, the pace of our domestic
affiliate fee rate growth should accelerate in the back half of our fiscal year.
On the Cable Networks cost side, while we don't have any major new sports rights kicking in next year, we'll have the
extra five months of expenses from the acquired NatGeo businesses, and as James will discuss, we'll invest around
$200 million toward a refresh of the NatGeo global programming and the expansion of original series at FX.
Turning to the Television segment, the upcoming year's revenues and costs will be influenced by two main factors: our
broadcast of Super Bowl LI and the election cycle. Excluding the Super Bowl, segment expenses are anticipated to
increase in the mid-single-digit range, led by planned increases in international sports contracts and by slightly higher
marketing investments at the Fox Network to support a higher volume of new series. Aggregate retransmission
revenues are expected to continue to grow at a low-double-digit annual pace.
Additionally, as of today, except for sterling, spot rates for the major currencies that we operate in are roughly similar
to the average exchange rates we experienced for the entirety of fiscal 2016. On its face, if these rates hold for the
full-year, that would suggest a nominal impact from foreign exchange on our fiscal 2017 full-year EBITDA results. At
the moment, the most significant impact to our results from the decline in sterling would be our translation of Sky's
equity earnings.
So, two final items to call out. First, our reported tax rate is expected to approach the full U.S. statutory rate next year.
And second, as Lachlan mentioned, today we increased our dividend and announced a new buyback authorization of $3

billion, which is open-ended as to its timeframe. And we'll be very selective in deploying capital toward this over the
next 12 months.
And with that, let me turn it over to James.
James Rupert Murdoch
Thanks very much, John and Lachlan, and hello to all of you, and thanks again for joining us. We've made a lot of
progress over the last year, but much remains to be done. I want to just highlight a few key things and give you a sense
of what we're super focused on, and then we can cover whatever you want in the Q&A after.
First of all, as I said last quarter, we want to make our programming and products more available, not less, and we want
to grow our capabilities in monetizing these brands and programs with our partners. And we want to enable a customer
experience for our viewers that is truly simple and great.
Our work with Hulu is a key part of this, as is our licensing to other MVPDs, over-the-top or otherwise. We want to be
flexible in our approach, though, to deliver the best experience to customers and the most value to our partners and
shareholders.
Our progress this last year puts us in a strong position in this regard. Our focus on product innovation and on ensuring
our brands and content are core to new services as they proliferate are drivers of future growth, but it's fair to say that
across the board from our organization structure to our commercial capability, from creative investment to talent
recruitment, we're moving at a fast pace today and are focused on improving our operations worldwide.
We've restructured the leadership team at Fox Networks Group, embarked on leadership transition at the film studio,
streamlined the cost base across the business, completed the integration of the three Sky's, completed the integration of
the newly acquired National Geographic businesses, completed the acquisition and integration of MAA TV and
completed an integrated Shine into the new Endemol Shine Group.
Now this past year, we've seen a flurry of M&A activity in the sector. And I want to be clear, please pay attention to
what we've chosen and choose not to do. While we never rule out opportunities to invest inorganically, we've set a high
bar with respect to how we intend to use capital and that bar will remain high.
In this coming year, while we certainly have challenges, we couldn't be more excited about where these businesses are
and what they can achieve. FOX Sports is looking forward to one of its best years ever. We start the year with strong
ratings for baseball at the RSNs, and we expect this NFL season, including Super Bowl LI on Fox, to be as good as
ever. And FOX Sports 1, already having overtaken ESPN2 in prime across all demos, including total viewers, is just
starting to hit its stride.
A full revamp of the National Geographic Channel's creative output starting in earnest with Mars this autumn and
continuing with mega documentary, One Strange Rock, and scripted programming like the upcoming Genius. Early
response from advertisers and critics couldn't be more enthusiastic as we start to see what a fully aligned business
organized around a global super brand like National Geographic is capable of.
At FX, we're expanding from 15 to 18 original scripted series. These included Atlanta from Donald Glover, Taboo with
Tom Hardy, Legion, which is set in the X-Men universe and is created by Fargo showrunner Noah Hawley, and Trust,
from the Slumdog Millionaire team of Danny Boyle, Simon Beaufoy and Christian Colson.
It's clear we have work to do at the film studio. Some of our major releases, as Lachlan said, did not meet expectations,
and that means we're starting the year with a bit of a hill to climb. But, we're energized about our upcoming pipeline
with releases such Miss Peregrine's School (sic) [Home] for Peculiar Children, War of the Planet of the Apes,
Kingsman 2, Assassin's Creed, Hidden Figures and Birth of a Nation all in the next 12 months, just as work has
accelerated on the much-anticipated next installment of Jim Cameron's Avatar.

Profit growth at STAR in India is accelerating. The business is in rude health and the peak investment years are behind
us as profitability towards our target progresses. We'll continue to invest in hotstar, our over-the-top mobile video
service. With over 50 million active users currently, we see this as a key opportunity to achieve real leadership in an
important category. In addition, we plan to expand its service beyond India this year, targeting the global South Asian
diaspora.
Sky, in its three European markets, is making great progress as the business broadens, opens up new customer
segments and develops more products and services, growing its customer base, revenues and profits.
And domestically, Hulu's velocity is picking up too, with over 11 million paying subs and exciting new live and
on-demand service set to launch in early 2017. With Disney, Time Warner, Fox and more to come participating in this
ground-breaking new product, we're very excited about Hulu's future.
And we also saw strong advertising demand in this year's upfront with revenue growth driven by healthy pricing and
volume increases across broadcast and cable. We also expect to build upon last year's momentum in non-linear
advertising gains.
So in summary, it's an exciting time. The vibrant downstream market is emerging, which will help drive affiliate
income and advertising innovation in the future. The overall TV advertising picture is healthy, our creative output is
strong, notwithstanding some disappointments at the film company. And lastly, but most importantly, the talent inside
the businesses is tremendous and focused on delivering growth. In an era of constant change, our disdain for the status
quo is our greatest strength.
Now, we'd like to take your questions. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you very much. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan
Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thank you. Good afternoon. James, just picking up on India, can you give us a
sense for what STAR delivered in the fiscal year that just closed as we think about that $500 million target that you've
laid out for 2018? Are you still on pace for that?
And just going back to the film studio, if you don't mind, I think you guys had your toughest year since 2011 in terms
of EBITDA contribution. What are you doing among the things you can control or impact, what are you and the team
doing at the studio to try to improve profitability there, acknowledging that obviously it's a hit-driven business and
there's a creative element to all this stuff? Thank you.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Ben. So, first of all, on STAR, look, fiscal 2016 was very strong, actually. As
you know, in the previous year, we invested probably 100% of the profits of the business of the entertainment business
into the growth of the sports business, but that's really turned now. So for this last fiscal year, the STAR business
overall, inclusive of sports, delivered just north of $200 million of EBITDA and we've met with this in a really good
pace for our 2018 and 2020 targets. So, we're really pleased with that performance. And I think, as we see the
investments really start to pay off there and the velocity of the business continue, it's on track.
And look, with respect to the film studio, I think one of the things that Lachlan said in his remarks about consistency is
really important. It's about consistency of creative output. It's about really focusing on having the best partners we can
have and the process in terms of the decisions on production starts, on new projects, et cetera, really functioning more
consistently and better. And I think, as I mentioned earlier, we've embarked on leadership transition there.
There are changes in the future that we want to make; but fundamentally, as you said, it's a hits-driven business. We
need to be more consistently great in a marketplace as competitive as it is, when it's hard to get a family off the couch

and out to the theater.
So, we had some great success in the year. If I look back at the Mars and our Deadpool or things like that, things that
are distinctive that are where we can take risks, where we're doing things that maybe other studios aren't doing and
provide something really different in the marketplace. I think the slate coming up is very promising, but it's going to be
tough to judge the film studio in any one quarter. It's really over a period of time.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: I think that's right, James. And I think that you have to remember that the studio was
part of the voluntary buyout program last year. So, there are a significant amount of cost savings that will underpin its
results. But ultimately, it's about having a higher standard for storytelling and then making better movies.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thank you, both.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Ben. Could we have next question please, operator?
Operator
Thank you. That will come from Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thank you. A couple of questions. On Hulu, what else do you need to launch? I think,
James, you mentioned that more content will come in. Are they coming in as investors or just part of the package? And
how should we think about demand for a lower priced OTT service?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Jessica. Look, as I mentioned, Hulu, we do expect more partners, more
content companies, more programmers and brands to be represented in the new Hulu service. Hulu is in discussions
with a number of those potential providers and suppliers currently. And as those come to completion and we get closer
to a launch of the service, I know Hulu will be communicating about that. There are no discussions currently about
additional equity investments. We think we've got a great set of partners in this business, and we're very excited about
it.
So, I think over the next number of months, as we see us complete some of the supply agreements, you'll see more
detail around the content offering and the full breadth of it, which we think is exciting. I think it's important to note that
we do think that in this re-bundling that's going on, there's significant demand for great television. There's significant
demand for a great customer experience and we want to be able to deliver it at the lowest price that we can.
Fundamentally, that limits Hulu's ability, right, to just go and pay anything for a lot of programming. We have to focus
on what's the programming that really, really matters and what's going to drive consumption and what are people going
to love. So I think it will be as I've described it before, kind of a core package, a core bundle there that we want to have
a great entry point for customers to come in. That's not to say that premium offerings won't be there. Hulu's been a very
successful seller of Showtime as a premium add-on to its SVOD product today and we would expect agreements like
that to continue to be announced as well.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Okay. And then just a couple of other questions, just quickly. Given the importance
of Fox News to the company, could you give us any color on any potential strategic shifts? Or will it be business as it
is? And then one follow-up on STAR. On hotstar, is there anything you can say about what Indian consumers are
actually watching the most? And how you think about the monetization potential of that service?
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: So, Jessica, I'll start with Fox News. As we've seen this year will be one the best
years, or the best year, for Fox News ever. There's no desire or need to shift the position that it has in the market. It's a
very successful business and we are just undergoing a transition to new leadership. That should not flag at all a
transition of the underlying positioning or the strategy of the channels.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: And, Jessica, with respect to hotstar, it's interesting. In the beginning, we saw pretty
severe sort of volatility and spikes largely around sports viewership on the hotstar platform, so when there was a big
cricket tournament or something like that. But gradually over the last year, what's really built and gotten much more

momentum is scripted programming. It's Indian scripted programming in multiple languages and that's really driving –
that's been the most gratifying thing to see more consistent viewership of that, and that's really a big, big part of the
volume now. And it's the fastest growing part of the volume on a consistent basis is local Indian scripted programming
at a very high volume. So, there's a lot of shows, full series stacks, all of that sort of stuff of the many, many thousands
of hours that we produce there every year.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Jessica. Operator, next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. The next question will come from Steven Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven Cahall>: Yeah. Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions. Maybe first on the SVOD side, I think
you maybe communicated in the past a willingness to keep more SVOD in house for the foreseeable future. We've seen
a couple of deals, American Crime Story as well as Homeland. I was wondering if you could just update us on your
SVOD strategy.
And then also in the RSN, there's been some articles lately about the strength of the ratings at RSN. You called out
some of the streaming cost you've now got. I wonder if you could let us know maybe what percentage of your RSN do
you now have exclusive streaming rights, and if there will be a pricing revenue upside tail that we'll see on that in the
future.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Steven. Look, as I mentioned in the remarks before, we do want to be
flexible in terms of our approach to licensing. I mean we want to do something that makes sense. The recent American
Crime Story agreement with Netflix we thought just made a lot of sense. It's an anthology series, so sequential stacking
of multiple seasons is less crucial, because it's not serialized across seasons. But we were able to secure the current
season full stack and avoid or not give up the kind of holdbacks that had been characterizing some of these agreements
in the past.
So, we think it makes a lot of sense for customers watching American Crime Story on FX or on FX NOW. So you have
the full in-season stack for the current seasons. And it was just a very, very attractive agreement for subsequent seasons
for us and for our partners in the show. So, you think you don't want to be too orthodox about it, but I think the
important thing here was this preserves really the customer experience that we're seeking to deliver. And for an
anthology series like this, we thought it was just a great deal for the company and for shareholders.
<Q - Steven Cahall>: But it certainly doesn't signal any shift in strategy and how we deal with SVODs?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: And then the streaming rights on the RSNs for the MLB and the NBA are in place,
authenticated in market streaming rights. And we think that's a great part of their value proposition. Look, these are
channels and brands that absolutely are enormously successful from a viewing perspective in their markets.
If I look at all of the MLB teams, in the first half of the season so far I think 10 MLB teams were rated number one in
primetime in their markets on nights that they play and half of those teams are on Fox RSNs. So, we combine that with
streaming opportunities, when we combine that with what we're able to do in sort of a TV Everywhere type
environment, we think that's one of their core value propositions to our MVPD partners both existing MVPDs and
future MVPDs.

<Q - Richard Greenfield>: Hi. I wanted to ask a question on I know you're still negotiating with other partners for the
Hulu virtual MVPD but just wondering, how do you think about the importance of having all four broadcast networks?
Kind of Hulu launch be successful if you don't have CBS? And I guess along that same theme, if you don't have all of
your affiliates on board for the launch and you only have the O&O's, will it basically be like what Sony Vue and Sling,
where it's next day access versus the live linear? And will you move forward or will you wait till you have all the
affiliates and all four broadcast networks on board?
And then just a quick housekeeping. I think someone said earlier that Hulu now has over 11 million subs, at the Hulu
upfront back in May, Mike Hopkins had said that by the end of the month that you have over 12 million Hulu
subscribers. So, just checking, did the number decline from May until now? I'm just wanting to ask a follow-up on that.
Thanks.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Rich. So, first of all, just to note, I mean, Hulu is in negotiations with a
variety of suppliers, as I mentioned, around the new MVPD, and it wouldn't be right to comment on any of those
negotiations that Hulu is having with those suppliers, not that we're having. But I would say, look, it's a balance
between putting together – you want to put together something that is a core proposition, something that's really going
to drive consumption and demand and what the prices are.
And without commenting on any particular potential suppliers, I would say that – you mentioned specifically CBS.
Customers have access to an à la carte CBS All Access product, so I don't think that's necessarily – I think that does
have an impact on how you would think about price and what you'd be willing to do to have it there, but I don't think
any one particular network – given where we are today with Disney and Time Warner and the Fox products there, I
don't think any one particular network has hold up value at this point. I think it's a great proposition today. We'd like to
make it better.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: And, Rich, just to answer your question on the 11 million subscribers versus the 12
million subscribers. My understanding, the difference is the 11 million is paying subscribers and the 12 million
includes – and it's slightly over 11 million, but the 12 million includes promotional viewers.
<Q - Richard Greenfield>: So, essentially we could just say between May and now, Hulu's been roughly flat from a
subscriber standpoint?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: It's been up a touch, actually, but it's less than a million, so we're rounding.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Rich. Operator, could we have next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. That will come from Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Oh, thanks so much. I was hoping that you would talk a little bit more about the growth
outlook for the Fox Networks Group, especially with realignment. You look at pay-TV in Latin America, it's not
growing like it used to, and Europe is struggling on the advertising side of it right now it seems. We've been focused a
lot on STAR growth the last couple of years. Anything on Fox Networks Group growth outlook would be helpful.
Thanks.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Doug. Look, I think one of the things – the Fox Networks Group
International cable assets have been particularly impacted by currency as well as gotten knocked around a little bit by
some of the advertising challenges, particularly if I look from Italy to Turkey to Brazil. All of these places are pretty
challenged and have been over the last year, so I think it's a little bit of a mixed bag.
We have a lot of confidence in overall growth of the pay-TV universe in a lot of these markets. As I mentioned I think
a few quarters ago, probably Southeast Asia, a little bit slower than it was before, but Latin America, very strong, and
we feel pretty good about that. But I think it's been disproportionately impacted by currencies and sort of patchy or
rather a mixed ad environment generally in those places.

<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: And then if I could just follow-up with the change in sterling, there's been a lot of questions
swirling around strategic interest in Sky. I think in the past, you've talked about 39% stake as a bit suboptimal. You're
sort of better off owning all or none. Any change in your outlook for how you think about Sky going forward?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: No. Look, I understand the question, and I guess it's just like a quarterly update on the
lack of a change of view. And look, it's just not something – we just don't want to get into commenting on what is
largely idle speculation and hypotheticals.

Operator
Thank you. That will come from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks. I have one for James, Lachlan, and then one for John. James and Lachlan, it
sounds like you guys want to keep your powder dry for M&A, but have a high bar for evaluating those deals. When
you look at your strategic footprint, where do you think the gaps are in terms of your assets? And what type of assets
would you be evaluating? That's one.
And then for John, there's a lot of moving pieces on expenses in Cable Nets, domestically, internationally. Could you
give us a range of what you think growth will be in expenses between U.S. and internationally for 2017?
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: Let me start by just saying I think it's important to note what James said in his
prepared comments, which is, we'd ask you to look at what was chosen not to do. We've been incredibly disciplined,
frankly, for a few years now in terms of our M&A and what we're willing to pay for businesses that may or may not
have some strategic value.
I think particularly when we look at what some of those businesses have traded for, we're quite happy with where we
are today. So moving forward, we're going to be very careful with our capital. We'll be in a position over the next few
months and year where we're going to rebuild our balance sheet to be in a healthy position, but we will be opportunistic
with how we use those funds.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Yeah. And I would just have the areas that we think about and I'll reiterate some of
the stuff that we've said in the past, Michael, but we do believe in investing upstream. We really believe in content
assets. We think that there's an incredible amount of demand for great storytelling around the world. And where we
have been able to find inorganic opportunities in that regard that are at attractive returns for shareholders and for the
company, we've done that. And that's around from MAA TV in India and Andhra Pradesh all the way to Manhattan
with the YES Network. So, I think there are places where that are naturals for us, but it's all a question of value and
about returns and it's making sense.
The other place that I think we talked about in the past as well is, what are the company's capabilities? Again, in their
capabilities in terms of monetizing these brands or really building brands? But, we have no sort of checklist or god
forbid a shopping list. We really do think, as Lachlan said, we feel great about the assets we have. We're really focused
on operating them with our whole team as well as we can and really driving this business forward with a great footprint
around the world and some of the greatest creative assets on the planet, we believe.
<A - John P. Nallen>: And, Michael, outside of the items I called out for 2017, the technical point about having the
extra months of NatGeo and the initiatives that James referred to, the expense growth at the rest of Cable will be
actually below what we experienced in the current year. And those are really just normalized increases from sports

contracts from programming investments, particularly around political and Fox News. And separately, we continued
the initiative of growing STARS, so it's digital investment around hotstar and some of its channels will increase. So,
that's the background on Cable.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Michael. Operator, next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. That will come from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Oh, hi. Thanks. At the risk of being very pedestrian, just a couple of, I guess housekeeping type
of questions. So the first, on domestic affiliate fees, plus 6%, I think, was the number. I think that's a little deceleration
sequentially from the first quarter, correct me, if I'm wrong. Just want to know if there's anything we can learn from
that. I know you have a particular group of networks, but is there anything about the pay-TV universe or some declines
or just specific pricing roll overs from you guys that we can – as we think about the significance of that number?
The second question is similar, James. With your comments on the international advertising, just I guess, really I want
to ask on this quarter, I think if we take the math in the press release it looks like maybe a plus 1% constant currency.
Obviously that seems like an abnormally lower number than usual. I just want to make sure we could understand
anything specific that drove that in as we think about the forecast for that? How are we thinking about this quarter?
Thanks.
<A - John P. Nallen>: So, Todd, I'll cover the first one on affiliate fees. It was 6% versus right, it was decelerated 6%
versus 7%. Truth be told, with about $10 million more in affiliate revenue, we would've been at 7%, so the difference
between 6% and 7% was quite small. And often times in these quarters it's mix. It's how the telcos lost versus how the
MVPD's gained and that really is a factor hovering around that difference. And then in international ads.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Yeah, so first of all, yeah, it was a smaller number than it has been, and I'd say there's
three factors to that. The first one is just weakness in Europe, so in some of the stronger ad markets for us. It was fine in
Benelux for example. The UK was okay. But Italy was not and Turkey was a problem as well. We have a larger
advertising waiting to Turkey, believe it or not, just because of the free-to-air channel there, which is a larger ad
business than some of the other international cable channels that's all lumped into that segment.
And then at STAR, we definitely had a change in the marketplace there a little bit where some of the e-commerce
money that was spending very heavily in the comparison quarters in the year before, notably Flipkart and Snapdeal
really reduced their spending quite dramatically. So, they had grown to be one of the top sectors in advertising there
and just went way, and the e-commerce money that continued to be spent was at Amazon, and that was really spread
out more around sports assets. So, we didn't get the full benefit of that. We have some in the cricket, but really the IPL
got a lot of Amazon's money as well. So, there was just a change there in the marketplace. We don't think it's anything
more than that, just comparison with those big spenders ameliorating their spending.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: I'll just add on to John's comments on the affiliate fees, that as you mentioned before,
we do expect as we get into affiliate renewals in the second half of the year for those affiliate fees to accelerate again.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Todd. Could we have next question, please, operator?
Operator
Thank you. That will come from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Hi. Thank you. Just given your ongoing investments in Hulu, how likely are you likely to
continue to participate in other virtual MVPDs that are expected to launch? I guess just sort of maybe address how you
balance the financial and perhaps strategic benefit of being part of competing sort of other streaming bundles? And then
just a quick follow-up, if you can maybe address the domestic ad market, how the upfront went, and underlying health

of the ad market in TV and Cable.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Hey. Thanks, Alexia. Look, I don't think there's any issue with us being a minority
investor in Hulu, one MVPD and licensing to a very vibrant downstream market. So, we're obviously in the last quarter,
I think we talked about our agreements with Sling and the inclusion of all of our brands in that product, and we
obviously like Sony's Vue service as well, and we would seek to do more.
So I think there hasn't been a problem in terms of licensing. And our real goal here is, we want to see the most
competitive downstream market we can. We do think great value can be created at Hulu and our investment in that
we're very confident about, but we don't think that any of those things are mutually exclusive.
And just as you know, we sell our programming across Europe to multiple MVPDs from particularly Liberty Global,
KPN, others, et cetera, while the Sky businesses were a major investor and competes vigorously in a lot of those
markets. So, I think it's just, a good example is India, where at Tata Sky, we're a significant investor there, but we
distribute across all of the MVPDs, satellite, cable and telcos.
So, I think it's consistent with our practice and it's always benefited us and benefited customers fundamentally to have
more competition downstream. We saw that when DIRECTV and DISH really started to grow again, at least grow
properly in the U.S. many years ago. We've definitely seen that across Latin America, we saw with the telcos
expanding the market, and we think the digital MVPD kind of universe is going to expand the market again. So we feel
pretty good about that.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: As for the upfronts, we couldn't be happier with the strength of the upfronts where
we've now fundamentally completed them all. It's been the strongest upfront we've had in years. CPM pricing is in the
high, very high-single digits. If you blend both the Network and the Cable businesses, and volume increases are up in
the mid-single digits. So, we couldn't be happier with them. Also, the scatter market remains very strong, sort of
mid-single digits, which I think goes to the strength of the advertising market today.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Operator, we have time for one last question, please.
Operator
Thank you, sir. That will come from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Just a housekeeping for John, thanks. On international, I think constant currency affiliate
fee growth was 19% in the quarter. Can you help us with what sort of international affiliate fee growth in next year that
we might expect? Can you kind of keep that up?
And then one for James. Just one thing we're starting to hear more about is lower ad loads on Cable. I think NatGeo is
lowering its number of ad units. What's your appetite for doing that in a more widespread fashion? And what kind of
premium CPMs do you get on the remaining ad spots just in terms of like how much higher can the ad pricing be for
reduced ad load format? And then other than sort of that CPM inflation, maybe you could just talk about what other
benefits you might see or you might expect to see with reduced ad load strategy? Thanks.
<A - John P. Nallen>: Well, on the international affiliate fee, I mean looking at any one particular quarter, you'll
always have ins and outs. So for the year, we averaged 15% constant currency growth in international. And the
mid-teens kind of growth is generally what we're looking for next year as well.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: And then, Anthony, on the ad load side. Look, I think, first of all, I think relative to
some of our cable competitors, I think we've historically and currently generally had lower ad loads. So, we do think
that that's a part of the product experience. It's part of the way that we managed the business. But to the extent that you

continue to lower them, it really depends on pricing. We make that call kind of on an ongoing basis.
I would say that where we see dramatically lower ad loads is in a streaming environment, and the CPM increases our
substantial. And it makes abundant sense to do that where we can target things better, where we can be – where we can
really innovate in terms of those things. But I think generally speaking, for a lot of customers and for more – I do think
some of our competitors out there when I look across the overall kind of dial for cable choices, I think ad loads had
been pretty high on a lot of channels. And they're probably right to reduce them.
