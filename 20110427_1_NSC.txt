Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman, President and CEO, Wick Moorman.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our first quarter 2011 earnings
conference call. I'm joined by several members of our senior team today including Don Seale, our Chief Marketing
Officer; Mark Manion, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Squires, our Chief Financial Officer, all of whom you'll
hear from this afternoon.
I am very pleased to report that Norfolk Southern had an excellent first quarter, delivering all-time first quarter highs in
revenues, income from railway operations and earnings per share. We achieved these records in the face of severe
winter weather, sharply higher fuel prices, and an unfavorable arbitration ruling which decreased earnings per share by
$0.10.
Our results were driven by strong top line growth of 17%, which was achieved through a balance of increased volume
as well as increased revenue per unit. We saw an overall volume increase of 8%, driven by double-digit volume growth
in coal, intermodal and automotive. Revenue per unit rose by 8% as well, driven by our continued emphasis on
market-based pricing along with higher fuel surcharges. Don will provide you with the revenue and traffic details in a
few minutes.
With respect to service, we, along with all of the other North American rails, battled some unusually disruptive winter
weather in the first two months of the quarter. But our performance improved substantially later in the quarter and on
into April as we worked through these weather issues. As most of you know, we constantly measure all aspects of our
service, and Mark will give you all of the details a little later.
Our improved service and handling of increased traffic volumes were largely the result of the targeted hiring that we
have been describing to you. Mark will give you an update on that as well. And I'll give you a little more color on
overall employment in my closing remarks.
Our record operating results and strong free cash flow enabled us to continue our focused efforts on investing in our
company, while at the same time returning cash to our shareholders. We got off to a good start with our capital
expenditure program and at the same time, we were able to increase our dividend 11% during the quarter and
repurchase over $340 million worth of our shares.
We anticipate that our continued focus on service delivery will result in customers moving more traffic on our system.
This in turn, makes our railroad more efficient, which then leads to our ability to generate more cash to invest and
provide superior returns to our owners.
Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the best news of the quarter, which is that we've received formal notice
that Norfolk Southern will receive its 22nd consecutive Harriman gold medal for employee safety next month. The
award, which is for calendar year 2010, is another tribute to the best workforce in the railroad business. But having said
that, we know that there is still room for improvement and we're intent on continuing to drive safety and service to new
all-time highs.

With that, I'll turn it over to Don for a look at our business in the first quarter. He'll be followed by Mark and then Jim.
And I'll conclude with some remarks before we take your questions.
Don?
Donald W. Seale
Thank you, Wick, and good afternoon, everyone.
During the first quarter, our markets continued to rebound, led by new business initiatives, increased manufacturing
output and improving global trade patterns. Strong volume growth and favorable pricing combined to generate revenue
of $2.6 billion, up $382 million or 17% over the same period last year. This was our highest revenue quarter since the
third quarter of 2008 and our third highest revenue quarter ever.
Approximately 53%, or $201 million, of the revenue gain in the quarter was driven by higher revenue per unit and the
remaining $181 million was the result of increased volume. As with the fourth quarter of 2010, our volumes and related
revenue could have been higher, but were impacted by harsh winter weather conditions, particularly in February.
Turning to yield for the quarter on Slide 3, you'll note that we achieved our highest revenue per unit ever, reaching
$1,531, up $117 or 8%. The improved pricing based on market demand and tighter transportation capacity across all
modes, combined with higher fuel surcharge revenue, drove this record performance. For the quarter, we set new RPU
levels for agriculture, metals, chemicals and coal. Higher RPU in coal was driven by favorable export business,
increased rates from contract renewals effective January 1st, and escalators in existing coal contracts. Favorable traffic
mix consisting of increased volumes of longer haul utility coal to our southern utilities also contributed to improved
revenue per car.
In our merchandise sector, improved pricing and favorable mix drove record RPU results for agriculture and chemicals,
while metals' record RPU was the result of higher pricing and fuel-related revenue. Finally, in automotive changes in
traffic mix due to higher volumes of lower RPU bi-level traffic and reduced volumes of higher rated auto parts and
tri-level traffic generated flat revenue per unit for the quarter.
With respect to pricing, network investments and improved service combined with tighter capacity in the truckload and
barge markets across all commodities bode well for continued price improvement as the year progresses. In this regard,
and as we've previously stated, our plan to price at levels that exceed the rate of rail inflation, we are pleased to advise
that we're clearly meeting this objective on a quarterly basis.
Now turning our attention to our volume performance in the first quarter, as shown on the next slide, total shipments of
1.7 million loads were up 128,000 units, or 8% over the first quarter last year. With the exception of agriculture and
chemicals, all other remaining business units posted year-over-year gains. During the quarter, we saw our total volume
reach a 52-week high, as well as individual market highs in our paper and automotive business groups. And I might add
that for the week ending April 2, a new 52-week high was again realized in automotive, along with a new 52-week high
in coal as well.
Now transitioning to our major business sectors, and starting with our coal markets, as shown on Slide 5, coal revenue
of $816 million was up $187 million or 30% over the first quarter of 2010. And it was our second highest revenue
quarter ever. Volume of 406,000 units improved by nearly 42,000 loads, or 11%, driven by increased global demand,
changes in coal source sourcing and stockpile replenishment. Volume weakness in domestic metallurgical coal,
following a 36% increase in the fourth quarter of last year, was driven primarily by reduced coal availability, and was
more than offset by strong utility and export volumes. We expect domestic met coal shipments to rebound ahead,
however, as stockpiles in this sector remain at 50% to 70% below targeted levels.
On the resources front we've added new AC locomotives to our coal fleet, and we'll start initial deliveries of 1,500 new
coal cars in May, all of which will be built this year. Short-term coal car leases are also being utilized to boost capacity,
and we've also upgraded additional tracks at our support yard at Lambert's Point. All of these added resources are

focused on improving service to our valued coal customers and producing further revenue growth ahead.
Now turning to the export market in coal, which was our strongest market segment in the first quarter, shipments
totaled 71,000 loads, up 25%, and 14,000 loads over the first quarter of 2010. The convergence of flooding in
Australia, a 10% increase in global steel production, and robust demand for met coal in Asia resulted in our highest
export volume since 1999. At Lambert's Point, volume for the quarter reached 51,000 loads, up 16%, while shipments
over Baltimore were up 49%, both due to high demand for U.S. met coals in Asia, Europe and South America.
With respect to our outlook in this market, global coal supply remains tight in response to the flooding in Australia.
Some major ports and mines there have resumed operation, but are operating at greatly reduced capacity. As of today
global demand is exceeding supply, and we do not foresee any decline in demand for U.S. coals from the return of
Australian supply for the balance of this year. Reflecting this favorable outlook, current dynamics in the marketplace
bode well for export pricing, and our C52 export contracts, effective April 1, reflect this ongoing strong demand.
Now concluding my discussion of coal on Slide 7, utility volume of nearly 277,000 loads was up 13% over the same
period of last year, despite a 2% decline in electricity output in our service region. The utility volume benefited from
increased shipments to southeastern utilities to replenish low stockpiles and new business. With respect to utility
stockpile levels, many NS served utilities have inventories that are still well below their targeted levels. Looking ahead,
customers will use the shoulder months to replenish coal stocks in preparation for the summer cooling season, and we
expect our utility tonnage to reflect that favorable trend.
Turning now to intermodal on Slide 8, revenue of $485 million was up $75 million, or 18%, over the first quarter of
2010. This revenue gain was primarily from volume growth, fuel-related revenue and contractual rate increases.
Volume reached 747,000 units, led by strong gains in our domestic and premium business. Our domestic growth was
driven by tightening truck capacity, new business initiatives and improving economic conditions. Also widespread
interest in intermodal as a less carbon-intensive alternative to truck continues to increase demand across our customer
base.
Of our total domestic increase for the quarter, we estimate that 60% came from local business east of the Mississippi,
which was up 21%, with the remaining 40% from traditional interline business such as the transcontinental market,
which increased by 14%. Premium volume, which was up 19%, benefited from tight truck capacity and highway
conversions in the LTL segment, in addition to volume resulting from the new FedEx business that I mentioned in
January. Finally, international and Triple Crown volumes were both up 2% for the quarter, as global trade and retail
sales slowly improved.
As all of you know, we're investing for future growth and improved customer service across our intermodal network.
Shown on Slide 9 are five major new intermodal terminals that we expect to be completed by the summer of 2013 as
we continue our unrelenting focus on upgrading corridor speeds and terminal capacity. Our clear objective here is to
take intermodal customer service up to the next level and to fully support future growth and higher profitability ahead.
Now turning to Merchandise, as shown on Slide 10, total revenue in this broad carload segment was $1.3 billion, up
$120 million, or 10%, over the first quarter 2010. Volume for the quarter was 558,000 carloads, up 3%, led by gains in
metals and construction materials, paper and automotive traffic. Drilling down to specific market segments in our
Merchandise business, automotive volume grew 12% over first quarter 2010, as shown on Slide 11, driven by the
increase in North American light vehicle production, robust vehicle sales and quality whole releases from the
manufacturers. Shipments for the Detroit III along with the majority of our international brand names saw
year-over-year improvement in the quarter. New vehicle business secured in the third quarter last year also contributed
to our ongoing volume growth.
Now turning to our metals and paper business on the next slide; metals and constructions business first quarter carloads
were up 7%, primarily driven by increases in coil steel, miscellaneous construction and aggregates traffic. Coil steel
carloads benefited from increased domestic steel production and related volume growth of inter-mill shipments.
Miscellaneous construction was driven by the continued ramp-up of natural gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale region
of Pennsylvania. And aggregates carload loads benefited from increased highway construction and paving projects.

Our paper and forest products volume was up 2% in the quarter primarily due to gains in pulp board, newsprint and
printing paper, reflecting stronger demand and higher production rates. Concluding our carload discussion with
chemicals and agriculture on Slide 3, chemicals volume was down 1% in the quarter due to tough comparisons to first
quarter of last year that included 5,700 carloads of TVA fly ash business. Adjusting for the TVA business, which has
now been completed, chemicals volume would have been up 5% in the quarter, benefiting from increased chemical
production, new plastics business and continued ramp-up of new business initiatives to handle waste related products.
Finally, agricultural's volume declined 2% as strong soybean shipments could not offset declines in corn traffic to the
export market, and to selected feed mills. Corn carryover stocks are headed to a 15-year low this year as high demand
for ethanol and domestic and export markets deplete available corn inventories.
Despite this decline, we're optimistic about our ag business going forward, and continue to invest in our agricultural
network. In that regard, we're purchasing 2,100 new grain hoppers this year to replace leased units. And delivery began
in April and will run until October at a rate of 100 per week. The majority of the new cars will be used in our long haul
unit grain train network.
Now transitioning, looking ahead, as you will note on Slide 14, we expect further growth across most of our portfolio
of business for the balance of this year and beyond. As shown here, we expect automotive volumes to remain positive
throughout the year, as North American light vehicle production is forecasted to grow by 14%. Our volume would also
be driven by the addition in new business that we expect to start handling in August from the new VW automotive
assembly plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
We expect our metals business to remain solid for the balance of the year, driven by domestic steel production and new
business from plants locating on our network, including two in the state of Alabama. Our agribusiness network will
continue to expand, with growth coming from four new ethanol terminals and higher volumes of grain. And we expect
record acreage to be planted this year to support overall demand as we move ahead.
Increased basic chemical production will continue to drive higher chemicals volume. Although our growth will be
somewhat moderated by difficult year-over-year comparisons, as I mentioned before. In our coal markets, we expect
utility coal volume to increase as stockpiles are replenished and new business gains ramp up. And we remain bullish on
export in the face of strong Asian and global demand and tight capacity around the world.
And worldwide thermal coal demand should also provide some targeted opportunities to move steam coal from NS
mines to the global steam coal market. We remain optimistic about both domestic met coal and steel shipments,
although potential for growth in the met coal segment will be subject to coal availability for the balance of the year.
In the domestic and premium intermodal markets, volume will be driven by robust demand and continued highway
conversions. And we're optimistic that international volume levels will continue to increase for the remainder of this
year as well. In the only market with prospects that are relatively flat, forest products, we are cautiously optimistic that
lumber and related wood products will improve as the year progresses, but for now we see CF as a modest recovery at
best.
To summarize, we are very encouraged by our strong first quarter results and expect to build on this momentum for the
remainder of the year. In the months ahead, we plan to fully capitalize on our growth initiatives, the changing nature of
overall transportation capacity in our markets and the ongoing economic recovery that we're seeing. Thank you for
your attention and now Mark will tell you how we're delivering service to our customers in a safe and efficient manner.
Mark?
Mark D. Manion
Thank you, Don, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting with safety, we ended the first quarter of 2011 with a safety
ratio of 0.77 compared to 1.10. That's a 30% improvement over the same period last year. On the service front, we
ended the first quarter with a composite service performance of 72.04% versus 75.84% for the same period last year, a
5% reduction.

While it's old news now, the performance decline was a result of extraordinary weather across the network, driven
greatly by the record-breaking snowfall in Chicago and the surrounding areas starting on January 31 and the recovery
that lasted for weeks afterward. Turning to the next slide, as a result of the winter storms, train speed was severely
impacted in February but partially recovered in March followed by continued improvement in April.
On the next slide, the same improvement trend can be seen in terminal dwell. In fact, at this point, we have improved
over last year, reflecting greater fluidity in our yards and terminals. This next slide illustrates our actual T&E
employment count by month from the beginning of 2010 and then projected through the end of 2011. This is a count of
currently active qualified T&E employees and trainees.
Since the beginning of 2010, we authorized the hiring of approximately 2,700 conductors. Over the same time period,
we have put 760 of these individuals on the ground working. By the end of the year, we expect our T&E population to
be about the same levels as we saw in early 2008. The projected increase of over 1,100 qualified T&E employees by
year-end is primarily driven by catching up on hiring over the past year, backfilling engineer trainees as we ramp up
locomotive engineer training, and traffic growth. And remember, this isn't just the new traffic growth we're
experiencing now. This is the traffic growth we are projecting a year from now.
In addition, we also anticipate a higher percentage of retirements than would normally be expected due to an increase in
the number of eligible employees who deferred retirement during the most recent business cycle. The training pipeline
is full. As you can see, we've reached a point where we are substantially exceeding attrition at an accelerating rate. But
as the year progresses, the hiring and trainee counts are declining as we reach a more steady state of qualified T&E
employees.
Finally, turning to our productivity scorecard, in the first quarter, carload volumes were up 8% while crew starts were
up a corresponding 5%. Total railroad employment was up 7%, driven largely by the increase in conductor trainees that
we discussed on the previous slide. Our efficiency metrics of gross ton miles per employee and gross ton miles per train
hour were up to 2% and 3%, respectively. Gross ton miles per gallons of diesel fuel were down 2%, driven by
weather-related operational issues that impacted us in the quarter, coupled with the addition of less fuel efficient lease
locomotives. With improved velocity, we expect this to improve our fuel efficiency as well.
As you may recall, we added 42 new AC locomotives in the fourth quarter, and an additional 50 locomotives that have
been received this year. As you've seen today, and as we have been saying for a while, we have been aggressively
hiring and training conductors since the beginning of 2010. We're now seeing the benefits of these resources across our
network in terms of improved velocity, increased efficiency and improving service performance.
Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Jim.
James A. Squires
Thank you, Mark.
I will now review our financial results for the first quarter. As Wick mentioned, we're off to a strong start, having
achieved a number of first quarter records, including revenue income from operations and earnings per share, even with
the effect of an unfavorable arbitration decision related to certain insurance claims for the 2005 Graniteville derailment.
And I'll speak to this adjustment as I discuss each effective component of our results.
As Don described, our railway operating revenues for the quarter reached $2.6 billion, up $382 million or 17%
compared to the first quarter of last year, including an increase in fuel surcharge revenues of $90 million. We set a new
first quarter record for revenues, even with an unfavorable fuel lag of $40 million for the quarter.
Total railway operating expenses increased by $337 million, or 20%, to $2 billion for the quarter. Income from railway
operations totaled $600 million, an 8% increase and also a new first quarter record. The resulting operating ratio was
77.1%.

Excluding the $58 million unfavorable Graniteville-related arbitration decision, operating expenses would have
increased $279 million, or 17%, for the quarter and income from railway operations would have totaled $658 million,
up 19%. The resulting operating ratio would have been 74.9% for the quarter, a 30-basis point improvement compared
to last year's 75.2%. Further, when considering the unfavorable fuel revenue lag, our operating ratio would have been
reduced to 73.8%.
Turning to our expenses, fuel and materials and other expenses accounted for almost two-thirds of the $337 million
variance. And the next slide reflects that more than 75% of the fuel expense increase is due to higher prices, with the
balance due to consumption. As shown next, our average diesel fuel price per gallon continued its upward trend with a
steepening slope in the most recent quarter. The $2.88 price per gallon in the first quarter of 2011 was 35% higher than
last year's $2.13 and was up 17% compared to last quarter's $2.46.
Delving deeper into diesel fuel price, this slide shows the per gallon components of price comprised of crude oil in gray
and other costs in green. These other costs primarily reflect crack, spreads, sales tax and transportation costs. What we
see here is that while WTI increased by 20%, other costs increased $0.38 per gallon, or 146%, and this drastic increase
in the non-WTI related price per gallon increased diesel fuel expense by $48 million this quarter.
As highlighted next, materials and other expenses were up $81 million, or 42%. The majority of this increase is due to
the arbitration ruling I mentioned earlier. Maintenance-related locomotive material usage and derailment expenses were
also higher.
Next, compensation and benefits increased by $66 million, or 9%. Looking at the major components of this increase on
the following slide, employee activity levels due to higher volumes added $20 million, including $7 million more for
trainees. Payroll taxes increased by $12 million due to higher pay levels as well as increased railroad unemployment
insurance tax rates.
Medical benefits for our agreement employees increased $11 million, largely related to higher health and welfare
premiums. Additional items included increased incentive and stock based compensation up $5 million higher, pension
expenses up $4 million and increased agreement wage rates up $3 million.
Purchased services and rents increased $48 million, or 14%, reflecting volume-related operating activities and
equipment rents and the absence of last year's favorable settlement with a freight car supplier.
The next slide displays our non-operating items. Other income net was up $7 million, or 35%, due largely to higher
coal royalties and reduced interest expense on uncertain tax positions. Interest expense decreased $7 million, reflecting
net debt reductions over the last 12 months.
As illustrated on the following slide, income before income taxes increased $59, million or 13%, due largely to higher
operating income. Excluding the arbitration ruling, income before income taxes would have increased by $117 million,
or 26%. Income taxes, displayed next, totaled $190 million, down $9 million compared to 2010. The effective rate was
36.9% in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 43.6% in the first quarter of 2010. The effective tax rate difference is
almost entirely due to last year's $27 million deferred tax charge from enactment of health care legislation and a
favorable adjustment to tax reserves as a result of a tax audit this year.
Net income and EPS comparisons are displayed on the following slide. The $68 million net income increase is a 26%
improvement compared to last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.90, or 32%, higher than last year, a first quarter
record. Excluding the arbitration decision, our net income would have been $361 million, up 40% compared to last
year. Similarly, our diluted earnings per share would've been $1.00, or 47% higher than last year.
Lastly, as displayed on Slide 16, cash from operations easily covered capital expenditures as well as dividends of $142
million. In addition, we used cash on hand to help pay down $408 million in debt and generate $343 million in share
repurchases. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter totaled $236 million. We have deployed substantial
cash over the last year in the form of share repurchases and capital expenditures. The veil of uncertainty we faced this
time last year has been removed, and we are confident in the future of rail transportation, and especially in our
franchise.

Thanks, Jim.
As you can see, Norfolk Southern delivered an excellent financial performance during the quarter, which reflected the
strong market for freight rail transportation and the value of our service product. As Don told you, we see continuing
opportunities for growth in almost every segment of our business, and we're optimistic about our prospects for the
balance of 2011.
In closing, I want to say a few words about operating ratio and head count. As all of you know, Norfolk Southern has
focused on reducing its operating ratio for many years, and in fact we've been an industry leader over the years with
respect to operating ratio improvement. While we don't publish our goals and forecasts, we remain intent on continuing
to lower our operating ratio, and we certainly expect to do as well as any carrier in the industry in that regard in the
future. However, there's always a tension between efficiency and effectiveness, and if we see opportunities which will
provide more earnings per share and greater returns for our shareholders while giving up some slight improvement in
operating ratio, we'll take that trade-off every time.
As to employment, our head count increases were in three main areas. The first, as Mark has shown you, is in train and
engine service, the people who run our freight trains. As you know, our business levels to some extent outran our
resource levels last quarter, and these new employees will help us restore our service levels even as our business
continues to grow. Something to note here, as you've heard before, is that the T&E workforce is paid on an activity
basis so that higher headcounts do not translate directly to higher expenses. The second increase in head count is in our
engineering group and these are employees to execute our expanded capital program. And finally as we described to
you earlier in the year, we've added resources in our mechanical department to restore our locomotive and freight car
repair programs to levels commensurate with the business volumes that we anticipate.
I'm particularly proud of the way these new employees have integrated into the Norfolk Southern culture. One
important way this has been borne out is in the continued progress in our safety process. Although 30% of our
agreement work force has been with the company less than five years, they've continued to help generate positive
momentum in our safety process as shown by our most recent Harriman award performance.
Looking ahead, we feel confident that the economic recovery is well under way and barring some extraneous event, it
will continue well on into 2012. We are watching the events in Washington very carefully, which parenthetically is a
phrase that I could have used in any one of these reports for the past many years, and in particular, we have some
concerns about the upcoming STB hearing on competitiveness. However, at the end of the day, the vast majority of
public officials and our customers believe that a strong and healthy rail industry is vital to all of our interests. And I
remain optimistic that we will continue to be allowed to earn an adequate return and invest in our future. In sum, we at
Norfolk Southern feel good about the results that we're producing and confident about our future ability to produce
superior service for our customers and superior returns for our shareholders.
Thanks, and I'll now turn the program over for your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.
Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Bill J. Greene CFA>: Yeah. Hi, there, good afternoon. Can I ask a question on – Don, on some of your yield
comments in the past on the calls, you had sort of talked about yields being a decent proxy for price. But it sounded like

there were a lot more moving parts here. Is it fair for us to use this yield number as a good proxy for price? Or can you
offer more clarity there?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, Bill, that's a good question and certainly, as I mentioned, the transportation market
continues to evolve. Transportation capacity in the first quarter was tighter in the trucking industry, the barge industry,
as well as rail. So our yields, we were pleased with them in the first quarter. So certainly I think that you are in line to
take a look at the 8% and look at it along those lines.
<Q - Bill J. Greene CFA>: Is it possible for you to break out what the fuel impact was in that then?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Our fuel year over year was $90 million, as Jim mentioned.
<A - James A. Squires>: That was the increase. The fuel revenue in 1Q '11 was $249 million versus $159 million in
1Q '10.
<Q - Bill J. Greene CFA>: Okay. Perfect. Thanks. And then, Don, can I also ask is there a limit on the export coal
numbers? You're already at sort of all-time highs. What's sort of the capacity limitation now of the system before you'd
have to put more capital to work?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Bill, we have plenty of extra capacity at Lambert's Point. We're not bumping up against
capacity constraints. The limiting factor is the availability of coal on a given basis and we see that holding steady.
Central App production was up 2.4% in the first quarter and I think coal pricing is favorable. And we've noticed that in
the past, and as we've noted in past calls, that with favorable coal pricing comes coal production.
<Q - Bill J. Greene CFA>: Right. Okay. Thanks for the time.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thank you, Bill.

Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yeah. Good afternoon.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Hi, Tom.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Wanted to ask you about a comment that I know you're reluctant to – a question you're
reluctant to give us a lot of detail on, but maybe directionally. Don, do you think that your base pricing is potentially
stronger this year than what you had seen last year? What can you give us in terms of your thoughts on base pricing?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Tom, we're seeing the transportation market continue to change as I mentioned and I would
say that pricing is stronger across all modes right now than it was this time last year.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay and when we try to break down that 8% yield growth and you gave us some seal
numbers, is there much of a mix effect within that as well? Or is mix fairly modest?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The mix effect for the quarter was negative. It wasn't a large number, but it was a negative
mix number.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. Let's see, you're putting resources in place and it seems that recently you've seen
a little pick-up in velocity. How close are you, I guess, to having adequate capacity in terms of conductors and so forth?
And as that takes place, do you think the incremental margins that you realize will improve from the level you've had in
first quarter?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, we as you saw, as Mark commented on, we continue to add resources. I would
say that you've seen a significant improvement over the past couple of months in our public metrics. We've certainly
seen that in our private metrics. Having said that, as we continue to add resources, we expect continued improvement in

all of our metrics on into I would say, Mark, the second half of the year, and as we turn the system faster, we get more
efficient and our margins start to look better.
<A - James A. Squires>: Tom, let me follow up on that, on the question of incremental margin in particular. I think we
had a couple of incremental margin headwinds this quarter, setting aside the charge. One was certainly weather and that
dinged expenses and also caused us to defer some revenue as well as Don mentioned. Another factor was fuel, with the
incremental margin or actually decremental margin that you see in fuel, that held back overall the incremental margin
improvement.
The third was labor. Now on the labor front, we have a lot of trainees in the pipeline, and those are not fully productive
employees today. As we move through the year, those trainees will become more productive and will start to substitute
for employees working overtime today, and that will be a good dose of labor productivity for us. In addition, we should
start to see – we'll see the weather effect abate, and we should see an abatement of the fuel impact on margin as well,
provided fuel stabilizes from here into the second half.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Do you care to give us any numbers around the magnitude of those effects in first
quarter?
<A - James A. Squires>: Sure. Yeah. Sure. Well, let's talk a little bit about the adjusted operating ratio and a number
of folks in the community, investor community, have been looking at this in terms of the impact of fuel price changes
in both revenue and expense. So why don't I walk through that. Overall, the impacts of fuel price in revenue and
expense hit the operating ratio 180 basis points as we figure it. And then on top of that there was 220 basis points
increase in the operating ratio as a result of the arbitration charge, so in total, 400 basis points from the arbitration
charge and fuel price taking the operating ratio from what it would have been at 73.1 to the reported 77.1. And just a
little bit more detail on the fuel price components to make sure you have those, we mentioned the $90 million increase
in fuel revenue. Of that, $77 million was price related. On the expense side, of the $135 million expense increase, $104
million was price related.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: The other piece of color we can give you is – and these numbers are always very
approximate – is that we have a rough estimate that we forewent somewhere between $25 million and $30 million
worth of revenues and that the additional expenses incurred were somewhere between $5 million and $10 million. But I
caution you, those are somewhat soft numbers.
<A - James A. Squires>: And just lastly too, to round out the pro forma adjustments here, with the adjusted operating
ratio of 73.3, we would be at about a 43% incremental margin.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. Great. Yeah all the detail is very helpful. Good to see the improvement and thank
you for the time.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee MBA>: Great. Thank you very much. I guess on the head count side maybe as you think about
the trajectory as you go forward, just want to get a sense – obviously you've done some pre-hiring here. Just want to get
a sense of how that should look kind of sequentially in the near-term, maybe 2Q relative to the first quarter, maybe
where you ended the quarter as far as head count is concerned? And then how you think about the potential cost per
employee, Jim, to your point, as you're bringing the employees on as full-time employees they're replacing some
overtime. Do you see any benefit in the cost per employee as you cycle these trainees into the program?
<A - James A. Squires>: We should. Yeah. And if you'll refer to Mark's slide that shows the trend in head count, T&E
head count divided between full-time and trainees you see the trainee count start to taper off as those folks get folded in
to the permanent work force. And there will be – there should be a productivity boost from that, as I said. Those newly
minted employees will be standing in for people working overtime today. So we should see a benefit in cost per T&E

employee.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee MBA>: And then just thoughts on total head count as you think about 2Q and then maybe 3Q?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I don't have the numbers in front of me. It will continue to go up a little, but
nominally. We're looking here.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: If I can jump in while you're looking at that, Wick.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Yes.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Between now and the end of the year, we'll add about 1,100 T&E employees. And that's
pretty much evenly divided out. I mean it comes out to about 125 to 150 people per month that are on the ground and
additional workforce. And keep in mind, those people are – about half of those people are actually, are a combination
of new business projection as well as taking the place of conductors that are stepping up to – for engineer training. So
that 1,100 people will be pretty well evenly distributed throughout the rest of the year.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee MBA>: Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe, Don, just a bit on the coal side. You
mentioned the coal stockpiles in the domestic and the utility business. Just kind of curious if you could give a little bit
of color about where they stand relative – I think you said they were lower than normal. But how – what's the
magnitude there, if you could give some color on that?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Chris, we have 30% of our utility network that is below target. And on our domestic met
market, we've got inventories that are between 50% and 70% below target across the board.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee MBA>: Okay. And how – I was just curious on the utility side if there's a level below target
that you're seeing on a day basis or how you guys think about that.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, we track it. We track it on a days inventory basis. And that 30% would reflect those,
essentially 30 utilities out of our universe of 100, that are well below their targeted days of inventory that they're
comfortable with.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee MBA>: Okay. That's helpful. Then with finally I guess, maybe you could elaborate on that
comment about the competitiveness hearing. And I'm just curious if there's something specific about it. Obviously
there's concerns about the thought around discussing the hearing here. But I'm just kind of curious if there's something
specific that you want to elaborate as far as your concerns.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, I think the concerns are right now general. There's going to be a lot of
discussion of competitiveness at that hearing. There're going to be a lot of witnesses. And I think the concern always is
that the rail industry articulates its very strong case for the economic regulatory structure that's in place today. We've
got a lot of customers who have written letters of support for us, economic development agencies and the like, and we
just want to make sure that the Board hears the very positive story that the rails have to tell about where we are and
where we're going.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee MBA>: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you very much for the time. I appreciate it.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Flower from Macquarie Securities. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott D. Flower>: Yeah. Good afternoon, all. Just a couple questions; Don, I guess I was wondering on the
export side you had a high run rate in terms of volumes in first quarter, running about 7.5. Is that reasonable to think
that can be sustained? That would be sort of toward the high end of what you were thinking about in the fourth quarter
call.

<A - Donald W. Seale>: Scott, based on what we're seeing in Asia in terms of overall demand as well as Europe and
South America, and the available global coal supply, we feel that that is sustainable based on the run rate that our
customers are telling us to expect.
<Q - Scott D. Flower>: Okay. And then I know that you said the capacity at Lambert's was adequate, but is that from
some of the capital work you described in terms of staging tracks? Or is that if you added another shift? Help me
understand capacity at Lambert's, because I understand you can go much higher, but I thought that might take some
capital or adding another shift, that you wanted contracts to be sure of that.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, Scott, the capacity is there. And what we're doing in terms of some small investments
there is just enhancing our efficiency at the pier itself. The investment we made at – with bringing back some track into
service was resuming about 1,100 car spots of track capacity at the terminal just to improve the efficiency at the pier.
<Q - Scott D. Flower>: Okay. I mean what do you think the run rate is in terms of the capacity throughput as it
currently is configured at Lambert's?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: 30 million to 35 million tons.
<Q - Scott D. Flower>: Okay. And then just one other quick coal question, how much of what you saw first quarter
was met versus thermal? Obviously the majority is met, but I'm just wondering whether some incremental thermal is
sneaking in with API II [ph] being this high.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: With respect to our exports market, the vast majority of it was met. I would say no more than
2% was thermal coal, although as I mentioned in my remarks, we see some opportunities to expand that.
<Q - Scott D. Flower>: Okay. And then just a couple of quick questions on operations, what would the composite
service metric be now? What is that running in April?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We are in the neighborhood of 76 – 75 to 76. And the good – the good story is that it is
trending in the right direction, Scott.
<Q - Scott D. Flower>: Oh, absolutely. And then are...
<A - Mark D. Manion>: One other thing that I might, Scott, if I could elaborate on the Lambert's Point comment you
were making. One of the things that we have in the mill to generate more throughput on the side of additional head
count is we are hiring in not only transportation, but also engineering and the mechanical side in order to support more
two-side operation. Up to now, for the most part, we can pretty well handle the business that's going through there
dumping on one side. We occasionally have two-side operation, but just to make sure that we can handle more going
forward, which we think will – is a likelihood, we are gearing up to be able to handle two-sided operation much of the
time, if necessary.
<Q - Scott D. Flower>: Okay. And then I know that you talked about the locomotives that you had delivered through
first quarter, but are you adequate on locos or do you have further deliveries through the year?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We feel good about the locomotives right now. We've still got our leased locomotives, about
260 of them. And as the velocity continues to increase, which we anticipate, our plan is to sideline those locomotives as
we see the ability to do so. So that is really what's in our radar right now is – or in our scope right now is increasing our
velocity and actually reducing some of those leased locomotives as we have the opportunity to do it.
<Q - Scott D. Flower>: Okay. And then two last very quick catch-ups with, Jim. What was the fuel lag impact? I know
you mentioned it. I just happened to miss it.
<A - James A. Squires>: $40 million.
<Q - Scott D. Flower>: I'm sorry?
<A - James A. Squires>: $40 million.

<Q - Scott D. Flower>: Okay. And then you had mentioned there was some favorable tax audit adjustment this year in
the tax line?
<A - James A. Squires>: Right. That was relatively minimal. The big factor in the change in the effective rate was last
year's deferred tax asset write-down.
<Q - Scott D. Flower>: The amount this year was what, $4 million or $5 million or something?
<A - James A. Squires>: Yeah, it'd be in that neighborhood. To bring it down from sort of a statutory rate plus a
standard state income tax rate to the reported 36.9%.

Our next question comes from the line of Justin Yagerman from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. Wanted to ask – I seem to recall you
talking about some negative mix issues in prior quarters as it relates to the coal business and shorter haul impacting.
And it sounds like you guys have reversed some of that trend and are seeing a longer haul, especially on the utility coal
side. Can you talk a little bit about what's changed?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, we certainly saw our southern based utility coal move at a higher volume. And as I've
pointed out in past quarters, our southern utility coal is generally about 30% higher RPU than our northern utility coal.
But also within the export market, as I mentioned, our Baltimore export tonnage was up 49%, which was higher than
the increase in Lambert's Point, Lambert's Point being the higher RPU coal traffic and Baltimore being lower RPU. So
there's a lot of moving parts to mix and the overall effect in the quarter, as previously mentioned, was modestly
negative.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And on the export coal outlook specifically, I was curious
whether you had any thoughts of moving to quarterly contracts. One of your competitors has discussed that. And you
know when you look at those contracts, if you were to be moving to the quarterly, would those be take-or-pay
contracts?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, we're constantly assessing contract structure and contract production. So I really can't
tell you whether we will go that way or not. But we're assessing the market on a continuous basis.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Now the contracts you do have currently, are those take-or-pay?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We have – we have volume commitments in some contracts, yes.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Okay. I was curious on the automotive side, or anywhere else that you're seeing anything,
if the disruptions due to Japan have impacted any production on your line. Is that something you've been hearing

about? Or as we're working through whatever inventory was already stocked prior to that disaster, are you starting to
hear about any potential issues arising as we look out over the next quarter or two?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, we're certainly watching that situation closely. As I mentioned, our auto traffic volume
was up 12% in the first quarter, and the Big Three volume continues to outpace what we had projected. Now the
international auto manufacturers that are more dependent upon a supply chain from Japan, we are seeing some
production reductions at some of the plants in the U.S. that are operated by the international manufacturers. We don't
know yet what the net effect of all that will be, but our sense is that the auto market is rising at a fairly rapid pace and
that if one manufacturer doesn't supply the product, the consumer will probably buy the product from a manufacturer
that does produce the product.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: That's a fair assumption. And the last question I had on the export coal side, moving back
to that, the interesting commentary around steam coal and the demand, albeit a very small part of total. Where are you
seeing the end market demand for that export steam coal? And where do you see that growing fastest in terms of that
leaving the East Coast?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, we're seeing South America grow very rapidly. Certainly we're seeing Korea and China
taking their share, and, of course, we're seeing Western Europe, which is our more traditional export metallurgical coal
market, rebound very well as well because global steel production is up 10%. And we see that continuing to surge and
Australian supply of met coal is still impacted to the tune of about 80% of their production.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: But I guess – that is definitely interesting. The question was looking at the steam coal,
which I realize is a very small part of this world, but you did call that out as something that you see maybe growing in
the future. Just kind of curious where that growth – that endmarket growth is coming from.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Western Europe would be one of those destinations and we see some opportunity possibly in
Asia as well.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Got it. All right. Thanks so much for your time. Appreciate it.

Our next question comes from the line of Jon Langenfeld from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jon A. Langenfeld CFA, MBA>: Good afternoon. On the intermodal site, could you reflect a little bit on the
modest volume growth on the international side? And just what you're hearing from the steamship lines. The import
volumes to the U.S. have been pretty good, upper single digits. So we continue to see slower growth on the
international intermodal across the board. So wondering if you had any details or explanations behind that?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, we on the domestic side, we're seeing increasing opportunities for highway conversion
of truckload freight to rail, particularly in the eastern network that we're ramping up. As it relates to international
business, we're continuing to see some international business on the West Coast, coming through the West Coast ports,
trans-loaded to 53 foot domestic boxes. And once that freight is trans-loaded into those domestic boxes, it's counted in
our domestic count. So while we were up 2% in international ISO boxes, I would say that the volume is slightly higher
than that, because of the trans-load activity that's taking place. The final comment that I'll make on international is that
as retail sales and consumption continue to improve, we expect international volumes to follow that.
<Q - Jon A. Langenfeld CFA, MBA>: And if you looked at your international volumes just on the East Coast, where
I believe trans-loading to be domestic, intermodal is less prevalent. So if you look at the international there, how has
that trended? And then maybe more specifically, how has that Heartland Corridor helped you?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We're seeing – we're seeing increased activity on the Heartland Corridor, both organic
growth in addition to volume that we have shifted intentionally from the old corridors to the Heartland Corridor for the
efficiency of it. And we're continuing to see our volume for other East Coast ports improve as well.

not sure if this was asked. I had to jump off for a quick second. But you'd mentioned during the prepared comments
that you're entering a period of elevated attrition as retirements approached. Is there a point at which you start to see a
measurable change in the comp and benefits line as a result of that, i.e. the average age of the workforce, arguably
should be declining meaningfully I guess over the next year or so.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: You will see some decline in terms of the average compensation. One reason that Jim
pointed out was overtime. The other is that new contract employees are on step rates. And it takes a few years for them
to reach 100% of the contract rate. So, there'll be some modest decline as that progresses too.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold CFA, CPA>: Okay. And on the April 1 contract increase for export coal, have you quantified
how much the average rate's going up?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: No, we would not quantify that, because they're in confidential contracts.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold CFA, CPA>: Okay. And then last question, it looks like you hauled about 8 million tons of
export coal in the quarter. Is it fair to just annualize that to $32 million as sort of the run rate for here?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, it was 7.4 actually. And we – we're optimistic that that market will continue to be
strong, as I've mentioned, based on the input that we're getting from both suppliers and customer receivers.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold CFA, CPA>: Great. Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Ed Wolfe with Wolfe Trahan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess the inverse of Peter's question, as employees start to come on
line and get trained and then they become active, at what point in that kind of life of the employee do you start to see
the comp per employee increase?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I'm not quite sure we understand your question, Ed. In terms of the way the contract
employees are paid, there are – it's a four-year step process, where they start at 80% and then reach 100% of the
contract rate. Once they've been here four years, they're paid at 100% of their rate.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: When they're in the training program, are they getting paid as if the day they become active or is
there a big step up at that point I guess is what I'm asking?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Trainees certainly are compensated. What, Mark – $700 a period?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: I don't know the exact figure.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: We can get you an exact figure. The trainees are certainly compensated less than
fully qualified employees.

<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: So when I think about comp per employee up 2.8% in first quarter, directionally throughout the
year, I would think that that would be coming down as you're ramping up the trainees and seeing some people turn
over. Or is that kind of a fair number going forward?
<A - James A. Squires>: Well, I think it will depend to a significant extent on how much we substitute these new
employees for those working overtime today. That's going to be a big factor and that is our plan. We're already seeing
overtime come down as a result of the trainees coming on line.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Yeah. I think right now we would expect that to come down.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: Okay. Switching gears, the coal revenue per carload is up 16% sequentially over fourth quarter.
Can you talk about some of the drivers? And what percentage of your export coal business re-priced in January relative
to April?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Ed, we had several contracts. I can't give you the percentage, but we had three or four utility
contracts that re-priced January 1, and then, of course, we have contract escalators that also took modifications in the
quarter as well.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: And what percentage of the business, the export Coal business, re-prices or escalates in April?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: All of our export coals adjusted April 1.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: Including the export coal that – the three or four contracts that went on on January 1? They also
took an increase in April?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: No, Ed. Those were domestic utility contracts.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: Okay. I'm slow. I appreciate that. What was the increase on average that you took in April?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We can't address that, as I mentioned. Those are contract confidential terms.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: You can't talk about an average across the book?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: No I can't.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: Okay. Why were Baltimore expert volumes, Don, up three times that of Lamberts in first quarter?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The demand for Pennsylvania higher sulfur coals that are being blended in the world market
were high. The capacity for production out of the Pittsburgh Eight Seam was there and we were very pleased to handle
it.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: So, does that mix continue for a little while? Or does it reverse fairly quickly where Lambert's
catches up a little bit?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We see the mix coming out of the Pittsburgh Eight Seam in Pennsylvania continuing to be
very strong.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: Okay. Is there an opportunity for coal royalties to materially increase now that we're seeing
global demand increase and pricing increase, the value of it?
<A - James A. Squires>: Probably not materially. We may see some trend in that direction, but it's a relatively small
item in the grand scheme of things.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: Okay and then last question, just the mix of intermodal. I think I heard Don say 60% give or take
is local east and 40% of the volume is transcon in first quarter. Did I hear that right?
<A - James A. Squires>: If you look at the split, 60% of our current book in the first quarter was domestic, 40%
international. 60% of the growth that we had was east of the Mississippi in our local market.

<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: And so how does that look now, that mix give or take between the local market and the transcon
on the domestic piece?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We are growing faster in the domestic local market, Ed. I don't have the numbers in front of
me here in terms of the total domestic local versus transcon, but we can get that for you.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: Is the transcon just directionally larger than the domestic?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, you've got to keep in mind that the domestic market east of the Mississippi in our local
market is a relatively new market. It's ramping up. It is a huge truckload market that has not been tapped traditionally
for intermodal. And we are tapping that and we're seeing it grow and as in past quarters, we've been sharing the
increases on some of the corridors. And for example on the Crescent Corridor in the first quarter, our volume was up
37% for domestic intermodal.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: Okay. I appreciate it.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: It's growing that much faster than our conventional transcon market.
<Q - Ed M. Wolfe>: No I get that. I appreciate it. Thank you for the time.

Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Newcrest. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne CFA, CA>: Thanks very much and good evening. Just continuing on with the intermodal
business, was wondering if you would offer any comments on the new business you secured with FedEx and just how
that ramps up during the quarter, and whether it was focused in particular lanes or more broadly throughout the
network.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: I did not catch your question. Could you repeat it for me?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: FedEx, how did it ramp up and where?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We saw – we saw FedEx ramp up pretty much across our network in the East. But I will tell
you that the strongest lanes were Chicago-Harrisburg, Chicago-Pittsburgh, those types of lanes in the Northeast.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne CFA, CA>: Okay. That's helpful. Last question for me is you did mention that you lost
some revenue in the quarter due to winter. And depending on what that was, presumably some of it may get moved in
Q2. So I was just wondering whether you could comment on if you had a backlog in certain segments as you exited the
quarter.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, as we stated, we estimate that we had $25 million to $30 million of weather impacted
revenue that we did not realize in the first quarter. Of that $25 million to $30 million we estimate that half of that,
approximately half of that revenue, was deferred. And we will recover that in the second quarter.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne CFA, CA>: Thank you. That's all for me.

<Q - Scott Malat CFA>: Evening. Thanks. You gave some great detail around the employees. It's very helpful. I just
wanted to understand as I just think about these numbers long term. If we look at a gross ton miles per employee,
historically it kind of peaked in 2004 and it was down every year until 2010, and now we're improving again. But I
think the productivity number is still down 10% since those peaks. Can you help me understand the difference there? Is
it that intermodal needs more employees? Are there other mix changes that have caused this? And I'm just trying to
figure out how to think about the normal run rate of employee productivity going forward for whatever normal is.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, if you – to some extent there is a mix effect, particularly in intermodal. It
doesn't generate gross ton miles in quite the same way. So there may be something going on there. The other thing I
would tell you is that you also have to think about it the way we think about it and that is in terms of our service levels.
We need a certain number of employees to generate the higher service levels.
As we went into the 2005 and 2006 traffic surges, we were adding employees to make sure that we have maintained
adequate service levels. As we look ahead, the hiring we discussed, we're hiring in anticipation, as Mark said, for
business that we will be handling in six months or a year. And we have realized some efficiencies in terms of
operations per employee. We certainly realized some throughout the 2009 downturn that we think we'll hold on to. So I
would tell you that I think we will start to – we'll continue to push those efficiency numbers up. I don't know without
doing a lot of analysis how that would compare ultimately with 2004.
<Q - Scott Malat CFA>: Okay. Great. So, then I guess as I understand it, you're adding employees now for the future
and yes, you could continually improve volumes you'll continually add, but it's a little bit of a stair step up, but you'll
digest and get better employee productivity for a while after that. Is that a fair way to think of it?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, partly it is. The thing that we need to keep in mind is that we still have a need for
additional employees for the business that we've got out there. And that 1,100 people that I've referred to, about half of
that is catching up from over the past year. And but as I also referred to, the other half of it is growth that we are
looking forward to in the months out as well as back going through these locomotive engineer trainees and so forth. So
there is a need to hire for our current business needs as well as hiring for the growth that's anticipated in the future this
year and on into 2012.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Let me add one other thing that occurs to me about 2004, and that is it was really
only after 2004 that we began hiring and having significant numbers of trainees on the property. We went through a
long period of time in our agreement work force and our non-agreement work force where we had relatively low
attrition. And we're a company like every other company, we've got a lot of places where we have an aging work force
and have had that for the past five or six years. And we consciously decided in the 2004 and '05 timeframe that we had
to try to get ahead of that curve, and we're continuing to see that attrition. So at any given time, we have several
hundred more trainees on the property than we had in 2004.
<Q - Scott Malat CFA>: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. The only other thing is just on the premium intermodal
volume, just the parcel on the LTL business following up on that. Can you just help us think about any sizing of this
today, and then help us think about the opportunity there? Thanks.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, certainly those are significantly sized markets, with opportunity for growth for us. They
represent companies like United Parcel Service and FedEx, both of whom have a very large base of business, and an
opportunity that's based on service performance.
<Q - Scott Malat CFA>: There's no way to help us just kind of size that, of intermodal – is it material now? Or it's just
pretty small now and it just has a good opportunity?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, it's material now. And it certainly has a good opportunity as well going forward. As the
pie chart shows in the presentation, you know it's – it was 65,000 loads.
<Q - Scott Malat CFA>: Okay.

Our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy from Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Matt Troy>: I had a question reverting back to the coal volumes. Despite CSX doing better on the export side,
you trounced them on the utilities side. You know they're citing weather and stockpiles. You don't seem to have those
problems. Sifting through the noise, it seems as if you've taken some share. I was wondering if you could speak to that,
specifically on the domestic side, what that new business might look like and how sticky it might be.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: As I mentioned earlier with respect to utility, we saw replenishing stockpiles with existing
customers. We also have a TVA planned at Kingston, Tennessee that is ramping back up. It was down because of an
operational issue with the fly ash spill at that location last year. And we've had some modest share gains in a couple of
other places. But the big drivers in the quarter is stockpile replenishment, number one, and then a distant second, the
ramping up of the TVA plant.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Interesting. So despite being in the same region and serving similar areas impacted by the same
weather, your utility customers have lower stockpiles?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: As I mentioned, based on the data that we're looking at, about 30% of our utility receivers tell
us that they would like to improve the level of their stockpiles.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Well, that's certainly a good news story for you folks. Second question would be in terms of just –
you know your CapEx budget. Has that changed for the year? And is the bonus tax depreciation leading you to pull
forward any investment that might have been a 2012 or 2013 CapEx expenditure?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: We are on track pretty well for our announced capital budget of about $2.2 billion.
Certainly, the bonus depreciation was something at least a slight factor in our decision to buy a lot of equipment that we
normally lease, but we've not pulled any substantial items forward from 2012 on account of it.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Okay, thank you. And two last quick ones. I know that there's some catch-up across the industry in
CapEx given what we've been through in the last 2 to 3 years. I was just wondering if you could give what a typical
year, once your catch-up is done, what CapEx might look like on a run-rate basis either in absolute dollars for
maintenance or just as a percentage of revenues? What should we be thinking about modeling in the out years?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, our out years, for our out years you should keep in mind that for the next few
years, we have a couple of things that we'll be doing. One is that obviously the extraordinarily large investment in
positive train control, which we all have to undertake; the second is that we have a substantial percentage of our coal
fleet to replace over probably the next 5- to 7-year period. We're buying 1,500 coal cars this year and that's just because
the fleet is becoming life expired. With all of that said, over the long term we have consistently said – and I think it's
still a reasonable place to be – that we'll be somewhere around 15% of revenues plus or minus.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Okay. That's excellent. And then the last question was I appreciate your comment earlier and the
confidence when you said that you continued to lower your OR as well as anyone else in the industry. I just want to
level set expectations, because you did have the settlement this quarter. When we think about the seasonality and the
flow-through through the year, should we be using that 74.9% OR as kind of the true OR to use as the basis 1Q OR?
Fuel is going to be what it's going to be, but ex the settlement, is the 74.9% number a good number to base off and
expect improvement going forward, ex fuel?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, the wildcard – let me just say this. The wildcard is fuel, because it's hard for me
to say it's 74.9% when we had, as Jim pointed out, also a significant lag effect. If you normalize that out, it's a lower
number. But I would just suggest that as you look at our operating ratio and look at our operating ratio trends through
past years, we expect to consistently lower the operating ratio year over year on a quarterly basis, ex the items that we
really don't have much control over, like fuel or an arbitration award or something else that comes along.

Our next question comes from the line of Gary Chase with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Gary Chase>: Hey, everybody. Just a quick one for Mark, I just want to verify when you spoke about the 1,100
heads, that's a net number right? And presumably a bit fluid based on whether or not these volumes you've been talking
about for 2012 materialize or whether you have line of sight into those as we approach year end. Is that fair?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Yes, that's right, Gary. That is a net number and that does put us about equal where we were
in 2008 and also keep in mind that we've got some flexibility here. If we see we need to pull back on that, we can do
that. The people that would be coming out, that would be with us, for example on your chart there in the fourth quarter,
they're not even in training yet. Some of those people aren't even hired yet. So we've got flexibility to adjust if we need
to.
<Q - Gary Chase>: And just switching gears, Don, when you talked about the mix shift towards some of these
Southern utilities in that coal line, would it be possible to describe that as dramatic? Was there something unusual that
happened in the fourth quarter? Because it's just very difficult to get from the fourth quarter yield numbers to the first.
Is it really feasible to believe that, that was driven largely by that mix shift you described, or no?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Gary, there was no dramatic changes in the first quarter with respect to our utility base.
Bottom line is that we handled 13% more volume year over year. We had our southern utilities taking more coal and
our coal suppliers were mining and shipping that coal to them. So we had the perfect situation of increasing our longer
haul southern-based utility coal.
<Q - Gary Chase>: And not a dramatic shift from where you were in the fourth quarter, right?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: I will tell you that we did a better job handling coal in the first quarter than we did in the
fourth quarter.
<Q - Gary Chase>: Okay. And then just when you noted the capacity being tighter across a number of markets, I don't
typically think of this business as one where you can sort of immediately monetize those types of conditions. Am I
wrong in thinking that? And if not, does it mean that you think there's more upside as we move through the year?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: I think that as we move quarter to quarter and we've seen a tightening in transportation
capacity since 2009 when some capacity was taken out, as the economy continues to improve and freight demand
ramps up each quarter, there certainly is an opportunity for us to realize additional value from our transportation
products in each quarter. We have about 68% of our book of business priced for 2011, so we have remaining business
to be priced and we expect transportation demand and capacity to both sort out in the subsequent quarters for the rest of
the year in a tighter fashion for supply.
<Q - Gary Chase>: And you think there's opportunity on that remaining 30% odd?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We do.
<Q - Gary Chase>: Okay, thanks everybody.

<Q - Walter Spracklin CFA>: Thanks very much. Good evening everyone. Wick, you mentioned that you were going
to keep and did a follow-on on the operating ratio discussion that you had. And you said you – you're going to sort of
keep up with and do better than any of the other competitors. And just so we understand and we're framing this in the
right context, all of them do have fairly aggressive targets out there in the next, call it 2, 3 to 5 years. Is that what you're
talking about? Are you – obviously you're aware of those. Are those comments made in the context of those operating
ratio targets?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, I'll say this. We certainly know what other people say about operating ratio
goals and we're competitive people. And it's – we're going to work very hard to make sure that we don't fall behind
others in what we're achieving in the industry.
<Q - Walter Spracklin CFA>: Okay. And second question very quickly – I know it's been a long call here. Back in
the domestic local intermodal business, obviously you're getting some really good growth here. Your investments seem
to be paying off quite nicely. My question is is it coming in quicker than you would have expected? Is fuel causing that
to come onto your network, convert from road to rail a little quicker than you were expecting? And is that a sticky
business? In other words, if fuel comes back down, have you had some discussions with those customers that might be
impressed with the service and more likely to stick around even if fuel prices come back down?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We're finding a pervasive interest in highway conversion to intermodal, from a sustainability
perspective, from an overall cost perspective, but also from a service and supply chain support perspective. So fuel
certainly is a component of it but we see an ongoing, building momentum in domestic intermodal demand as more and
more customers are looking to that product as a fundamental shift in their supply chain support.
<Q - Walter Spracklin CFA>: That's a great story. Okay. Thanks very much, guys.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Great, Wick, and to follow up on your earlier operating ratio commentary and your
competitive nature, I like those comments. But if you step back, was there a change in how you would address pricing
in the quarter? Or have you adjusted with your sales force anything? Because it seems your pricing accelerated pretty
significantly. You were the fastest on pricing amongst all the rails this quarter. So I just wanted to see if there was
something you kind of put to the sales force to go chase that.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Ken, I'll just say that we have maintained a consistent philosophy on pricing all
along. We price to the market in every instance that we can. As you know, we've discussed over the past few quarters
that there are a lot of moving parts in our business. And because of that, we have opted and I think rightly so that we –
over the long term revenue per unit is as good an indicator of where the industry and our business is going as any. But
we haven't changed our philosophy about pricing at all.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: It just seems odd because the last couple quarters, maybe the last two quarters it seemed like
you were maybe trailing kind of the group average on that metric. And so you're suggesting that it's more mix changes
or -
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Ken, one of the things that you always have to remember, Don has pointed out many,
many times is that pricing – we maintain a consistent philosophy on pricing. In price in the market, pricing
opportunities vary depending on timing. There are all kinds of things going on, but I can assure you – Don looking at
me nodding his head – that we always have and always will price to the market.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Ken, that's the basis and we have had no change in our philosophy or our approach in the
market. As I've pointed out, we are seeing the market change, and we have seen it evolve over the last three to four
quarters as demand has increased and supply of transportation has tightened. But we haven't changed our approach

within that environment. We're just pricing to the market and taking advantage of an opportunity where it exists for our
service in the marketplace.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Okay. Let me jump to kind of the same thing on volumes. I mean you've moved, oddly
enough in the same quarter, to the head of the group in terms of pricing strength as well as on volumes. To a question
earlier, it seemed to be just asking solely around coal, but are there some share shifts going on overall within the –
within your commodity mix? In other words, do you think you're gaining some share that's leading that? Or is it kind of
just back to your service provision is -?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, certainly first and foremost, it's all about the value of the service in the marketplace.
Secondly, the big share shift that's taking place is from the highway to our intermodal service. And third, we're working
very closely with our customers to collaborate with them on the best way to support their business plans and their
supply chain requirements. We've always done that, though. That's not a change in our strategy. We'll continue to do
that going forward.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate the time.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso from Credit Suisse Group. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso CFA>: Thanks. Good evening. Just a couple questions; I think you'd mentioned a couple
quarters ago that you had picked up some very short haul, I think you called it project business. I'm not sure if that was
just in the coal franchise or in other commodities. But is that – has that run its course? Or is that still with you?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We still have quite a bit of that. And as you'll recall that I mentioned in the remarks today
that our domestic metallurgical coal is a good example of that. It's very good business for us, but it's shorter haul. A lot
of it goes to the river, lower RPU business. It was up 36% in the fourth quarter. It was down this quarter. So we – those
are the kind of moving parts that we have in the business. And there's not much ratable volume in each market that will
be the same each quarter.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso CFA>: How much longer does that – is this the typical annual kind of contract? Or how long
does that run?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Chris, how long does what run?
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso CFA>: The – this project business that you won that's shorter haul.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Generally for a 12-month cycle.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso CFA>: Okay. And then just a question for Wick, you brought up the topic of the hearings and
the STB. I mean outside of an actual change in legislation, what is it exactly that you're concerned the STB might do
that might make life more difficult to you? What sort of bounds do they have to make changes if the laws don't change?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, they have – they do have certain bounds. And the – any changes they've made
would be made over some period of time. But within their regulatory purview they have the ability to make changes in
our regulatory structure and our – so it's something, as I say, that causes us some concern and we're going to watch that
very closely.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso CFA>: Okay. Is this definition of types of traffic or anything specific that you're concerned
about?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: There are a number of different changes that one could hypothesize about. As you
know, they just had a hearing about exemptions and this will be around general competitiveness issues. The STB has a
fair number of components of our business that they regulate. So we will watch with interest what they do.

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl from Dahlman Rose. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl MBA>: Evening, gentlemen. I'll try to keep this quick. You guys mentioned there was a bunch of
trans-loading going on, the 53 footers. We've seen a shortness in this type of equipment before. Could you talk to where
we are right now with 53-foot domestic equipment capabilities?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well coming off last year, Jason, when a lot of buyers of containers, domestic 53 foot
containers, could not get the boxes built in China, nor could they get those boxes delivered, we are seeing a better
supply of 53-foot domestic boxes this year as those deliveries from China take place. So we have seen some of our
intermodal partners increase their domestic fleet and as we pointed out in our capital discussions in January, we are also
taking delivery of some additional 53-foot containers and supporting chasses this year.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl MBA>: Now when do you think those will hit your network?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We are already receiving some of those boxes.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl MBA>: Okay. Very good. My next question also stays on the intermodal side. We talked a little
bit about this new FedEx business. Can you talk about the impacts on the RPU the FedEx business has had on your
intermodal mix? Is that going to be positive, negative or is it a wash?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well it is just beginning and it's ramping up so the impact at this point's immaterial, but it -
<Q - Jason H. Seidl MBA>: Is it shorter length of haul business?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Pardon me?
<Q - Jason H. Seidl MBA>: Does it have a shorter length involved than your typical intermodal business or no?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: No, it will have a slight – or higher RPU than the base because it's domestic and longer haul.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl MBA>: Okay. Fair enough. That's all I have. Thank you very much for all the color today.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman from Sterne, Agee. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman MBA>: Thank you. I know it's been a long call. So thank you for taking my question. Don, I
want to follow up on a question Ed Wolfe asked and something we hit on before. The sequential increase on the coal
franchise on basically flat utility volume, it looked like RTMs were up $1.2 billion. Can you just give me an idea of
how much of that $1.2 was attributable to the utility coal? Then since it's kind of flat tonnage, I can get an idea of the
length of haul impact here. Because your length of haul sequentially was up about 20 miles and that is a pretty big jump
fourth quarter to first.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, the overall increase in utility was up 13% in loads for the quarter and of course, our
export coal was up 25%, as I indicated. The moving part in utility that was favorable on length of haul was that we had
an increase in our southern utility business that was up greater than the increase in our northern utility business which is
shorter haul.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman MBA>: Okay, Don, I'm sorry. When you're talking about that 13%, you mean year-on-year,
correct? I'm talking quarter-to-quarter?

<A - Donald W. Seale>: That's year over year, not sequentially, but versus the first quarter of last year.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman MBA>: Okay. So if I go back to first quarter last year, it's about 1.8 billion ton-miles
difference. I could figure out how much utility tonnage is up, but how much of the ton-mile change was utility-related
versus other?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: I don't have that number in front of me, but we can certainly check it.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman MBA>: Okay. I'll follow up off line with that. And then one final question, I'll leave it be.
About a 10% increase in rev per RTM sequentially, normally it's a little closer to five. Is it fair to say that the difference
between five and ten is the re-pricing of the three to four utility contracts we spoke about earlier?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: No. I wouldn't be that precise. The utility contracts that we re-priced January 1st were not
large contracts.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman MBA>: Okay. So there's more to it than that.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Yeah.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman MBA>: Well, listen, congratulations, terrific quarter. And thank you, guys.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thank you.

Our last question in the queue comes from the line of Donald Broughton from Avondale Partners. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: Well, I guess last but not least, I'm the caboose. The – I know you don't run them
anymore. But that said, fuel has gotten to a price – diesel has gotten to such a price that you're seeing shorter and
shorter and shorter lengths of haul converted to intermodal. And certainly that's a bigger and bigger – as you know, the
demand curve there is logarithmic, not really linear. Is there a point at which you change your thinking and your
equipment, that you run fewer – are willing to run more flats? I mean I know so much of your investment in these
corridors has been on driving double-stack volume. Is there a point at which there's so much market share available
you're willing to add more flats to your system?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Don, first and foremost in the intermodal market, double-stack technology is, in our view, the
way to go with respect to the ultra short haul market, and a good example of that is Savannah to Atlanta, with our
international business coming through the port of Savannah. A little over 225 miles in the haul and running a 10,000
foot double-stack clean train is the way to go about that to compete and also to generate the margins that we're seeking.
So double-stack first and foremost, we never say never with respect to adding platforms for trailers. If the money is
there and the market evolves to that point, we're certainly not ruling that out.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: Thank you for your patience and answering all of our questions and congratulations on a
good quarter.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thank you, Don.
