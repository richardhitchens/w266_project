Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Thank you, Holly, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Allergan second quarter 2015 earnings
conference call. Earlier this morning we issued a press release reporting Allergan's earnings for the second quarter
ended June 30, 2015. The press release and our slide deck, which we are presenting this morning, are available on our

Brenton L. Saunders
Thanks, Lisa, and good morning everyone. It's great to be with you to review our results for the second quarter of 2015,
which built on the terrific results we had last quarter. This was also our first full quarter of a combined operations
following the close of the Allergan acquisition on March 17. And I'm very proud of what our team has accomplished,
especially the momentum they have created to propel our future growth.
Turning to slide 5. Allergan's second quarter performance highlights our ability to execute on our four pillars of our
long-term growth strategy. First, operational excellence is yielding exceptional financial performance and results in all
key business segments, key products, and key geographies.
Second, therapeutic area leadership is leading to double-digit growth among many of our franchises.
Third, our productive and innovative R&D engine has produced more than 100 branded product approvals globally and
56 branded regulatory submissions year to date.
And fourth, we are executing on strategic business deals to support our growth in key therapy areas and charge up our
pipelines for the future.
We also changed our name to Allergan in the quarter to symbolize our transformation into a leader in Growth Pharma,
where brands now contribute more than two-thirds of our company's revenues. With our focus on Growth Pharma we
are encouraging our employees around the world to be bold and smart in the way we think and act.
Turning to slide 6. The announcement of our plans to combine our Global Generics business with Teva in a $40.5
billion deal is the latest bold move by our company to continue our transformation towards being a leader in Branded
Growth Pharma. For years we've been moving up the innovation curve towards specialty pharma products.
This agreement clearly accelerates our transformation. This deal allows us to dramatically simplify our operating
structure, sharpen our focus on seven core therapy areas, and reload our capital structure to continue our
transformation.
There is certainly more to come on this story. We are confident that we are creating the most dynamic company in
Growth Pharma, while adding our impressive global generic commercial, generic R&D, and operating capabilities to
Teva.
Now let's turn to slide 7 and talk about the business performance in the second quarter. Our second quarter revenue
more than doubled on a year-over-year basis to $5.7 billion as a result of the acquisitions of Allergan and Forest. On a
pro forma basis sales were up 12% excluding the impact of foreign currency, Namenda IR, and divestitures with
double-digit growth in our Brand and Global Generics segments.

The strong sales increase introduced from the integration of Allergan and Forest were the primary drivers of the 29%
increase in earnings per share to $4.41. Meanwhile non-GAAP EBITDA rose to $2.6 billion. And cash flow from
operations was about $1.7 billion, excluding one-time cash payments for severance, acquisitions, and integration. Tessa
will talk more about the financials shortly.
On slide 8 our Global Generics business is doing very well, and the units that comprise it are firing on all cylinders as
we prepare for the combination with Teva. Generic sales are up 17% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Generic
profitability is up. And our exceptional generic R&D capabilities are evident with 12 new first-to-file drugs this year.
This brings the total number of ANDAs under review to approximately 220 with 76 confirmed first-to-files.
U.S. generic revenues were at $1.1 billion in the quarter and continue to benefit from new product introductions and
contribution from high-barrier and semi-exclusive products like generic Concerta.
Meanwhile our international generics team continues to drive excellent performance in key markets, excluding the
impact of foreign currency such as the U.K., which was up 85% including the effect of the Auden Mckenzie transaction
that closed in May, and Russia, which was up 32%.
Turning to slide 9. Our Brand business continues to drive impressive performance where 12 of the top 15 global brands
growing, many with double-digit pro forma year-over-year growth. Sales increased 11% excluding Namenda IR, the
divestitures, and the impact of foreign exchange. And the success is broad-based. Excluding the impact of foreign
currency, we drove double-digit growth in Eye Care, GI, and key Women Health products, and Cardiovascular.
Double-digit growth from our latest largest leading brands like Botox, Restasis, Namenda XR and our fillers including
Juvederm. Double-digit growth from well-established brands like Bystolic, Lo Loestrin and Estrace; and double-digit
growth from Linzess, Ozurdex and other launched brands, which puts us in excellent position to power growth well
into the future. It is a terrific line-up of brands with long exclusivity and is backed by a great team on the ground and
our leading pipeline with multiple shots on each of our seven priority therapeutic areas.
Turning to slide 10. We continue to drive conversion of patients to Namenda XR right up to the end of the Namenda IR
exclusivity, reaching about 53% before generic entry. With continued promotion and the launch of Namzaric, we
believe the penetration rate goes even higher towards our target of 60% to 65% as the year progresses.
And with once-a-day dosing, formulary access at every one of the top eight plans, and a focused sales team, we have
maintained relatively stable volumes on Namenda XR, even as the Namenda IR prescriptions drop. We are now doing
the blocking and tackling to build demand and access for Namzaric. With full promotion just getting under way, our
DTC campaign beginning in September, and an anticipated seven out of the top 10 plans having coverage by the
beginning of 2016, we think we are well prepared to drive market expansion in 2016.
Given the broad use of combination donepezil and memantine therapy, the efficacy of Namzaric and the patient,
caregiver, and system benefits of one pill once a day, we think there's a great opportunity for the innovation of
Namzaric to become the cornerstone of once-a-day branded market in Alzheimer's treatment.
Turning to slide 11. In a few moments David Nicholson will give an update on the pipeline. But I want to point out that
our pipeline remains one of the best kept secrets of our company. With 70 projects in mid to late development we are in
an enviable position of having multiple programs in each of our therapeutic areas to help us sustain leadership in the
areas we choose to compete. And we have built this pipeline step by step, not by investing big dollars on discovery but
by investing in smart development projects.
Even with the excellent breadth and depth of our current pipeline, we are always on the lookout for R&D assets that
can extend our leadership by bringing novel approaches to existing therapy areas. In the last two months alone we've
announced agreements for four planned acquisitions in Aesthetics, Eye Care, and CNS. Each will bring novelty to
existing areas and will add to our ability to lead in these therapeutic areas. And each of these deals brings
game-changer potential ideas to our pipelines.

Kybella is off to a strong start in Aesthetics with sales already surpassing $1 million and a recent approval in Canada.
We are making great progress towards closing the transaction, now that we have cleared antitrust review in the U.S.
And as we announced yesterday, we no longer intend to issue our shares to complete this acquisition.
The Oculeve acquisition has also cleared HSR in the U.S. And we'll look forward to extending our dry eye
opportunities with their novel nasal neurostimulation device.
In CNS we are working to close deals to extend our migraine offering with Merck's first in oral – first-in-class oral
CGRP antagonist and the Naurex novel approach to treating mood disorders, including severe depression, which
remains a leading cause of suicide.
In closing our team continues to focus on execution. And the results indicate that we are exceptionally skilled at
delivering strong operating results while also doing surprising things that make our company the most dynamic in all of
healthcare. I'm so proud of our team for their performance, and I'm looking forward to what we can do with a
strengthened focus on Branded Pharmaceuticals and a significantly reduced operating structure and reloaded capital
structure.
With that I'll now turn the call over to Tessa.
Maria Teresa Hilado
Thank you, Brent. Good morning everyone. Turning to our overall results for the second quarter on slide 13. In Q2 we
delivered strong performance both year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter. On a non-GAAP basis consolidated net
revenue for the second quarter was $5.7 billion, an increase of 36% versus Q1 2015.
Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $406 million, compared to $185 million in the prior-year period.
Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 21.7%, an increase of 3 percentage points over the prior-year
quarter as a result of the Forest-branded products and Allergan business, which we have higher SG&A spend.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2.6 billion, an increase of 203% versus the prior year, driven by strong
revenues and higher gross margins across our segments.
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 29% to $4.41, compared to $3.42 per diluted share in
the second quarter of 2014.
Our non-GAAP tax rate improved from 17.1% in the year-ago period to 14.5% in the current-year quarter, mainly due
to the geographic mix of our businesses. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $1.4 billion, an increase
of 198% versus the year-ago quarter. Excluding acquisition-related restructuring and integration payments, our second
quarter free cash flow would be $1.7 billion.
Before turning to our business segment results I would like to take a moment to review our new segment reporting for
the second quarter. In this quarter we are reporting results in five segment.
The U.S. Brands segment represents sales and expenses related to branded products within the United States, including
Botox therapeutics. The U.S. Medical Aesthetic segment represents sales and expenses related to aesthetics and
dermatology products within the United States, including Botox cosmetics.
The International Brands segment represents revenues and operating expenses in countries that have the majority of
their businesses represented by branded sales and revenues and expenses related to product sales in Canada,
Switzerland, and Austria. The Global Generics segment represents revenues and operating expenses in countries that
have the majority of their business represented by generic product sales, our third-party Medis business, and revenues
and expenses related to product sales in the U.S., Canada, Switzerland, and Austria. The Anda distribution segment
results represent sales and expenses related to distribution of generic and brand pharmaceutical products manufactured
by third parties.

Also as a result of Teva's acquisition of Allergan's generic business, Allergan will report a generics business as
discontinued operations beginning in the third quarter of 2015. Since the divested business spans both Global Generics
and International Brands segments, it will be difficult today to model the remaining Allergan business. We will provide
some guidance in September.
Turning now to our U.S. Brand results on slide 15. The business delivered strong performance year over year and
quarter over quarter. U.S. Brands revenue was $2.44 billion for the quarter, up 331% versus the prior year period and
35% in the prior quarter, driven by the addition of the Forest and Allergan businesses and strong growth across key
products including Linzess and Namenda XR. Adjusted gross margin within U.S. Brands remained steady at 87.4%.
SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased to 20.8% versus 17.8% in the year-ago quarter, driven by expenses related
to the Forest and Allergan acquisitions.
Turning to slide 16 and our U.S. Medical Aesthetics business, second quarter revenues were $487 million, an increase
of 510% versus first quarter 2015 results. Second quarter gross margin of 93% and segment margin of 70.6% were
largely in line with expectations. SG&A in the quarter remained steady.
Turning to slide 17 and in our International Brands results, second quarter revenues were $717 million versus $169
million in the prior-year period, an increase of 324%. Gross margins increased 21.7 percentage points to 77.8% in the
second quarter, due largely to the inclusion of higher margin legacy Allergan products. Segment SG&A improved 7.2
percentage points to 32% versus Q1 2015 due largely to synergy capture related to the Allergan acquisition.
On slide 18 Global Generics revenues in the quarter were $1.6 billion, up 10% versus the prior-year period. Growth
was driven by strong sales in the base business, including generic Concerta, offset in part by additional competition on
certain products including generic Lidoderm. Adjusted gross margins increased 1 percentage point compared to the
year-ago quarter due to continued strong performance within our international business. Lower gross margin versus the
prior quarter was mainly due to lower contribution of Guanfacine ER and Oxycodone in the second quarter versus the
first quarter of 2015. SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue decreased slightly to 15% from 15.8% in the
year-ago quarter.
Turning to our Anda business on slide 19, revenues increased to $462 million, up from $427 million in the prior year,
an increase of 8% driven by trends in our base business and a higher mix of chain drugstore sales.
Slide 20 details our debt capitalization following the completion of our first full quarter following the close of the
Allergan acquisition. We ended the second quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $42.9 billion and equity of
$72.1 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing.
In the second quarter we paid down approximately $1.4 billion of our debt. Currently our leverage ratio stands at 3.9
times debt-to-pro-forma adjusted EBITDA versus 4.1 times in the prior quarter. We remain committed to using strong
free cash flows from our business segments to accelerate debt repayment. And we continue to remain committed to
investment grade ratings.
I'd now like to turn the call over to David Nicholson, who will provide an update on our Brands R&D progress in the
quarter. David?
C. David Nicholson, PhD
Thanks, Tessa, and good morning everyone. Let's go to slide 22. Our Brands R&D team continues to be tremendously
productive. Year to date and worldwide our strong mid-stage pipeline has delivered more than 100 pharmaceutical and
medical device approvals, and 56 regulatory submissions. I will highlight some of the most significant of these in my
overview.
Following the first round of integration prioritization we now have more than 70 mid- to late-stage development
projects with approximately 45 projects in either late-stage development or registration. The productivity of the legacy
Allergen R&D organizations is demonstrated by the industry-leading figure of 14 NME approvals in the United States

over the last 6.5 years. Going forward we'll continue to make data-driven prioritization decisions on all of our
programs.
In addition to rationalizing and driving productivity from our existing pipeline we are committed to identifying and
executing acquisitions and licensing agreements that further strengthen our long term leadership position in key
therapeutic areas. This is exemplified by our pending acquisitions of Kythera, Oculeve, and Naurex, and our licensing
of Merck's oral CGRP programs during the quarter.
The next two slides summarize some highlights and describe the progress in our late stage pipeline. Slide 23 shows
late-stage game-changing opportunities across our therapeutic areas. In aesthetics we are adding Kybella from Kythera
to our pipeline. Our Aesthetic pipeline already includes by Bimataprost for hair growth. Aczone and Sarecycline for
acne, as well as many line extensions to our fillers.
In Eye Care we are adding the intranasal dry eye device from Oculeve to our dry eye franchise, further enhancing our
leading position in this therapeutic area. My colleagues and I have reviewed our restated data and again find our
efficacy and tolerability data very compelling in comparison to recently published data for other compounds in
development and registration. In Phase III we are developing DARPin and have a sustained-release formulation of
Bimataprost.
In CNS we are adding the Naurex NMDA modulators to our pipeline. These compounds have the first novel
mechanism for mood disorders for more than two decades. We are also adding oral CGRP antagonists. These
compounds in license from Merck are designed both for the acute treatment as well as for the prophylaxis of migraine.
We also have Cariprazine in development and Namzaric, which combines two complementary therapeutic agents,
Namenda and Aricept.
Recently much attention has turned to prevention of Alzheimer's. And like all of us I hope that effective preventative
therapy will be discovered. Data on Namzaric was recently presented at the 2015 Alzheimer's Association International
Conference. The efficacy of Namzaric in patients with Alzheimer's is at least a similar magnitude to that reported with
the present, preventative agents in development.
In GI disorders, together with our partner Ironwood, we continue to develop dosage and formulations of our IBS-C
agent, Linzess, to offer a very complete package to physicians and patients. Also we're completing the initial
development of Eluxadoline, Viberzi, for IBS-D.
In Urology, together with our partner Serenity, we have intranasal desmopressin completing Phase III for Nocturia. In
our Anti-Infective franchise we continue to develop Dalvance and Avycaz. In Biologics Phase III will be completed
this year for Bevacizumab, a biosimilar of Avastin, which is part of our partnership with Amgen.
Last certainly not least is Botox. We continue to further develop and launch this agent across our respective CNS and
Urology franchises.
Turning to slide 24, I'm going to update you on progress with regulatory authorities for key late-stage products.
In Aesthetics Natrelle Inspira, textured breast implants, received FDA approval for women undergoing breast
reconstruction, augmentation, or revision surgery. And we're on track for FDA submission of our Volbella filler in the
third quarter of 2015. Yesterday we received FDA approval to market 28 additional styles of Natrelle 410 breast
implants. In Asia we received licensing rights for commercial sale of Juvederm in China and submitted an NDA for
Botox for crow's feet lines in Japan.
In Eye Care Botox received approval in Japan for the treatment of strabismus. We're on track for the FDA submission
of a multi-dose, preservative-free formulation of Restasis in September. We are currently enrolling patients in Phase III
trials for Bimataprost in the U.S. And we've initiated pivotal Phase III trials of our lead DARPin in age-related macular
degeneration on target and during this year.
In CNS we have a PDUFA date in September for Cariprazine as a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar mania. And
this quarter we launched Namzaric, and we'll be filing additional dose combinations of this agent later this year.

In GI our strong pipeline does continue to develop new opportunities. We expect to complete the Phase III study for a
low dosage form of Linzess to treat chronic idiopathic constipation in the second half of the year. And we expect to
submit an sNDA for this indication next year.
Meanwhile, Viberzi – Eluxadoline – has been approved by the FDA as a twice-daily oral treatment for IBS-D. We're
awaiting DEA scheduling of Viberzi prior to launch of this product in the United States. And we've submitted the
dossier of Eluxadoline in Europe in May.
In Women's Health enrollment in our Phase III trial of Esmya for the treatment of bleeding disorders caused by uterine
fibroids is on track. We're committed to completing trial enrollment this year.
In Urology we've completed our Phase III trials of SER 120 in Nocturia. The data is under our review prior to
submission to the agency.
In Anti-Infectives our development of a single dose formulation of Dalvance remains on track. We've made regulatory
submissions for approval in both the United States and Europe. We're also anticipating approval for Teflaro in
bacteremia during the course of this year.
On slide 25 we outline some of our most recent business development opportunities. Obviously these help us to further
solidify our leadership position in our core therapeutic area. With Kythera we add a first-in-class agent, Kybella, for the
treatment of submental fat, or double chin, to our product line. The product is launched the States and was recently
approved in Canada. In addition Kythera has an interesting and genetically validated hair growth property in early
development.
Oculeve will strengthen our leading position in dry eye with the OD-01 development program and intranasal
neurostimulatory device that increases tear production in patients with dry eye.
Our licensing agreement with Merck builds on our commitment to the development of treatments for migraines. We're
adding oral formulations of CGRP antagonists to our product line. The use of both small molecules, as well as
antibodies, has clearly shown that CGRP antagonism is effective in treating migraines. There are four injectable
antibodies in development, whilst we will have the only oral CGRP antagonist.
Finally, Naurex. The acquisition of Naurex adds innovative development programs in depression to our pipeline.
Depression is an area of medicine that has seen minimal progress for the last 20 years. The Naurex compounds are
NMDA modulators, a unique approach to the treatment in depression. These agents have the potential to be fast-onset
antidepressants. And hence may be beneficial in the alleviation of suicidality, which is so often a terrible feature of this
disorder. In early-stage development the Naurex team showed their compound indeed to be fast in onset and also to be
effective in treating depression, which failed to respond to traditional antidepressants.
In closing the second quarter 2015 was another period of continued strong productivity for the Allergan R&D team. We
look forward to continue to deliver on the promise of many of our development programs in our pipeline for the
remainder of 2015 and beyond.
With that I'd like to turn it over to Brent for closing remarks. Brent?
Brenton L. Saunders
Thank you, David. As you've heard we have a lot going on and look forward to giving you updates on our progress
over the next few months. In mid to late September we will provide updated guidance for our continuing operations for
the remainder of 2015. This will reflect our Global Generics business as discontinued operations, as we wait for the
close of the transaction with Teva next year.
In conjunction with our third quarter earnings result, we also plan to host an R&D update meeting on November 4 in
Irvine, California, at our campus. It will be our opportunity for the R&D team to shine a spotlight on the

With that I'd like to turn the call back to Lisa for Q&A.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Thank you, Brent. We'll now take questions. If you could please limit yourself to one question only. We have only 30
minutes to get through all of your questions. Thank you.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Thomas Schott>: ...question. One of the questions we've been getting post the Teva divestiture is as
you guys are considering transformational acquisitions, it's obviously a very fluid market out there right now. Is it
possible for Allergan to pursue a large transaction before the Teva deal closes if the right transaction were available? I
guess both from an operational and financial standpoint?
And just a very quick second one on that guidance in September, is that just 2015? Or can we think about the
preliminary view on either 2016 or an update on $25 [EPS] 2017 outlook at that time as well? Thanks so much.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. So with respect to potential for transformational M&A, I think that
the way to think about it is the most likely scenario would be after the close of Teva, if in fact we were to do
transformational M&A. Certainly anything is possible prior to that. And we have always been bold in thinking about
how to execute things if the timing was right.
But I think in fairness, given the commitment to our investment grade rating and our ability to deploy cash after the
deal has closed versus prior, or perhaps our flexibility to deploy cash after the deal closes is better than prior. I think
that's probably how you should think about it.
Now that doesn't mean we couldn't engage in analysis or discussions or other things like that with someone who was
interested in doing a deal with us or we were interested in doing a deal with them. But I would say that it's most likely
after the close of the Teva transaction.
With respect to the guidance, maybe I'll ask Tessa to talk about that for a second.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Yeah. So in September what we will be providing you is what the remaining will –
business will look like, since Teva will be discontinued operations. That's not exactly a very easy separation to do, and
also just to manage expectations, as we provide that, given the accounting rules, it will be very difficult at this point in
time for you to model what the remaining 2015 will look like.
As an example, for instance, debt will continue to remain with the Allergan Branded business and not go to
discontinued operations. There is no such thing as non-GAAP discontinued operations. So we'll provide a little bit more
clarity come September. But it's really largely focused on the remainder of 2015.

<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Just to follow up on that earlier question, Brent or Tessa. So when you give
discontinued – or rather when you give pro forma earnings going forward, which presumably only includes the
Branded business. Will that Branded business also include all the interest expense that you're carrying on your books?
In other words, I would assume that some of that $40.5 billion is going to reduce debt. So how do we think about that
when we think about the base business going forward?
And then secondly, just to follow up on that $25 number. That $25 obviously includes about $5 or $2.4 billion in EBIT
from the Generic business. Brent, at what point can we expect you to update us on that guidance? And I think on the
last call you didn't withdraw that $25. So any – again any color on how we should think about the company's ability to
replace that $2.4 billion in EBIT. Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: So, Tessa, want to take the first one?
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Yeah. So you definitely touched on some of the nuances related to discontinued
operations as it pertains to debt as an example, for instance. So on a go-forward basis, in the September earnings what
you will see is that debt will reside in the remaining company and not allocated to discontinued ops.
Obviously as you think about that on a go-forward basis, it would really largely depend on what we do with the capital
on a go-forward basis. What we had indicated in our call related to Teva that we would use a portion of the proceeds to
pay down debt. But again it's largely dependent on how much we use for capital deployment.
Having said that though, we are committed to our investment grade rating. So we will ensure that the appropriate
amount of debt is paid down.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yes. I think the net-net, Jami, on guidance – and I know this will drive your teams nuts
and many on the phone nuts – that the rules are the rules. It's the accounting policy. So the next couple quarters till we
actually close the transaction, it will be very difficult for you guys to run models and do clean comparisons. We are as
always committed to as much transparency around product sales like we were in this press release. And we will do the
best we can, given the rules that we have to all live with. But it will make for some tough modeling work on your guys'
part over the next two or three quarters. And we apologize in advance for that. And we'll do everything we can to help
facilitate that.
With respect to the $25 aspiration, what I said – I think you asked this question on the deal call if I recall correctly,
Jami – was that we absolutely remain steadfast in our aspiration to increase our earnings per share to as high as
possible, including the $25 target. What has changed obviously is, by selling the Generics business and the $2.4 billion
of EBITDA to Teva, the timing of that aspiration. And so we need to continue to look at how we will deploy that
capital and how the timing of the deployment of that capital will pull through to give a more precise view of it.
So again we're not withdrawing the $25, but we will come back and have to add some variables to it like capital
deployment and timing of capital deployment to get there.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Sure.

<Q - Liav Abraham>: Good morning. Brent, another question on the topic of business development. I wanted to get a

transformational transaction and interested in moving up the value chain. You've also said that you're not necessarily in
favor of early-stage research.

I'm trying to reconcile these comments. Can you engage in a larger pharma transaction and move up the value chain
without a greater commitment to early-stage research going forward? And isn't this really necessary in – to at least – to
a certain extent to secure longer-term organic growth?
And then very quickly for Bill, can you comment on how much you'll be giving away incrementally in terms of rebates
in order to secure formulary status for Namzaric next year? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Sure. So, Liav, I think the answer to the first part of your question is yes with an
exclamation point on it. Look, I think we love research. And we have no issue with research. We just don't like to do it
ourselves, unless of course it's unique research or something that isn't wildly – widely available in external research,
like venture-backed companies or research- or academia-backed companies or smaller biotechs.
And so I think if you look at what David and his team did with Allergan, we kept the research capabilities where they
had unique strength and proven track records, like in Aesthetics and Eye Care. And we have – and we will continue to
fund that as appropriate.
What we won't do is waste our money on R&D that is widely available elsewhere. And so I think you have to really
consider us as very tactical when it comes to research, basic research. But also a virtual-like company when it comes to
research, as demonstrated by some of the deals we just did, like Naurex or even the licensing of the oral CGRPs from
Merck. David, any other comments on research?
<A - C. David Nicholson, PhD>: Look, one of the points that I always like to make is how impressed I am with the
biotech industry these days. I think the biotech industry today with – founded by so many brilliant academic scientists,
coupled with more and more people with pharmaceutical executive experience, are excellent in generating early stage
molecules, which we can pick up and further develop through to the market. There are plenty of opportunities out there.
Also when you look at what's going on in the academic world, you increasingly see academic institutions setting
themselves up to generate more spin-off opportunities. And we are very keen on interacting with the external world.
We think that's where research should be performed.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And to be fair, and you've heard me say this before, Liav, I don't think what we do is any
different than the great other innovators in our industry in really not doing discovery themselves but licensing in
compounds. And there's some fantastic companies that have solved for huge unmet medical need without discovery
labs. And I won't go through naming them, but they get the biotech moniker. But they really have no discovery, but
rather smart business development and licensing. And that's essentially our approach. We just come at it with a very
practical approach and a real bent for not wasting money.
Bill, you want to talk about Namzaric?
<A - William J. Meury>: Yeah, Liav. Listen, on Namzaric working with Adamas we got a product to market that the
Alzheimer's community has wanted for over 10 years, since we launched Namenda in 2004. We think it should be the
standard of care for patients with moderate to severe disease. And we're at the very early stages of the exclusivity
period. And so our primary aim is going to be market share and volume and giving access to physicians and caregivers.
As it relates to the discount rate it's going to be consistent with what we had for XR in 2015. And for XR I think it will
be consistent in 2016. No dramatic changes. We manage the price/volume relationship on that business very, very
carefully. And we're at a price point that is attractive to health plans and acceptable to us.
<Q - Liav Abraham>: That's great. Thank you.

<Q - Sumant S. Kulkarni>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On your dry eye programs after the
purchase of Oculeve, do you see any gaps in the types of product offerings that you have in that portfolio? And very
quickly how should we think about your cardiovascular franchise given that Bystolic is still a relatively significant
contributor in terms of sales?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So maybe, David, you want to talk about dry eye platform? Just if there are any
gaps?
<A - C. David Nicholson, PhD>: Sure. Look, dry eye is a underserved market at the moment. There's Restasis out
there and a couple of other things in development, but there are not many product offerings for dry eye. And a
relatively low proportion of patients suffering from dry eye actually receive treatment at the moment.
I think with Restasis obviously we have the leading product. Oculeve is a very interesting device. I used it myself
recently. I can assure you it works. And it's really adding to our product line.
In addition to the anti-inflammatory agents like Restasis, there are some other opportunities in the biotech pipeline with
different mechanisms of action. So I think in the future we are going to see other opportunities out there, which are
going to be effective via other approaches in dry eye.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Bill, anything to add?
<A - William J. Meury>: Yeah. I would just say right now we have the waterfront largely covered. We have an OTC,
or artificial tear. Oculeve essentially is a natural tear option. And then RESTASIS is an anti-inflammatory. And so we
offer a more complete product line for the Eye Care community than any company in the sector. And I agree with
David that there are a few opportunities out there, but we have most of the market covered.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. And I think also people underestimate the importance of the multi-dose
preservative-free, which we intend to file in September.
Having worked in this space before one of biggest issues with chronic eye drops, particularly Restasis because of its
single-dose applicator, is dosage and compliance. Because it's very hard to get that little single dose in the eye.
And so for patient convenience and patient compliance in dosing, the multi-dose applicator is a huge innovation and
something that we're very excited about bringing to market next year. And then keep in mind we also have four other
development programs of both Restasis and novel mechanisms earlier in our pipeline.
On Bystolic in cardio I mean I think the way I think about it – and Bill can certainly chime in – is Bystolic, while
certainly a cardio drug, is managed a bit more like a primary care drug, in about 80% of its volume comes from our
primary care field force. We do have a partnership with Trevena for an earlier stage product. So we're not completely
walking away from cardio. But it's not one of our core focus therapeutic areas.
Bill or David, anything you'd add?
<A - William J. Meury>: Yeah. That's exactly right. The exclusivity period on Bystolic extends out for many years.
It's a big primary care product. We're going to increase detailing in the second half of the year. We have great
formulary coverage. And it's got a terrific following in cardiology and primary care.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And I always hear anecdotal, but I hear from doctors all the time about it being their
favorite beta-blocker to prescribe, so long as they can get it through managed care.
<Q - Sumant S. Kulkarni>: Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.

<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes. Morning. Brent or maybe Bill, can you talk about some of the key products in the
portfolio and just the dynamics in the quarter? Restasis seemed to be very, very strong in the quarter, much bigger than
what we thought. Breast Aesthetics was much weaker than we thought and Botox. Just some of the key products and
just the dynamics, U.S. versus International, what's going on? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Sure. Maybe I'll ask Bill to talk about his. And then Philippe maybe you could chime in
on a few of the key aesthetic products.
<A - Philippe Schaison>: Sure.
<A - William J. Meury>: Yeah. I'll start with Botox, Botox therapeutic. We're focused on two high-growth areas,
which is migraine and overactive bladder. Our priorities right now are to increase injector productivity and expand our
injector user base. And we have complete focus on that.
We think the trends in the second quarter look terrific. And I think the outlook for the rest of the year is the same. I
don't see anything that would disrupt the reliability of that sale stream.
As it relates to Restasis we're focused on a large OTC artificial tear market. There are millions of patients overusing
artificial tiers. We have an effort where we're – to increase the diagnosis rate through in-office screenings for dry eye,
which have been linked to blurred vision, adverse post-op outcomes. And so there's an educational effort there. And
then finally, we launched a primary care effort for Restasis. And the formulary coverage on the drug is rock solid.
And then I'd just probably add Linzess in there. We have our foot on the gas. The response to our second wave of
direct-to-consumer advertising is exceeding industry norms. We just launched a effort into long-term care for the first
time since Linzess was approved, and that's about 25% of the market. Our relationship with Ironwood is excellent. And
we're waiting to launch a low-dose version of Linzess.
And so I feel very good about our top products. And as Brent mentioned in his opening remarks, 12 of our 15 products
are increasing. If you look at the U.S. business 12 of the 15 products are increasing at a double-digit rate. And we've
had virtually in my opinion no disruption due to the integration. And there's total focus on customers.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Great. Philippe, you have some thoughts?
<A - Philippe Schaison>: Sure. On facial business grew by 13.5% versus the prior year for the quarter. And year to
date we grew by 13%. Very strong growth also in Botox, which grew by 12.5%.
Although the growth is mostly linked to our strong DTC campaign, and you might have seen our Botox ad and our
Voluma ad. And on Voluma you can see that the brand awareness increased by 42% from 27% in Q1. So very strong
business and linked to very strong advertising during the year, second quarter.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Great. Thanks.

one. Would you be able to provide us the constant currency growth rate for the Aesthetic products? This is I guess the
way we're tracking this, might be really useful to have those.
And then second regarding the article on the Mesalamine franchise, I noticed that you were excluded in both CVS and
Express formularies starting in 2016. How should we think about this franchise? Is there another phase to this
franchise? Or is this something that will generally – we should think about it as a flat to declining?

<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Yeah. So on an overall basis ex currency we grew about 11%. Think about it this way.
Most of our Aesthetics products are really mostly U.S. products. So there are products sold internationally, but it's not
significant as it relates to the total portfolio. So a good amount of them does not have any currency impact, given
they're U.S.-based.
<A - William J. Meury>: Yeah. And as it relates to the Mesalamine product line, as you know, Ronny, you win some
and you lose some. We got a big win with Linzess on that same formulary at the expense of Amitiza. But as it related to
the Mesalamine product line, they excluded it.
We view it as a mature business. It is promoted behind Linzess. We have a core group of users. We're managing
volume. And of course taking price increases when and where appropriate. And that's how I would think about it as an
established business.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: Thanks. Good morning. In just running through the segment data it looks like the Generic
business contributed about 23% of segment profitability inclusive of R&D allocation. And I guess going forward we're
all sort of tasked with trying to figure out how much of the proceeds in the Generic business will be applied to
immediate debt reduction versus potentially using internal cash flow generation to pay down debt and target external
opportunities.
But is that sort of the right percentage to think about in kind of just of a ballpark number when thinking about your
prior indications that the combined business would generate around $8 billion in free cash flow? Would the Generic
business count for roughly 20%, 25% of that?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Well it's a – and Tessa can certainly add her $0.02. Elliot, I think it's not that simple. And
that's the issue I think that we were trying to highlight with the earlier comments around it being very tough for you
guys – and our apologies in advance for that – for the next couple quarters. Because what's in that business it's – as we
report it today it isn't necessarily what's being sold to Teva down a straight line.
Also as you do GAAP reporting and reporting around discontinued operations, what gets assigned to what part of each
business is also not intuitive and not necessarily straightforward to reality either?
So it's going to make for some difficult quarters ahead. Again we are committed to as much transparency as we can
possibly provide around product sales. And perhaps cash flow may be a good way to look at the business. But it's not as
straightforward or as intuitive as you would hope or want it to be, just in fairness. I don't know if, Tessa, you're...
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: Yeah. I mean if I may just add to that just to give a little bit of context. It's to remember
that we were really managing the business on a consolidated basis. We weren't managing the business separately as
solely a Generic business and a Branded business. We didn't have the holding company approach. We actually were
managing the business on a consolidated basis.
And from a segment reporting basis even today in International Brands or Generic products in there and in Global
Generics, there's also Branded products.
The other thing to note, which you also highlighted, is from a balance sheet perspective, it's really all intermingled as it
relates to debt and the tax rate. Some of the things are not necessarily operationally related. So I just wanted to give
context as to why [ph] it's not as difficult to start to like (54:58) strip out and do a percentage of cash flow and say that's
what's attributable to Generics.

Your next question will come from the line of Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Great. Thanks guys. Brent, just a question for you. A lot of people have been watching the
legacy Allergan products, waiting for some moderation. That hasn't happened. In fact they were really strong.
And so the question that I have is just given the difference in spending support levels on sales and marketing between
the legacy Allergan and where you're at today, and I'm just looking at slide 15. Number one, do you feel like that
infrastructure is right-sized? And then secondly, just your confidence level in some of the key products and being able
to continue to sustain that growth? I mean Botox and Restasis were very strong.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. I think, Randall, it's a great question. So I think we are – we have rationalized our
sale force for our acquisitions and for the market as we see it over the next few years. And so we don't anticipate any
additional cuts in the field.
And in fact we would selectively add if we thought the opportunity paid back. So as an example with the acquisition of
Kythera, we will increase our facial Aesthetic sales force by roughly 75 positions, making us the strongest field force in
Aesthetics by a large margin.
And so I think you'll see us continue to look for ways, so long as we're increasing our line call type strategy of product
flow, either through our R&D engine or through licensing and acquisition, of building and making sure we maintain
leadership, strong leadership positions commercially in each of our therapeutic areas.
With respect to spending on DTC and otherwise we always look at the return on investment. And so the extent we think
we can add more money to a Botox or a Restasis or a Linzess or even Namzaric, which will kick off in the fall DTC.
We're always monitoring the situation, looking at both response and return on those investments. And have no issue
making them so long as we see a strong ROI.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: The other thing that we'd heard legacy Allergan talk a lot about was the international
emerging market in Asian geographies as a big opportunity. Is that something that we should still think about for you
guys that is in front of you?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. I think it is. It's a slower build but bigger – but big opportunity over time. I mean
look at the approvals for example of Juvederm in China this quarter. That gives us a great opportunity to build on
Botox in that market. I'll be down in Brazil next week with our team, looking at how we can continue to leverage our
infrastructure in Latin America and grow.
So clearly the divestiture of the Teva business has some drawbacks in mid-markets like Eastern Europe and Russia in
that we were going to leverage the old legacy Actavis infrastructure in those markets. But I think we can compensate
for those and continue to grow and build in emerging markets.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Great. Thanks, Brent.

on the DARPin Japanese trial that's ongoing? Should we be expecting an update soon? And what would that look like?
And then second one for Brent, if I may. On transformational M&A the question we all keep getting from investors, so
how do you think about companies with growth profiles that might be lower than with your 10%? Or companies with
potential biosimilar headwinds? Or even ex U.S. companies for that matter? Just wanted to understand how you think

about this.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Sure. David, you want to take DARPin? And I'll come back to the transformational
M&A question.
<A - C. David Nicholson, PhD>: Yeah. So sure. Yeah. So for DARPin in Japan, we actually want Japan to join in our
global Phase III program. In order to do that, we needed to complete a small study in Japan and compare it to an
additional small study in the United States. We're in the process of finalizing those studies prior to including Japanese
sites in the Phase III trials sometime next year. So yeah. There will be some updates on that going forward.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And I think to your second point, Umer, around transformational M&A with companies
with lower growth profiles or the like. Look, I think in that in fairness it would be very difficult for us to do a
transformational deal with a company with a higher growth rate, because I think based on at least today's measure, the
only one with a higher growth rate is Celgene. So that would really limit the universe.
That being said, I think that the issue for us is, look, we want to be in Growth Pharma. Would we be willing to go from,
let's say, roughly 10% to a 9% top-line growth rate to do a highly accretive bottom-line deal? The answer is absolutely.
Would we be willing to go from 10% to 3% or 4% top-line growth to do a highly accretive deal? I would say highly
unlikely.
And so we want to go out and make sure that we can acquire something that we believe has a growth orientation to it.
That has longer-duration assets. And I think you should also keep in mind we're pretty – as I use the word – bold in our
thinking.
So I think a lot of people look at the universe of transformational deals and say, well you can't touch this because it's
got this particular product drag or this particular issue. We've been known to be very creative in solving for those things
in the past. And albeit a very small deal, I would point to Furiex as just an illustration, where they had two assets. They
had the NDA for Eluxadoline, and they had a royalty stream from Takeda. We divested the royalty stream of Takeda to
Royalty Pharma at the time we announced the deal. We had that pre-wired.
And so we kept what we wanted, and we sold something that was valuable to somebody else to help pay for the deal.
And so to the extent we look at companies or opportunities that have things we like and some things perhaps we don't
like, there are always potential solutions for solving for those issues.

<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. Brent, if another party were to boldly approach you as an inversion target, other than
doing what's best for shareholders, which I think you have a reputation of doing, along with Paul and the Board, are
there certain elements of the model and its specialness and growth profile that you'd be concerned about that might play
into your thinking about longer-term shareholder value creation? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So, Gregg, I think you're right. It would have to be a bold offer. Second, I think
Paul and I always would debate and talk to our board about the best long-term interests of our shareholders. And I think
as you step back and look at what I think is so special about this company, a lot of it goes to the depth and quality of
our management team. And so to the extent someone would be open to thinking about cultural change and change and
balance to leadership and talent and management, I think that would be more helpful for us.
I think clearly our commitment to R&D and the way we think about R&D is also very special. And I think our ability to
be nimble and move quickly and do what we believe is always in the shareholders' best interest is also a bit unique.
And so those are the types of discussions that we would have. It's not limited to that. But that would be, I think, at least
top of mind for debate. And I see Paul shaking his head, so I know he's in agreement.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks guys.

Your next question will come from the line of David Maris with BMO Capital.
<Q - David W. Maris>: Good morning. On the Naurex, this looks to be like a potential $1 billion-plus drug. And I
know we'll cover more of it during the R&D day. But if maybe you can talk a little bit about what has attracted you to
this? How it's differentiated in the market? But also most importantly, what's the – what are the next steps toward the
path to approval?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So I'll ask David to comment. I'll just give you my quick take of why I was so
excited to do the deal with Naurex. Is that this is an area, a huge market with huge white space for unmet need. You can
debate the numbers. But very few patients – in fact the minority of patients – are adequately served by SSRI or SNRI.
And then they have to live with, in some cases, very difficult side effects from those medicines, as well as a long onset
of action for those with acute issues that need to be dealt with more quickly.
And I think, David, you mentioned this in your earlier remarks. There has been no real novel breakthrough in
depression in about 20 years. And so for us to be able to be at the forefront of potentially revolutionizing the treatment
of this very large and horrific disease is something that I think is very exciting for us, given our commitment to leading
in CNS and in particular psychiatry.
David, your $0.02?
<A - C. David Nicholson, PhD>: Yeah. I've only got time for $0.02 apparently, so I'll have to be quick. So I've been
working in psychiatry for 20 years. I've taken compounds through to the market. Bill and his team have
commercialized some of the biggest-selling antidepressants.
So I think the team that we've got here knows depression in the area over the last 20 decades (sic) [20 years] (1:05:20).
So when an opportunity like Naurex comes along with a novel mechanism of action – over the last two decades. Yeah.
I've been corrected by my colleagues.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: It's pretty odd if you're here for 20 decades.
<A - C. David Nicholson, PhD>: Just feels like 20.
<Q - David W. Maris>: Watch the Botox.
<A - C. David Nicholson, PhD>: So when a new opportunity comes along with a new mechanism of action, I think the
team here can recognize it and seize it pretty quickly.
These things are exciting. Completely novel mechanism of action. And showing a fast-on set of action in depression.
And not only in depression, but in depression where the patients fail to respond to SSRIs. So that's an exciting
opportunity.
And the next steps for us are to get into Phase III as quickly as possible with GLYX-13, the lead molecule. And to get
into Phase IIb with the second compound, NRX-1074. And we aim to do that as early as possible next year.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Certainly, we'd like to close the deal. But then we'll move pretty aggressively to doing it.
<Q - David W. Maris>: Great. Thanks very much.

You might be on mute sir.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Sorry about that. Thanks for your patience. I apologize. Yeah. So thanks for my taking my
question as well. I appreciate it. I guess I have a couple of questions here.
The first is with respect to the Generics business that you're selling to Teva, there were some slight differences between
the press release and the slides. Could you just tell us what the organic growth was in the second quarter of the
Generics business that you're selling? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. Dave, if I understand the question I think the differences are between what we
have and what Teva had on their slide deck. And it would be very difficult for us to comment on the differences
between what we have and what another company has.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: So if I recall we provided the Generics business EBITDA for 2015. And they provided a
number for 2016. That was the difference.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Oh sorry.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: And obviously we can't comment on their...
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And just to be fair, it's their number for 2016, not our number for 2016. Just to be clear.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yeah. I'm sorry. I meant the difference between Allergan's press release today and
Allergan's slides today, there were some slight differences in the revenue reported on your [ph] PF slide (1:08:11)...
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Got it.
<A - Maria Teresa Hilado>: We can address that.
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: Yeah. Hi, David. It's Lisa. So in the top Global Branded product highlight slide, the ex
U.S. Branded products from Forest, Warner Chilcott, and Actavis are not counted as Generic products. They're counted
in the Brand total.
When you look at our Global Generics segment, our Global Generics segment still counts those as per accounting rules
as part of the Global Generics business. That's the difference.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: And in terms of the organic growth of the Generics business, what was that in the second
quarter?
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: That's what we gave you as – well the Global Generics segment itself grew 17% on a
constant currency basis quarter over quarter.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And that's not a clean...
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: Right.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: What – that's the point I was trying to make earlier about why it's so difficult to model.
That's not apples to apples of what's being sold and what's staying. They're puts-and-takes in from the segments versus
what was actually being sold. And that's what makes this so complicated.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Okay. Got it. Okay. Yeah. I can follow up on that. And then separately with respect to the
Namenda switch here, obviously it's taking you longer than expected to get to your target of 60% to 65%. But you're
leaving that unchanged. I guess I'm a little bit surprised if you're leaving that unchanged, when you talk about 60% to
65% is that a percentage of the total prescriptions including the Generics? Or is that just the Branded Allergen franchise
that you're now forecasting?

<A - William J. Meury>: That would be the total Namenda business including Brands and Generics. And the way we
think about it is we launched Namzaric only 2.5 weeks ago. Our DTC campaign starts in September. We expect
exceptional formulary coverage by January 1. And the incremental sales from Namzaric by essentially taking
advantage of an untapped combination market, especially in moderate Alzheimer's disease, effectively is going to get
us to our target conversion rate.
As I said earlier if the formulary coverage had not developed like it has, we might have a different situation right here.
But as it relates to 2016 Namzaric is going to be highly economical. [Namenda] XR already is. And I think the majority
of patients are going to have an opportunity to get it.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.
<A - William J. Meury>: Sure.
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: Okay. Thanks everybody. Brent, would you like to make some closing remarks?
Brenton L. Saunders
Yes. I would just like to thank everyone for joining the call today. And in closing just to summarize I think we had a
very strong and well-executed quarter. I think our plans are in motion to continue to focus on operational excellence
and driving our growth agenda and our focus on our key therapeutic categories and establishing long-duration
leadership in those categories.
I think our leading pipeline, our reloaded capital structure, and our now focus on Branded Pharmaceuticals and
willingness to take bold and decisive actions make us the most dynamic company in Growth Pharma. I thank you for
your time and look forward to updating you later again in September.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Thanks everyone. And I know we didn't get to quite a few people in the Q&A, so we'll follow up with you shortly.
Thanks.
