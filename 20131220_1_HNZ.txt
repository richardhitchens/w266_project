Presentation
Operator
Good morning. I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the H.J.
Heinz Company's second quarter fiscal 2014 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded at the request of the
H.J. Heinz Company.
I would now like to turn the call over to Marcos Romaneiro, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Mr. Romaneiro,
you may begin your conference.
Marcos Romaneiro, Senior Vice President, Global Finance
Good morning and welcome to the Heinz's second quarter earnings conference call. I'm Marcos Romaneiro, Senior
Vice President, Global Finance and I'm here with Paulo Basilio, Chief Financial Officer.
Today's presentations include forward-looking statements as defined in U.S. securities law, which are based on current
expectations subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances and which are not a guarantee of future performance.
Actual results may differ materially due to a variety of factors, including the risk factors section of our latest Form
10-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement except as required by law.
Our remarks will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to the GAAP numbers in our 10-Q
filing. Our 10-K and 10-Q are available on our website at the Investor Relations page. This morning, Paulo Basilio will
provide an overall summary of the second quarter results and I'll briefly discuss the individual segment and highlights
from the cash flow and balance sheet. Paulo will conclude the call by touching on recent announcements.
Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Paulo.
Paulo Basilio, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Marcos. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. The company's sales in the second quarter
were $2.7 billion, a 2.7% decrease versus prior year. This reflects unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2.2% and a
decrease in volume of 1.5%. Favorable pricing of 0.4% offset the impact of divestitures. The volume decrease was
driven by category softness in the U.S. and UK businesses along with our strategic decision to focus on margin
improvement by limiting the frequency and depth of promotional expanding.
Below net sales, quarterly results reflected two groups of one-time costs and purchase accounting impacts, which
totaled nearly $260 million [ph]. First, we incurred nearly $200 million to simplify the organization, drive productivity
and provide resources to reinvest in growing the business. About 150 million of this represents severance and benefits
costs to reduce our global workforce by approximately 2,000 positions or slightly more than 5%. The remaining $50
million includes professional fees and contract and lease terminations along with asset writedowns and accelerated
depreciation to close corporate office and a factory in China and reduce manufacturing capacity of a factory in the UK.

Second, purchase accounting adjustments adversely impacted gross profit and operating income by a total of $52
million. This included a final $38 million of revalued opening inventories and $14 million in incremental amortization.
Third, we incurred $8 million in merger and transaction related costs this quarter, including advisory fees and
professional costs. Setting aside these items, gross margin was comparable to prior year and operating income
increased by mid single digits, despite the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange.
Our adjusted EBITDA was 512 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year. These results reflect the favorable
impact of business productivity investments. We expect these benefits to increase in future periods.
Below operating income, we incurred incremental interest expense of $91 million, reflecting higher average debt
balances resulting from the merger. And we incurred an additional $5 million in other expense from the amortization of
debt issuance costs.
Income taxes added $34 million to net income, reflecting the reported net loss of the quarter's actual tax rate.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Marcos to provide a few comments on second quarter results by geographic
segment and our year-to-date cash flow.
Marcos Romaneiro, Senior Vice President, Global Finance
Thank you, Paulo. Turning to North America consumer products, sales decreased by 47 million or 5.9%, reflecting
decreased volume of 5% and unfavorable foreign exchange. Volumes were impacted by reduced promotions and timing
of promotional activity influenced also by a later Thanksgiving holiday and category softness primarily in frozen
nutritional meals.
Operating income decreased 6 million or 3.1% as lower volume and the purchase accounting impacts that Paulo just
discussed were partially offset by favorable SG&A, driven by workforce reductions and lower marketing spend.
Looking next at the U.S. Foodservice segment, sales decreased by 2 million or 0.4% due to pricing. Operating income
increased 13 million or 30% as current-year restructuring initiatives drove lower manufacturing and SG&A costs. This
was partially offset by the purchase accounting impact.
Turning to Europe, sales decreased 26 million or 3.2%. Volume was down 3% as continued strong performance in
Russia was more than offset by category softness in the UK, Italy and parts of Continental Europe. Benefits from
favorable net pricing of 0.6% and favorable exchange of 0.7% were offset by the divestitures of a small soup business
in Germany and a non-core product line in Russia.
Operating income decreased 24 million. This reflects the purchase accounting impact along with lower volumes and
increased marketing spend.
Moving to the Asia-Pacific region, sales decreased 39 million or 6.5%. Unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates
drove more than all of the decrease at 7.3%. Volume increased by 1.2%, driven by sauces and infant nutrition in China,
partially offset by nutritional beverages declines in India and the timing of Ramadan in Indonesia. Pricing decreased by
0.4%.
Operating income decreased by 44 million or 81% driven by the purchase accounting impact and unfavorable foreign
exchange translation rates, partially offset by lower SG&A.
Finally, in our Rest of the World segment, sales increased by 10 million or 3.5% driven by volume growth of 5.6%
across the segment and increased price led by Brazil and Egypt. Brazil posted double-digit growth in combined volume
and price and we expect continued strong growth with the recent launch of Heinz Baby Food in that market. Foreign
exchange translation rates decreased sales by 5.4%.
Operating income increased by 12 million or 44% driven by higher volumes, favorable pricing and product mix and
lower SG&A costs, partially offset by the purchase accounting impact and increased marketing investments.

Now, let's take a look at cash flow on a 6-month year-to-date basis. Cash flow from operating activities was a negative
502 million, compared to a positive 291 million a year ago. This 793 million decrease was driven by unfavorable
one-time cost totaling 738 million due to the transaction costs and restructuring and higher interest expense payments
of 135 million. This was partially offset by favorable movement in working capital.
Excluding these two impacts, year-to-date cash flow from operations is higher than the prior year. Cash used for
investing activities totaled 21.7 billion compared to 151 million in the prior year quarter. This change reflects the
merger consideration, net of cash on hand, of 21.5 billion. Capital spending was 219 million compared to 176 million
in the prior year quarter, driven by an $88 million lease buyout under the changes of Control Provisions.
Cash provided by financing activities totaled 24.3 billion compared to cash used for financing activities of $422 million
in the prior year quarter. The merger was funded by equity contributions totaling $16.5 billion, approximately $9.5
billion of proceeds drawn under the senior credit facilities and $3.1 billion upon the issuance of the notes, partially
offset by $4.3 billion in debt repayments and $316 [ph] million in debt issuance costs. We also made our first preferred
stock dividend payment of $180 million this quarter.
On October 27, 2013, the company had total debt of 14.7 billion and cash of approximately 2.6 billion. We expect the
cash will be utilized to liquidate accrued obligations under the merger agreement, pay preferred stock dividends, meet
seasonal working capital requirements and also fund future restructuring expenditures.
Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Paulo for a few closing remarks.
Paulo Basilio, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Marcos. I'd like to touch on two recent company announcements and our expected impact on future periods.
The first is the change in our fiscal year. On October 21st, our Board of Directors approved a change in our fiscal
year-end from Sunday closest to April 30 to Sunday closest to December 31. The Form 10-Q that we filed last week
will be our last under the old fiscal year and we will file a transitional report on Form 10-K for the 8 months ended
December 29, 2013. The company will subsequently file our quarterly and annual reports for the new fiscal year ending
December 28, 2014.
The second is the closure of three factories in U.S. and Canada, which we announced on November 14 and plan to
complete by the middle of calendar year 2014. We expect that 1,350 employees will be affected with total charge of
approximately $63 million. We're also planning to implement projects based on SAP platform and tools in the U.S. and
Russia at the end of the first quarter. Once this phase is completed, we expect that two-thirds of Heinz global
businesses will be utilizing our global ERP system and tools, enabling floor productivity and efficiency.
As you can see, we are making significant progress in establishing the foundation to enable us to deliver our vision of
Heinz, to be the best-fit company, grow in a better world.
Marcos and I would like to thank you for participating in today's call. Happy holidays to you and your family.
