And now to comments from Qualcomm's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.
Steven M. Mollenkopf
Thank you Warren, and good afternoon, everyone.
We delivered a stronger than expected quarter, with earnings per share coming in above the high end of our initial
guidance, driven by stronger 3G/4G device sales and lower operating expenses in QCT. QCT chipset shipments were
near the high end of expectations, with low-tier strength across OEMs, particularly in China, offsetting some weakness
in thin modem sales at a key customer.
QTL revenues were higher than expectations on stronger 3G/4G device volumes and ASPs. And we continued to make
progress in signing up Chinese licensees, although there is still more work to be done on that front.
During the quarter, we also returned approximately $2.8 billion to stockholders through dividends and stock
repurchases, which included the completion of the incremental $10 billion in stock repurchases we announced last
March. This $10 billion is over and above our commitment to return a minimum of 75% of free cash flow to our
stockholders.
We are also very pleased to have announced an agreement to form a joint venture with TDK to enable the delivery of
RF front-end modules and RF filters into fully integrated systems for mobile devices and other IoT applications. Once
closed, we will add TDK's capabilities in micro-acoustic RF filtering, packaging, and module integration technologies
to our RF360 portfolio to offer leading-edge RF solutions in fully integrated systems that we believe will provide
significant advantages in performance and time to launch across our Snapdragon product tiers. The deal is expected to
close in early 2017 and is forecasted to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings in its first year.
We have a strong pipeline of new RF front-end products, including new generations of our Envelope Tracker, antenna
tuner, switches, and CMOS and Galliumarsenid PAs. Our gas PAs are anticipated to enter production in 2017.
In addition, we continue to deepen our level of cooperation with and investment in China. We just announced a
cooperation agreement with the province of Guizou, including the formation of a joint venture that will design,
develop, and sell advanced server chipset technology in China. This builds on the announcement we made in October
detailing the availability of our server development platform, which is now sampling to Tier 1 cloud customers and the
strategic partnerships we have established with Xilinx and Mellanox.
We continue to make good progress on the elements of our strategic realignment plan [SRP] and are on track to achieve
our cost savings targets.
I would also like to welcome Jeff Henderson to the board. Jeff brings extensive financial and operational management
experience to his position as an independent director, including 10 years as CFO of Cardinal Health and past
automotive industry experience. Following our annual meeting in March, assuming our slate of directors are elected,
our board size will be reduced to 12 members, and the average tenure will be reduced to approximately five years.
I would also like to congratulate Cristiano Amon on his promotion to President of QCT. He provided exceptional
leadership over his 18 years at Qualcomm and will play a critical role in expanding QCTs roadmap, enhancing our
customer relationships, structuring our efforts for success in our adjacent opportunities, and positioning the business for
long-term success.

On that note, we continue to be pleased with the performance and design traction of our Snapdragon 820 processor.
The first product announcement based on the Snapdragon 820 occurred at CES, and we expect a number of exciting
launches in the first half of this calendar year, including many at Mobile World Congress. We now have more than 100
design wins based on the Snapdragon 820, and the product is entering mass production using 14-nanometer LPP
technology.
At the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month, it was clear that many industries are looking to leverage mobile
technology into their products, and businesses are looking to the leaders in communications and compute systems such
as Qualcomm to make the world more connected and smarter. Our many announcements at the show reflect our
progress extending Qualcomm technology into adjacent and new areas, including automotive, IoT, and networking.
In auto, we announced that Qualcomm Snapdragon 602a processors will be commercially available in 2017 Audi
vehicles. We also introduced our next-generation Snapdragon 820 automotive processor as well as several other
products, including our wireless charging technology.
For IoT, we announced a smart home reference platform using the Snapdragon 212 processor, the new Qualcomm aptX
HD solution for high-resolution audio over Bluetooth, a new Bluetooth smart SoC, the first commercial drone based on
the Qualcomm Snapdragon flight platform, and the Snapdragon X5 9x07 LTE modem, which broadens our family of
modem solutions for IoT.
In networking, we launched Qualcomm Wi-Fi SON, which is a self-organizing network solution, to simplify Wi-Fi
networking and optimize user experience. And we showed significant traction in multiband Wi-Fi 802.11ac and
802.11ad, enabling products across multiple segments.
As we did in both 3G and 4G, we are leading the industry in the development of a unified, more capable 5G platform
that will take on a much larger role than previous generations and deliver new levels of efficiency. The foundation of
this platform is an OFDM-based unified air interface that will not only enhance mobile broadband services, but also
enable connectivity for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services that require lower latency,
higher reliability, and robust security.
5G will also include native support for advanced technologies, such as the use of unlicensed spectrum, multicast, and
device-to-device capabilities. We are pioneering these technologies today with our leadership in LTE Advanced and
LTE Advanced Pro. These new technologies are paving the way for 5G and accelerating our path to a truly connected
future.
Overall, we are pleased with our progress on key initiatives: execution of the strategic realignment plan; design traction
for the Snapdragon 820; refreshing the QCT roadmap across tiers; broadening our presence in adjacent opportunities;
progress on new licensing agreements in China; execution of our data center strategy; and advancements that will
extend our technology leadership position.
I want to reiterate that we remain focused on execution to improve our financial trajectory exiting the fiscal year. Our
industry and company are undergoing rapid changes, and we are enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead. We are
extending our leadership in mobile and are driving our mobile technologies and core competencies in communications
systems and high-performance, low-power computing into significant new areas. We have taken action to enable us to
seize these opportunities while delivering improved performance. I am optimistic about the future and have great
confidence in our employees to execute on our strategies and drive growth.
I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Analyst Day, and would now like to turn the call over to Derek
Aberle.

QTL had a strong fiscal first quarter, with total reported device sales of $60.6 billion, which was above expectations on
both higher ASPs and reported units, as well as some catch-up reporting from recently concluded license agreements in
China.
QTL revenues in the quarter were higher than expectations, and would have been even higher if not for a contract
dispute with LG that resulted in us deferring revenue of more than $100 million for the quarter. Although LG continues
to report and pay, we are not recognizing revenue while the arbitration regarding the dispute proceeds. We believe LG's
claims are without merit.
The deferral of this revenue has the effect of depressing the implied royalty rate as you would calculate it, as their
shipments are included in total reported device sales without the corresponding revenue. Assuming we conclude this
matter successfully, as we have done with others in the past, we would expect to recognize the deferred revenues at that
time.
Looking ahead, the outlook for global 3G/4G device shipments continues to be strong. With respect to smartphones in
particular, there continues to be a significant opportunity for Qualcomm. LTE penetration is only 14% of cellular
connections globally, and smartphone unit shipments are forecast to be more than 8.5 billion from 2015 through 2019,
according to GSM Intelligence and Gartner.
Calendar 2015 global 3G/4G device shipments are largely in line with our prior expectations, driven primarily by
migrations to 4G in China, partially offset by some recent weakness in developed regions. We continue to estimate that
calendar 2016 global 3G/4G device shipments will grow approximately 10% at the midpoint, driven primarily by the
migration to 3G/4G devices in emerging regions, with particular strength in India. Our estimate for premium tier
shipments is down slightly versus our prior view, driven by slower than expected sell-through at a large OEM, but that
is offset by a slightly stronger outlook for emerging region shipments.
We continue to expect low single-digit growth in global 3G/4G device sales in fiscal 2016, as unit growth more than
offsets ASP declines. We will provide further color on our long-term outlook for the 3G/4G device opportunity at our
upcoming Analyst Day.
Now let me provide an update on our progress with licensing in China. We are continuing to aggressively seek to
conclude new license agreements on the NDRC [National Development and Reform Commission] terms with the
remaining Chinese OEMs and improve compliance. We are making progress with these negotiations and recently
concluded new agreements with Xiaomi, Haier, QiKu, and Tianyu. These agreements include royalty-bearing licenses
for three-mode devices and contain terms that are consistent with the terms of the rectification plan submitted to the
NDRC.
Having said that, we still need to conclude agreements with a handful of key Chinese OEMs, and those negotiations
continue. Our progress in our ongoing interactions with the NDRC and other parts of the Chinese government continue
to give us confidence that we will be able to conclude agreements with the remaining key OEMs.
While we are working to conclude new license agreements and improve compliance through commercial negotiations
and audits, we are prepared to enforce our agreements and take other actions against certain OEMs that are not
negotiating in good faith, under-reporting royalties, or refusing to conclude agreements in the near term.
Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2016, we continue to expect QTL's revenues to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $8.0
billion, although additional risk has been introduced as a result of the new LG dispute, given that it could be resolved
outside of fiscal 2016.
In conclusion, although we are seeing some near-term softness in the premium tier, the sales of smartphones remain
healthy and should continue to grow. We remain confident that we will be able to resolve the dispute with LG,
conclude new agreements with the remaining key Chinese OEMs, and improve compliance over time.
That concludes my comments, and I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Analyst Day. I will now turn
the call over to George.

Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone.
Our first quarter results reflect a strong quarter relative to November guidance and are consistent with our update a few
weeks ago. Fiscal first quarter revenues were $5.8 billion. And non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.97, $0.12 above
the midpoint of our original guidance. The outperformance primarily reflected stronger revenues in our licensing
business and accelerated cost reductions in QCT. We also benefited at the end of the quarter from the permanent
reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, impacting non-GAAP earnings per share by approximately $0.01 to $0.02.
In QTL, higher than expected ASPs and shipments led to stronger revenues at $1.6 billion and more than offset the
dispute impact in the quarter. Total reported device sales include some reported devices without the corresponding
revenue from the LG dispute that Derek described as well as some deferred three-mode revenues.
QCT shipped 242 million MSMs, with revenues of $4.1 billion and operating margin of 14%, reflecting stronger than
expected demand in the low tier, particularly in China, partially offset by lower than expected shipments of thin
modems.
For the company, non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were lower than our expectations, decreasing
approximately 2% sequentially, reflecting an acceleration of some of our SRP cost initiatives, originally forecasted to
be taken later in the fiscal year.
Operating cash flow was strong at $2.7 billion, or 47% of revenue for the quarter, and we returned $2.8 billion to
stockholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. As of the end of the fiscal first quarter, we had approximately $4.9
billion of our stock repurchase authorization remaining.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 17% in the fiscal first quarter. And we now estimate that our fiscal 2016 non-GAAP tax
rate will be approximately 18%, including the impact of the permanently reinstated R&D tax credit, down from our
previous estimate of 19% to 20%.
Now turning to fiscal 2016, for QTL, we are not modifying the prior $7.3 billion to $8.0 billion revenue range for the
year. However, that range did not anticipate deferral of revenues related to the LG dispute. While we are working hard
to resolve this dispute and believe their claims are without merit, it is possible that the resolution will not occur in fiscal
2016. In this case, the deferral of the LG revenue outside of the fiscal year could impact the range by several hundred
million dollars.
In QCT, we continue to expect improving trends in the second half of the fiscal year on new product traction. We also
continue to expect to achieve a QCT operating margin of 16% or better in the fiscal fourth quarter.
We remain on track to meet the spending reduction objectives under the strategic realignment plan, and now expect at
least $700 million of savings in fiscal 2016, and to exit the year at a savings run rate of $1.1 billion. We expect fiscal
2016 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% year over year, down an
additional 1% at the midpoint on earlier capture of cost savings relative to previous estimates.
Turning to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016, our outlook reflects a seasonally strong December
quarter for 3G/4G device shipments for QTL and seasonally lower first calendar quarter MSM shipments for QCT.
Consistent with last quarter, our guidance does not include a forecast of potential revenue from signing new license
agreements in China, and we have excluded estimated revenue from LG as a result of the dispute.
We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $4.9 billion to $5.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share
to be in the range of approximately $0.90 to $1.00 per share. We anticipate fiscal second quarter non-GAAP combined
R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% sequentially, reflecting continued progress on our
SRP initiatives.
In QTL, we estimate total reported device sales of $65 billion to $73 billion will be reported by our licensees in the
March quarter for shipments they made in the December quarter, up approximately 14% sequentially at the midpoint,

reflecting the seasonal strength of the holiday quarter. If the dispute-related units continue to be reported and the matter
is not resolved during the quarter, then we could again see units included in TRDS, for which revenue would not be
recognized.
Also in QTL, we are expecting a one-time benefit of approximately $250 million in revenue in the fiscal second quarter
based on termination of an infrastructure license agreement that resulted from one of our licensees acquiring another
one of our licensees. This was partially offset by the end of a multiyear amortization of approximately $100 million in
quarterly license fees. These events were expected and contemplated in our prior guidance.
In QCT, we expect MSM shipments of approximately 175 million to 195 million units, lower sequentially, reflecting
seasonal trends, somewhat exaggerated by an above-seasonal decline in demand for thin modem products. We also see
some modest negative impact from mix shift across OEMs and devices in China. We expect revenue per MSM to be
higher quarter over quarter, reflecting stronger mix, including a lower mix of thin modem shipments. And consistent
with our prior guidance, we expect QCT's fiscal second quarter operating margin percentage to be in the low to
mid-single digits.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.
Warren Kneeshaw
Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go
ahead.
<Q - T. Michael Walkley>: Great, thank you very much. George, just following up on the QTL guidance, is that $250
million from the merger of your infrastructure customers, is that included in the guidance? I just wanted to clarify that.
And then overall longer term as you look at QTL, with the royalty rate and more three-mode devices coming in, Derek,
can you just help us think about maybe the implied royalty rate going forward? That would be very helpful.
<A - George S. Davis>: Sure. Hi, Mike. This is George. Yes, the $250 million is included in the guidance. And
remember, it's netted against the expiration of about $100 million a quarter from a previous multiyear agreement.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Mike, this is Derek. On the implied royalty rate question, I think there are so many moving
pieces on this, so let me give you a high-level view. I think there's going to be some lumpiness as we go forward just in
terms of catch-up units coming in, and some of those will be three-mode units from prior periods as well as then, as
licensees start reporting more three-mode, that will put some pressure on the rate, although actually what we're seeing
in the market in China is more of a shift to five and six-mode devices and away from three-mode devices. And so a lot
of the design traction now has moved. And I think as you go into the second half of 2016, we'll probably start seeing as
a percentage of units in China a reduction in the amount of three-mode on a go-forward basis.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Timothy Patrick Long>: Thank you. Just sticking on the royalty rate in the QTL business, Derek, first, I just
wanted to make sure I understand. I guess there are the moving parts. But if the LG is a little more than $100 million,
and that number still seems like the calculated number would be 10 or 15 basis points under 3%. So is that, do we have

a new reset to the rate there, or is there something else that dragged the number in the quarter down?
And then the unit numbers, the paid units were pretty good above what we've seen as normal seasonality. So if you
could, just maybe break down for us how much of that was catch-up or maybe how much of that was contribution from
some of these new deals that have been signed recently. Thank you.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Tim, this is Derek. On the rate, there are a few things affecting it in the quarter. We gave $100
million – we said more than $100 million, and so we're not being entirely precise on that number. So I think you need
to be a little bit careful about just pegging it to the $100 million. But we also had some catch-up units come through in
the quarter for which we didn't have revenue in the quarter given the structure of the deal in terms of when it's going to
get paid out. That revenue we expect will come in, in future quarters, so that's also having a drag. So you've got the
disputed TRDS as well as the three-mode element that is collectively putting some pressure on the rate. There are
catch-up units in the quarter. I would say that they're not a huge contributor, but they're probably less than about 20
million units for the quarter.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. Can you just maybe talk through the drivers of the QCT margin decline into the
next quarter? It seems like quite a severe drop. I know there's seasonality, but we haven't observed it to be that volatile
in the past. That's the first question on QCT.
And on QTL, Derek, maybe thinking about it another way, it looks like now, if my math is right, you signed with
vendors all with these new terms that account for almost 50% – 60% of the Chinese smartphone market. And I would
have thought at some point the increasing compliance in China would drive an uptick to the QTL revenue profile. It
doesn't seem to be doing that, even if I take out the impact of LG this year. So how should we think about the future
compliance of more vendors you want to sign up? Should that QTL revenue rise up reflecting that, or are there other
factors at work that we should think about this year? Thanks.
<A - George S. Davis>: Kulbinder, hi, it's George. So on the margin decline quarter over quarter, and again, as a
reminder, we actually guided this at last quarter's call as well. As you see, the big seasonal pullback in volumes and the
mix change that we see that has both an absorption of OpEx issue and a gross margin reduction element to it, and the
combination of those at this level of revenue pulls it down to our forecast. I will say, as we talked about, we see those
dynamics actually reversing themselves and actually providing momentum into the back half of the year in terms of
margin improvement, and we still see getting to 16% in Q4 in QCT.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Kulbinder, this is Derek. So again, I think you've got to break down the TRDS picture in
China. There are really three elements. One is the under-reporting, which I think is largely referred to as the compliance
issue. Then there's three-mode volume that is unlicensed, and we're working actively to get companies signed up so that
they start paying on three-mode. And then the third thing that we talked about last quarter were actually a small number
of companies but actually meaningful in size that had actually started withholding reports and payment of licensed
non-three-mode units.
And so as we conclude new agreements with those companies, you'll see a meaningful improvement in the run rate
collection because they also tend to be some of the larger three-mode players in China. So you'll capture the
three-mode plus you'll get them back reporting on the non-three-mode, which will leave you really with this
compliance question, which will still be something we need to work through. But those two, I think it's really a
relatively small number of companies that need to get signed, and you'll see a pretty material improvement in the run
rate in QTL.

Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - James E. Faucette>: Great, thanks. I just had a couple of questions I guess related to royalty collections. First, in
the contract dispute with LG, can you give a little color there as to is this at all connected to the KFTC process within
Korea, or is resolution somehow of one dependent on the other?
And then along those same lines, maybe if you could give any update on your engagement and progress with the
different governments that are looking at Qualcomm's practices in Korea, Taiwan, and the EU. Thank you very much.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: James, this is Derek. I'll take the first part of that. Really the dispute we have with LG is
really unrelated to the issues that are before the KFTC. We've had this throughout the history of the licensing program.
It's just part of the business that we'll from time to time have disputes with our licensees. This is really a contract
dispute under their agreement similar to a number of the ones we've had in the past, which we've resolved successfully
for the company. And we feel very firmly that we're going to be able to do that again here.
And so there will be a question of timing. We decided for now not to adjust the QTL revenue guidance for the year
because we still have three quarters left to resolve it, and we think there's a chance that that can happen. If it goes all
the way through the arbitration process, that will likely push it outside the fiscal year. But we feel very good in our
position. And again, we've been through a number of these in the past and they've worked out well.
<A - Donald J. Rosenberg>: James, this is Don. In terms of more color on some of the regulatory issues that we're
dealing with, there's not much more color we can add other than to say our licensing model, as you know, has been in
effect for quite a few decades. It's been modeled after others. Everybody in the industry follows the device-level
licensing, for example. And we're very confident in the chances of trying to convince regulators that this model has not
only been effective, but has enhanced competition. Through our licensing model of sharing our intellectual property, I
think we have broadened the field. And our immense investment in research and development and the core
technologies, which we patent and then share, I think has contributed to the growth of this industry. And hopefully,
we'll be able to demonstrate that as we go through these regulatory matters.

Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I've got a couple. First one I wanted to ask you, you
talked about – you said less than 20 million catch-up units in the quarter. I wonder if you can talk a little bit about the
potential timing of catch-up in China and what the outstanding unit number looks like. We have our estimates, but it
would be nice to get some kind of indication from you guys.
And then I also wanted to talk a little bit about QCT margins again. I guess two questions within that. One is, can you
give us some idea what the fixed cost level there is? And should we be looking at fiscal Q1, fiscal Q2 and that margin
move as some indication of where that number is?
Second question I had is those margins were pretty strong in Q1. And I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about
what's going on underlying that, since the mix was shifted toward the low end. I would have thought that would drag
margins down, but they were actually quite strong. So could you just comment on that? Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Hi, Rod, this is Derek. On the catch-up units and compliance, I think we gave some color on
that for the full year fiscal 2015. And if you looked at the delta between what we gave as the global device sales and the
reported device sales, it was about 9%, or 25 billion. So that was the range for 2015.
For 2016, it's really going to be dependent I think highly on the timing of getting these additional agreements signed.
The underlying under-reporting by licensees that have agreements, I would say, has largely been in line over the last
couple of quarters. It's not materially improving or worsening. It's really been more the dynamic of the people that have
withheld payment and reporting, which will get resolved upon signing the agreements. So I think the rough-sizing that
we gave for 2015 with that color hopefully will get you there.

<A - George S. Davis>: Ron, hi. It's George. On Q1, I think one of the things that you saw was better performance by
QCT, particularly on OpEx pulling in some of the cost savings earlier into the year, which actually helped that margin
and improved that margin relative to our expectations going into the quarter.
I would say that some of that has narrowed. In terms of the OpEx improvement quarter over quarter, you're not getting
quite the move. So on lower revenue, OpEx as a percent of revenue is obviously going to weigh on the margin. And
then of course, you just have the natural gross margin impact when you see a big seasonal adjustment in units, and
that's really what we're seeing, so nothing more than that. And again, those things tend to reverse themselves, as I said
earlier, in the second half of the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi, thank you, another question on the royalty rate. I just wanted to clarify again. Of the
2.65% implied rate in the quarter, if you took out the one-off impacts like the catch-up of the China licensees as well as
the LG, what would that number have been? And then once we get past the March quarter and that one-time $250
million benefit from the infrastructure merger, did I understand you correctly that there's going to be a $100 million
impact on the royalty rate collection on a go-forward basis past that, so effectively about a 15 basis point hit to the
implied rate? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Hey, Simona. This is Derek. So I think last quarter, basically what we said about the implied
royalty rate for the year, we said listen, it's going to be highly dependent on the timing of signing up some of the new
agreements in China and moving people over to the CPLA [Chinese Patent License Agreement] rates. But on balance,
we expected it to be down modestly for the year. So I would say if you adjusted for the impact of the disputed revenue
and the reported sales in the quarter that didn't have revenue coming along with it because of the catch-up units, we
would be broadly in line with that.
You are correct that once this amortization of the $100 million expires, that will come out. We've talked about the fact
that we have license fees and those are amortized over a period of time. And so once those go away, that will become a
drag, but that was anticipated. And so when we gave the color of what we expected the rate to do for the year with all
the moving pieces in mind, that was factored in.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Okay. So the clean rate for the quarter was something close to 3%. And then looking
out a couple of quarters, like for like it would come down to something like 2.8% once you remove the infrastructure
amortization.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Yes, that's generally correct. I would say that the second part of your question would imply no
other changes, but we do think that there are some other things that could potentially play out throughout the year that
would be a positive bias on the rate. So I think that's maybe the piece you're missing. But otherwise, I think that's
generally right.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Okay, understood. And then just a quick second question was on the comment about
your server chips sampling with the Tier 1 hyperscale customers. When would you expect to see production volumes,
and when would you expect that to be something that can move the needle for QCT?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: When we first started talking about this, we were pretty clear that we're going to be in
investment mode for a period of time here before this becomes a meaningful contributor. We're very positive on the
signs we're seeing, both in North America with the large cloud players as well as in China. And so you'll start seeing
some shipments within probably the next year or so. But really, when you think about it as a contributor, it's going to be
out a few years.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Timothy Arcuri>: Thanks a lot. I had two. I guess first one is on M&A. Obviously, you have a lot of offshore
cash, and I just wanted to get your opinion. I think that the TDK deal was great, but I wanted to get your opinion on
maybe something bigger, some transformational deal that maybe you could do in QCT. So I just wanted to get your
general thoughts there.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Sure, Timothy, it's Steve Mollenkopf. The way we think about it is, we obviously have
the ability to execute on something like that. We don't feel like there's really a gun to our head to be able to have to do
it. We feel we have a good growth path. But we're pleased to be able to return the cash that we have and will continue
to do and have options to do that.
As the industry consolidates, I think we're going to consider ourselves to be getting in a stronger position versus a
weaker position to be able to take advantage of the trends that I spoke about in my script. So we feel like we're in a
good spot, but we don't feel like we have to do something in order to grow.
<Q - Timothy Arcuri>: Okay, thanks. And then I guess a question for George, just on the 185 million MSMs in
March, can you give maybe a sense in terms of how many of the new design wins for Snapdragon 820 are included in
that number, or is that more of a June event? Thanks.
<A - George S. Davis>: I can't give you the specifics too much on that, but what I can tell you is that we really see the
Snapdragon 820 as more of a second half. We certainly see that we'll be shipping some devices in the latter part of this
quarter, but it's really going to be more evident in the second half of the year. And maybe, Cristiano, I'll let you jump in
on that. We're seeing more – I would say Q2 is more of a strong seasonal effect, with an exaggerated effect, as I said in
my prepared remarks, on thin modem.
<A - Cristiano R. Amon>: Just one comment, I think it's very optimistic about the Snapdragon 820 design traction.
Right now, we're supporting key flagship designs through [indiscernible] certification, and volume ramp will happen in
the second half of fiscal 2016.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Hi, guys. Hopefully you can hear me okay, just one clarification before my question. You said in
response to what Simona asked you, you said that there are positives on the rate that could come through the rest of the
year. Outside of LG coming back, are there any other positives that could impact the royalty rate? So that's question
number one.
Question number two is about the implications of Snapdragon 820 in the second half of the year. Can you discuss the
implications on margins and the implications on ASPs? I think ASPs are quite straightforward. But the question is,
when you start ramping Snapdragon 820, does it have positive implications on margins right from the beginning; or to
the contrary, it has negative implications at first until you ramp to a certain level, or you expect certain expenses, and
only then it goes up. Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Tal, this is Derek. On your first question, there are a couple things. Really the primary
positive driver would be OEM mix, so share gain by companies that are paying a higher running royalty rate than
others. And we think there is some potential for that as the year progresses.
<A - Cristiano R. Amon>: This is Cristiano. On the Snapdragon 820, I think as we said, the real volume ramp is going
to be in the second half of the year. That's when we go into mass production. I think we feel pretty good about the
Snapdragon 820 and all of our economics. I also think we are, as we said, on a 14-nanometer LPP process node.

Another thing to think about QCT in the second half is we're seeing increased design traction across all tiers, not only
the Snapdragon 820, in particular in China because of the acceleration of LTE Advanced, which is 4G-plus and the
all-mode that was mentioned by Derek earlier.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First on the chipset guide, I know
you're pointing to seasonal effects, obviously driven by – exacerbated by thin modems. But at the same time, the 24%
quarter-over-quarter decline, 57 million units, I think this was your biggest sequential chipset decline ever. Can you
give us or at least help us parse out the impact I guess of the seasonal effect? Is there any inventory flushing going on?
Do you think that this is a normal run rate exiting the quarter? How should we be thinking about those other seasonal
drivers impacting that guide?
And for my second question, you have this $100 million licensing amortization rolling off. Do you have any other
licensees with amortization that's rolling off say within the next three years?
<A - George S. Davis>: Stacy, hi. It's George. Let me just respond to the chipset guide question. So I would say that
we're certainly seeing above normal seasonality in this quarter, in particular on the thin modem side. We've also seen
some OEM mix in China having an effect. But I would say that is a deep third effect to what is seasonal first, above
seasonal in thin modem, and then some modest OEM mix where customers of ours are ceding some share to customers
that use other devices.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Stacy, this is Derek. On the amortization question, we have over the years done different
kinds of deals, some of which have license fees that are amortized over a period of time. And so there are things that
come into the amortization and go out. That's just on an ongoing basis. But beyond that, you saw an acceleration of
$250 million of license fees that would have been amortized over a longer period of time that will come in next quarter,
and those are really the two that we're highlighting at this time.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tavis C. McCourt>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. George, just to make sure I have – the $250
million coming in, that's coming in through QTL, correct? And then I think you mentioned in the prepared comments
outside of the thin modem customer, I forget what the verbiage was, was you're seeing some strength or at least
stability in emerging markets in your chipset business. That's not completely obvious to me why that should be.
Typically, in a strong dollar environment, handset sales can really get hurt in emerging markets. So I'm wondering if
you're just not seeing that yet. Or is there some channel inventory issues going on or perhaps some market share gains
as we exited last year and enter this year?
And then a final one for you, Steve, on the TDK joint venture. You mentioned gas PAs. And I wasn't sure if you were
referring to having them sampling in fiscal 2017, or we should see those in commercial products in fiscal 2017. Thanks.
<A - George S. Davis>: So on the $250 million, that will be reported in QTL. In terms of what we're seeing in the
channel, I would say we're not seeing an unusual inventory build like we saw a couple of quarters ago with the
exception, like I said, we're probably seeing a stronger than normal seasonal pullback in thin modems. But that's really
what I would say is more of the outlier for our quarter.
<A - Cristiano R. Amon>: This is Cristiano, just another comment. I think when you look at the Q2 185 million MSM
midpoint of the guidance, I think what we said is China was a very minor impact. I think it's not any unexpected design
change. What it is, is the mix of OEMs in the marketplace. We saw a slight increase of volume for an OEM that is not

using QCT. It's a vertical OEM in China, but I think it's very minor. The main thing really is seasonality and the thin
modem demand adjustment.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: And this is Steve, just one other additional thing. Really what's driving worldwide unit
demand for the products is just the transition to 4G. You're still only seeing something like 14% of the market is using
4G now, and that continues to be a positive trend for us across tiers.
With respect to the TDK commentary and the Galliumarsenid PAs, we will be in production in 2017, and I think
comfortably so. So we expect to see products in the market using those PAs in that timeframe.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri>: Thank you, a couple of questions, first a clarification. George, on the annual guidance
for licensing, I'm just curious if LG is impacting only $100 million or is it $100 million per quarter. And then a
follow-up to Steve's answer on the gas PA and TDK deal. Steve, obviously the RF market in general has been growing
very nicely over the past few years, and some would argue that actually that market is slowing down now. It grew very
nicely last year and two years ago and it's beginning to slow down now. I'm just curious as to why the deal now. What
do you see out there that gives you that this is the right time to invest more aggressively in this market?
<A - George S. Davis>: Srini, hi, it's George. So the LG impact that we talked about of over $100 million is a quarterly
number. So the annual impact of course is going to be dependent on what their royalty obligation would be for the year
relative to the guidance range. It was not anticipated or included in the $7.3 billion to $8.0 billion range, so it would be
an adjustment to that. It really will be a function of when it is resolved as to what the potential impact would be until
then.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: And this is Steve. On the RF front-end business, I think it continues to be a very large
TAM that for us we haven't been participating in outside really largely by our Envelope Tracking business. Like all of
our RF businesses or analog businesses, that's actually a good profitable business. And so our ability to grow that even
within that TAM is I think a good story for us.
Our view of the market is that you're going to need to have all the pieces, filter, module, PA, baseband, switches, to
really be meaningful as a long-term player. And that capability will continue to be important not only in the handset
market, but also across all of the connectivity markets that open up as everything becomes connected and certainly in
5G. So we think that's a good set of assets. We'll be able to grow that moving forward. We've got some execution to do
to prove that, but we feel like we have. We're getting the right pieces, and we're going to make it happen.
Operator
Your final question comes from the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward F. Snyder>: Thanks very much. On the same theme on the RF, I think you launched RF360 in early
2013, and now you've got the TDK relationship which expands upon that. Should we expect revenue from RF to be
material to consolidated results in fiscal 2017, or is that something more of a 2018 event?
And then with respect to the RF products you're selling now, do you anticipate that you'll be selling these RF modules
into solutions that don't use your baseband? Obviously, your solutions you use in baseband would be a natural home for
those. but do you think you are intending to reach beyond where you are, if your baseband socket wins are to move out
to the general market? And then a follow-up, if I could, on mix shift in QCT.
<A - George S. Davis>: So this is George. We'll consolidate as soon as we close the transaction because we will have
51% and effective control from a reporting standpoint. In terms of supporting other devices and other customers, we
would anticipate continuing to do that, just as TDK does today.

<Q - Edward F. Snyder>: Will this show up in one of the existing segments once you consolidate it, or are you
considering breaking it out in its own group?
<A - George S. Davis>: It will be reported in QCT.
<Q - Edward F. Snyder>: Okay. And finally, was the mix shift away from thin modems in the December period, was
that a major component in the sequential increasing QCT margins, or was it not very material?
<A - Cristiano R. Amon>: Hi, this is Cristiano. I think George answered that earlier. I think one of the things, we're
ahead of the plan of delivering some of the cost savings that we had as part of our strategic realignment plan. And I
think that has been a key contributor of our stronger margin in Q1.
Operator
This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before
adjourning the call?
Steven M. Mollenkopf
Sure, I just want to thank everyone for attending the call today. We are executing on the plan to get the company
growing again. We're focused on improving licensing in China. And I look forward to the second half of the year as our
new products ramp. I also want to remind everyone that we will hold our Analyst Day in San Diego in two weeks,
where we will go into more detail on our strategy and priorities.
I will close by thanking all of the Qualcomm employees on their hard work and for delivering a stronger than expected
Q1. Thank you.
