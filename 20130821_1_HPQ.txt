Meg Cushing Whitman
Thank you, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. As we continue our fix and rebuild year, parts of the
business, like Printing, Enterprise Services, Converged Storage and Software, are making progress while others like
industry-standard servers and Personal Systems have not completely turned the corner. So overall, I would say our
turnaround continues. We're moving forward against our plans and I remain comfortable with where we're heading.
Most importantly, we once again achieved the financial performance we said we would, delivering $0.86 in non-GAAP
diluted earnings per share, within our previously provided outlook of $0.84 to $0.87. During the third quarter we held
our annual HP Discover event in Las Vegas. We brought together more than 11,000 people, including more than 120 of
the world's top CIOs. These are record numbers for HP. I was encouraged by the interest I heard from our customers
about technologies like HP Moonshot, StoreOnce, 3PAR, software defined networking, Vertica and Autonomy.
At HP Discover we introduced some very significant new innovations. We announced HAVEn, a big data analytics
platform that leverages our analytics software, hardware and services to allow customers to make decisions in real time.
We also expanded our converged cloud portfolio with a common OpenStack-based architecture for HP's private,
managed and public cloud offerings; and we announced a new partnership with Google to introduce a one-stop shop
technology solution for small and medium size business customers.
As I said before, HP's turnaround will happen on the back of great products and services. As the benefits of our focus
and investment begin to pay dividends in 2014, I expect that you will see increased innovation across HP.
From a macroeconomic standpoint we see a continued weak enterprise spending environment. Sentiment in the U.S. is
improving, although it's not translating to our results yet due to inconsistent execution. I would characterize Europe as
challenging and China continues to be soft. We're also seeing acceleration in trends driving customers to the cloud and
shifting to mobility.
For the third quarter our results were driven by solid execution in Software, Printing, Converged Storage and Enterprise
Services coupled with the savings from our restructuring program and improvements in our operations. As a result of
our focus on operations, we were able to bring our cash conversion cycle down to 18 days, a remarkable achievement
compared to 27 days in the prior year.
In the quarter, operating cash flow was $2.7 billion, once again another strong performance. As a result, we lowered
operating company net debt by $1.7 billion to $1.2 billion. This represents our sixth consecutive quarter of reducing our
operating company net debt by more than $1 billion. Our operating company net debt is now below pre-Autonomy
levels and is approaching our goal of approximately zero. We also returned approximately $283 million to
shareholders, primarily in the form of dividends in the quarter.

Along with the operational improvements and the work force restructuring we're focused on getting the right leadership
in place to lead the company through the next phase of the turnaround. To that end we announced several changes to
our executive leadership team during the quarter. In June Dion Weisler took over Printing and Personal Systems. Dion
is more aggressively shifting to a multi-operating system, multi-architecture and multi-form factor strategy.
And earlier today we announced additional changes to our executive leadership team. Bill Veghte, currently HP's Chief
Operating Officer, will become EVP and General Manager of the Enterprise Group, replacing Dave Donatelli who will
remain with HP and take on a special assignment. Bill brings a critical set of skills to the management of HP's
Enterprise Group. He is a proven technology executive with a wide range of experiences leading sales, services,
marketing and engineering at scale. During his tenure at HP he has run HP Software, held the responsibility of Chief
Strategy Officer, and for over 15 months has served as HP's Chief Operating Officer. As COO Bill helped create HP's
blueprint for the future and deeply understands the strategic challenges and opportunities facing both the company and
its customers.
As hardware becomes more standardized, leadership solutions are increasingly differentiated by the software layer that
drives the hardware. This is true for both traditional IT and cloud environments. Bill will retain his current
responsibility for the pan-HP cloud initiative. And Bill's experiences in software and in the enterprise combined with
HP's infrastructure leadership will help HP accelerate innovation in converged infrastructure, cloud, and the emerging
area of software-defined data centers.
In a separate organizational move, Henry Gomez, EVP and Chief Communications Officer, will assume the additional
responsibilities of Chief Marketing Officer. By combining marketing and communications we will accelerate programs
that will drive sales, build brand loyalty and help customers embrace the new style of IT. HP's current CMO, Marty
Homlish, will become Chief Customer Experience Officer, a new role that will focus on driving more consistent and
high-value interactions with customers across all business units.
Now, let me turn to our business group performance in the quarter. As you would expect in a turnaround, there are
areas where we're doing well and areas where we have to improve. Let me start with the parts of the business that
performed well in the quarter.
In Printing we once again delivered a solid quarter. Business initiatives like Ink Advantage and new products like
Officejet Pro X continue to take hold with strong customer adoption. As a result we're seeing strength in our Ink In The
Office program. Overall we grew hardware unit sales for the first time since 2011, gaining 1 point of share in both ink
and laser over the prior year and 5 points of share in Laser over the prior quarter. The Printing team has done a very
good job executing the strategy we laid out last October. Although revenue is down, profitability is in line with our
expectations and the top line is stabilizing.
Printing revenue was down 3.6% over the prior year and 1.4% in constant currency while margins were 15.6%,
essentially flat over the prior year. In Enterprise Services, the business is stabilizing as we continue to execute well
against our recovery plans. Revenue was down 8.7% over the prior year, better than the FY 2013 outlook range we
previously provided. We saw add-on business offset the anticipated revenue runoff from the four exceptional accounts
we identified at our Security Analyst Meeting last October. Margin in the quarter was 3.3%, bringing Enterprise
Services' year-to-date margins to 2.4%, at the high end of our FY 2013 outlook range.
We continue to see improvements in signings but they are mostly renewals. Going forward we're focused on
strengthening our go-to-market capabilities dedicated to strategic enterprise service solutions in areas like cloud, big
data and apps modernization and new account wins. As we outlined in October, this will be a multi-year journey.
Enterprise Services was able to secure some major wins in the third quarter. We announced that Enterprise Services
and its partners were awarded the United States Department of the Navy's Next Generation Enterprise Network
contract value of up to $3.4 billion over five years. The contract is being protested but we have every confidence in the
Navy's evaluation and the ultimate selection of HP.

In the Enterprise Group we're making progress in executing our vision of converged infrastructure based on HP
intellectual property and the software defined data center. We see near-term revenue pressures in ISS and some parts of
Storage where we face aggressive pricing and competition. Customer interest in our revolutionary HP Moonshot
product has been strong. We're working hard to ramp this product in the market. We're currently in testing and
development with many key customers and expect to roll out a number of new innovations on this platform over the
next few quarters.
In Storage we're seeing the planned portfolio shift continue with strong performance in our Converged Storage
business, which was up 37% of the prior year, being offset by weakness in traditional storage. We continue to see solid
growth in our midrange 3PAR products that were launched in the first quarter. While we were pleased with our
Networking performance in China, revenue was essentially flat and we must grow this business faster. Going forward,
we're focusing on new channel plays and improved go-to-market actions to accelerate growth.
Enterprise Group had a number of significant customer wins in the quarter. HP was selected as the official technology
partner to Oriental DreamWorks, the joint venture between the China consortium led by China Media Capital and
DreamWorks Animation.
In Software we saw good performance and improved execution. We grew revenue nearly 1% over the prior year and
4.3% sequentially. We saw continued improvement in operating leverage as margin expanded 2.5 points over the prior
year and 1.4 points over the prior quarter, and achieved an operating margin of 20.5%. Performance in Software was
driven by strength in security, which saw double-digit revenue growth, strong momentum in Vertica, which saw
triple-digit growth and sequential license revenue growth in Autonomy. In addition, we saw pockets of improvement in
IT management, although we saw continued pressure from the shift to SaaS coupled with a portfolio that is weighted
towards services and support.
Now let me turn to where our performance needs to improve. Overall the Enterprise Group's performance was very
disappointing. Enterprise Group profitability was pressured by lower revenue, particularly in ISS, resulting in an
operating margin of 15.2%, down 1.9 points over the prior year and 0.7 points sequentially. ISS continues to experience
near-term business model challenges impacting our competitiveness in the Hyperscale market. In addition, mainstream
server weakness was driven by execution challenges, competitive pricing and a misaligned go-to-market model. This
impacted our revenue and profitability. The net impact of these execution challenges is an expected loss of 5 points of
market share on a revenue basis. Fixing execution across Enterprise Group will be Bill Veghte's top priority in his new
role.
In our Personal Systems business we're seeing continued PC market contraction as HP revenue declined 11% over the
prior year. On a positive note, in the third quarter we saw relative strength and market share gains in growth markets
like Asia-Pacific and in commercial PCs. According to IDC's second calendar quarter results, HP has achieved its
highest ever PC share in India with 34.1%, leading in every category of the PC market. Overall margin for the quarter
was 3%, down 0.2 points sequentially and down 1.7 points over the prior year.
Looking forward, we're focused on driving profitable growth in Personal Systems. It's going to take time to get margins
to our desired levels against the backdrop of the changing marketplace but we're confident that our differentiated
approach from competitors including our focus on beyond the box innovation will pay off over the long term.
Now let me turn to our future outlook. As you know, I stated in May that I believe that company level revenue growth
was still possible in fiscal 2014. Particularly given the challenges I just highlighted in Enterprise Group and Personal
Systems as well as the fact that 2013 revenue from key accounts in Enterprise Services is running off more slowly than
anticipated, we now expect that total company year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2014 is unlikely.
That said, I remain confident that we are making progress in our turnaround. We are already seeing significant
improvement in our operations, we are successfully rebuilding our balance sheet and our cost structure is more closely
aligned with our revenue and we have re-ignited innovation at HP with a focus on the customer. So I do expect that
we'll see pockets of year-over-year revenue growth across certain parts of the business in 2014.

As is our normal practice we'll give a more comprehensive outlook on 2014 including EPS at our Security Analyst
Meeting on October 9 and I look forward to seeing you all there.
Now let me turn it over to Cathie for a closer look at our performance in the quarter. Cathie?
Catherine A. Lesjak
Thanks, Meg. Good afternoon, everyone. Total revenue for the quarter was $27.2 billion, down 8% year-over-year and
down 7% in constant currency. Overall our results came in largely as expected with some variance in performance
among the business units. Enterprise Services came in slightly ahead of expectations and Printing and Software were
broadly in line. However, a weak PC market and increasingly competitive pricing pressured Personal Systems and
execution challenges and aggressive pricing impacted industry standard server performance. I'll go into more detail on
each segment shortly.
By region, EMEA remains weak particularly in Consumer with revenue of $9.6 billion, down 10% year-over-year and
8% in constant currency. Revenue in the Americas up $12.4 billion declined 7% year-over-year as reported and in local
currency partly driven by weakness in U.S. public sector spending as well soft demand in Brazil and Canada. APJ was
mixed with strong growth in India due in part to our recent educational PC win in the state of Uttar Pradesh partially
offsetting weaker China performance. APJ revenue was $5.2 billion, down 8% year-over-year and down 5% in constant
currency.
Turning to gross margins. Improved Enterprise Services and Technology Services margins combined with a favorable
mix from Software, Printing and Personal Systems offset a highly competitive pricing environment across most of our
hardware businesses. Gross margins were flat on a year-over-year basis and down 30 basis points sequentially.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.1 billion, down 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially driven by expense
benefits from restructuring actions and lower R&D investments in Business Critical Systems.
Non-GAAP operating profit of $2.3 billion was 8.4% of revenue, down 80 basis points year-over-year. We recorded
$146 million of expense on the other income and expense line with the 22% tax rate and roughly flat share count of 1.9
billion shares outstanding we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.86. Our non-GAAP EPS excludes
pre-tax charges of $356 million in amortization of purchased intangibles, $81 million of restructuring charges and $4
million in acquisition related charges.
Turning to the business group, I'll start with Printing. We continue to execute on our strategy and the group delivered
solid results in the third quarter. Revenue of $5.8 billion was down 4% year-over-year. Total unit shipments grew 5%
year-over-year as we took advantage of the depreciating yen to place more units and partially offset other currency
headwinds. Operating profit is $908 million or 15.6% of revenue was down 0.2 points from last year. Commercial
hardware revenue declined 3% year-over-year while units increased 12%. We experienced strength in low-end laser
sales while high-end revenue declined due to the mix shift in the value segment. We saw good growth in managed
services and Indigo sales.
Consumer hardware revenue was flat while units increased 2% against the prior year driven by strong Ink In The Office
and Ink Advantage sales. Supplies revenue declined 4% against prior-year and made up 66% of Printing revenue. Our
overall channel inventory has moved slightly above our target range. This was partly driven by supplies demand from
our channel partners seeking to maintain service and reliability levels to their customers. We need to bring down
channel inventory in the fourth quarter.
Personal Systems continues to face a challenging environment. Revenue was $7.7 billion, down 11% over prior year
led by weakness in Consumer. Total unit shipments declined 8% year-over-year. We saw broad-based regional softness
led by EMEA. Consumer sales declined 22% year-over-year while Commercial performed much better, down just 3%.
Commercial unit shipments outpaced the market by 8% year-over-year and we maintained our number one market
share position in this category. Continued pricing pressure and currency headwinds drove an operating profit of $228
million or 3% of revenue, down 1.7 points over prior year. Personal Systems contributed just 9% of HP's segment

operating profit. We remain focused on improving profitability in this business over the long term.
Turning to Enterprise Group, results were weaker than expected with revenue down 9% year-over-year to $6.8 billion.
We continue to see positive momentum with our Converged Storage solutions but we faced extreme competitive
pricing in industry standard server and storage and continued weakness in traditional storage demand. We are also
working to address execution challenges across ISS, and as Meg noted, we need to improve the go-to-market
fundamentals across Enterprise Group.
Operating profit was $1 billion or 15.2% of revenue, down 1.9 points from last year. Higher margins in Technology
Services helped offset weakness in the other businesses, primarily ISS and Storage. By business unit Industry Standard
Server revenue declined 11% year-over-year to $2.9 billion. We saw double-digit declines in mainstream and
hyperscale. Hyperscale results partly reflected a tough compare over the prior year.
Storage revenue declined 10% year-over-year to $833 million. We remain excited about our Converged Storage
offerings which grew 37% year-over-year. 3PAR was up double-digits again and StoreOnce continued to do well.
Together 3PAR plus XP plus EVA, a metric that adjusts for the planned product transition, outgrew the market.
Business Critical Systems revenue declined 26% year-over-year, consistent with expectations, at $284 million. We
continue to face Itanium pressures, and the overall UNIX market secular decline persisted. This more than offset solid
growth in Mission Critical x86 sales.
Networking sales were flat year-over-year at $644 million. We continued to make strides in Wireless LAN and have
had strong customer interest in our new software-defined networking solutions that we introduced earlier this year.
That was offset by weakness in U.S. public sector spending.
Finally, in Technology Services revenue declined 7% year-over-year to $2.2 billion driven by hardware declines
particularly in BCS and traditional storage. We are focused on improving our attach rates on our newer products.
Turning to Enterprise Services, revenue of $5.8 billion declined 9% year-over-year as public sector austerity measures
continued to pressure discretionary IT spending, particularly in the U.S. and U.K. But performance was still ahead of
where we expected due to incremental business offsetting expected runoff. Operating profit of $192 million or 3.3% of
revenue was down 0.5 points year-over-year due to higher operating expenses on a tough year-over-year compare,
offsetting improvements in resource management and cost control and our handling of under-performing contracts.
By business unit, IT Outsourcing revenue was $3.7 billion, down 7% year-over-year and Applications and Business
Services revenue was $2.2 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Both business units were significantly impacted by
contractual runoff. Strategic Enterprise Services revenue continues to grow double-digits driven by cloud, security,
application modernization and big data solutions.
We are pleased with the execution progress across ES. Our signings were up double-digits both year-over-year and
sequentially driven by renewals. However, our ability to grow sales beyond traditional offerings needs to improve.
Growing our bookings at SES by better embedding in our large deals and winning smaller deals remains a top area of
focus.
Software had a solid quarter with revenue up 1% year-over-year to $982 million. We are especially pleased with the
continued performance in our strategic areas of cloud, security and big data. Sales of our security solutions grew
double-digits while Vertica revenue was up triple digits. At the same time we continued to prune our professional
services portfolio, which tempers revenue growth but improves profitability. Operating profit for the quarter was $201
million, or 20.5% of revenue. This was up 2.5 points year-over-year and 1.4 points sequentially, showing real signs of
improved operating leverage.
License revenue was flat year-over-year while support revenue grew 4% over the prior year. By design professional
services revenue declined 11% from last year and SaaS revenue was up 4% on prior year, which is below our
expectations but bookings growth was solid in the quarter. Across Software we saw better sales execution in the quarter
with improved license conversions but we still have work to do on building our pipeline and continuing to improve our
sales execution.

HP Financial Services revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $879 million due to Enterprise Services volume declines
offsetting solid direct business growth. Financing volumes were down 9% year-over-year with net portfolio assets of
$12 billion down 4%. Operating profit was $99 million or 11.3% of revenue. The return on equity in HP Financial
Services continues to be strong.
Moving onto our balance sheet and capital allocation for the quarter we continue to execute our strategy of driving free
cash flow and strengthening our balance sheet. Operating cash flow was $2.7 billion in the quarter, down 6%
year-over-year, and free cash flow was $2 billion down 2%. We continue to see improvement in working capital with
the cash conversion cycle down nine days year-over-year to 18 days. The year-over-year reduction was driven
primarily by improvements in days payable. Sequentially, the reduction of three days was in line with typical
seasonality for days payable and days inventory where we were able to offset the increases from the large deals I noted
last quarter with other inventory improvements. Days sales outstanding was better than normal seasonality as a result of
strong collections as well as better usage of cash discount.
I want to take a minute to comment on our share repurchase program. In Q3 we spent just $3 million on repurchasing
168,000 shares in the quarter, well below our historical levels. During the quarter we had material nonpublic
information that prevented us from putting in place a share buyback plan as we typically do. However, we have
developed a plan for Q4 that will ramp up our spending to offset dilution from Q3 and Q4 but will remain in line with
our broader FY 2013 goal of rebuilding our balance sheet. We will provide an update on our capital allocation priorities
for fiscal 2014 at our Security Analyst Meeting in October. We remain committed to overall capital distribution to
shareholders and we paid out $280 million in dividends in Q3.
Gross cash at the end of the quarter was $13.7 billion. Operating company net debt was $1.2 billion, down another $1.7
billion from the last quarter and down $10.6 billion from the peak in the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
I am pleased with our progress in reducing operating company net debt and on August 1 we further reduced gross debt
by paying off a $1.1 billion maturity. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we see mixed trends. At a macro level, we
expect Consumer demand weakness in the PC industry will likely continue to impact Personal Systems and we expect
continued pricing pressure in Printing, Personal Systems and Industry Standard Servers.
At the same time, we expect to see more favorable trends in demand for commercial PCs relative to Consumer. We
expect Printing to continue to perform well as we utilize the end tailwinds to place more units. But as we mentioned,
we do have a little bit more work to do to bring down supplies channel inventory.
For Enterprise Services, contractual runoffs continue but we expect the overall full year revenue decline to be in the 8%
to 9% range, less than the 11% to 13% range we indicated in the Q2 earnings call. For the year we continue to expect
margins to be at the high end of our 0% to 3% range that we provided last October.
Software will have a tough Q4 compare due to the large General Motors deal we noted last year. We still expect to see
improved execution and strong customer demand across our big data, security and cloud offerings. Finally, we
anticipate one point of currency headwind to revenue in Q4.
With that context, we expect full year fiscal 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.53 to $3.57.
We expect full year fiscal 2013 GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.57 to $2.71. Finally, although we
don't typically update our cash flow outlook quarterly, we think it makes sense to update our expectations given our Q3
cash flow performance. We now expect free cash flow to approach $8 billion for the full fiscal year 2013. We did better
than expected in Q3 but we believe the Q3 cash conversion cycle was below what we consider to be a sustainable
long-term rate so we expect some pull back in Q4. I know everyone wants to hear our view on fiscal 2014 but we will
provide our detailed outlook at our upcoming security analyst meeting on October 9. We look forward to seeing you all
then.
With that, let's open it up for questions.

[Operator Instructions] And we have Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan on line with a question. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Yes, thanks, good afternoon. Meg, the first question is for you. I was curious regarding
this commentary around execution. Can you give us a little more specifics, particularly in context of today's
management changes, how much is driven by technology deficiencies go-to-market or both? And I just want to see how
we should think about that trajectory, if there is a lot more R&D required going forward?
And then I have a follow-up for Cathie if I could around the Services business. I hear you on the revenue decline not
being as bad as expected at last October's Analyst Meeting. But how should we think about some of the services
slippage going forward as these extensions with some of these four exceptional services customers unwind? Will be
there any sort of operating margin hit down the road that we should prepare for?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Great. Well, let me take the first one. So, we were disappointed, as I said, in EG's
performance this quarter. And there are a couple of issues. I think this is less technology than it is a number of other
areas. First is we've got to have the right products targeted to the market segments that we choose to go after with the
right cost structure. And we've got some more work to do on having a competitive cost structure around supply chain as
well as our manufacturing strategy. We also have got to simplify and make more effective our selling motion. This is a
very big, very complicated sales motion and frankly we've got to simplify it.
And then we've got to see our channel programs that we put in place earlier this year and some changes to the partner
compensation program in August have got to work. And actually there's some bright spots there, but my view is we've
got some operational excellence work that needs to be done here. So I actually am quite confident in our technology.
I'm confident in our next-generation blades in Moonshot. I think we can turn the corner on this, but we're going to have
– we have a bit more work to do.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And also on the Services business question in terms of the slippage, so I'm not sure I
would call it slippage. That sounds unplanned in some way. We've been working closely with these top four accounts,
and at least one of them is completely done, but the three that remain and we're working very methodically to make
sure that their transition works well, and frankly that gives us time to come in and do a couple of things. A, get our cost
structure in-line for now the new run rate business, but also it's enabling us a chance to come in and sell a bit more on a
sell-and-build basis within the quarter, and we saw that this quarter.
So this quarter if we had just had the runoff from these exceptional accounts, and we hadn't been able to bring in some
additional revenue, then the reduction in revenue would've been much better – much lower, and so – sorry, much
higher, much worse. And so I think that, that's giving us time. So I think actually letting these things take a little bit
longer to transition has been good for us.
<A - Rob Binns>: Great. Thanks, Mark. Next question, please?

And we have Toni Sacconaghi on line with a question. Please go ahead.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes. Thank you. Meg, I was wondering if you could comment a little more on the
management changes. In the last two months you've changed leadership of business units that comprise more than 80%
of your profits. So you outlined some of the things that you were dissatisfied with. Perhaps you can comment on what
are the specific marching orders to the new executives? And can you also comment on why you are not looking to
attract talent from the outside? I think in your press release you said the imperative is to rapidly respond with fresh
ideas and bold execution. Fresh ideas often come from the outside and all the management changes that have occurred
recently have included promotion solely from within. So marching orders and then recruiting outside talent, and I have
a separate follow up, please.

<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Okay. Good. So this, as I said for a long time, is a five-year turnaround with
appropriate milestones along the way, but we're entering the next phase of the turnaround, and my view is we need to
accelerate into the next turn. And my job is to get the right people in the right job at the right time with the right
experience and domain expertise. And as I evaluate the performance of each of these businesses, what I think is
necessary, then I've got to match the right executive to the challenge at the time, and I am excited about the make-up of
this new team.
And you're right, Toni, I have relied more on promote from within, because we've got a lot of very talented executives
in the company, who have been in second or third level jobs, who are more than capable of stepping up. In the case of
Dion Weisler the results in APJ for PPS are really quite good. And it takes a long time to learn how HP does things and
understand the business.
In the case of Bill Veghte, he had been our Chief Operating Officer, had helped plot the blueprint for the future and
brings a tremendous amount of software expertise to a business that is relying more on software to differentiate the
hardware than the bare metal. Also has tremendous expertise in selling, ran Microsoft North America and one of our
big weaknesses here is our selling motion and our sales go-to-market. So it's always a balance. I have brought some
new people in from the outside, but you're right, I tend to want to go with people who I think have the fresh ideas and
the energy and the enthusiasm, but also don't have to start at the beginning of the learning curve.
<A - Rob Binns>: Great. Thanks for that, Toni. Next question, please?
Operator
And we have Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley on line with a question. Please go ahead.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Yes. Thank you. Cathie, can you talk a little more specifically about the cash cycle improvement
in the quarter and importantly, why you don't think that's sustainable? Were there mix or timing situations this quarter
that won't continue? And then also can you reconcile the fact that printer hardware unit growth was the best in a couple
years and yet printer supplies growth declined this quarter, which was a deterioration from last quarter and you're sort
of down-ticking on the outlook around printer supplies as well? Thank you.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Thanks, Katy. On the cash conversion cycle, first off we're very pleased with the
performance that we've delivered, both in Q3 as well as frankly throughout the year around cash flow. What is showing
up in the numbers is the work we did to educate everybody in the company, help them understand how they can
contribute to improving cash flow. And then frankly also embedding in a more significant way cash flow into the
executives bonus metrics doesn't hurt either. And so we've seen that kind of improvement.
Specifically in Q3 one of the big drivers of the year-over-year improvement was in days payable, and that is really –
that was the result of some purchasing linearity in the quarter. When we step back and we look at what is a long-term
sustainable kind of cash conversion cycle for the company, we think it's more in the low-20s. And that's really where
the pull-back that we expect to see in Q4 as well. So that's on that side.
In terms of the hardware units, again, what we did this quarter was we were able to use the kind of the yen tailwinds
that we have in our cost structure to really go after more units. And we saw that with units being up 5% year-over-year,
in the Commercial space up 12% year-over-year and the Consumer space up 2%. And so we're really pleased with
having that opportunity to get those units out for exactly the reason that you raise, is that in a fairly short amount of
time that's going to drive additional supplies consumption.
In terms of the specifics around the quarter for supplies this quarter, we do expect that supplies will continue to be
relatively volatile quarter-to-quarter. Our strategies for the long-term are really to drive units out there that will
ultimately use more HP-branded ink. Those strategies are things like Ink in the Office, Ink Advantage, Ink
Subscription, Multifunction Printers, Managed Print Services. Those are all really designed to drive more supplies per
unit. And while it's still early days, the early indications are encouraging that those strategies are going to bear out.

And we have Jim Suva from Citi Research on line with a question. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thanks very much. And, Meg, a quick question. It seems like a while ago, you were talking a lot of
confidence about the five-year program, especially with the revenue growth next year. It seems like now that the
confidence is downshifting a little bit and maybe I misinterpreted the tone of your voice recently or maybe I [ph]
misread and if (40:17) it is true, is it mostly due to PCs? Or how should we think about your confidence in outlook?
And is this five-year program changing at all?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Yeah, no. So listen. I'm very confident that our turnaround is working. As you would
expect in any turnaround, some businesses are performing better than you would think and some are somewhat
performing not as well as you would hope. But what has changed about 2014's revenue outlook for me is a couple of
things. First is Enterprise Group's performance especially during the last quarter. I would say the weak execution has
amplified the market challenges that we know exist and it's been a very aggressive pricing environment.
The server market growth rates have come down in the last quarter. The PC market has not stabilized as much as I had
anticipated it would. That stabilization has yet to occur. And then finally Enterprise Services, which is good for this
year, is running – the revenue is running off more slowly this year, which is good for this year, but creates growth
challenges for next year. So I am confident that we can address the challenges. There are some segments that will
absolutely grow next year and will deliver very good performance, but I think it is unlikely given the changes that have
occurred over the last quarter or so that we're going to see growth in 2014 as I had hoped.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Okay. That's on the revenue side, but then also on the profitability side it seems like cash flow is
better and restructuring is progressing well. Do you think on the earnings side you could see growth? Or just the top
line has so much pressure?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: So we're being very smart about this, as smart as we can in a dynamic market, which
is, it's not growth at any cost, right. We want to manage the margin/revenue trade-offs here and we'll give you a lot
more insight to that in our Security Analyst Meeting, where we're going to talk about our earnings per share
projections, capital allocation, the investments we need to make and where we think the growth is going to come from
next year by market segment.
<A - Rob Binns>: Great. Thanks, Jim.

And we have Ben Reitzes from Barclays on line with a question. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Yeah, hi. Can you talk a little bit about the Technology Services business? That has been pretty
stable and it kind of dipped down 7%, inflected and I think that's your most profitable business of the whole company,
even more profitable than Software.
And then just one clarification, I wanted to know, Meg, that the Server business ISS has been declining for several
quarters. I believe this is the seventh or eighth in a row or sixth or seventh in a row. And I was wondering like why
now? Why didn't we hear about this a couple quarters ago? And what actually came to light to make the decision

happen now on this call rather than over the last year? Thanks.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Thanks, Ben. Let me start with the Technology Services question that you have. One of
the things that we are absolutely seeing in Technology Services is the need to really improve our attach rates on some
of our newer products. And so as some of the older products like Business Critical Systems, which has a very strong
attach and penetration rate, as that has a long tail, but it is coming down and hardware in general has been coming
down, that's starting to impact Technology Services. And so what we're doing about that is trying to improve our attach
on the newer products and then also coming out with new, innovative service offerings, like what we call Proactive
Care or what we call Datacenter Care, have kind of coming out with these new offerings to somewhat cushion the
pressure that we're seeing because hardware sales are declining.
If you go back and you look at fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012, we were able to improve the penetration rates in Storage
and in Networking over 300 basis points each. In this year, we've had a little bit of a step back, and particularly in this
quarter we were down a little bit on pen rates and that's really due to mix. We've got to get the attach rates up on the
newer products.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Let me take the question on our Enterprise Group performance overall. The Server
business has been under pressure for some time. The pricing in the marketplace is as intense as I've seen it since I've
been at HP, but the revenue share loss this quarter was bigger than we had anticipated. I said in the script it was five
points of share loss on a revenue basis, and we have got to move faster on our Hyperscale initiative. We've got to – and
Moonshot will be the disruptive force there, so we've got to move that faster. And then we must see Networking grow
faster. We are the upstart in this business. So a flat Networking performance is not what we need to see and then
frankly our Storage business, the Converged Storage part is growing well, but the decline in tape and other areas, XP,
we can do better than that.
So my job as I said is to make sure that we are positioning these businesses for the future and what I ask of our senior
executives to sort of double back to Toni's question that I didn't answer as directly as I could have is, listen, set realistic
targets, deliver on your commitments while keeping an eye on the long term. I've said for a long time we're not here for
this quarter or for this year. We are trying to set HP up for another really great run here.
You got to decide where you're going to play and how you're going to win because this isn't all about revenue growth.
This is a margin/revenue trade-off business and we have to be very clear about where we want to play and how it is that
we're going to win and then make sure that you have done a perfect job of segmenting your market and marrying the
right products to that market segmentation. And if you do that and manage your cost structure, we'll have a very
successful business here.
So that's what I'm looking for. And this is something historically HP's done really well, but it is not being done as well
as it could be in all parts of the business and it needs to be a real strength of the company going forward especially as
we are navigating these incredible shifts in the industry. It's not business as usual in our industry and we have to be
better at it than we've been in the last year or two.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Rob Binns>: Thanks very much. Thanks, Ben. Next question, please?
Operator
Yes. We have Brian Alexander for Raymond James on line with a question. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Yeah, just on the leadership change. Do you expect trends in the Enterprise business to
deteriorate further as you go through this transition? And at what point, Meg, would you actually hope that this
business would start growing again? And with the change and responsibilities for Dave Donatelli, how should we think
about HP's emphasis on returning to M&A as a key growth driver, given you now have two very senior executives
focused on early-stage opportunities. Thanks.

<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Yeah, so listen. We are in a happy position now from a capital allocation perspective
of being able to – our capital allocation strategy has been very clear. Return cash to shareholders in dividends, buyback
enough shares to offset dilution and pay down debt. So we now have an opportunity to say where can we use strategic
acquisitions to further our overall objectives as a company? And we will be back in the market as we think about
acquisitions that can further our objectives. Again, we will be incredibly measured and disciplined. We are very
mindful of the event that we just came off with Autonomy, so don't worry about that. We are very focused and
disciplined, but I think as we see these big tectonic plate shift, there's no question that acquisitions are going to have to
be a part of how we turn this company around.
So listen, there's a lot of changes going on in the marketplace. The good news about EG, someone asked me the
question earlier. Do you think it's a technology problem? In other words, you're not spending enough R&D? Actually I
don't think that's the case. I think we have the right technology. We've got to work on go-to-market. We've got to work
on cost structure and we've got to work on market segmentation, which frankly are easier more near-term things that
can be fixed as opposed to, you know, hoping that we're going to have the right product two or three or four years from
now based on what's in the labs today. I'm less worried about that and much more focused on what I would call more
prosaic execution.

Operator
Yes. We have Maynard Um from Wells Fargo on line with a question. Please go ahead.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi. Thanks. On your go-to-market, I'm just curious. Your partner changes were put in place on
May 1 or somewhere around there, so you've had about three months since implementation. So is the go-to-market
change a function of not having had it right initially? Or is it something else? I'm just curious how long you seem to
imply that these are sort of short-term things? I'm just curious if it really is a short-term thing or if these are changes in
the channel that need to sort of play out over a period of time, multi-quarters? And if not, why, if it's a short-term
phenomenon? Thanks.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: So, whenever you make changes to your go-to-market selling motion, these take a
while to work through the system and our channel partners have just gotten their first checks from the new
compensation program that went in, in June. And actually there's some light at the end of that tunnel. We feel good
about the changes we made to our partner selling motion. But go-to-market is more than just a coverage model. It is our
ability to price. It is our ability to provide the specialist and the solution architects that are needed to sell. It is about our
ability to compel – to provide compelling bundles of server and storage of – like an appliance for some of our software
elements. So it is a holistic view of go-to-market. I think there's some real light at the end of the tunnel. We've had our
AGMs and our AEs in place now for a number of quarters, in fact, a number of years now and so there's more account
consistency, but there's still work to do here. And frankly, my view is we've made this a bit more complicated than we
need to have and simplicity in my experience in sales organizations is simplicity and clarity of role and the right people
against the right opportunities is critical.
<A - Rob Binns>: Great. Thanks, Maynard. Next question, please?

<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. I have two questions. One was a follow-up. The first is, can you talk

down and so you're going to continue to give up share? Or how are you weighing that? Because obviously in printers
you're willing to do that where you have the yen benefit, but I'm thinking in some of the other categories where you
have seen some share slippage.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Shannon, our focus whether it's in Industry Standard Servers, which Meg talked a little bit
about a few minutes ago, or in PCs that we've talked about for a long time, same thing in printers, is that we're focused
on long-term profitability. And so if in the short-term there are reasons to make an investment that we think will give us
a good return, then we'll do that deal. And it may not always make money, at least on a fully loaded basis. But our goal
is long-term profitability and we believe that ultimately the way we're going to get there is investing in our own IP,
driving products and services that have a strong value proposition for customers and will then enable us to compete
very effectively. You even saw in PCs this quarter we were able to do well from a profitability perspective and also
gain share, so we gained share both year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter. But ultimately the decision is, what's the
best thing for this business over the long term and how we're going to drive profitability.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay. Thanks. And then can you just talk a bit about what you've seen in China, if there are
any more details you can give in terms of demand, enterprise, government, consumer, linearity during the quarter, just
any color you can provide on what's going on over in China?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: I'll make some top-level comments and Cathie can chime in. China is softer than we'd
anticipated, and it is actually across the board. We are seeing more rapid growth in Tier 4 through six cities, a little less
in the big areas, but it is reasonably soft demand across the board, at least as we see it. Do you want to add anything to
that, Cathie?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So let me give you just some data points. Networking in China for us was very strong. We
saw very good growth year-over-year in Networking in China, and you all may not focus on this, but we do. We are the
leading market share holder in China for Networking, so we're pleased with the results in Networking. And then in
Printing as well on a local currency basis year-over-year, we grew revenue as well. That's in the context of what Meg
said, is that overall the economy does seem to be slowing a bit.
<A - Rob Binns>: Great. Thanks, Shannon. Next question, please?
Operator
Yes. We have Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal on line with a question. Please go ahead.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to see if you'd give us update on the restructuring and the cost
opportunities that still have yet to show up. And the reason I ask the question, it's not apparent that HP is getting
material benefits from the cost restructuring activities, so if I look at the guidance for this fiscal year, your operating
profit dollars are going to be down roughly $1.5 billion and that's assuming that you're getting cost savings that are
flowing to the income statement of about $1.5 billion. So why aren't we seeing more of this show up in terms of the
income statement? Because I know Meg you've said that you're making some investments, but it seems like an
extraordinary amount. And then how much still has yet to be delivered in terms of the cost actions? And will we see
any of that show up? And that's it for my question. Thank you.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So, Keith, let me give some update on the restructuring program. Of course, we've got
two dimensions to it. Of course we've got the labor and the non-labor. From a labor perspective, the restructuring
remains on track. We will have – we had roughly 3,800 people leave under the program in Q3, on a program-to-date
basis that roughly 22,500 people have left under the program and we're on track to hit the 26,000 roughly exiting under
the program by the end of fiscal 2013. So I would say good progress on the labor side.
On the non-labor side, we're on track in most areas and ahead in others. And so we're feeling good about the non-labor
progress as well and it's really both the labor and the non-labor savings that's enabling us to compete and price more
effectively in the market. And I think that, that gets to kind of your second question. If you go back to our EPS
guidance implied for Q4 specifically that's roughly normal seasonality at the EPS line, but that's not – we don't have the

same seasonal growth in the revenue line and the difference between that is basically the savings that are getting
generated under the labor and the non-labor restructuring efforts. That's what's cushioning the bottom line. If it weren't
for those savings coming through, the results would be materially lower.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: I guess, Cathie, just to follow up if I could though, but the challenge there for investors is
when the cost cuts run out, the pricing in the market will presumably still remain. How do we reconcile that with HP
being able to grow its earnings over time? And then sorry, I'll cede the floor.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Well, I think, Keith, part of the challenge obviously is the macro and our execution issues.
These savings are frankly giving us the, if I can call it, air cover or room and time to actually fix execution issues and
hopefully over time the macro environment starts to become a little bit easier. We're not planning on that when we
think about 2014, but it does give us, you know, kind of this time to fix some of our execution issues.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: The other thing I would add here is that while we are making these cost cuts, we are
making investments that we think will result in revenue growth over time and we have three segments on businesses.
We've got businesses that are growing, businesses that are maintaining roughly flat and then we have declining
businesses. The mix is now quite heavily weighted towards declining businesses. Over time, that mix will shift because
of the investments we're making and frankly the market shift. So our mix of business is not helping us right now but we
think over time – take Storage for example. So our Converged Storage business is growing very rapidly, the traditional
Storage business is shrinking. At some point the Converged Storage gets bigger than the traditional Storage, and then
you have a growth story in Storage, and that actually is a metaphor for the whole company.
So it's a financial architecture that actually works in our favor over time, but to your point, we have to continue to be
vigilant about costs, we have to restructure our business, we have to make this very large company as lean and efficient
as we possibly can. And some of the organizational changes that I announced today I think there's more efficiency that
we can gain from combining marketing and communications, and we need to think through new models for delivering
what our customers want and being laser-like focused on that and not doing a lot of other things that aren't laser-like
focused about the places that we can win and then how we're going to win there.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Right. Right. Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - Rob Binns>: Thanks, Keith. I think we probably got time for maybe one more.
Operator
Thank you. We have Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital on line with a question. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Hi. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. I guess to that end, can you give us a little bit of a
sense of what the maybe a preview, if you will, of what the opportunity for cost savings might be going forward?
Presumably, we are going to get market forces that are going to continue to be pretty aggressive across a number of
segments. So even if you give us something anecdotal, that would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: So listen, we have done I think a very good job of identifying areas of cost savings.
Cathie very accurately described the labor savings. We have a non-labor program also in place and we continue as we
are in place and consistency of leadership for Hewlett-Packard is so important because you actually have, you know,
one year to the next of learning behind you and an ability to see things that you might not have seen even two or three
years – or two years ago.
So listen, I think there's still opportunity for us in how we support the sales force. Sales operations is an opportunity for
us, how we are organized between product marketing and category management and product management versus what
takes place in the field versus what takes place in the business units. How do we leverage our key accounts, our big
accounts between ES and the Enterprise Group? So I think there is a next generation, if you will, learning how we can
be more efficient. You also have to remember, this company was the product of many acquisitions going all the way

back to Compaq, EDS, ArcSight, TippingPoint, Fortify, Opsware, you name it, and while there were many acquisitions
that I think were integrated well, not all of them were fully integrated in such a way that we had the right ERP systems
et cetera. So I think you'll see pockets of growth over the next year as we continue to work on this, and I think we
continue to take out costs.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And we will talk a lot more about this at our Security Analyst Meeting in October, when
we really lay out all of the different elements of the fiscal 2014 plan and continued cost reduction will certainly be
prominently featured.
Meg Cushing Whitman
But let me – are we done? I think we're ready to close. Okay. So listen: I feel very confident in our turnaround. This is a
journey. We have achieved a lot of milestones along the way and I'm confident we're on the right track and I'm really
excited about this new management team and what we're going to accomplish for the benefit of customers,
shareholders and employees. So I feel like we're on track and things are headed in the right direction.
Rob Binns
Great. I think we are done. So with that, we'll conclude the call. Thanks very much, everybody.
Operator
