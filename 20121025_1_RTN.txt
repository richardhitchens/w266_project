of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Todd Ernst
Thank you, Chanelle. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our third quarter conference call.
The results we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides we'll reference are available on our
website at Raytheon.com. Following this morning's call an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of
the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website. With me today are Bill Swanson, our
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dave Wajsgras, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief
remarks by Bill and Dave and then move onto questions.
Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters
discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and
expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of
assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are
summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.
With that I'll turn the call over to Bill.

William H. Swanson
Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another solid quarter. Our operating margin, EPS,
and cash flow were above expectation. Overall the businesses executed well in the quarter. We remain focused on
reducing our cost, improving our productivity, and delivering innovative affordable solutions to our global customers.
As we said on the last call, we expected bookings to ramp-up in the last half of the year, and our third quarter orders
came in strong at $7.3 billion. Notable awards included more than $1.2 billion for the Standard Missile-3, which
follows on two successful intercepts that we had in the second quarter. Our classified book-to-bill was approximately
1.2 and has been above 1 every quarter this year. We also received significant awards for domestic and international
training.
In addition, I'd like to highlight one of Raytheon's core market areas, C3I or Command, Control, Communications and
Intelligence. Within this area, we're a leading provider of strategic communication terminals. We currently are
providing the Navy Multiband Terminal or NMT for the Navy as well as the Secure Mobile Anti-jam Reliable Tactical
Terminal also known as, SMART-T to the U.S. Army.
Adding to our success in this area, during the quarter, we were awarded a $70 million competitive development
contract for the FAB-T program. This is a significant effort and it enhances our secure communications position within
the U.S. Air Force as well. FAB-T will allow communications between military aircraft, ground sites and the new
higher data rate satellites. And like the systems for the Navy and the Army, it will allow secure, protected
communications for our customers' most sensitive missions.
Also during the quarter, the Air Force awarded us a study contract to help define the next generation of tactical
protected SATCOM systems. These wins plus our existing franchise positions us well for the future.
Our international pipeline is strong with Kuwait Patriot completing the congressional approval process in late August
and we expect to book an award by the end of the year. Other international opportunities are proceeding through the
process, including a large precision munitions award, a C4I system, a Rolling Airframe Missile and just – these are just
a few among many others that we are pursuing in the fourth quarter.
Over the past years, we pursued a strategy of growing our international business and I'm encouraged and pleased by the
increasing number of international opportunities for the company. At the same time as we know the timing of
international awards is always a factor. It's the nature of the business.
The bottom line is for 2012 combining our strong domestic orders and our substantial international opportunities, we
remain confident about achieving the $25 billion plus or minus $500 million booking objective we set in January of this
year.
At the end of the third quarter, Congress passed a continuing resolution for the fiscal 2013 defense budget that runs
through the end of March next year. They've become a way of life essentially in this fiscal environment. This one is a
little different in that it extends past the January second sequestration implementation date. While the CR does not
preempt sequestration, it does provide a mechanism for continued funding through the end of March should
sequestration be delayed. Although we continue to believe a resolution could occur after the election, we're planning
for a variety of potential outcomes.
As you've heard me say on prior calls, we're focused on the things we can control. This includes operating the business
as efficiently as possible and delivering value for our customers and our shareholders regardless of whether
sequestration happens or not. We believe that Raytheon's large international market presence, portfolio programs,
technology and focus on high priority areas should help to mitigate some of the potential overall impact if sequestration
is implemented.
Importantly, over the past several years, we've made the investments in common systems and infrastructure across the
entire company. This enables us to be more agile. We can more effectively balance workloads. We can win work
anywhere, design it anywhere, and build it anywhere across the company. This allows us to respond quickly in this

dynamic budget environment that we're currently experiencing.
I'd like to thank the Raytheon team for their hard work and dedication in an environment marked by higher than normal
level of complexity and uncertainty. The team has remained focused and has executed well. We're prepared for the
future and stand ready to continue to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders.
With that, let me turn it over to Dave.
David C. Wajsgras
Okay, thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks starting with third quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to
questions. During my remarks I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. Okay, if everyone
could please move to page three. As Bill noted, we reported solid operating results in the third quarter. The company
had strong bookings in the quarter of $7.3 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.21.
Our adjusted EPS of $1.60 was up 15%, driven by continued operational improvements and capital deployment actions.
Adjusted operating margin was 13.8%, up 80 basis points compared to last year's third quarter, reflecting strong
performance for the company. Sales were $6 billion in the quarter, down slightly from last year's third quarter.
We delivered strong operating cash flow from continuing operations of $1.1 billion, better than expected, and primarily
driven by the timing of collections. We've updated our full year 2012 guidance, which I'll address further in a few
minutes. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for $125 million, bringing
the year-to-date share repurchase to 14.1 million shares for $725 million.
Turning now to page four, let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results. Our total company
bookings for the quarter were $7.3 billion and on a year-to-date basis were $18.6 billion, representing a year-to-date
book to bill ratio of 1.04. We continue to see our book-to-bill range for the full-year 2012 of between roughly 1 and
1.05 times.
Notable bookings in the third quarter included $1.2 billion at Missile Systems for SM3 for the Missile Defense Agency.
MS also booked $350 million on a multiyear TOW-missile contract for the U.S. Army and Marines, $101 million for
Phalanx Weapons Systems for the U.S. Navy and an international customer, and $87 million for MALD, our Miniature
Air Launched Decoy for the U.S. Air Force.
Technical Services booked $246 million for work on the air traffic controller training contract, ATCOTS, for the FAA.
CS also booked $252 million and $137 million respectively for domestic and foreign training programs in support of
the Warfighter FOCUS program.
Intelligence and Information Systems booked $170 million on a contract to provide intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance support to the U.S. Air Force.
Integrated Defense Systems won a competitive award of $123 million for the Upgraded Early Warning Radar system
for the MDA and the U.S. Air Force. IDS also booked $84 million to support air and missile defense capability for the
U.S. Army.
And as Bill just highlighted, Network Centric Systems received a $70 million award for the Family of Advanced
Beyond-Line-of-Sight Terminals program for the U.S. Air Force, a key competitive win for the Raytheon team that
positions us well to address the Air Force's need for secure, protected communications by leveraging proven
technology that we've also provided to the Army and Navy. IIS and SAS booked $559 million and $382 million
respectively on a number of classified programs.
Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $35 billion compared to $35.3 billion at the end of 2011. On a funded basis,
our backlog is up over $400 million from the end of 2011 and up approximately $1.2 billion from the same period last
year.

If you now move to page five. Sales were slightly below last year's third quarter. By business, IIS, Missiles and SAS
had sales essentially in line with the comparable period of last year. IDS had third quarter 2012 net sales of $1.3 billion,
an increase of 8% on a year-over-year basis. The increase from prior year is primarily due to stronger international
sales on Patriot programs and the TPY-2 radars. Technical Services had net sales of $785 million, down a little more
than $30 million from the comparable period a year ago due to the completion of the Polar contract in the first quarter
of 2012.
NCS had net sales of $963 million in the quarter. The 13% decrease in net sales is primarily due to the decline of some
U.S. Army production programs. Some international programs, which we had expected to book earlier in the year have
moved to the right and we have updated our guidance accordingly. It's notable that NCS's book-to-bill was greater than
one in the last two quarters, driven by both domestic and international orders. For the full year, the business is expected
to achieve a book-to-bill of between 1.1 and 1.15 times.
Moving ahead to page six, we're pleased with the overall company operating margin. The year-over-year improvement
was driven by operational performance. Our adjusted margin was 13.8%, an increase of 80 basis points. On a
year-to-date basis, our adjusted margin was 13.5%, up 90 basis points over the comparable period in 2011. The strength
in our company margins is a result of our planning process, including our continued focus on improving productivity,
strong execution across the company and contract mix.
We are realizing the benefits from reduced costs in our administrative functions, improved efficiencies in our factories
and increasing value from the implementation of strategic supply chain initiatives. As we have said in the past,
Raytheon Six Sigma efforts are driving tangible results for the company.
So looking at business margins. Several international Patriot programs including Taiwan and Saudi and an international
missile defense radar program have now moved into full rate production at IBS and they are executing well. The
favorable performance on these programs is being driven partially by the benefits realized from the economies and
efficiencies of increased volume flowing through the factory. This along with a change in mix has favorably impacted
the IDS margins.
Missiles and SAS margins were up in the quarter compared to the same period last year. Solid overall program
performance drove improvements at both businesses as well as favorable mix at SAS. NCS delivered solid margins in
the third quarter of 2012, but were lower compared to the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to a change in mix driven
by higher net sales on long-term production programs last year and as we have already discussed the timing of
international awards. And at Technical Services third quarter 2011 operating margins benefited from efficiencies
realized on some programs that completed last year. So overall, the company continues to perform well.
Turning now to page seven, third quarter 2012 adjusted EPS was $1.60 up 15%. The increase was driven by operational
improvements and capital deployment actions, specifically share repurchases and on a year-to-date basis adjusted EPS
was $4.61, up 12% from the same period last year.
If you could please move to page eight, I'd like to briefly comment on our updated outlook for 2012. We've lowered
and narrowed the range for full year 2012 net sales primarily due to the timing of awards at NCS. We now expect sales
to be in the range of between $24.3 billion and $24.7 billion. As we have done in past years, during the third quarter we
updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of the update, FAS/CAS pension expense for
the year decreased by $32 million from $284 million to $252 million. We increased our adjusted EPS guidance for the
year by $0.10 to reflect the strong performance through the end of the third quarter. We see adjusted EPS of between
$5.85 and $5.95. You should note that we also increased our 2012 guidance for GAAP EPS to between $5.36 and
$5.46, which includes the expected margin improvement for the year, as well as the updated full year of FAS/CAS
pension expense.
As I mentioned earlier, we generated strong operating cash flow in the quarter, which is primarily the result of timing
of collections. A portion of this is expected to increase our cash flow for the year. As a result, we've increased our 2012
guidance for operating cash flow from continuing operations by $100 million to between $1.8 billion and $2 billion.
Overall our updated outlook for 2012 reflects our ability to drive results through performance improvements.

If you move to page 9, I'll discuss some detail on our full-year guidance for 2012 by business. So let me start with
sales, we've increased the IDS full-year sales outlook by $100 million as a result of strong growth in international
programs. We tightened the full year sales range for IIS, Missiles and SAS. We also lowered and tightened NCS's
full-year sales range to reflect the timing of new international awards, and TS's full-year of sales range due to delays on
domestic training and logistics programs.
Now turning to margins, we've increased the range and expect higher full-year operating margin performance for IDS,
IIS, Missiles, SAS and Technical Services. The strong year-to-date results exceeded our prior estimates. We lowered
the range of our full year operating margin guidance for NCS, driven by a change in mix due to delays in a few
international awards, one of which we expect to receive in the fourth quarter. You should be aware that the fourth
quarter outlook also includes costs related to potentially terminating a supplier agreement.
From an overall standpoint, Raytheon remains well-positioned going forward. We continue to invest in critical
technologies. We relentlessly focus on execution and we have a broad and balanced portfolio of programs. We will
continue to improve productivity and deliver value to our customers and shareholders.
Now turning to next year. As we did last year, we intend to provide 2013 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call
in January. So, if you could please move to page 10 we have provided a FAS/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2013
as we've done in prior years. And just to be clear, the discount rate and the actual asset returns won't be known until we
close out 2012. It is worth noting that given the current interest rate environment with discount rates at historical lows
today we expect to see improvement to the FAS/CAS pension expense in 2014 and beyond assuming even a modest
increase in rates in the future.
Before we open it up for Q&A, let me summarize. We had a solid third quarter and exceeded the operating margin,
EPS, and cash flow guidance we provided back in July. Our book-to-bill was 1.2 or put another way, our bookings
exceeded our sales by 20%, once again highlighting how our innovative and affordable solutions are aligned with our
global customer priorities and providing a solid foundation for the future.
We continue to move ahead with our efficiency initiatives, which importantly have provided savings for our customers
and driven solid financial performance for the company. We are confident in our outlook for the year.
With that Bill and I will open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Nadol, JPMorgan.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks, good morning guys.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: I just wanted to start out, I hear you on the international items, and thanks for the detail you
gave there. So, wondering if you guys have formally adjusted your expectations of the components of those bookings
for the year or if you're just kind of sticking with what you have so far, since you're keeping your overall number? And
then also Bill, just any color you can give on the hold up. Is this end market related or is this the FMS process in
Washington that's holding it up et cetera? Thanks.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, Joe. Let me try and frame it first from the top. We still expect bookings to be in
around the 25% to 28% of our total bookings. So from our standpoint, we feel pretty good that what we said we were
going to do in January, we're doing. The good part on the international is no cancellations. And we're just being
cautious as we look at the market getting into what we said the back half of the year was where our activity was going
to be and we brought in over $7 billion worth of bookings and we expect Q4 to be strong.

Maybe what I should do is give you some color the way I think about it if I look at the Q4 bookings. We expect IDS to
bring in about $2.5 billion worth of bookings. 60% of that is international. Kuwait Patriot will drive that. We have a
congressional notification that's been approved. That total award is in the $1.2 billion range, but we probably expect
$750 million to $800 million in that because they will buy the fire units first and then they'll go to buy the spares and
the services shortly thereafter.
The balance of what they are going to bring in is domestic orders. Those are mainly in the naval area and they've got a
few other international contracts there. IIS will bring in about $750 million. These are all plus or minus a little, and they
are mainly in the classified area. I think about missiles, they have bookings of around $1 billion, two-thirds of what
they're going to bring in is international. The largest there is a munition program, Paveway. We expect to get that
approval and we expect it to happen and the balance will be domestic.
In NCS, our bookings there will be about $1.5 billion. As Dave mentioned, we've signed and expect that customer to
sign momentarily an award, probably around $600 million to $700 million, in that range. And the balance there will be
domestically as we look at it.
SAS, we expect bookings there of about $1 billion. About 60% of those are international and the biggest piece is
related to Tactical Airborne Radars, classified probably a couple of hundred million there. And TS bookings, we
estimate around $300 million and that will be in training and a logistics program, about 60% of those internationally.
So, overall, we see a strong Q4 bookings around $6 billion to $7 billion, and from our standpoint over half of those will
be international. I think that gives you a pretty good color of what we're trying to do and to finish out the year.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: No, that's very helpful, Bill. Just any color on the FMS process, and if that's creating any
delays or it's normal?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, it's – there's a little bit of a delay there, I mean, we have to go through the
congressional notification process. Things are moving. I'm not pointing any fingers at anything, but we'd sure like the
process to be quicker if we could move them. These are international sales, they're good jobs here domestically and
we'd like to keep pushing as hard as we can, but we are in an election year and we kind of looked at this at the
beginning of the year and knew something would happen, but we're getting great support out of the building and people
are trying here. But it's taken us just a little bit longer.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.
Operator
Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey, good morning gentlemen.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a couple of quick ones. One, I noticed that the share repurchase was a little bit less in Q3
than you'd done earlier in the year, at least it looked like that. Was there any just sort of conservatism, given the budget
uncertainty that we're dealing with as we head into the back half of the last quarter of the year, and with sequestration
sitting there next year, did that weigh on your share repurchases in the quarter?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So back in January, Carter, we had talked about moderating our share repurchases for 2012
going forward relative to prior years. So frankly, we're executing along those lines and the way the cadence has played
out was something that we had essentially anticipated back in January. I think importantly we feel very good about the
cash flow generation both on the quarter and year-to-date and I think it's worth noting that we've increased our
guidance to between $1.8 billion and $2 billion of cash on the year.

<Q - Carter Copeland>: Great. That's what I recalled. I just wanted to make sure there was no sort of difference in
message. So, thank you for that.
And the second question Dave is one of – a more mechanical one, and we're struggling to figure out what sequestration
is going to main for 2013 as you are as well and I'm sure you are evaluating lots of scenarios. But putting the top line
impact aside, if you were to think about the mechanics about how you will evaluate the impact of sequestration on
margins, given that we will already be done with Q4 and you'll probably be closing out your EAC shortly thereafter and
we won't know really what's going to happen with contractual actions by the time you report Q4 results and may not
know by the time you report Q1 results. When is it realistic in the sort of mechanical process of how you're going to set
EACs and determine profit rates that you'll have a realistic read on what the impact of sequestration could be for your
margin rates?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. So, I will try to answer the number of questions that you just put forward. There are
many factors to consider when you're thinking about this and frankly at this stage, it's hypothetical. So, the speculation
isn't all that easy. Now with that said, a lot of this depends – for various companies, not just Raytheon, but if you stand
back, a lot of this depends on how companies' programs are going to be impacted overall. So for example, if the
decreases are tied to a dedicated facility, and that's not a situation that we would want to be in and frankly we don't find
ourselves in that situation, the costs associated with the facility could have a negative impact on the margin profile.
It also depends on whether a program or programs are being canceled or stretched out, whether they are funded or
unfunded, the overall program mix of the company and whether or not you have offset, so things like international
business. And again, from Raytheon's perspective, we believe that's a strength.
I think most importantly is, our ability to react quickly to any type of reductions from a cost structure standpoint. We
know how to react in this regard and you can see that, especially if you look in the rearview mirror, just look at the
facts and look at the results we've posted and the margins we've been able to achieve. We do have a broad portfolio
programs and the fact that we have companywide systems, again which we've talked to in the past, it does provide us
with a lot of flexibility to help mitigate any kind of pressure on the margin profile. I hope that answers the question.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: It does, as kind of a follow-up to that, and thank you for that. Is it fair to say that it will take
an extended period of time into 2013, before we'll really have a decent handle on what some of those impacts might be?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Again, it depends what kind of guidance we get from the customer and if and how
sequestration is actually implemented. So it's – my crystal ball is a little foggy this morning; it's a fair question, but it's
very difficult to answer in the hypothetical.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: All right. Thanks – go ahead, Bill
<A - William H. Swanson>: Just a little color to what Dave said. We do not expect the Department to cancel programs
starting in January, at least some of the discussions have stated that they'll plan their way through it as they've said, and
for us we will do our planning based on both scenarios. Normal, as a normal year you'd call what we're in, versus a year
of sequestration, and what's important is we have a healthy funded backlog.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Great. Thank you, gentlemen.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.

<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hey, Dave, a quick question for you and then one for Bill. Dave, you mentioned that there
were going to be some costs related to the termination of a supplier agreement. Can you give a little bit more detail
about (a), what that is and (b), what the extent of the cost might be?
And then Bill, if you could share a little bit about cash deployment going forward and kind of update us on your current
thinking on priorities? Thank you.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure. So, relative to the NCS supplier agreement, we are in negotiations, so there is a not a
lot we can say. What we've done is essentially set up a worst-case scenario for the fourth quarter and have assumed a
$30 million adjustment to NCS's earnings; that's from a company standpoint. In the fourth quarter – from a fourth
quarter margin perspective that's about 50 basis points. But again it is a worst-case scenario and the team is working
through the situation, and we are working hard to not have this happen, but we did think it was appropriate to put that
into the guidance in the fourth quarter. So that's part one.
Part two, you asked about capital deployment. At this point, we don't see any wholesale changes moving forward. We
have a balanced approach. We have moderated our share repurchases in 2012 when compared to 2011. We had a
meaningful dividend increase earlier in the year, the eighth consecutive increase on an annual basis. We feel
comfortable relative to the funding profile of the pension. You can see as you dig into the details of our financial results
that we continue to invest in ourselves, particularly in the R&D area. Going forward we'll continue to – we'll continue
with the acquisition strategy that we put in place a few years ago, adding critical technologies to the overall portfolio.
So, the short version would be, I wouldn't expect meaningful changes as we look ahead to the next couple of years. I do
believe that the company has done an exceptionally good job from a cash performance standpoint and converting
earnings into cash, and that puts us in a very good position and gives us a lot of flexibility as we look to 2013 and 2014.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: That's helpful. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned, Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Yes, good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I wanted to talk a little bit about NCS. My understanding had been that you were pretty
much done with the impact from decline in war-related activity and that what was left could be offset by growth
elsewhere in the unit, particularly international. That didn't appear to be the case this quarter. Backlogs are holding up
well, but do you think we're at the bottom yet with respect to the impact from the decline in Army programs?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, I think so Doug at least from what I see their book-to-bill was above 1 this quarter;
we expect it to stay above that going forward. I think for us NCS went through the transition. They've got a strategy of
the power of the network really with network-enabled solutions. They're tapping into that for our customers and
working it across the business base here in the company. The Army drawdown, they've transitioned from what I'd call
single mission Army products to network solutions bringing the actionable intelligence to the individual soldier. That's
where we see the Army going. They need to accomplish that on the move.
You've heard me talk about MAINGATE, AFATDS and Command View and PSDS2 are things that we can do to
broaden NCS and help the Army get in there. There are large Army and Navy satellite communications programs. I
talked about that earlier on the call. We see that as a real strength for them. And then of course I mentioned they'll be
getting a sizeable contract here in the fourth quarter. We really feel good about it. It's all buttoned up. We've just got to
wait for the final signature here. We thought we would announce it, but things move a day around here at times. So we
feel good about that, and then the thing that's really exciting is our air traffic business, demand is there, they are
partnering with the FAA to evolve the terminal automation systems to be interoperable with the FAA and DoD to
provide a common operating picture and increase capacity, in short to implement and deploy next gen. So we feel

pretty good about where they are at and we look to the vector to be up as we go forward.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: And then regarding bookings, more generally. In Q3, it looks like a lot of your large
awards were heavily U.S. awards this time and did you see any of the strength in bookings as DoD efforts to get things
done before the end of fiscal 2012?
<A - William H. Swanson>: No, no, Doug. We haven't seen a delay and we've not seen an acceleration. The guidance
DoD has is business is normal, obligate the funds and proceed forward. So from our standpoint, it feels normal on the
DoD side and kind of what we expected as we looked at things.

Our next question comes from Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer.
<Q - Yair Reiner>: Thank you. Congratulations on the nice quarter.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Thank you.
<Q - Yair Reiner>: I have a long-term question about margins, in both IDS and Missile Systems, you are entering a
new territory in terms of profit rates. I think many of us are trying to figure out whether it's something really structural
is taking place that can allow these type of margins to become a new baseline, or whether we're just kind of at a crest in
the cycle. I think if you could help us think about that structurally in terms of both contracting dynamics and private
cycles that would be helpful? Thank you.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So let me start off with kind of the near-term view, and then address the longer-term view.
So for IDS, the third quarter margins were higher than the guidance that we had earlier provided. That's really the result
of the strong execution in our factory operations. So, on a quarter-to-quarter basis, if you're looking at Q4, it actually
moderates a little bit relative to Q3 and year-to-date, but that's the result of the timing of the efficiencies that we spoke
to earlier combined with the overall schedule acceleration on a number of international programs.
Looking forward, we would continue to see strong margins in IDS. I'd suggest of the six business areas, likely the
strongest margins for the group, driven primarily by the strength of the international business specifically in the Air and
Missile Defense area as well as continued performance on a number of domestic programs as we look ahead. From a
Missile Systems standpoint, structurally there isn't anything too remarkable. I would suggest that the third quarter
performance was again driven by a number of areas of focus on the efficiency side and the productivity side as well as
overhead reduction efforts again, that we spoke to earlier. Going forward, I'd suggest that margins would be in the
general range that we expect for 2012. Again, I'm extrapolating over the next couple of years.
<Q - Yair Reiner>: Very helpful, thank you.

<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No you're kidding.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Yeah. First of all if you could give us an idea of where your returns are year-to-date and what the
discount is that you're looking at the moment say as of the 30th of September?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure, returns year-to-date as of last night were just above 10% from an asset plan
standpoint. If you were to put a stake in the ground today, we would be looking at around 4.25% discount rate. And I'll
remind you and I recognize you're aware of this that the discount rate will be set on the last day of the year based on a
hypothetical bond portfolio that mirrors the liabilities of the plan. So it's obviously difficult to handicap where that's
going to end up. But again if you're looking at today, we would suggest about 4.25% discount rate. So let me answer
your next question before you ask it. If you're looking the FAS/CAS impact of 2013 versus 2012, we see that likely
increasing by about $50 million, 2013 to 2012 and you can see that if you just look what is on the pension matrix.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Okay. Actually next question I was going to ask is something different, was whether you would
assume any material change in your contributions moving into next year?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: At this stage, we don't see any material change in our contributions. Let me just give you
some specifics. From a gross pension funding standpoint, we'll be at around $750 million in 2012, and after the CAS
reimbursement we're actually positive about $100 million. That's the same neighborhood as we look at 2013, it's about
just under $900 million gross, but again positive about $100 million from a cash flow standpoint.
I do want to just mention one other thing before we close out this subject. If we look at 2014 from a FAS/CAS expense
standpoint, we see that number being in the neighborhood on an absolute basis of about $50 million negative. So, there
is a fairly significant movement in the numbers from 2013 to 2014.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: That's great. That's it Dave.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure.

Our next question comes from Howard Rubel, Jefferies.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. Good morning.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Hi Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Two things, I want to just ask about, one is Bill as you look at sort of your bid and proposal
and opportunities that you're going after. w hat sort of percentage would you say in general terms is new things that you
don't currently have, so that they in effect represent market share opportunities?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Howard, I don't know if I broken it down that way, but if I think about it from a
technological point of view, and where we make our investments and where we're heading, we're seeing more
technology and where we're focusing into upgrade systems. If you take older devices, there is a great opportunity to go
from what I'll say are the old Maggies or tubes to solid state. There is a way to go from gallium to GaN. And, so there's
a push for us in that area.
The other thing that we see an opportunity and you saw this in EW World that where you could take multiple systems
and go to multifunction systems. And that's an area where we see that taking place and of course of the last one is that
we believe you need technology to be able to reduce manpower. And, we think going into the headwinds that's
something that's important. So, from our standpoint, that's kind of our focus. We see as our military gets smaller and
tries to be more agile in their strategy, we see ourselves going there and then the other part that something I've talked
about before is our CRAD. Our development is running about $1 billion to $1.5 billion for us, and that's really all the
seed corn stuff we see in the company that leads to new programs and – of course for us EW, advancing AESA radars
on older platforms and so forth are just examples of things we're trying to do, but I don't have a percentage and I hate to

swag it, but it is something I'll go look at, see if I can't get an answer.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you. And then, just to finish is that – part of all of this pressure on defense is
obviously units and things like that, but part of it is also process at the customer. Have you been able to be effective
either in coming up with some notable solutions or examples that you can take from one business unit to another where
your contracting cost and processes to deliver the good is really better?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah. It's a great question. I talk about it in B&P funds, bid and proposal. Clearly for us
we have and are sharing best practices across the company, the number of programs we're bidding on is going up.
We're opening the aperture and one of the things we've found is some of our businesses have got some very creative
ways to be able to bid more with no more and we passed that around the company. The other thing I should have
mentioned back to your original question in cyber what we're encouraged about now is we have the ability to work
cyber from the network to the cloud to the desktop to the laptop to all forms of mobile. And we believe that's an
opportunity for us that we haven't had before as we've added some niche acquisitions in here and I should have
mentioned that.

Our next question comes from Bill Loomis, Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - Bill R. Loomis>: Hi, thank you, good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - Bill R. Loomis>: Just looking at you did a good job giving us overview on NCS, but just on IIS and TS, when I
look into your guidance for the year and the fourth quarter it really implies margins in those two lower margin units
anyway going into the low sevens. Is there anything unusual there or conservatism, how do you explain that?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No. For IIS, I think if you just cut through everything, I would expect the full year margins
to be at the top-end of the ranges that we've provided. There is nothing unusual or remarkable going on in IIS. They
continue to perform well. They're winning a lot of new business. We are very pleased with the way they have delivered
results for the company for 2012 and we expect more of the same in 2013. They are particularly strong in the classified
area.
From a Technical Services standpoint, we talked a little bit about the timing of training and logistics programs shifting
to the right. From a margin perspective, the comp to last year's third quarter is a difficult one because we had a number
of programs closing out at our Customized Engineering and Depot Services area, and that resulted in some margin
pickups that otherwise would have occurred later in the year. The roughly low 8% range is about the way to think about
that business. They're continuing to perform well, and again, I know I sound a little bit like a broken record, but there is
nothing too remarkable happening in that business either.
<Q - Bill R. Loomis>: And just one quick question on NCS, on the $30 million worst case scenario on that supply
agreement, if I – if I guess if I just add that back to my model based on your implied fourth quarter guidance, you have
actually a very good margin in NCS. Is that – how is that factored into the guidance specifically?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: It's just a – think of it as directly off the bottom line. It's a $30 million – it's not a reserve in
the accounting sense, but it's a reserve in the guidance that we've built into our projections, and again, we're working
hard to not take that impact and we'll see how things play out over the next month or two.
<Q - Bill R. Loomis>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, Sam
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Can you – Dave, maybe you can help me with this. You talked about the strong order
activity, yet order is kind of $1 billion higher than sales, but when I look at your funded backlog, it actually declined
since June. So, can you just talk about how things end up going into total backlog versus funded backlog?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, the funded backlog, I think the place I'd like to start would be relative to where we
were in this period last year, and that's up about $1.2 billion. With respect to the overall backlog, as well as the funded
backlog, Sam, there is always timing elements to this and there is nothing to read into it. Again, quarter-to-quarter,
things will ebb and flow. We do feel that the backlog from an overall mix standpoint is very strong. The international
backlog is in the high 30% range, and we expect that to increase over time. The average funded portion of the overall
backlog runs about 55% to 60%. So, again, I don't think – there is nothing significant to report. There is obviously
timing from quarter-to-quarter.
<A - William H. Swanson>: And I would add – it's Bill – that at least one customer base, not DoD, is on a monthly
funded basis rather than a quarterly funded basis. So, the number could even be, or should even be higher. So, it's
caused a little bit of a spike, but we feel pretty good about our funded backlog going into next year.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. And then Dave, if I can follow-up just on the cash flow.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: You were $400 million or $500 million more than you said you were going to be in terms of
cash flow from ops. You said a lot of it's timing, but this would imply the fourth quarter is actually below the third
quarter and I can't recall you doing that in quite a while. So, why are we going to see that reverse next quarter?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, again we did suggest that much of this was timing. I am comfortable with suggesting
the higher end of the cash flow range for the year and that is a little bit different than what we had been suggesting in
the past. Obviously, cash is measured on the last day of the year. So, it's always difficult to handicap. But again, I
wouldn't say there is anything unusual going on there either.

<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, consistency is a good thing and transparency is even better and no surprises is the
best. And so, from our standpoint I think we think about it the same way. First of all, can we invest in ourselves? If we
do that, then we know the kind of margins and returns we're going to get. The next part, can we partner with someone
that helps if they have the capability? For us, we have a good record teaming with universities on some of these smaller
jobs and programs that we have as we go forward. Dave talked about share repurchase and dividends, how we look at
that.
And the next part is the M&A and we're very comfortable with the type of M&A activity we had. We just announced
Teligy, that's a strategy really there to broaden cyber even further for us. They specialize in wireless RF
communication, vulnerability analysis, reverse engineering and rapid prototyping. We're thrilled to have this firm join
the Raytheon team, and they just give us more capability in this very complicated cyber world that continues to get
more attention. But the bottom-line is we have not altered anything and I can't comment on the transaction other than
those are hard to do in this environment.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Right. And just regarding that the smaller niche Teligy, are you seeing – are there more
opportunities for you where you feel like you have technology gaps? It feels like you already had a very big base to
work from in the cyber?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Right we do, but one of the things you have to look at cyber, it evolves. It's a threat that is
basically depending on whether you're right handed or left handed, a click of the mouse. And from our standpoint,
we've always had this vision of being full service to our customers. And to us we want to make sure that we can handle
not only the network, but the cloud the desktop, the laptop or what we see the whole world is going mobile, and that's
very vulnerable and as an engineer, I realize that an aperture is a door. And that door can be opened or closed and we
want to be able to provide that service to our customers that we have full knowledge of the spectrum. And that's kind of
how we think about it.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Thank you.
<A - William H. Swanson>: And by the way I should point out as we add these firms, we have a very nice transition
plan here in the company where they become part of it and what I'm really thrilled about is the acquisitions we made,
talking to those leaders, how they feel about joining the company and being able to broaden their capabilities too.
<A - Todd Ernst>: Chanelle, we have time for one more question.
Operator
Sure. Our final question comes from the line of Myles Walton, Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Thanks, and good morning. Maybe first Dave, on cash just a clarification, coming into the
2012 you had to lap some tough comps on customer advances from 2011 and I think at the time, you talked about 2013
kind of showing a nice rebound, kind of thinking about it conceptually between the two years. Is that still about the
right way to think about 2013 as you go forward?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So 2013, it's a little early to talk about the guidance. We did come into the year with a
balance that was – I would say high relative to prior years, specifically around customer advances, international
customer advances, which is being liquidated in 2012 and 2013. As you know, we have improved cash performance
and the guidance that we had suggested back in January. I'll provide more details this January on how we see 2013
playing out, but given just the number of moving pieces for 2013, I think it's just a little bit early. What I would feel
comfortable conveying at this stage is that the cash flow expectations for next year in a general way should be in line
with what we're seeing for 2012.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Okay. And Bill, a question for you on communications on the defense landscape. It seems
like JTRS has been restructured, now it's inside of a new program office and I know Raytheon is engaged on the
software side, but it seems like the hardware side is opening up opportunities for you as well. Can you touch on where

you think Raytheon fits in that? Are you competing on the vehicular radio competition?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, we are in – from my standpoint, I really don't think of it as a radio business
anymore. I really think about it as a software business. That's where communications going not only in waveforms and
so forth, but the other thing that we're going to see a real push on is in secure communications. How do you move data
around the battlefield in a secure way? And if you think about it, it's no different than I think what U.S. industry is
going to have to think about, about how corporations move around Big Data and the information in an encrypted
format. So, from our standpoint, we see that something that's really important to us and where part of our focus is here
as you move think about data from an airborne or a satellite platform down to a ground station and then you move that
information around – that information has to be secure and it's secure really through software and through waveforms.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: But specifically in the JTRS vehicular radio, have you been able to get a placement in that
competition?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, we have. And the other thing is MAINGATE really puts a hole in everything there.
