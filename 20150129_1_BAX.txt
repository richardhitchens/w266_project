Robert L. Parkinson
Thanks Mary Kay. Good morning. Thank you all for calling in. 2014 was a great year for our company and I'm very
pleased with our achievements and progress we've made from a financial, operational, scientific and strategic
perspective. First, we were successful in meeting or exceeding our financial objectives with accelerated growth in sales,
solid earnings and significant cash flow and we've consistently executed a disciplined capital allocation strategy that
balances reinvestment in the business with returning value to shareholders in the form of increased dividends and share
repurchases.
Positive momentum continues to build across the commercial franchises as we extend our global reach with the core
portfolio, enhance care with the introduction of several new products and positioned both businesses for sustained
success. We're balancing this with investments in commercial and operational excellence as well as manufacturing
capacity to improve our competitive position and support the solid underlying fundamentals and future demand that we
perceive for Baxter's products and therapies across the globe.
We're also transforming innovation and advancing the pipeline with the achievement of significant clinical and
regulatory milestones while expanding the portfolio through acquisitions and collaborations. And most notably in 2014,
we reached a significant milestone in Baxter's history as we remain committed to driving long-term value for
shareholders with the creation of two independent publicly traded companies in mid 2015, providing investors with two
unique and compelling investment opportunities.
Before turning the call over to Bob Hombach for a discussion of the financial results and future outlook, let me take
just a few minutes to reflect on a number of achievements from the past year.
First, strong sales performance reflects our strategic focus on improving access and treatment standards, broadening our
global presence while investing to support future growth. Baxter's worldwide revenues totaled $16.7 billion in 2014,
advancing 11% or 5% excluding Gambro and foreign exchange. International sales representing nearly 60% of Baxter's
total revenues were augmented by significant growth in emerging markets, with sales in the BRIC countries advancing
by more than 15%.
Continued emerging market penetration represents a significant opportunity for both businesses going forward, as
many products and therapies remain underpenetrated, diagnosed or treated. For example, in Medical Products we
continue to drive global penetration for higher margin specialty products including those from biosurgery and nutrition
franchises with the expanded launches of FLOSEAL in Japan, HEMOPATCH in Europe and our proprietary triple
chamber nutritional containers in several new markets like China, Brazil, Australia and France.
To address strong demand across our hospital products and renal portfolio, we announced plans to invest approximately
$600 million to expand capacity and enhance production capabilities in several key markets and product areas
representing some of the greatest opportunities for future growth. These include investments in Asia and at our North
Carolina facility to support production of peritoneal dialysis and intravenous solutions. We're also executing on
expansion plans at our state of the art manufacturing facility in Opelika, Alabama to meet the growing global demand
for dialyzers.
In addition, we've successfully executed on the integration of Gambro, achieving the commercial and cost benefits that
we anticipated and further extending our global reach with a comprehensive renal therapies portfolio.
In BioScience, we're building upon our global leadership position in hemophilia as evidenced by our strong double
digit revenue growth for 2014. Highlights for this franchise include supporting rising standards of care for
approximately 100,000 patients, more than a quarter of the world's hemophilia A patients in key markets like the UK,
Australia, Brazil, Russia and China with recent product approvals, launches and multi-year tender awards. Second,
driving personalized care with the launch of BAXJECT III reconstitution system and myPKFiT in Europe, Canada and
Japan. And thirdly, the European regulatory approval of the new manufacturing facility in Singapore for the production
recombinant proteins including ADVATE and eventually BAX 855.

Within our biotherapeutics franchise, we remain committed to meeting patient needs by enhancing our plasma
manufacturing footprint in a flexible and cost-efficient manner. We've increased capacity at our Los Angeles and
Vienna, Austria, plasma fractionation facilities. We're investing in a new state of the art facility in Covington, Georgia,
and we're making progress with the Sanguin collaboration. These efforts have led to improved growth throughout 2014,
capping the year off with strong double digit growth for this franchise during the fourth quarter.
As you know, we've significantly ramped up R&D over the last several years and are now beginning to realize the
benefits. In 2014, the company received regulatory approval for almost a dozen new products and therapies. We also
announced an array of significant pipeline achievements and advanced many of our R&D collaborations with partners.
In Medical Products, we obtained 510(k) clearance for the next generation SIGMA Spectrum Infusion pump in the
United States and further advanced development of AMIA and HomeChoice Claria, our latest automated PD systems
for the US and European markets.
In BioScience, we received FDA approval of several key therapies including HyQvia, which we launched in the United
States in the fourth quarter. HyQvia is a transformational subcutaneous treatment for adult patients with primary
immunodeficiency. Our launch is progressing well with more than 400 physicians currently prescribing the therapy.
We were granted FDA approval for OBIZUR, a treatment for patients with acquired hemophilia A, a very rare and
potentially life-threatening acute bleeding disorder, as well as the pediatric indication for RIXUBIS for the treatment of
hemophilia B. In addition, we recently received European approval for RIXUBIS for both pediatric and adult patients.
During 2014 we achieved several regulatory milestones, including positive top line results from the Phase 3 pivotal
clinical trial of BAX 855, an extended half-life recombinant Factor VIII treatment for hemophilia A based on
ADVATE. We also met the primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase 3 study of BAX 111, the first standalone
recombinant treatment for von Willebrand disease. And late last year, we successfully completed the FDA regulatory
submissions for both Bax 855 and Bax 111 with approvals expected later in 2015.
In addition to our internal R&D accomplishments, we're collaborating with partners to advance R&D programs in new
disease areas which capitalize on our core technical capabilities, expertise and global channel. These collaborations
include the partnership with Coherus Biosciences and the initiation of two Phase 3 trials for an investigational
etanercept biosimilar in rheumatoid arthritis and chronic plaque psoriasis and advancement of pivotal trials for
pacritinib with our partner CTI BioPharma. Pacritinib is a novel oral JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor for patients with
myelofibrosis, a chronic malignant bone marrow disorder and we expect clinical trials results for PERSIST-1 later in
the first quarter of 2015.
In 2014 we augmented internal development programs with select acquisitions and new collaborations. Within Medical
Products, we entered an exclusive agreement with Rockwell Medical for their leading hemodialysis concentrates in
select markets, which enhances Baxter's comprehensive range of therapeutic options across home, in-center and
hospital settings for patients with end-stage renal disease. And earlier this year, we acquired ICNet, a global leader in
surveillance and case management software used in hospitals, which builds on Baxter's unique expertise in hospital
pharmacy operations.
In BioScience, the organization continues to enhance its focus on specific disease areas centered on its expertise in
hematology, oncology and immunology as well as through technology platforms including gene therapy and
biosimilars. During 2014, we bolstered the portfolio with acquisitions like AesRx and Chatham Therapeutics and
extended our collaboration with Xenetic Biosciences. The AesRx acquisition expands our reach in hematology with
BAX 555, an investigational oral prophylactic treatment being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial for patients with
sickle cell anemia.
With Chatham Therapeutics acquisition, we obtained their development gene therapy preclinical hemophilia A and
ongoing hemophilia B program which is currently in a Phase 1/2 trial. This approach has the potential to redefine the
concept of longer acting therapy and we plan to share additional data on this program at the European Association for
Haemophilia and Allied Disorders in Helsinki in February.

The exclusive agreement with Xenetic Biosciences is a partnership for the development of BAX 826, an extended
half-life recombinant Factor VIII therapy for hemophilia A. BAX 826 is currently in preclinical development as a
treatment that may be administered less frequently, potentially at once weekly intervals without compromising efficacy.
Also in BioScience, we're building on the strategic decision to expand our presence in the area of hematology and
oncology, leveraging our heritage of success in developing new therapies that treat unmet medical needs for patients
with rare diseases. We now have several oncology assets, including our most advanced asset, MM-398 for pancreatic
cancer, which will be submitted for approval in markets outside the US and Taiwan in 2015, as well as pacritinib
mentioned earlier. Each of these new therapies offers the potential for numerous additional indications for patients with
a variety of hematologic and solid malignancies.
In summary, our core portfolio remains strong and we continue to benefit from our focus on life saving therapies along
with strong global channels that provide a platform for ongoing geographic expansion and growth. We're investing for
the future to enhance our commercial, operational and scientific effectiveness. Our pipeline remains robust and we've
accelerated the pace of business development with opportunities that are aligned with our core strengths. And we're
committed to overcoming the challenges presented by the external economic environment while enhancing value
through improved performance and execution.
So with that, let me now turn the call over to Bob Hombach for a discussion on our 2014 financial results and outlook.
And when Bob concludes his commentary, I'll provide an update on the spinoff of our biopharmaceuticals business
before opening up the call for Q&A. Bob?
Robert J. Hombach
Thanks Bob, and good morning everyone. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased
2% in the fourth quarter to $1.34, which exceeded our previously issued guidance range of $1.30 to $1.33 per share.
These results reflect strong revenue growth across several key franchises and continued investments in operations and
research and development.
As we mentioned in the press release, GAAP earnings of $1.74 per diluted share reflects both earnings and an after-tax
gain from the recently divested vaccines franchise totaling $429 million or $0.78 per diluted share. In addition, our
GAAP results reflect after-tax special items totaling $209 million or $0.38 per diluted share for intangible amortization,
costs associated with business development and contingent milestone payments, integration of the company's
acquisition of Gambro AB and Baxter's planned separation.
Now, let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to the financial outlook for 2015. Starting
with sales, worldwide sales of approximately $4.5 billion advanced 3% on a reported basis. On a constant currency
basis, sales increased 7%, reflecting a sequential improvement in growth over the last four quarters from an organic
perspective. This growth also favorably compares to our guidance for the quarter of approximately 3%.
Each product category contributed to the overachievement, with particular strength coming from the hemophilia
franchise driven by ADVATE and FEIBA, and strong US performance across the Medical Products portfolio.
Sales in the US increased 6% and international sales excluding foreign currency increased 7%. As Bob mentioned,
sales in emerging markets were strong, advancing by more than 15% in the quarter with robust growth in the BRIC
markets driven by hemophilia sales in Brazil and the timing of tenders as expected. For the full year, worldwide sales
of nearly $16.7 billion advanced 11% on a reported basis or 13% on a constant currency basis.
Baxter sales for the full year increased 5% on a constant currency basis when excluding Gambro revenues from both
periods. Gambro sales were $1.6 billion in 2014 compared to $513 million in 2013.
In terms of individual business performance, global BioScience sales totaled approximately $1.9 billion in the quarter
and advanced 9% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, BioScience sales increased 12%, reflecting the
highest quarterly growth in the last five years. For the full year, global BioScience sales advanced 7% to $6.7 billion.

After adjusting for foreign currency, sales grew 8%, significantly exceeding our original expectation of sales growth in
the 3% to 4% range for 2014.
Within the product categories, hemophilia sales in the fourth quarter of approximately $1.1 billion increased 9% on a
reported basis and excluding foreign currency, sales advanced 13%. While sales in the US were strong, up 8%,
international sales grew 16% on a constant currency basis. As mentioned in Bob's opening remarks, international
penetration remains a significant opportunity for our company, as hemophilia is a disease that remains tremendously
under-diagnosed and under-treated around the world. As the established global leader, Baxter today derives
approximately 60% of total hemophilia sales from outside the US in more than 60 countries worldwide.
In addition, in the quarter we achieved a record level of ADVATE sales with a fifth consecutive quarter of double digit
growth. This was the result of strong global demand, prophy conversions, benefits from recent tender wins in the UK
and Australia and conversions of recombinant therapy in Brazil. For the year, sales in Brazil totaled more than $100
million, in line with our expectations and to date we have converted approximately 40% of the estimated 10,000
hemophilia A patients in the country.
In the US where we face new competition, our recombinant Factor VIII sales outpaced market growth. In fact for 2014,
we've enhanced our overall Factor VIII unit share position despite a more competitive environment and modest patient
losses.
We're also pleased that growth in our hemophilia franchise was further augmented by the launch of several new
products and indications including double digit growth of FEIBA for the treatment of hemophilia patients with
inhibitors, as well as contribution from RIXUBIS, a Factor IX treatment for hemophilia B patients and the recent
launch of OBIZUR for acquired hemophilia.
In biotherapeutics, sales of $628 million increased 11% on a reported basis. Sales increased 14% on a constant currency
basis driven by robust demand, particularly for immunoglobulin therapies and albumin. Throughout 2014, we enhanced
our overall supply of plasma therapies, as we successfully executed to increase capacity across our manufacturing
network. We are now in a position to support ongoing growth in demand of at least 8% going forward.
A significant achievement in the fourth quarter was the launch of HyQvia in the US. This is a transformational therapy
with an attractive value proposition for patients, physicians and payers. For 2014, Baxter successfully increased global
SubQ penetration, including US HyQvia sales in the fourth quarter of $35 million, which primarily reflects the impact
of initial stocking orders by customers and the favorable reception of the product in the marketplace.
In biosurgery, sales of $197 million grew 2%. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 4% driven by increased
penetration of surgical sealants despite modest growth in surgical procedures and some competitive pricing pressures.
As you may recall, the biosurgery business will be reported in the Medical Products business going forward.
In Medical Products, global sales of approximately $2.6 billion were comparable to the prior year, and on a constant
currency basis sales increased 3%. For the full year, Medical Products sales rose 15% to approximate $10 billion and
on a constant currency basis, sales growth was 16%. After adjusting for Gambro in both periods, Medical Products
sales in 2014 increased 4% on a constant currency basis.
Within the product categories, renal sales in the quarter were approximately $1.1 billion, reflecting a decline of 2% on a
reported basis. Excluding foreign currency, sales grew 3% driven by solid PD patient gains in the US and emerging
markets, and improved performance from the Gambro HD business. For the year, Gambro sales were in line with our
expectations and exceeded $1.6 billion, an increase of approximately 2% on an organic basis.
While sales in the first half of 2014 were comparable to the prior year, we are encouraged with the acceleration of sales
to mid single digits in the second half of 2014, driven primarily by mid teens growth of the acute care business and
improved dialyzer sales. Within the fluid systems category, sales of $822 million were comparable to the prior-year
period and on a constant currency basis sales grew 2%. Performance was driven by favorable demand for IV therapies
as well as increased sales of cyclophosphamide which collectively more than offset lower sales of infusion pumps.

As you may know, a new competitor recently entered the US market for cyclophosphamide, and we continue to expect
additional competitors in the coming months. For your reference, full year 2014 US cyclophosphamide sales totaled
approximately $450 million.
Specialty pharmaceuticals, which includes our inhaled anesthetics and nutritional therapies, posted sales of $417
million in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 2%. Sales rose 6% on a constant currency basis as we continue to
penetrate international markets with our higher margin anesthesia portfolio and achieved strong growth in our US
nutrition business with improved sales of vitamins and lipids, which were constrained last year.
Finally, sales in BioPharma Solutions, which is our pharma partnering business, totaled $271 million, increasing 1% on
a reported basis or 4% on a constant currency basis. Performance can be attributed primarily to increased demand from
our contract manufacturing partners and strong hospital pharmacy compounding revenues.
Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin in the quarter was 50.3% compared to 50.4% last year. Positive mix in
BioScience and select pricing improvements across the portfolio were more than offset by the impact of foreign
currency as well as expedited freight for PD solutions, ongoing manufacturing inefficiencies and investments we are
making to enhance operational capabilities and advance our quality systems and processes. For the full year, the gross
margin of 50.4% was in line with our guidance.
SG&A totaled $970 million and increased 4%, driven by planned investments in promotional and marketing initiatives
for new product launches in BioScience and incremental customer freight and logistical expenses to support the strong
demand for IV solutions.
R&D spending in the quarter of $305 million increased 6% versus the prior year, driven by the addition of new R&D
programs in BioScience through acquisitions, the acceleration of other programs in the areas of hematology, oncology
and immunology, and investments in renal therapies aimed at improving patient outcomes across the continuum of
care.
Interest expense was $29 million in the fourth quarter compared to $41 million last year as we benefited from recent
debt maturities and income generated from a change in the mix of floating versus fixed interest rates. Other expense
totaled $25 million and was driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange on balance sheet positions.
The tax rate was 20.5% for the quarter, bringing the full year tax rate to 21.7%, in line with our expectations. And as
previously mentioned, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 2% to $1.34 and for the
full year 2014, earnings per diluted share of $4.90 exceeded our guidance range.
Turning to cash flow. For 2014, cash flow from operations was very strong and totaled more than $3.2 billion.
Excluding cash costs associated with the spinoff of the biopharmaceutical business, we generated $3.3 billion in cash
flow from operations. Capital expenditures totaled $1.9 billion for the year, reflecting investments in manufacturing
capacity to support future demand and growth across the portfolio.
DSO ended the quarter at 52 days and excluding Gambro, Baxter's DSO was 50 days, lower than the prior year by more
than 2 days. Inventory turns of 2.4 are lower than the prior-year period by 0.3 days driven by the impact of new product
launches and enhanced inventories in our plasma business.
And lastly in 2014, the company repurchased approximately 7.8 million shares for $550 million, or on a net basis 1.3
million shares for $206 million.
Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing some information on the financial outlook and
assumptions affecting our performance in 2015. As I previously mentioned, given the complexities of a mid-year spin,
we're not in a position today to provide full-year guidance for Baxter and Baxalta. As we move into the second quarter
of 2015, Baxter will likely begin reporting Baxalta as a discontinued operation, and at our investor conferences in May,
each company will provide additional information on their financial profile and outlook.
Today, we will provide investors with some relevant information on several key discrete challenges we expect to face
in 2015.

First, given significant volatility in foreign currency rates particularly in emerging markets and more recently the euro,
we expect a full-year impact of approximately $0.40 per diluted share related to foreign exchange. Given the timing of
currency movements, the impact of our hedging strategies and our geographic mix, the majority of this impact is
expected to occur in the second half 2015.
Second, with interest rates much lower as we exited 2014, pension expense will be a headwind of approximately $0.10
per diluted share for the year.
Third, given the assumption that we will experience additional competition for cyclophosphamide throughout 2015, we
are assuming a full-year impact of approximately $0.40 per diluted share.
And lastly, as previously mentioned, we are incurring additional costs that reflect manufacturing inefficiencies and
investments to enhance operational capabilities, creating an additional headwind in the first quarter of approximately
$0.10 per diluted share. As we move into the second half of 2015, we expect these costs to stabilize as we begin to
anniversary these impacts.
Let me take a few moments to provide full-year sales guidance for the two businesses and the major product categories
for 2015. Recall that given the spin, we have taken the opportunity to step back and look at our organizational structure
to ensure that we're best positioned to successfully operate two standalone companies. Therefore, we are moving to a
new reporting configuration that is aligned with the respective internal organizations and are providing guidance in this
new format this morning.
For your convenience, we've posted the historical restated sales including 2014 by quarter to the Investor Relations
section of our website. Beginning with the new Baxter franchises on a constant currency basis, we expect sales to be
comparable to 2014. Excluding cyclophosphamide in both years, underlying growth will be approximately 3%.
Specifically, we expect sales in our renal franchise, which includes our leading peritoneal and hemodialysis products to
grow in the 4% to 5% range. We expect fluid systems sales to grow in the 2% to 3% range. This franchise includes our
IV therapies, infusion pumps, and associated disposables.
We expect sales of our surgical care franchise to grow in the 4% to 5% range. This franchise includes anesthesia and
biosurgery products. We expect the integrated pharmacy solutions sales to decline approximately 10%. This franchise
includes injectable drugs like cyclophosphamide as well as our nutritional therapies and hospital pharmacy
compounding business. Excluding the impact of cyclophosphamide of approximately $300 million, growth is expected
to be in the low single digits.
And finally we expect the other category to decline approximately 15%. This category primarily includes our
third-party manufacturing business which will be impacted by a major customer electing to self manufacture products
previously manufactured by Baxter.
For Baxalta, we project sales growth excluding foreign currency of approximately 3% to 4%. Our outlook includes
growth in the hemophilia franchise of 0% to 2%. This includes sales of our recombinant and plasma-derived
hemophilia therapies including ADVATE, RIXUBIS and other treatments for Factor VIII and Factor IX deficiencies.
Growth will be fueled by new product launches and strong international demand, which will be somewhat offset by
anticipated high single digit share loss in the US due to increased competition.
We expect growth in the inhibitors category to be in the 6% to 8% range driven by further penetration in growth of
FEIBA for the treatment of inhibitors and the launch of OBIZUR for the treatment of acquired hemophilia. The
immunoglobulin therapies, which includes our antibody replacement treatments, we expect growth of 6% to 8% driven
by strong market demand and the contribution from HyQvia. And finally for biotherapeutics, which includes
plasma-derived therapies like albumin and treatments for Alpha-1 deficiencies among others, we expect to grow in the
2% to 4% range.
Now turning to the first quarter, we expect adjusted earnings excluding special items of $0.85 to $0.90 per diluted
share, reflecting the headwinds just mentioned. It is important to note however, that this guidance does not reflect any
incremental costs or dis-synergies associated with the spinoff of the biopharmaceutical business as these costs will

begin to be layered in throughout the second quarter.
Now in terms of the P&L by line item, we expect first quarter sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency of
2% to 3%. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sale to decline 3% to 4%. By business on a constant
currency basis, we expect Medical Products sales growth of 1% to 2% and BioScience sales to grow 4% to 5%.
In the first quarter we expect gross margin for the company to decline by approximately 250 to 350 basis points versus
the fourth quarter of last year of 50.4%. This reflects the impact of increased manufacturing costs which are most
pronounced in the first quarter as well as the impact of cyclophosphamide and pension expense.
We expect SG&A to decline by approximately 5% versus the prior year and R&D to be flat on a reported basis.
Excluding foreign currency impacts, both SG&A and R&D are expected to grow in low single digits. And finally for
the first quarter, we expect interest expense to total approximately $35 million, no impact from other income versus
gains we recorded in the prior year and we expect a tax rate of approximately 22% with an average share count of
approximately 547 million shares.
This concludes my prepared remarks this morning. We look forward to providing more financial information to you in
the near future. In the meantime, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bob for his closing comments.
Robert L. Parkinson
Thanks, Bob. Let me end our prepared comments this morning with a brief update on the anticipated spinoff of our
biopharmaceuticals business. Our organization has been fully engaged in separation activities since the announcement
that we made last March and we're energized by the prospects of separating Baxter into two leading global healthcare
companies, one focused on developing and marketing innovative biopharmaceuticals and the other on life saving
medical products. This decision supports Baxter's evolution and underscores our commitment to ensuring long-term
strategic priorities remain aligned with shareholders' best interests while creating value for patients, healthcare
providers and other key stakeholders.
The two businesses operate in distinct markets with corresponding underlying fundamentals and each possesses unique
and compelling growth prospects, investment requirements and risk profiles. The spinoff will create two
well-capitalized independent companies with strong balance sheets, investment grade profiles and disciplined
approaches to capital allocation. The spin will also provide greater management focus, the ability to more effectively
commercialize new and existing product offerings to drive innovation and enhance our flexibility to pursue respective
growth and investment strategies. This will result in revenue acceleration, improved profitability and enhanced returns
for shareholders.
During 2014, we named our senior leadership teams for both companies, established the international and commercial
structures for both organizations, formally unveiled Baxalta Incorporated as the name of the new publicly traded
biopharmaceutical company, and filed a preliminary Form 10 with the SEC for Baxalta. While we continue to work
through the complexities, this process is unfolding in line with our expectations and we continue on track toward a mid
2015 completion.
We recently announced that we'll be hosting an investor conference in New York City on the afternoon of May 18 for
Baxter International and on the morning of May 19 for Baxalta Incorporated. At these conferences, we'll introduce you
to the new senior management teams and provide investors with more information regarding the strategies, growth
prospects, capital structure and financial outlooks for each company. We'll also engage in a comprehensive investor
relations effort, including investor road shows for both companies with their respective senior management teams
several weeks before the spinoff is completed.
In closing, while 2015 will be a challenging year, momentum in the core business is building and we remain excited
about our future prospects and we're poised for improved performance in 2016 and beyond. As we chart distinct and
unique paths forward as separate global healthcare leaders we look forward to unlocking value for shareholders,
partners, employees and the patients and healthcare providers that we serve.

As always, I'll be happy to take any questions on these or other topics during the Q&A. So with that, I'd now like to
open up the call to your questions, if we might.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to remind
participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter International's website
for 30 days at www.baxter.com. Our first question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Your question
please.
<Q - Brittany Henderson>: Hi guys this is Brittany Henderson in for Kristen. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Okay.
<Q - Brittany Henderson>: I just wanted to kind of get more clarity as we think about 2015. How should we just think
about the incremental standalone costs versus kind of the stranded costs associated with the Baxalta spin ?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Okay. Well, we're still working – as we've mentioned, we're still working through the
details around that. We've talked about initial dis-synergies of approximately $300 million or approximately 2% of
Baxter's current sales. Interestingly enough, almost half of that is going to relate to IT-related costs and we will be
working towards separating the IT infrastructure over time. But that is one of the longer lead time items. So that is
actually a difficult thing to break out at this point. Our initial estimate was a little bit heavier towards Baxalta in terms
of dis-synergies, but a fair amount of stranded costs for new Baxter given again some of this IT overlap for some period
of time. But at this point, still working through those details. That's part of what we look to address in the May investor
conference; for each of the two companies we'll lay out the financial outlooks.
<Q - Brittany Henderson>: Okay. Thank you. And just a quick follow up. How should we think about SUPRANE in
2015? What are the assumptions for competition there?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: This is Bob Parkinson, Brittany. We anticipate SUPRANE is going to continue to grow
in 2015. Having said that, we also anticipate that we may get generic competition in various markets around the world,
although as we sit here today, it's not evident when or if or who that will be. I will tell you that it continues to be
promotionally sensitive in many markets around the world. So longer term we view the anesthesia franchise with
SUPRANE as a foundation product as a growth vehicle not only in 2015 but frankly over our LRP.
<Q - Brittany Henderson>: Okay. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - James Francescone>: Hey, this is actually James in for David. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Okay, James. Go ahead.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Hey James.
<Q - James Francescone>: I just wanted to get a quick sense from you, the first quarter earnings guidance of $0.85 to
$0.90, how representative do think that is of where the business stands from a profitability or earnings power basis
today? On the one hand obviously you've got some idiosyncratic headwinds from quality spending that are going to

fade through the year, but on the other hand, it seems as if FX and any potential ADVATE competitive impact would
get greater through the year. So is 1Q kind of a reasonable representation of where the business stands today, or is it
[ph] wrong? (39:23)
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: As we've looked at the situation, there are clearly some things in Q1 that are more
pronounced. The $0.10 in manufacturing clearly is something that is very much front-end loaded. Overall
manufacturing, just to give you a sense, is definitely a meaningful headwind in the first half of the year but a slight
tailwind in the back half of the year. And so that clearly is not representative of what the ongoing situation is with the
company. FX and cyclo are clearly meaningful headwinds here, both around $0.40. They will be somewhat back-end
loaded, particularly FX. We're very well hedged in the first half of the year on the euro and a few other key currencies.
But again as we've been highlighting for six months, the emerging market depreciation in currencies that happened in
the back half of 2014 is still very much there and we're much more exposed as well. So Q1 I would say is definitely not
representative, and as a general matter from a seasonality standpoint, it's usually by far our lowest quarter from an
earnings perspective in any given year.
<Q - James Francescone>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just second, any help that you could give us on hemophilia
guidance. Obviously you've done very well in that business, strong double digits or double digits at a minimum for the
past several quarters decelerating to 0% to 2% next year. Clearly there's some competitive impact there, but how do
you think about balancing the US competitive impact versus the continued strength internationally?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Well this is Ludwig, James. First of all, the hemophilia team is doing a great job as you
see from the numbers. We will continue to grow at a faster than market internationally. So internationally, we'll see
positive growth. In the US as Bob was alluding to, our guidance of high single digit market share loss between from the
Biogen launch to 855's launch is still our guidance. This will result in a negative growth in the US. With respect to our
sales guidance, as we said hemophilia, this the base business only. It's 0% to 2% for the year. We have a separate sales
guidance for the inhibitor market. Our business will continue to grow 6% to 8%. So overall when you take the two
together, we're talking about low single digits of market, low single-digit growth.
<Q - James Francescone>: Very helpful. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Thank you. Bob, Bob and Mary Kay, good morning.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: And you.
<Q - David H. Roman>: I wanted just to start on HyQvia which, Bob, you gave some disclosure in your prepared
remarks. I think you said that there are 400 prescribers as of now. Could you maybe just go into a little bit more detail
on the launch? Was that the US or a global number and how are things going thus far domestically?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Yes David, I'll let Ludwig address that. Go ahead, Ludwig.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Yes. Thanks. So we're very pleased with the launch in the US. The 400 number that we
gave you is the US number only. So the interest is very high. We have a value proposition for the patient as well as for
the payer. The value proposition for the patient clearly is a SubQ once a month with one needle.
From a payer perspective, although we take a price premium of about 30%, overall the cost of the treatment is still a
favorable number. Overall cost we think about 10% less because of the higher viability that we have with HyQvia
versus SubQ. So overall it's a very strong proposition for all of our key stakeholders. Our objective is that HyQvia will
become a leadership brand within the PI market long term. With respect to our 2015 guidance, you saw 6% to 8% for
IG. We think that HyQvia will be about $100 million for 2015.

<Q - David H. Roman>: That's very helpful. Thank you for the additional information there. And then maybe
secondly, just broadly on the US business, I think this was one of the better quarters you've had domestically in quite
some time, particularly on some of the more volume exposed or Medical Products businesses. Can you maybe just talk
through some of the underlying dynamics in the US? What really got better this quarter? And your guidance does not
seem to suggest that that's sustainable, but why would that be the case?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: With respect to hemophilia and when I think about ADVATE 2014 as well as the fourth
quarter, we've seen an impact of 1 to 2 market share points from the Biogen launch over last six months. However,
when you take all the different pieces of the puzzle together here, the positive contribution of the prophy conversion
that we have, more than 650 patients that converted to ADVATE prophy. So that positive contribution in addition to
the weight gain contribution more than offset the share loss. So that's the dynamic that we have and that's the reason
why we are growing faster than the market. Then our projection for 2015, we will continue as we said, we're on track
for a high single digit market share loss for the year, but we will not only have a Biogen competition. Our assumption is
that we also have new entries in the short-acting Factor VIII market segment.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yes and David, I would just add that given the momentum we've seen the last couple of
quarters, we are sticking with our original assumption here of the high single digit market share loss, but that may
prove to be conservative.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Understood. I guess I was asking more broadly about your US franchises across the board. I
think if I look at the biosurgery business, that did better. You had nice momentum in things like the specialty areas.
Why wouldn't that continue in 2015?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Bob Parkinson here, David. Yes, I think in many of those areas it will continue in 2015. I
think we're seeing a little more stability in the market in terms of hospital procedures and hospital activity compared to
what it was earlier, which is encouraging. We're also managing out of some of the supply constraints that we incurred
earlier in the year and got in a much better position in the fourth quarter on both IV solutions in PD solutions and we're
bringing some more capacity online in 2015. So I think the underlying fundamentals, whether it's the IV fluid systems
business, whether it's parenteral nutrition, biosurgery as you mentioned, anesthesia. And again, we'll expand on this
when we get together at the investor conference and so on, but I think each of these product segments, these are never
going to be double digit growers, but they're going to be solid single digit growers and we'll provide some more color
on that when we get together in May.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: David I think, just to add, it's Mary Kay. I would just say the decline in cyclo and in the
other category are really predominantly what's driving the US performance to where it is in 2015.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: And offsetting the strength in the other areas that I commented on.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Correct. That's correct.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: So you get some pretty large netting effects there as you know.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. That's really helpful. Okay. We'll look forward to more detail in May.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Thanks for taking the question and very nice quarter, guys. Let me just, I want to circle
back to the first quarter guidance because that's what I'm getting the most questions on. So the $0.10 that you're calling
out that's kind of the manufacturing impact, the quality upgrade, how much of that do you want us to think is ongoing

versus one time?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Well as I mentioned, we will see on a year-over-year basis a meaningful improvement in
the back half of the year. The nature of these are partly due to capacity expansion and the timing of that which will
come online in the first half of 2015, so that will certainly alleviate the need for some of the expedited freight and the
incremental logistical costs that we've been incurring. Other aspects of the process modifications that we're working
through will take a little bit more time to work down as we work down the cost curve on that. These are
well-established processes that we've been manufacturing PD and IV solutions for decades, so it will take a little bit of
time. So I would say a meaningful portion in the back half. Some will linger into 2016.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay, so if we think about just the $0.85 to $0.90 as starting point and recognizing the
first quarter is historically like 22% to 23% of a year's earnings, so it's not a best representation.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Right.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: But you still have in front of you the full impact of generic cyclo. It sounds like you're
assuming the front-end part but not the whole part, so there's still a little bit of a tail there. And then obviously you've
got the, call it $0.45 of dis-synergies from the split of the two companies. Is that the right way to think about it in terms
of what's still in front of you in terms of the EPS headwinds that we won't see in the first quarter, but we'll still see at
some later date?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Well as it relates to cyclophosphamide, we do anticipate a pretty meaningful impact here
in the first quarter. It won't be one fourth of a year, but it will be meaningful and certainly in the first quarter we expect
a meaningful impact and in the first half, almost half of the full year impact we expect to see. As you know when
generics come in, the pricing volume dynamics start to play out pretty quickly. So that is fairly representative of what
the full year is going to look like.
As it relates to the synergies estimate, again we won't really see those in the P&L in any meaningful way until the back
half of 2015. The initial estimate is around $300 million, but both of the two companies are going to get busy as
quickly as possible post, and to start working those down. So how that plays into what a full year 2016 is going to look
like, I don't anticipate that's going to be $300 million. I think it's going to be lower and that will be part of what we lay
out in the May timeframe.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Perfect. Thank you, guys.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Thanks Mike.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is now open.
<Q - Lawrence S. Keusch>: Yes, hi. Good morning. Bob, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the outlook
for Brazil in 2015. You obviously did as you anticipated for this year and achieved over $100 million in sales. But talk
a little bit about what has to continue to happen on the conversions and where you think you are as you go towards that
I think $200 million-ish target.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Why don't you take that one.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Yes, so we gave you a target of $200 million. Clearly we're on track to achieve that over
time. As far as the market is concerned, there are about 10,000 hemophilia A patients in Brazil. We have now
converted more than 4,000 patients. As we convert from plasma to recombinant, we also convert those patients from
on-demand to prophy, and our penetration of prophy in those patients is about close to 70%. So we still have a long
way to go and that's where the additional $100 million opportunity is coming from. 2015 will be the next step in the
journey that is going to take longer than two years to get to the 100% conversion.

<Q - Lawrence S. Keusch>: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess for Bob Parkinson, one thing that you've talked
about is potential opportunities to establish other public-private relationships such as the Brazil hemophilia agreement.
Could you provide any thoughts on do you think that's still viable in other either geographies or other product
categories, and when we may see something transpiring?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Yes, I think it's, Larry, I think it's going to be an increasing opportunity actually for both
companies and both businesses because I think governments are going to be thrust in a position to kind of embrace new
paradigms in terms of how they manage healthcare costs. And I think inevitably it's going to involve collaborations
with suppliers, certainly leading suppliers in ways of doing business going forward that are different. So obviously the
Hemobrás collaboration in Brazil on hemophilia has been well discussed and everybody understands that.
But I mean we're building a new solutions plant in Thailand to manufacture PD solutions which was a direct result of
us working with the Thai government to establish from a policy point of view peritoneal dialysis as the therapy of
choice, not hemodialysis, largely because it's lower cost. It saves the government money and in the process we're
making investments, we're creating jobs in Thailand. China is another good example where we've got a program that
we refer to or describe internally as the Flying Angels Project, which has really been another example of a great
collaboration that's driving adoption of PD therapy.
And I know Ludwig and his team continue to have discussions on various fronts as does new Bax. So I just think this is
going to be a new way of doing business going forward and I would anticipate in the coming years both companies will
do more of these kinds of collaborations.
<Q - Lawrence S. Keusch>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Derrick Sung of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask a little bit about if you could help us
think about the capital structure of the two split businesses moving forward. Can you give us a sense for how we should
think about we'll get these split evenly amongst the companies? And in terms of the dividend, how should we think
about high-level dividend profile of the two businesses?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Derrick, this is Bob Hombach. As we've been saying, we're going to give the whole
financial picture for both organizations, the financial outlook for sales, for earnings, CapEx spend and capital structure
including capital allocation assumptions in the May timeframe. A lot to work through as we work through the
separation here and that is obviously a very key aspect of this. We do believe both companies are going to generate
significant cash flow going forward and will have a significant amount of flexibility to be disciplined about capital
allocation and to think about returning significant value to shareholders as we've been doing in the past, but also
continue to reinvest in the businesses to support future growth. So we'll lay all that out in the May timeframe.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Okay. Thanks. Well maybe then focusing a bit on Baxter, the Medical Products business for I
guess either of the Bobs. You've talked a bit about the potential for a margin expansion opportunity coming up with a
relatively lower margin relative to your peers. Could you help us think a little bit more about does that margin
expansion come primarily from mix shift? Or is it, we understand the Gambro piece to it but beyond Gambro, where
does that primarily come from and kind of how do we get there?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Yes Derrick, Bob Parkinson here. Let me spend a couple of minutes responding to that.
First of all, the comment about our returns being lower than peers, I think everybody understands one of the reasons for
that it is we are in very logistics-intensive businesses. Shipping IV solutions and PD solutions is expensive, so we have
a freight distribution line on our P&L which is inherent in those businesses as opposed to let's say traditional medical
device or hospital supply businesses.

Now having said that, what we will show you at the investor conference in May is a steady improvement over the LRP
and operating margins that are very achievable and I think will be significant as well. And they really emanate from a
series of things. I'll just touch on a few in the interest of time.
We clearly are going to increase our focus in investment and what I'll call higher margin, higher growth product
categories, things like anesthesia, biosurgery, parenteral nutrition, the CRRT business in the hospital setting. These are
all businesses today that range between $0.5 billion and $1 billion that are promotion sensitive, have prospect for
higher growth and are higher margin, so would represent a mix upgrade.
Also, we're very excited about re-engagement, if you will, in the infusion pump business with the approval of the
SIGMA Spectrum version 8. We'll be rolling that out in 2015 in the US. We effectively have been out of the infusion
pump business for a number of years. And there's been a lot of margin that's been lost attendant with share loss with –
starting with the Colleague things and so on. So we're on the cusp of being able to get that back.
Also our new product flow in new Bax, and again we'll get into this in detail in May, but VIVIA home hemodialysis;
AMIA, the next generation home PD solution; [ph] Prismatch (57:18) which is a next generation CRRT. We have a
program called [ph] Project Carerra (57:18) internally which is an array of premixed drugs that we'll be developing and
bringing to the market in our proprietary GALAXY technology. These are all very exciting growth opportunities and
new product opportunities, but all of which represent margins, in some cases that are meaningfully higher than the
overall margin percentage of the business.
Clearly, we still have a lot of synergy to capture from Gambro going forward. It's tracking very well. We've achieved a
lot of that, but there's still meaningful opportunity consistent with our original projections on Gambro synergies, both
cost and commercial synergies. I think you'll see us managing portfolio very aggressively both from a product and
geography point of view. And to be very frank, I think the split-off of the company provides a better line of sight to
really focus on overhead infrastructure costs and so on, and you can anticipate that we're going to do some things in
that regard to be proactive.
So I'll stop there and we'll expand on each of these in detail in May. But each of the things I mentioned are meaningful
and that's why we're pretty confident about our ability to drive meaningful improvement over the long range plan and
beyond.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, Bob.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Thanks. Sam, we have time for two more.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Thank you so much for taking the question. Ludwig, could you just parse in the US
hemophilia guidance for next year how much the high single digits, kind of Eloctate versus more standard competitive
recombinant Factor VIII? And just comment more generally on – basically all the surveys everybody did on the sell
side indicated that Eloctate would be much more impactful than it's proving to be. Does that – and given the changes in
hemophilia that are likely to occur over the next five years or so, does it speak at all to Baxter's competitive advantage
in that space because of the intimacy you have with patients and caregivers? Just any general comments in that regard.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Well it's a good question, thank you. With respect to the surveys, I think my answer would
be we're post the surveys. We have now six months of data, so at this point the surveys are very qualitative but the
quantitative piece comes from actual data. So – but that would be my answer to the survey question.
With respect to the market itself, it's a very sticky market. We've seen this. We see this in Factor VIII. Now when you
look at the market dynamics in IX, it's not much different with the new entrants including RIXUBIS. So the market I
believe will continue to look for the standard treatment because we raised the bar and the bar is very high. The bar is
zero bleeds. And when you look at the clinical data, zero to one is where the ADVATE data comes out and that's a very

high bar. So irrespective of the new technology, we're talking about an efficacy target which is very high.
We do believe that we have a very strong strategy in place, starting from the gold standard ADVATE, moving to 855
which is ADVATE in a [ph] fabricated (61:00) form, two known technologies; moving to 826, which is ADVATE in a
PSA technology. And then leapfrogging maybe those technology with potentially gene therapy. In gene therapy as you
know, we're post proof of clinical concept in hemophilia B. We're going to show that data in a couple of weeks in
Helsinki, but overall we believe that we are in a position of strength to continue to grow this franchise and moving
forward.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: And thanks. And Bob, just talk – could you give us some general comments about your
assessment of the progress of Gambro? I know that PD is growing high single digits, low double digits, thereabouts,
and your guidance for renal, 4% to 5% in 2015. How does Gambro figure into that? Is it tracking as you've hoped in
terms of revenue growth?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Yes, first of all, relative to the synergies, we're tracking very much on target, okay. And
so the numbers that we laid out at the outset will be achieved both in total and the timeframe attendant with that. So
we're pleased with that. In terms of commercial performance, frankly we got off to a little bit of a slow start, but we've
really picked up steam. I think if you look at the first half, second half comps, 2014 versus 2013, you saw the
momentum build in the second half. And I think that's a byproduct of the natural challenges of integrating
organizationally and getting the alignment, the leadership established and so on. But I think we are very much on a
pace to generate revenue growth commensurate with what we messaged at the time of the acquisition. And of course
we look forward to being able to expand dialyzer capacity in 2016 and beyond which is going to be very helpful to
meet more demand.
The other thing I would say, the commercial synergy component of this, now having the full product line gives us a lot
of flexibility. I mentioned in response to one of the earlier questions about public- private partnerships and so on,
managing the costs of providing access to treatment of end-stage renal disease dialysis is a very – that's a big-ticket
item on every healthcare budget for every country around the world. And this is an area where naturally they're going
to look for collaborations in how to partner to manage that. Given our full product offering, I think we're in the best
position to partner with governments to do that as evidenced by the example I gave with the PD first program in
Thailand. So I'm very pleased with the acquisition. There's always fits and starts when you do something of this size
and complexity, but I'm really glad we did the deal and it's going to be a big part of our growth going forward. Bob?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yes, maybe just a clarification, Bruce. We have talked about double digit patient growth
in the US as a result of change in reimbursement. Recall US is less than 20% of global PD sales. So if we look at our
guidance for 2015, mid single digits for the overall renal business, in fact PD and the legacy Gambro business are both
expected to grow in that mid single digit range. So it's comparable.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Perfect. Thanks so much.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: You bet.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Our last question, Sam?
Operator
Thank you. Our final question comes from Chris Hamblett of Cowen. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Chris L. Hamblett>: Thanks for taking the question, guys. Strong quarter. Just one follow up on hemophilia. As
you kind of position gene therapy as the next major potential breakthrough for the longer competitive dynamics in that
market, what do you think you'll need to show in terms of long-term durability and safety to address potential
regulatory concerns there with the gene therapy? And then second, what exactly are you going to show in terms of new
clinical data for BAX 335 in February? And when might the Factor VIII gene therapy be ready for the clinic? I believe
you said later this year, but I wanted to make sure that was correct.

<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Okay. With respect to gene therapy, as I mentioned, we're post proof of concept in
hemophilia B, and so the data that we're going to present in two weeks from now will be individual patient data. What
we will be showing, and I've shared that before, we see sustained levels of factor expression elevated versus the current
treatments. With respect to what is the target level, there is some data with respect to target levels, depend on activity of
the patient. But when you're talking about patients that are active, it might be 20% plus, and yes we are able to achieve
those levels with hemophilia B.
Then with respect to your question on regulatory pathway, that is still a work in progress. My assumption at this
moment is that for every new technology that comes into hemophilia, that it might be a little bit different than the way
that we've developed ADVATE or 855 because there's always going to be more questions with respect to efficacy,
sustainability and the long-term probability. But we'll keep you posted as soon as we got the regulatory input.
And with respect to the timing of gene therapy for hemophilia A, we are planning to start our clinical program in the
next year, so hemophilia B, we're post proof of concept hemophilia A. We're going to take this same technology into
the clinic in about a year from now.
<Q - Chris L. Hamblett>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call with Baxter International. Thank you for
participating. Everyone have a wonderful day.
