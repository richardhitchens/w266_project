MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Time Warner fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. My name is Mike, and I will be your operator for
today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kopelman, you
may begin.
Michael Kopelman
Thanks and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's fourth quarter and full-year earnings conference call.
This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the fourth quarter and full year and the other
providing our 2016 full-year business outlook.
Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on
our website at www.TimeWarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also
included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current
expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various
factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on
Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and in fact expressly

I will now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard
Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler, and
Kevin Tsujihara, will join us for our Q&A session. Jeff?
Jeffrey L. Bewkes
Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everyone, for listening in this morning.
We had another strong year in 2015. Our revenues increased 3% to $28.1 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 19%
to $6.9 billion, and adjusted earnings per share grew 14% to $4.75 a share. That's our seventh consecutive year of
double-digit growth in adjusted EPS, and we've outpaced all of our peers over that time.
We also returned close to $5 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. And our updated $5 billion
share repurchase authorization and our 15% increase in the dividend underscore our commitment to disciplined capital
allocation and continued direct returns to shareholders. It's the same combination of strong execution, continued
investment in our businesses, and disciplined capital allocation that's allowed us to provide superior long-term returns
to shareholders.
As we discussed with you last quarter, the shift to on-demand multi-platform consumption of video content is
accelerating. Consumers increasingly have greater control over where, when, and on what device they watch their
favorite content. And they're responding by spending more time and money watching video than ever. With more
options available, they're also demanding great content be accompanied by a great viewing experience.
And while these shifts present challenges, they also create enormous opportunities. In this environment, we're
convinced that the strongest brands, biggest networks, and the best content will take share. Our strategy was designed
with these shifts in mind, and we're more confident than ever that we are ideally positioned to benefit.
For years we've been investing in the very best video content and using technology to enhance the value of our brands.
With our revenue growth set to accelerate this year, we'll be investing more aggressively not only in content, but also in
new capabilities and digital products to ensure our brands and content are available wherever and however consumers
look for them, and that we can monetize them effectively when they do.
At the same time, we'll continue to take our brands around the world and operate as efficiently as possible to help fund
investments and future growth. Our structure supports this strategy. We've deliberately reshaped the company to focus
on high-quality video businesses with global scale, and are well positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for the
very best video content. The combined scale of our businesses is critical to our ability to take advantage of that growth,
and it's particularly important in distribution and programming, the core of what we do as a company.
The benefits of our strategy and the advantages of our scale and structure were evident in our many successes in 2015.
Let me share a few highlights, starting at our networks, which continued to lead the industry. Turner was the only
programming group with three of the top-10 ad-supported cable networks in primetime among adults 18 to 49. And
TBS finished as the number one entertainment cable network in that demo for the third consecutive year. Our operating
momentum was strongest at CNN and Cartoon Network. In 2015, CNN was the fastest growing top-40 cable network
in the U.S. in its key demo, and Cartoon Network was the only top-three kids network to grow ratings.
And then when it comes to premium content, HBO remained peerless. Its 43 Primetime Emmy awards not only led all
networks for the 14th consecutive year, but was also the most Emmys received in a single year by any network in at
least 25 years. That included 12 Emmys for Game of Thrones, setting a record for any series in one year.
We demonstrated the combined strength of our brands and the scale of our network in affiliate negotiations during
2015. Last spring, for example, Turner and HBO worked together to renew their agreements with DISH. And late in the
year Turner completed a deal with one of its largest distributors and now has all of its top-10 affiliates on a new rate

card that will drive accelerating revenue growth starting in 2016.
While strengthening its place inside the multi-channel ecosystem, Turner has been expanding its presence outside it,
with two of our biggest digital properties, CNN Digital and Bleacher Report, growing revenue over 25% on a combined
basis. CNN Digital remained the top position in news for multi-platform views, and Bleacher Report again finished the
year as the number two digital sports destination in the U.S.
HBO also accelerated its efforts outside the ecosystem with the pioneering launch of HBO NOW last April. HBO
NOW was a significant contributor to HBO's 2.7 million domestic subscriber additions last year, capping its best
two-year period of subscriber additions in the past 30 years. Just as importantly, HBO continued to have positive
momentum with its traditional distributors.
Outside the U.S., HBO Latin America introduced a standalone OTT [Over The Top] product in Colombia, followed
recently by Mexico, expanding the international reach of our streaming products. We also extended high-return,
low-risk licensing agreements in Canada and certain European territories, as we continue to execute the multi-model
international distribution strategy that we think best monetizes our great content.
At Warner Bros., we had a record year in both revenue and profits, driven by growth in its television business and our
best-ever year in video games. While our overall theatrical performance was not as strong as in other years, we're really
proud of our two Oscar-nominated films, Mad Max: Fury Road and Creed. In television, we were the leading supplier
to broadcast again, and we had the top new broadcast show in Blindspot, the top reality program with The Voice, and
the top comedy in The Big Bang Theory. And Warner Bros. ended the year as a top-three video game publisher in the
U.S. and Europe on the strength of Mortal Kombat X, Batman: Arkham Knight, and the successful introduction of a
new franchise in LEGO Dimensions.
Warner's also continued to build its international business. To tap into the significant growth opportunity we see in
China specifically, last year Warner's entered into an exciting new venture to produce local language films. Our
confidence in the China opportunity has been reinforced by the success of Hollywood VIP, an SVOD partnership
between Warner's and Tencent. Hollywood VIP added more than 5 million new subscribers in 2015, helped by its
exclusive access to Warner Bros. movies and HBO's original programming.
So 2015 was another very successful year on multiple fronts. And thanks to the investments we've been making, we're
poised for an even better year in 2016 as we roll out richer, more engaging content lineups across the company and
accelerate the pace of investment and innovation.
At HBO, that includes increasing the hours of original programming by 50% globally. We'll have an unmatched lineup
of returning shows, including: Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley, John Oliver, Ballers, and Veep; as well as some of our
boldest new programming in years, including: Vinyl from Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger, which will debut this
Sunday, Westworld from J.J. Abrams and produced by Warner's, and Divorce with Sarah Jessica Parker. We also have
an ambitious roster of new programming geared to the NOW audience, including shows from Jon Stewart, Bill
Simmons, Sesame Street, and a daily Vice newscast.
As we introduce all this new content and further expand distribution, we're going to step up our marketing of HBO
NOW. We think the combination of an even stronger original programming lineup, the best selection of hit Hollywood
movies, and ever-improving digital products will drive continued subscriber growth, both at HBO NOW and with our
traditional distributors. As we renegotiate some of our more important affiliate agreements over the next couple of
years, we expect to better monetize those subscribers and accelerate subscription revenue growth at HBO.
We'll continue to expand HBO's streaming products internationally as well. We anticipate significantly expanding our
OTT footprint in Latin America, and recently we announced plans to launch a standalone streaming product in Spain
later this year.
We're equally excited about everything that Turner has in store for 2016. It's going to be a historic year for Turner
Sports, which will broadcast the NCAA Men's Basketball Finals for the first time. And we're rolling out Turner's new
eSports league in partnership with WME | IMG. And as we head into the home stretch of the riveting 2016 presidential

election race, CNN will continue to be the place to find authoritative political coverage and analysis.
In kids, Cartoon will look to build on its momentum from last year, and we're excited about Boomerang's content
refresh and global expansion, which is the centerpiece of the kids' partnership between Warner and Turner.
This year we'll also start the brand refreshes of TBS and TNT. TBS recently kicked off its new lineup with the launches
of Angie Tribeca and Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. They're already changing perceptions of what to expect from the
network, and there's a lot more to come. TNT will start its own refresh later this year, with projects such as Animal
Kingdom from producer John Wells and Warner Bros., Good Behavior, and The Alienist joining its existing lineup of
leading originals. While it will take some time to fully refresh their lineups, we're already seeing evidence of a bold
new voice from both networks.
These changes at TBS and TNT are just the latest steps in a multiyear transformation at Turner. Over the last several
years we've put in place new management teams at Cartoon Network, CNN, truTV, and Turner's international portfolio,
and the results give us a lot of confidence in our ability to further strengthen TBS and TNT in the years ahead. In 2015,
CNN and Cartoon significantly outpaced their peers. And one year after its rebrand, truTV's ratings in its key demos
returned to growth in the fourth quarter. And excluding the impact of FX, Turner's international networks have grown
profits over 60% since 2013.
2016 is also set to be a blockbuster year at Warner Bros. We're expecting another record performance, this time led by
our theatrical business. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice arrives in theaters on March 25, and it's one of the most
anticipated films of this or any year. More than just a clash between the two iconic superheroes, it will mark the
beginning of a multiyear slate of franchise films at Warner's. DC will be a significant part of that slate, including
Suicide Squad this August and Wonder Woman and the first Justice League movie in 2017.
Cartoon Network is also launching a new Justice League TV show, which will join Teen Titans Go, another DC-based
program from Warner Bros., and the number one show on Cartoon Network. That underscores both DC's success in
television – it has eight shows on air this season – and the deepening integration between Warner's and Turner's kids
business.
The strength of our theatrical slate extends far beyond our DC titles. We're just as excited about Fantastic Beasts and
Where to Find Them, the magical return to J.K. Rowling's World of Harry Potter, set for release this November. And
we're already looking forward to the return of our LEGO franchise in 2017 with LEGO Batman and Ninjago. As those
titles migrate into premium and broadcast windows, we will also benefit from them on HBO and Turner's networks.
While it's still early in the development season, we're very confident about the prospects of Warner Bros. TV in the
upcoming TV season. We're expanding and diversifying our slate of programming, working to extend our leadership
position in broadcast to basic cable, premium cable, and OTT services. That includes some of HBO's and Turner's
biggest new shows that I noted before, as well as original programming for SVOD services, like 11.22.63 for Hulu and
Fuller House for Netflix.
Putting all this together, I hope you can appreciate why we expect 2016 to be a standout year for Time Warner. We
expect the investments we've made in recent years to drive an acceleration in revenue growth. Along with continued
cost discipline, that will allow us to invest aggressively in the business while delivering very attractive financial results.
All that's reflected in the outlook we released this morning.
We're just as confident about our long-term prospects. As I noted earlier, the shift to on-demand consumption is
accelerating, and we're stepping up our pace of innovation investment to match it. Because of our industry-leading
brands and scale, we're in a great position to take advantage of the many opportunities these shifts are creating, and we
have clear momentum across the company. So we fully expect to continue delivering industry-leading financial results
and shareholder returns for many years to come.
Thanks for listening in. I'll turn it over to Howard.

Howard M. Averill
Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on
our website.
As you'll recall, 2014's results were affected by significant restructuring and severance charges across the company and
programming charges at Turner. Given the nature and size of these items, my comments today related to expenses,
margins, and adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter and full year will exclude these charges from all periods.
Starting with consolidated results, for the year revenues grew 3%, or 7% excluding a drag of almost 400 basis points
from FX. Adjusted operating income increased 6%, or a very healthy 13% absent a more than 700 basis point currency
headwind. And that came despite a decline in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the timing of programming expenses
at Turner, programming charges at HBO, and difficult comparisons at Warner.
As a result of the restructuring actions we took and ongoing efficiency measures, we limited total expense growth to
2% and increased margins close to 100 basis points. When we took those actions, we set a goal of $500 million in cost
savings. We recognized the majority of those savings this year and expect to surpass our initial target in 2016. Those
savings helped fund nearly $12 billion in content investments across the company. So we were able to drive margin
expansion while still investing aggressively in the business.
Moving down the income statement, adjusted EPS of $4.75 exceeded our outlook for the year. And when excluding an
FX drag of $0.50, adjusted EPS growth was a very strong 27%.
In addition to our strong operating performance, we also benefited from our share repurchase program. In 2015 we
repurchased $3.6 billion of our shares. So combined with $1.2 billion in dividends, we returned $4.8 billion to
shareholders during the year.
So we had another really good year in 2015. That was a result of the same combination of top tier operating
performance, relentless focus on efficiency, content investments, and disciplined capital allocation that's allowed us to
provide our shareholders with long-term returns well above our peer group average. And that's the combination we will
continue to strive for in 2016, when we anticipate another year of attractive growth. That's reflected in our 2016
outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40, which using current rates includes an approximately $0.15 year-over-year
headwind from FX. Absent that additional FX headwind, our outlook would imply mid to high teens growth in adjusted
EPS. I'll provide additional context around our outlook as we go through the presentation.
Now turning for the segment highlights, I'll start at Turner, where we grew adjusted operating income double digits in
2015, even in the face of significant FX headwinds and while we continued to invest in the transformation Jeff
discussed. Advertising revenues increased 2% for the year and 5% in the quarter. That was ahead of our expectations
for the quarter due to the strong domestic ad market and improved ratings trends.
Domestic advertising grew high single digits in the quarter. That was boosted by particularly strong results in news and
kids, record ratings for our MLB playoff games, the comparison to last year's dispute with DISH, and the airing of three
additional major league baseball playoff games. International advertising grew low double digits in the quarter,
excluding an over 18 percentage point drag from FX and the benefit from the consolidation of our sports network in
Brazil.
Looking ahead to the first quarter, we're seeing a continuation of the recent positive trends, so we expect total
advertising revenue to be up in the mid-single digits despite continued FX headwinds. And with scatter pricing pacing
up double digits versus the upfront, historically low cancellation levels, and great momentum at many of our brands,
every indication points to a very strong upfront this year.
Moving on, subscription revenues were up 1% for the year, but looking through the impact of foreign currency would
have increased 5%. In the fourth quarter, domestic subscription revenues grew in the mid-single digits, which included
a benefit from the comp against the dispute with DISH last year. And absent a greater than 20 percentage point drag
from FX, international subscription revenue grew in the low single digits. The slowdown internationally was due in

part to the timing of revenues related to a contract renewal.
Looking to 2016, we now have achieved the rate increases we were targeting with all of our top-10 domestic
distributors, so we continue to expect domestic subscription revenue growth to accelerate into the low teens starting in
the first quarter. We also anticipate attractive local currency growth at our international networks, though at current
rates, FX headwinds would prevent a return to reported growth until the latter parts of the year.
Adjusted operating income was up 11% for the year. As we anticipated, that included a fourth quarter decline due to
13% programming cost growth, which was mainly a result of higher MLB expenses and the timing of original
programming. For the year, total expenses declined 3% and margins expanded over 300 basis points to the highest level
in Turner's history. That reflected continued tight cost control and the benefits of the restructuring we undertook in
2014.
Putting that all together, Turner delivered very strong growth in adjusted operating income while making progress from
the multiyear transformation of our core networks. We took share in both news and kids and started the hard work of
rebranding our entertainment networks. And with the investments we made across the business, we laid the
groundwork for continued attractive growth in the years to come.
Turning now to HBO, where we had another year of strong subscriber growth while continuing to make the
investments necessary to go after the significant global opportunity we see for the business; subscription revenues were
up 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. Both periods included about a 100 basis point headwind from the
combination of foreign exchange and the transfer of HBO's basic cable service in India to Turner.
Domestic subscription revenue increased in the mid-single digits for both the quarter and the year. We continued to see
very strong growth in our subscriber base, but subscriber mix remained a constraint on revenue growth. At the same
time, we're pleased with the early progress we're making with HBO NOW, who's contribution to subscription revenue
increased sequentially throughout the year.
As we move into 2016, we expect the revenue contributions from HBO NOW to increase further as we roll out new
programming and expand distribution, allowing us to invest even more aggressively in marketing and product. And
later in the year, we expect to begin renewing some of our affiliate deals, which should result in improved monetization
of our subscriber base.
Moving to content and other revenue, which grew 20% in the quarter and 6% for the year, that's mainly due to higher
international licensing revenues, and it's indicative of the strong demand we're seeing globally for HBO's premium
content. Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues increased high single digits for
the quarter and year when excluding the impact of FX and transfer of the basic service in India. And subscriber growth
remained strong, especially in Latin America and Europe.
Adjusting operating income was down 3% in the quarter but up 1% for the year. The decline in the fourth quarter was
mainly due to higher programming expenses, which increased 11%. That growth included programming charges
primarily related to series in development that HBO decided not to move forward with. Looking through those charges,
programming costs would have grown 1% in the quarter. For the full year, total expenses increased 5%, reflecting
investments in technology and marketing related to the launch of HBO NOW as well as higher programming costs.
So 2015 was another successful year for HBO, as we maintained the subscriber momentum we've had the past few
years, delivered another year of profit growth, and continued to execute our key strategic initiatives, including the
launch of standalone streaming products in the U.S. and Latin America. Given the strength of both the global demand
for our product and our programming slate, we remain very confident in HBO's ability to accelerate its growth over the
next several years.
Moving on to Warner Bros., where despite a dip in the fourth quarter, we finished the year with record revenues and
profits, led by our TV and games businesses, we achieved that even with a material drag from FX. On the TV side,
revenues increased modestly in the quarter, due largely to international growth. And for the year, TV revenue grew
double digits. That was primarily due to significant growth in licensing revenue, including the domestic licensing of 2

Broke Girls, Big Bang Theory, Person of Interest, Seinfeld, and Friends. We also continued to see increasing demand
and strong pricing around the globe for Warner's hit content. So we remain encouraged by the strong secular trends in
the TV business.
Turning to video games, where we had difficult comparisons in the quarter against LEGO Batman 3 and Middle Earth:
Shadow of Mordor, even so, we posted record video games revenue of close to $1.5 billion for the year. And with the
great IP and strong franchises at Warner's, we're confident we can continue to grow our games business over time.
Theatrically, we knew 2015 would be a challenging year given the lack of any core franchise releases and the
comparison against the end of The Hobbit trilogy as well as the releases of The LEGO Movie and Godzilla. So as
expected, revenues declined for both the quarter and the year. Looking ahead, 2016 will mark the beginning of an
ambitious slate of franchise movies, including at least 17 releases from our DC, LEGO, and World of Harry Potter
franchises through 2020. So we feel great about the outlook for our theatrical business in 2016 and beyond.
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue declined 10% for the year due to continued weakness in
physical sales, in particular catalog releases and lower carryover revenue. However, digital trends remain healthy, with
EST growing in the high teens for Warner's.
On the expense side and in line with the enterprise-wide focus on cost efficiency, Warner's reduced SG&A by 2% for
the year, and that included significant savings from the 2014 restructuring actions. So on the whole, Warner's had a
terrific year. And with the momentum at our TV and games businesses and ambitious franchise film slate set for the
next several years, we're in a great position to drive attractive growth at Warner's for the foreseeable future.
Turning to the next slide, we generated very healthy free cash of $3.6 billion in 2015, converting over 90% of our
earnings into cash. The year-over-year increase was due to the growth in adjusted operating income and lower cash
taxes. And that was despite the increase in working capital as a result of increased content investments across our
divisions and severance payments related to the restructuring initiatives in 2014. Our cash taxes declined primarily due
to the timing of tax legislation and related payments. Looking to 2016, we expect another year of solid growth in free
cash flow, driven by strong profit growth and continued high conversion.
Now looking at our balance sheet, we ended 2015 with $21.6 billion of net debt, up $1.8 billion from the end of 2014.
That's primarily a result of our continued commitment to direct returns to shareholders. During 2015 we repurchased
$3.6 billion in shares, and combined with our dividend returned $4.8 billion to shareholders. And as Jeff noted earlier,
the board authorized a 15% increase in our dividend and up to $5 billion in share repurchases, reinforcing our
commitment to provide direct returns to shareholders.
During the year, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $3.8
billion of long-term debt, including our first euro-denominated debt offering. We also extended the maturity of our
revolving bank credit facilities through the end of 2020. Meanwhile, we retired $2 billion of debt in the year as a result
of a maturity and a tender offer and redemption of higher-priced debt. And on the investment front, we spent close to
$700 million, about half of which is related to our real estate project at Hudson Yards. We expect to invest a similar
amount in that project in 2016.
We ended the year with a net leverage ratio at approximately 2.85 times, just above our target level. Looking forward,
we plan to return to our target leverage ratio of 2.75 times over the next few quarters, and we don't anticipate a change
in either that target level or our capital allocation philosophy, which will remain focused on investments back into our
businesses, targeted M&A, and consistent direct returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. 2016 marks the start of what we
anticipate will be a strong content cycle across the company, and that should translate into an acceleration in revenue
and adjusted operating income growth and another year of strong growth in adjusted EPS. At Turner, we expect another
strong year as we take advantage of faster revenue growth and continued cost efficiencies to increase investment for the
future. As I mentioned earlier, subscription revenue growth should accelerate meaningfully. And advertising revenue
should benefit from a strong ad market, continued momentum at CNN, including from its election coverage, and airing
the NCAA Championship Game for the first time.

And at the same time, we're planning for higher programming and marketing expenses, tied primarily to the NCAA
Championship Game and the start of our new NBA deal in 4Q, as well as election coverage at CNN and investments in
originals related to the brand repositioning at both TBS and TNT. We remain focused on continuing to efficiently
manage overhead expenses to help fund these initiatives.
At HBO, we also expect faster growth in subscription revenue in 2016, driven by continued subscriber gains, including
from HBO NOW, and improved monetization of our subscriber base. Over the next couple of years, we would expect
that to take HBO subscription revenue growth into the high single digits. That will be balanced against investments
associated with HBO's slate of new originals as well as the new programming targeted for digital platforms. We will
also continue to invest in marketing and technology to drive growth on HBO's digital platforms.
At Warner Bros., we'll kick off our slate of franchise films with the release of Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad, and
the first of Jo Rowling's Fantastic Beast films. And while we're facing challenging comparisons in TV licensing and
video games, we expect both businesses to continue to deliver healthy results. In addition, we remain focused on
driving margin expansion through efficiency measures and the transition to digital. So all in all, we expect very strong
growth and another record year at Warner.
So looking across all three segments, we're set up for a very good year from an operating perspective. That's despite an
estimated year-over-year FX drag of approximately $125 million on adjusted operating income and approximately
$0.15 on adjusted EPS, which we have factored into our outlook. And if we look back relative to the expectations we
shared with you at our Investor Day, the FX drag on adjusted EPS in 2016 is in the range of $0.55 to $0.60. Absent
that, we would be on track for the close to $6.00 in adjusted EPS we shared with you then.
In terms of the cadence of the year, we expect our earnings to be weighted toward the back half as a result of the timing
of both our film slate and marketing investments at HBO and Turner.
Putting all that together, we expect another very good year in 2016, which is reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS
of $5.30 to $5.40. And that incorporates continued investments in high-quality video content and new business models
and capabilities that should position the company to continue to drive very attractive growth for the next several years
and beyond.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you. There seems to be a lot of opportunity ahead with HBO, traditional domestic
opportunity, HBO NOW, and international. I guess can you provide us some color of where you think the most upside
is, specifically any upcoming milestones we can look to from the outside for signs of traction? I know you mentioned
some renewals later this year. I guess any color on when and what to expect there, and any more color you can give us
on HBO NOW subscribers.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Hey, thanks, Alexia. This is Jeff. I'm going to turn it to Richard.
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: Alexia, thank you. Look, we had a terrific year in sub growth, 2.7 million additional subs.
Quite obviously, our mission and our opportunity is now, as we've said, to go capture the revenue that reflects that sub

growth toward the end of this year and into next year, and we're going to do that.
HBO NOW, where we're just getting started, I think we've made a lot of progress. We are not yet out on two major
platforms, PlayStation and Xbox, which for example on HBO GO account for over 20% of viewing. And we've not yet
put out the content like Jon Stewart, Bill Simmons, Vice Daily News Show that we think is particularly suited for those
platforms. And that of course will catalyze a great deal of marketing, digitally and otherwise, which we think will drive
subscriptions. So we're very excited about where we are. I think it's important to punctuate that of the 2.7 million, those
are full paying subscribers. Our job now is to go, as the deal renewal cycles open up at the end of this year and into the
next 18 months, to go capture that revenue, and we intend to do that.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Richard, why don't you add a little about international HBO?
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: Sure. Well look, we have three basic tenets, of course, of profit around the world. One is
our networks business in 60 countries and of course licensing into over 150 countries. And it is not, as we said to you
before, a one-size-fits-all strategy. We look at this market by market, where we think we can make the most money,
and we follow the money. We just added an OTT service in Spain, doing the cost/benefit and decided that that's where
the best long-term growth opportunity was for us. We extended a licensing deal in Canada with Bell Canada and Bell
Media because that's where we thought the best long-term growth opportunity was.
So we take this market by market. We have a lot of flexibility. And the reason I think that we're uniquely suited to
exploit these opportunities is because we own our own content. And that gives us an enormous amount of flexibility
however we choose to pivot around the world.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Hey, Alexia, this is Howard. Just to clarify one thing, the 2.7 million subs, they are paying
consumers. We're just not seeing the benefit, as Richard pointed out, that we need to go and we need to work with our
distributors to renegotiate as we go forward so that we capture some of that upside as we move forward.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: And then we should see some of that, I assume, when you do some of the renewals that
you pointed to toward the end of this year as well?
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: Precisely right.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Yeah, starts this year and it goes over the next 18 months or so.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Look, I can't resist – this is Jeff. I can't resist adding, this is exactly what we've been telling
you, and it's on track, because remember what we're all focused on here, particularly at HBO, is that we want to show
the value and demonstrate consumer penetration. These are paying subs that value the service. We intended to do that
before then aligning the affiliate renewals to capture the money, and this is something we do in partnership and in order
to incentivize our distributors. And we are pushing HBO out both in traditional distribution and on the NOW platform
to cover either the 70 million basics that don't have pay TV or to go after the 12 million or 13 million broadband-onlys,
again, just in the U.S. But if you look at it across all of those platforms, it's basically quite an advantageous position
that HBO is now in to accelerate the revenues, not just in 2016, but in 2017, 2018, and beyond.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you very much.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Alexia. Mike, can we have the next question, please?

The next question is from John Janedis from Jefferies.
<Q - John Janedis>: Hi, thank you. I just wanted to start maybe with a couple of housekeeping questions. First, can
you clarify the programming charges during the quarter by segment, and do you foresee more in the near term? And
then secondly, for the 2016 guidance, how much of it's driven by the tax rate? And do you expect to buy back a similar
amount of stock this year?

<A - Howard M. Averill>: Hey, John, this is Howard. So in terms of program impairments, at Turner we had about
$130 million in the fourth quarter. And that was tied to the TBS and TNT transition, which has now started at TBS.
And we've rolled out some new shows and we're pretty pleased so far where that's going. There's another $50 million or
so of charges at HBO, and that was tied to some series that we decided not to move forward with, which happens
occasionally. So in the quarter it was about $180 million of charges.
As far as the taxes and the buyback, I would say the tax rate in 2016 will actually go up versus 2015. That's in part
because we saw some fourth quarter benefits that lowered the rate overall for 2015. So I think if you look forward, you
should see a tax rate that might be up a couple hundred basis points, more in line with what we had in the first three
quarters in 2015.
In terms of buybacks, as always, that's going to depend on what our free cash flow generation is and what our
alternative uses of capital are. But given that we ended the year at about 2.85 times, which was above our target
leverage of 2.75 times, I would expect that the buyback would come down a bit versus 2015 levels.
<Q - John Janedis>: Thanks, Howard. And maybe, Jeff, separately, you talked a bit now about potentially retaining
rights longer or delaying SVOD sales. Can you give us updated views? And is there any anecdotal evidence that there
would be an impact on ratings given how millennials consume content? Do others need to follow to strengthen the
industry broadly? And if there's anything to share in the context of partnering and Hulu, that would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Okay, that's a lot of questions. Let's start of what you were talking about in terms of either
syndication sales, windows, et cetera. We're not ideological about syndication windows. That depends on evolution and
a lot of factors. But I think the overriding point everybody ought to focus on is that it's becoming crystal clear that
consumers want the ability to watch their favorite show, their favorite network on demand, across whatever platform
they're watching, whatever window it is. Whether it's a new show, current season, whether it's a one or two-year-old
show, they want to see it on demand. We want to make sure our networks have the flexibility to meet that consumer
demand.
Now if you look at HBO, a perfect example, HBO has for many years provided on-demand access to almost all the
content, multiple seasons that it's ever produced. Some of the new entrants in the business that have VOD as a primary
feature have also put multiple seasons on. The Turner networks are committed to delivering more programming on
demand across their distribution channels. That's whether you get it in a new bundle, over the top, whether you get it
through a traditional distributor. And Warner's already sells broad suites of rights when partners are interested in them.
And of course, Warner's sells to every kind of network, broadcast, premium, cable, over-the-top subscription VOD
services. So the overriding development, which is a good development, is that consumers want VOD on whatever show
or window they're watching.
Now your second question which is what has to happen, not just in our company, and I think we've been pretty clear
about what we said, is that distributors need to be able to offer more on-demand functionality view services. So the
overriding development, which is a good development, is that consumers want VOD on whatever show or window
they're watching, and we're basically moving to satisfy consumer demand.
Now your second question, which is what has to happen, not just in our company, and I think we've been pretty clear
about what we said, is that distributors need to be able to offer more on-demand functionality. We see them moving
quite rapidly now to do that. You can look at interfaces and on-demand offerings at Comcast. You can see new bundles
and moves at Verizon or Sling. And I think Sony has a new product. I think you're going to see ever-increasing
innovation across the distribution platforms, over-the-top and in traditional distribution package offerings. So this
consumer demand is going to be satisfied, and it's basically going to be good for any brand, any network, or any show
that has strong consumer resonance. And that's why we think that it's very good for our very concentrated suite of
networks at Turner and HBO, and we think it's very good for the world's leading producer of TV shows and films,
which is Warner Bros.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: He had one more question. What was it?

<A - Howard M. Averill>: I just want to go back to it. I want to just do some housekeeping. On your housekeeping
question, which you talked about, are the future plans for charges, there is not any plan for any material charges going
forward.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: I think you asked a question about Hulu.
<Q - John Janedis>: Correct.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: As you know, we're not going to comment on someone else's asset or any press speculation.
So putting aside Hulu, we are actively pursuing opportunities outside the ecosystem. You've heard it at Turner, at HBO,
at Warner's. It's part of our efforts to meet the consumer demand, who are looking for more video and more VOD,
whether it's HBO NOW, whether it's our Turner networks in all the new over-the-top bundles, whether it's both
Turner/HBO product or Warner product in overseas markets. Basically, that's what you're seeing. We think it's a good
thing that we have these new entrants offering Warner on demand.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, John. Mike, can we have our next question, please?
Operator
Your next question is from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thank you. I have one for Richard and one for John. Richard, now you're into the first
year of life at HBO NOW. I wonder. What has surprised you in terms of the rollout, and how have you adjusted your
strategies based on that learning?
And then for John, there has been increasing focus by us on minimum carriage agreements between networks and
distributors. So if you can, talk a bit about how close Turner is to your floors on those minimums, and whether or not
you have to adjust down any of your minimums in exchange for the better pricing that you received.
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: Michael, thank you. It's Richard. Look, we're learning all the time. We're at this eight
months. We're at about 800,000 paying subscribers. We see an enormous amount of opportunity ahead. As I said to
Alexia, we're excited about getting on additional platforms. We're excited about bringing new content to the product,
which we think is going to draw people in on a daily basis, things like Stewart and Vice News and Simmons, and we're
going to begin to market more aggressively. But again, I don't want to bury the lede. HBO NOW is an additive part of
our growth strategy. And what we've seen in the ecosystem, where we see the vast amount of growth, is that we have
huge opportunities there as well. So we're going to work in a multifaceted way to expand our sub base and to expand
our sub revenue, as I discussed earlier.
<A - John K. Martin>: Hi, Michael. It's John. So with respect to your carriage agreement question, for a long time
now, Turner has paid a lot of attention to its distribution commitments. And I'm not going to speak specifically about
any one of our distributors, but we do have protections in all of our agreements. And we feel really confident from a
contractual standpoint that we'll be highly penetrated and remain highly penetrated.
I think more importantly, over time, what's going to determine the distribution strength is going to be the strength of
your brands. And we've now – and this has been a long time coming for Turner and Time Warner, we've just now
completed a distribution rate renewal cycle that we started planning for four years ago. And beginning in the first
quarter of 2016, we're going to see meaningful acceleration in our domestic subscription revenues, and we feel great
about that. We think it's a tremendous validation of the brands that we have. And I feel very confident that our brands
are going to be carried in all and any major programming packages going forward. And specifically to your question
that we made adjustments down on penetration, the answer is no.

Your next question is from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thank you. Good morning, a couple. Howard, I don't know if you would be
willing to help us with working capital and cash taxes for 2016.
And then, John, just picking up on the Turner outlook, as I'm sure you're well aware, there's a big focus on domestic
affiliate revenue growth across the space. Now that you've got all your deals done, can you help us with 2017 and
2018? I think you had guided to low teens again in 2017. But given what you're seeing in subs, in sub trends, and your
deals that are now done, you probably have pretty good visibility. So any comfort there you could give us would be
really helpful.
And then if I can sneak one more in on HBO, Richard, have you thought about – I'm sure you've thought about it. But
are there any restrictions to changing the price point on HBO NOW? I'm just wondering if you've considered lowering
the price of the over-the-top product in the U.S., given where the other over-the top services are priced? Thanks.
<A - John K. Martin>: So do you want me to start? Hey, Ben. It's John. I'll start on the carriage agreements and
visibility. Look, I think this is one of the great benefits of being in this business and having the great partnerships that
we have with our affiliates is that we have multiple-year deals with great visibility on how that's going to translate into
revenue. And so, as I said, we still continue to expect, and we've been predicting this now for a long time, that our
subscription revenues are going to accelerate into the low teens in 2016. I think in 2017, I would expect the growth rate
to be at a similar level. We feel really terrific and confident about our ability to achieve those levels. We've done
everything we said we were setting out to do on our rate renewal cycle, and we feel great about that.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thank you.
<A - John K. Martin>: Ben, you wanted to know about price. Look, we don't have any plans to change the price point
at this point. We have a lot of flexibility. But what we're seeing is an enormous amount of growth in the ecosystem. So
listen, we think that our premium price right now makes sense, and we'll assess that as we go forward. But right now,
we have no plans to change it.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thanks.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Back to free cash flow, Ben. So as I mentioned, in 2015 we converted at over 90% of our
earnings to cash flow. We see strong conversion going forward, nothing really unusual from a working capital
standpoint. I would say with respect to cash taxes, we did see some benefit this year from some legislation. We're going
to see continued benefit in 2016, but I would expect it might tick up a bit from a cash tax standpoint in 2016.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thank you all.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Ben. Operator, Mike, can we have the next question, please?

And your next question is from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura Securities.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Kevin and one for John. Kevin, of
course, big film year for Warner's. I wondered if you could also touch on the TV licensing comparisons that Howard
mentioned, the large syndication sales that you guys had in 2015 in the prepared remarks. And given those compares on
content licensing, I wonder if you could help us with the swing factors around the growth trajectory for Warner's in
2016. So can video games and film more than offset the tough TV licensing comps this year?
And then for John, Howard said, just back to restructuring, I know Howard just said that you have no plans for further
restructurings as of now, but I was just wondering. At Turner, what gives you the confidence, and do you think the

businesses are right-sized at this point given the cable TV environment? Do you have any further cost-cutting for the
non-programming expenses planned? Just walk us through how you evaluate that on an ongoing basis. Thank you.
<A - Kevin Tsujihara>: Anthony, this is Kevin. As Howard mentioned, we do face the very difficult costs from a TV
licensing perspective. We had 2 Broke Girls, Person of Interest, Friends and Seinfeld, and the second cycle of Big Bang
Theory. We don't have similar type product going down the pipeline in 2016.
But I will say that one of the things that we do have, we have Mom coming up. And the lumpiness of television
licensing has decreased as you've seen more of the SVOD revenue. Thanks to shows like Blindspot, Supergirl, Lucifer,
and Legends of Tomorrow, which are our big first-year shows this year, won't have the same type of one-time
lumpiness as you look at how we're recognizing revenue and how we're selling these shows going forward. 2016 and
beyond, 2016 and 2017 are big film years. It's what we talked to you about in October. We feel really good about
setting up a film franchise with Batman v Superman. Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts look great. And so yes, I do
believe that film and games will more than offset the difficult comp in TV, and we will have strong growth in 2016.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks, Kevin.
<A - John K. Martin>: Hey, Anthony, it's John. So let's start with where we're at right now at Turner. Yes, we've
taken some pretty material restructuring charges over the last couple of years. As you heard Howard say, no plans on
the programming side – to take additional restructurings, that is.
Look, with regard to expenses overall, on an adjusted basis, Turner finished 2015 with the highest margins we've had in
its history, and I think our margins are now at or near the top of where the industry is. And having said that, we are
going to remain incredibly disciplined across the entire company as it relates to expenses and pay very close attention
to how and where we're spending our money. And we're going to be doing that at the same time that we're going to be
investing to improve capabilities and build new businesses. So I feel terrific about the efficiency of the operations of
the company right now. I still believe longer term that our programming costs will grow in the high single-digit range,
which is what we've been saying now for a long time, and our non-programming costs should grow much, much more
slowly than that.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks, John.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Hey, I just wanted to follow on and just point out, John's discussion of the efficiency at
Turner, that is a philosophy across the entire company. It's something that we continue to be focused on as we move
forward.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Okay, thanks.

And your next question is from the line of Richard Greenfield with Deutsche Bank (sic) [BTIG].
<Q - Brandon Ross>: Brandon Ross from BTIG in for Rich. Two questions, one for Jeff and one for Richard. First for
Jeff, one of your peers, Facebook, grew mobile ad revenue by $2 billion year over year in Q4 alone, largely on the back
of video advertising. As consumer engagement shifts to mobile away from TV, what's your strategy for competing
specifically in mobile? Do you need to start new businesses, make acquisitions, or combine with another entity?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Brandon, [indiscernible] (57:02), good question. We're focused on that opportunity. And
let's break it into a couple of pieces. One is availability. And that is we're committed to making our content available
across all platforms, including mobile. That's why we went out years ago and put the TVE [TV Everywhere] contracts
in place for VOD to all of our affiliates. That's why HBO announced On Demand more than a decade ago, and now
they have NOW.

And so what we've been doing if you go beyond those two pretty obvious examples is we've been building more digital
businesses that go straight to mobile, so let's look at them. There's CNN, which is the leader in mobile news. And
you've seen very strong growth in CNN in all digital platforms, but certainly in mobile, and domestically and
internationally, by the way.
You have the launch of Great Big Story. That's already with 170 million video views in just the first few months.
Bleacher Report, the number two online sports destination in the country, has a very strong mobile presence, given the
nature of that programming, particularly with its Team Stream app. Super Deluxe, which is a new launch at Turner of a
digital studio that makes short-form video that is very weighted to mobile, is yet another one. So if you take all of those
together – probably should add some – John, add the Cartoon.
<A - John K. Martin>: Yeah, just to amplify what Jeff said, the other category where we have a very strong
competitive position and we're really focused on growing the business is in kids. We relaunched the mobile app for
Cartoon Network in the summer, and within two months I think our traffic doubled. And so there's going to be
consistent innovation as we're going to continue to make our products better and better and better. And I think the
monetization of our traffic on all of these platforms is going to begin to improve.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: And then let's go back to HBO. You were asking it mostly from the point of view of ad
revenue. HBO doesn't do that, but we have a lot of sub revenue there that's tied to mobile as well. So new content like
Jon Stewart, Bill Simmons, the Vice Daily Show, we think it's going to thrive on digital platforms. And then not to
leave out Kevin, because he's sitting here, Blue Ribbon studio at Warner's focuses on short-form content also for this
kind of environment. So we're basically moving with many avenues into this business.
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: Brandon, it's Richard. So -
<A>: Brandon, [indiscernible] (59:48) did you have another question?
<Q - Brandon Ross>: Yes, so my second question for you, Richard, was, a year ago you thought all the ISPs would be
actively marketing HBO NOW, but it seems like they clearly want to protect their legacy video bundle at all costs. Do
you think this is why you only have 800,000 HBO NOW subs? And does it alter your thinking about the economic
viability of OTT, and does it change your view on ISP consolidation?
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: The answer to the last two questions are no and no. Let me make a couple of points. First of
all, I wouldn't say only 800,000 HBO NOW subs. We're just getting started, as I said earlier. I think we're going to
make a lot of progress as we put new content on and get onto new platforms. And listen, our distributors are selling
HBO in a variety of different ways. I had dinner with one of our major distributors the other night. We talked about our
growth opportunities. Part of that conversation was HBO NOW, and they were very excited about it. So I reject the
notion that our major distributors out of hand don't want to bundle HBO NOW. I don't think that's true. And as our
deals come up for renewal, I think we'll see different kinds of packaging. But listen, if they want to sell HBO through
skinny bundles, fantastic. If they want to sell HBO through triple plays, fantastic. And I think it's very important to
remember that in the last four years we've grown 8 million subscribers. Over the 44-year...
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: In just the United States.
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: In just the United States. In the 44-year history of our company, that's 20% of our sub
growth. What that tells you is, as I've said before, nobody is doing us any favors selling HBO. They're growing their
own businesses by using our brand to grow their different companies. So I think this is a win-win. And whether they
want to market and bundle NOW or whether they want to do skinny bundles or basic packages or triple plays, there are
growth opportunities for them and parenthetical growth opportunities for us. That's what we're excited about.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Brandon. Operator, Mike, I think we have time for one more question.

<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thank you, two questions. We've talked a lot on the call about TV windows. Can you
discuss how you're thinking about film windows, how they might change, and how that would affect both Warner Bros.
and HBO?
And the second question is, you and all of your peers have talked about the strength of the ad market. What do you
think finally drove it back up, and how are you feeling going into the upfront market?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Kevin, you start on it.
<A - Kevin Tsujihara>: On the film window question, I think that similar to the conversation that Jeff had on
television windows, we're constantly looking at what consumers are looking for, what consumers are asking for, and
evaluating how to monetize that demand for content earlier and earlier. We obviously have constituents in the film
exhibition community that we're trying to also weigh the impact on that as well. But I think that we continue to look at
it. I think the industry is looking at it, and it also would affect the pay TV window. And Richard and I have had a
number of conversations about what that would do to that and how HBO would play potentially even in that world as
well.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Let me add something, because Richard [indiscernible] (1:03:23). It's good for HBO
however that ends up. And one of the reasons is if films get more available in your home on demand, and you've got to
look at what price will be yielded by that, it's going to make the movie aspect of premium TV, which HBO has the lead
of, more valuable from a consumer – in terms of what consumers value, they're going to see what they're getting in the
HBO subscription just on the movie side, leave out the original programming, as ever-more valuable. That's a good
thing.
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: Absolutely, I'd just add because it's often obscured that our film viewing across all
platforms is over 72% of viewing, and on the linear network it's over 77% of viewing. So the truth of the matter is the
film business continues to be an enormous engine of viewership and subscriber satisfaction for HBO.
<A - John K. Martin>: Jessica, it's John. I'll take the advertising question. We were really pleased with how strong
2015 ended. And I'm also pleased, as Howard said, that we seem to be continuing a meaningful amount of momentum
into the first quarter. And I think that there were a number of factors. I think some of them are company-specific and I
think some of them are market-specific. The company-specific factors would be right now our news business is killing
it. And we're really taking advantage of the hot news cycle, and sports is really strong for us. We're seeing very strong
demand for the NBA and for the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship. We're also seeing great strength in the kids'
market, and I think we're taking share there.
In terms of the overall ad market, I think you're seeing a few things that are contributing to the buoyancy and vibrancy
of the market. Number one, the strength of scatter all throughout 2015 means that if you sat out the upfront, you paid
for it in the scatter market. So we're looking ahead, and we think all indicators would seem to suggest that this year's
upfront is going to be particularly strong. And I think that's going to reverse what's been a couple of years of being not
so strong. And I think there's a recognition that TV is still the best reach medium and the most effective option for
brand advertisers to convey their message. And so there's going to be a lot of innovation happening in advertising. We
want to lead the market there, but we feel really good about where things are right now.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thanks, guys.
Michael Kopelman
All right. Thanks, Jessica, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please
