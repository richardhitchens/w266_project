MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Tiffany and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome
everyone to the Biogen Idec Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any
background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you.
Claudine Prowse, VP, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Claudine Prowse
Thank you, and welcome to Biogen Idec's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I encourage
everyone to go to the Investors section of biogenidec.com to find the press release and related financial tables,
including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are
provided in tables one and two. Table three includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results.
We believe non-GAAP better represents the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the
business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow discussions related to this call. I would like
to point out that we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs.

On today's call I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Tony Kingsley, our Head of Global
Commercial Operations; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. Doug Williams, our Head of R&D; and Al Sandrock, our Chief
Medical Officer, are traveling overseas but will be available for the Q&A.
Now I'll turn the call over to George.
George A. Scangos, Ph.D.
Okay. Thanks, Claudine, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Biogen Idec had another great quarter in which
our products continued to perform well and during which we achieved several key milestones. Our underlying business
remains strong as we enter into a period of anticipated growth resulting from the introduction of several new therapies
in MS and hemophilia.
As Paul will review, third quarter financial performance was strong, with 37% growth in revenues and 61% growth in
diluted non-GAAP EPS year-over-year. Our core multiple sclerosis franchise continued to capture share with an
increasing number of patients using our therapies. We believe that our product portfolio of disease-modifying MS
products, including TECFIDERA, TYSABRI, AVONEX and now PLEGRIDY, truly differentiates Biogen Idec as a
global leader in the treatment of MS.
TECFIDERA continues to gain market share in the U.S., and uptake has been strong in European countries where it has
been launched. TECFIDERA is the number one oral MS treatment in the U.S., and with many more launches to come
around the world, we believe that it has the potential to be a market leader in many countries. According to our
estimates, TECFIDERA has treated over 100,000 patients globally within just 18 months of the U.S. launch and only
six months since EU approval. This is an impressive milestone to reach, and we believe that it reflects a broad
recognition by physicians and patients that TECFIDERA is a unique product that offers strong efficacy with a
favorable tolerability and safety profile, along with the convenience of oral administration.
We would like to inform you that we have confirmed a case of PML in a patient being treated with TECFIDERA who
recently died from complications of pneumonia. Despite this tragic loss, we believe that the overall positive benefit risk
profile of TECFIDERA remains unchanged. The patient was treated with TECFIDERA for four and a half years as part
of the ENDORSE study. During the course of therapy, the patient experienced severe lymphopenia that lasted for over
three and a half years.
Lymphopenia is a known risk factor for PML, and can be caused by a number of factors including treatments for MS,
cancer, HIV. The current TECFIDERA label includes warnings and precautions regarding lymphopenia. We reported
the case to the regulatory authorities and will work with them to confirm that the language in our label provides patients
and their physicians' appropriate information regarding lymphopenia.
Moving on, AVONEX continues to be a very strong part of our business, and we believe that the interferon franchise
will continue to remain solid with the anticipated launch of PLEGRIDY in the U.S. With an attractive clinical product
[ph] profile (04:44) and every-two-week subcu dosing, we believe that PLEGRIDY has the potential to be the leader in
the interferon class.
We're optimistic about the future of TYSABRI as physicians continue to view this product as an important
high-efficacy treatment option. We believe the higher level of efficacy, the increasing understanding of the benefits of
risk stratification, and the potential of TYSABRI in other indications, such as SPMS in stroke, all bode well for its
long-term growth.
We've now launched both of our hemophilia therapies, ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE, in the U.S. Although hemophilia
is a new therapeutic area for Biogen, we believe that we're well positioned to succeed. We're the first to market with
long-acting products and we bring tremendous expertise in biologics manufacturing and process sciences. And we built

a hemophilia organization comprised of many individuals with years of experience in the treatment of hemophilia, who
are communicating the clinical benefit of ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE to physicians.
We continue to advance our R&D efforts. At last month's [ph] ECTRIMS (05:51) meeting, we highlighted our
continued leadership in MS and ongoing commitment to advancing patient care. We presented several analyses of
TECFIDERA's positive real-world patient experience, as well as longer-term data from the ENDORSE study
demonstrating sustained patient efficacy. ENDORSE data indicated a favorable overall safety profile, including data
from some patients who were treated for up to seven and a half years. Other presentations including data reaffirming
the powerful efficacy of TYSABRI, two-year data for PLEGRIDY demonstrating sustained efficacy and a compelling
safety profile, [ph] both (06:29) Phase III results for daclizumab HYP as well as supportive data for anti-LINGO in
acute optic neuritis.
Our pipeline continues to move forward, and we have strengthened our research and development capabilities even
further by hiring a number of highly accomplished scientists. Chris Henderson has joined the company as Head of
Neurology Research. Chris formerly was Professor of Neurology, Pathology and Cell Biology, Director of the Stem
Cell Initiative, and Co-director of the Motor Neuron Center at Columbia University Medical School.
Richard Ransohoff has joined as Vice President of Neuroimmunology Research. He was previously was Director of the
Neuroinflammation Research Center and Professor of Molecular Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. Don Johns recently
joined the company to head our ALS Initiative. Dr. Johns previously was Head of Neuroscience Translational Medicine
at Novartis. And Olivier Danos recently joined Biogen Idec to head Gene Therapy Research. He previously was Senior
Vice President at Kadmon Pharmaceuticals, and prior to Kadmon, led the Gene Therapy Consortium at University
College, London. With these new hires, we've meaningfully strengthened our R&D capabilities in our areas of
expertise and natural adjacencies.
I'll now pass the call over to Tony.
Stuart Anthony Kingsley
Thanks, George. Our commercial organization continued to execute and deliver strong results during the third quarter.
Starting with MS, during the quarter, Biogen Idec executed our MS franchise strategy and, as a result, we continued to
grow our global MS market share. TECFIDERA's launch trajectory in the U.S. was sustained through the third quarter
as this therapy continued to grow. TECFIDERA continued to capture share while attracting a broadening set of patients
from the MS population. Year to date, our market research suggests that TECFIDERA is capturing approximately a
third of all new patient starts and over 40% of patients switching therapies. As a result, we estimate TECFIDERA's
market share in the U.S. ended the quarter in the high teens.
Outside of the U.S., the rollout of TECFIDERA continues, and we've now secured reimbursement in 10 countries. In
countries where TECFIDERA has been launched, patient uptake has been broad and strong. TECFIDERA is now the
number one prescribed oral MS therapy in Germany. TECFIDERA is also available in a number of other countries with
limited reimbursement and we continue to expect to achieve full reimbursement across most of the major EU markets
in 2015.
In a market where oral therapies are growing rapidly, our interferon franchise saw 2% year-over-year revenue growth.
Q3 revenues included AVONEX and early PLEGRIDY revenues from Europe. AVONEX continued to perform well
within the interferon therapies. With our continued focus, we believe AVONEX has captured meaningful share of new
patient starts and has exhibited strong performance within the evolving MS landscape.
The PLEGRIDY launch in Europe is underway with the initial launch in Germany and Denmark. Physician awareness
of PLEGRIDY is high and we believe the product's efficacy and dosing make it an attractive option in the interferon
class. In Germany, we gained favorable reimbursement for PLEGRIDY. PLEGRIDY does not need to go through the
AMNOG process and has been priced within the band of other interferon beta-1a therapies. In the U.S., we are
prepared for an early November launch of PLEGRIDY. We've completed sales force training, established contracts

with specialty pharmacies and prepared the financial and patient support programs for a successful launch.
Now turning to TYSABRI. TYSABRI has continued to demonstrate strong performance. Patient and physician demand
for TYSABRI is solid as the therapy enjoyed its second consecutive quarter of positive net new patient adds. In the
U.S., retention rates have improved to levels seen prior to the launch of TECFIDERA. We believe TYSABRI continues
to be viewed by neurologists as a therapy of choice for patients requiring high efficacy. In addition, we believe that
TYSABRI has benefited from physicians' improved understanding of patient management.
The hemophilia launches are off to a solid start. As we've said, success as a new entrant in this market will require
several things: establishing Biogen Idec as a credible and committed partner to the community, activating early
adopters among patients who see the benefits of the dosing schedule in prophylaxis regimens, educating hemophilia
treatment centers and providing support services to ensure patients can get rapid access to products. Our experience to
date suggests we are making good progress on all these fronts, and we believe we can reinforce that positive experience
to expand use over time to a broader set of patients.
Starting with ELOCTATE, the patient and physician awareness for ELOCTATE is high 10 weeks into the launch.
We're building strong relationships with customers and achieving our early goals of reach and frequency with
hemophilia treatment centers or HTCs. As of the end of the quarter, based on our data, approximately 50% of all HTCs
have prescribed ELOCTATE, suggesting broad interest in longer acting therapies across the market. ELOCTATE is
also widely available through specialty pharmacies and we're pleased with the status of reimbursement at this stage.
ALPROLIX is also seeing strong demand and broad interest from patients and physicians. Through the end of the
quarter, approximately 55% of HTCs have prescribed ALPROLIX. We believe that the early adopters initiating
ALPROLIX have primarily been existing prophylactic patients and have been largely choosing the once-weekly
prophylactic dosing schedule. Acquiring additional patients with hemophilia will require sustained educational and
promotional efforts but we believe we have the ability to execute. We continue to believe that reduced infusion
frequency is the largest unmet need for the hemophilia community and that ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE have
attractive product profiles to address this burden. Our goal is to become market leaders in the mid to long term, and we
believe in the products and our ability to execute.
So overall, we're pleased with our performance. The commercial team is executing well. And we believe we are
demonstrating the ability both to launch multiple therapies in parallel and drive continued growth in the base business.
With that, I will turn the call over to Paul.
Paul J. Clancy
Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.62 in the third quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings
per share in the third quarter were $3.80. Walking down the P&L, I'll start with revenues. Total revenue for the third
quarter grew 37% year-over-year to approximately $2.5 billion. Global TECFIDERA revenue was $787 million in Q3.
In the U.S., TECFIDERA revenue was $638 million. Our best estimate at this time indicates that we ended the quarter
with approximately three and a half weeks of inventory in the channel, which includes specialty pharmacies and
wholesalers. International TECFIDERA revenue was $149 million in the third quarter. Germany represented
approximately three-quarters of our ex-U.S. TECFIDERA revenues.
Interferon revenues, including AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $745 million. In the U.S., Q3 revenue increased 6%
compared to prior year to $482 million. Outside of the U.S., Q3 AVONEX revenue was $260 million, a decrease of 6%
compared to prior year due to increased oral competition.
TYSABRI worldwide revenue, net of hedging, was $501 million in the third quarter, an increase of 25% over the same
period last year. These results were comprised of $275 million in the U.S. and $226 million internationally. There are a
number of items of note for TYSABRI. We're now recognizing TYSABRI revenues at the full reimbursed price in
Italy. In the U.S., there were 14 shipping weeks this quarter compared to 13 weeks in the same quarter last year as
TYSABRI ships on Tuesdays. And we benefited from the benefit of a timing of a shipment in Brazil, a tender market.

Factoring in these items, TYSABRI still experienced double-digit revenue growth year-over-year.
Moving to hemophilia, ELOCTATE revenue in the third quarter, it's first quarter on the market, was $22 million.
ALPROLIX revenue in Q3 was $25 million.
Turning to our anti-CD20 franchise, RITUXAN and GAZYVA U.S. profit share was $271 million for the third quarter.
Royalties and profit share on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $20 million. The result was $291 million of net
revenue from unconsolidated joint business. This amount includes an expense of approximately $21 million related to
our share of changes in the recognition of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee in the quarter. This fee was imposed to
pharma companies as part of the Affordable Care Act. During the quarter, the IRS issued final regulations related to the
drug fee, which changed the recognition for accounting purposes from the period in which it is paid to when the sales
occur. The incremental charge this quarter represents the remaining expense for 2013 and year-to-date 2014 sales
related to RITUXAN.
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q3 cost of goods sold were $303 million or 12% of total
revenue. Q3 non-GAAP R&D expense was $416 million or 17% of revenues, which includes no new business
development activity this quarter. Q3 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $569 million or 23% of total revenue. Included
in this amount is an expense of approximately $19 million related to the previously mentioned Branded Prescription
Drug Fee. Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25%. Weighted average diluted shares were 237 million, and
we ended the quarter with approximately $3.2 billion in cash and marketable securities of which 60% is in the U.S.
In Q3, we incurred a $200 million liability as we reached $3 billion in cumulative sales of TECFIDERA and
FUMADERM in the quarter. As highlighted in our SEC filings, this relates to the TECFIDERA contingent payments,
which are being recorded as an increase to goodwill, reported on the balance sheet when incurred, and flowing through
the cash statement when paid, but not impacting the income statement. We expect to enter a period of meaningful
TECFIDERA CVR payments to the former shareholders of Fumapharm. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted
earnings per share, which were $3.80 for the third quarter, an increase of 61%.
Now let me turn to our updated full year 2014 guidance. We expect total revenue growth between 38% and 41%
compared to prior year, unchanged from prior guidance. R&D expense is unchanged yet expected to be at the low end
of the range of our previously communicated guidance between 20% and 21% of total revenues. Our full-year R&D
forecast now includes approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter for business development opportunities, a
decrease from prior guidance. This remains an important focus for the company and we continue to pursue high-quality
early and mid-stage business development opportunities.
SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 22% to 23% of total revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. We
anticipate non-GAAP EPS results between $13.45 and $13.55, and GAAP EPS to be between $12.00 and $12.10. Our
improvement in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS is primarily due to our revised assumptions with respect to
anticipated business development activity.
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments.
George A. Scangos, Ph.D.
Okay. Thanks, Paul. Look, in closing, I think the third quarter was very productive for Biogen Idec. We now have 10
marketed products, including five products in MS and two products in hemophilia. Our efforts over the coming months
will focus on continued performance of the base business, execution on the launch of new products, and innovation to
bring meaningful new therapies to patients. We plan to make TECFIDERA broadly available as we launch across
Europe and other regions around the globe. We will begin launching PLEGRIDY in the U.S. imminently, with
continued launches across Europe occurring over time. We expect to continue to grow our hemophilia franchise. We
believe ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE represent true innovation for patients and a significant long-term opportunity for
the company.

We believe that our accomplishments have set the stage for an exciting period as we look forward to 2015 and beyond.
We expect an important part of our long-term value creation for patients and shareholders will come from our pipeline
that could form the next wave of late-stage development opportunities. Our strategy for sustainable growth centers and
a deep commitment to the patient and continued innovation to develop novel medicines that address important medical
challenges. We intend to follow good science and stick to our knitting in the areas that we know best: neurology,
hematology and immunology. We believe these guiding principles position us for long-term success.
So in closing, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated employees and the patients and physicians
involved in our clinical development programs in helping us make a deep difference to patients' lives.
So thank you all for joining us this morning, and, operator, we'll now open up the call for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Your line is
open.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Maybe for Tony or Paul, it's on
TECFIDERA. It looks like the growth on a quarter-on-quarter basis, either absolute dollars or percentage basis, it looks
a bit lower in Q3 than, say, over any of the last four or five prior quarters. Was there anything sort of one-time nature
that you want to call out, or should we just assume that the drug is on a different sort of trajectory?
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Thanks, Eric. It's Tony. Nothing big on a one-time nature. I mean, inventories are
moderating I think a little bit in the channel. As always, a little probably difficult to predict exactly. But no, we've –
look, we've always expected that TECFIDERA's growth rate would moderate over time. I think we're seeing a natural
case of that. But we're very comfortable with the trajectory of the product right now. We're very comfortable, as we
talked about, the portion of new starts and switches that we're getting. So nothing that's significantly off plan from our
standpoint. In fact, I think we feel pretty good about the performance.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Your line is open.
<Q - Salim Q. Syed>: Hey, guys. This is Salim in for Mark. Thanks for all the information. On the PML patient,
George, could you just confirm if the patient had a history of being on TYSABRI. And then also I know you mentioned
100,000 patients have been treated with TECFIDERA but how many of those patients have been on drug for the same
length of time that the PML patient, which I believe you said four and a half years?
<A - George A. Scangos, Ph.D.>: Yeah, okay. Look, this patient was not on TYSABRI, but this patient did have
severe lymphopenia for three and a half years. And we believe that the length of time on TECFIDERA is not the issue.
The issue is related to lymphopenia. So we are treating this as a case that results from the lymphopenia. And so there's
a normal background rate of lymphopenia. There is lymphopenia on the TECFIDERA label, a small fraction of the
patients develop lymphopenia, and that's why screening for lymphopenia is on the label. It's caused by lots of drugs.
Okay?

<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. We've been getting feedback from
physicians that PLEGRIDY could be an attractive option relative to other beta interferons. So I'm just curious with
respect to your marketing and commercial strategy, to what extent are you going to be focused on trying to capture
share from other interferons beyond AVONEX, and how much weight do you think the improvements in convenience
might have versus perhaps some of the pricing discounts going on from some of the competitors in that space? Thanks.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Thanks, Brian. It's Tony. So, look, we really like the product profile of PLEGRIDY.
We'll repeat the theory. Interferons, as of last count, still treat more than half the patients in our markets. We think that's
declining for all the obvious reasons, but we think interferon remains an important part of the treatment set. We think
PLEGRIDY is the leading interferon and should take share from all of the interferons that are on the market today. And
I would point out when physicians look at it, they're not going to look just at the convenience benefit but they're going
to look at the total package of the efficacy and dosing schedule, and we think that's a very attractive proposition. So
yes, we think we have the potential to take share of high frequency interferons.
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much. Lots of questions, but perhaps the macro one, just go back to the
issue of sequential growth. Paul, top line, if you net out the one-time items, it looks like sequentially it was about 3%,
and it's been sort of in the 9% to 10% range for most of the past year. Obviously that wasn't going to be sustainable.
But is this the new normal when you add up all the sort of bits and pieces and components of your revenue mix? Is this
what we should be thinking going forward?
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Gosh, Geoff. As we move into 2015, we'll use the end of the year call to give our expectations
going into 2015. And obviously, that'll play into where we think 2016 goes as well. But I think that you're painting a
picture that's probably less optimistic than we think. We certainly are in early stages in TECFIDERA for the European
rollout. The majority of European TECFIDERA sales are Germany. We've moved forward with reimbursement in
number of other markets, but ahead of us is a number of larger markets and that most of those will be impacted as we
go into 2015.
We think there's still meaningful growth in TECFIDERA in the United States as we continue to penetrate docs and
penetrate the marketplace. And certainly, we're in very early days for the PLEGRIDY launch, which actually is ahead
of us in the United States. It just started with a very small amount of sales in Europe and certainly in very early days in
ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX that while it's hard to discern signal from noise early on, but the longer-term perspective
that we have is that the marketplace will move to long-acting hemophilia products, and we will play, hopefully, a
meaningful role in that
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q>: Hi. Thanks. This is [ph] John (27:39) on behalf of Michael Yee. On the TECFIDERA patient with PML, could
you just remind us, is this the first PML case in TECFIDERA, and what was the JC virus status of the patient? Also
going forward, how do you think this case may be different or similar versus the prior experience with TYSABRI?
Thank you.

<A - Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D.>: Okay. Sorry about that technical difficulty. Yes, this is the first patient with PML
on TECFIDERA that we're reporting. I think as George pointed out, it's important to note that this is a patient that was
part of the ENDORSE study and was on drug for four and a half years and for three and a half of those years had severe
lymphopenia, which we know is a risk factor for developing PML. And so it's an unfortunate circumstance that we
believe is related to the lymphopenia. Prolonged and severe lymphopenia is a risk factor. We have monitoring rules in
our label right now for checking white count, and we believe that that is the best way for physicians to manage patients
going forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe more just a high-level one. So in the slides, you
guys had called out that a portion of the market growth since the launch of TECFIDERA was attributed to this increase
in the commercially insured patient. Just wondering, what data led you to draw that conclusion, and if you can try to
quantify the benefit for us? Thank you.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Yeah, it's – thanks, Terence. It's an interesting point. Look, we think the market growth, first
and foremost, is being – the increase is driven by orals into the marketplace, and specifically TECFIDERA bringing
back quitters in particular and slowing down even the number of those patients that exit the marketplace.
In addition to that, what we've noticed over the last, call it, five years to seven years, is unemployment rates actually
have [ph] effect – (30:20) play a role in this marketplace. So when unemployment rates in the United States specifically
pop up to the high single digits, we see the impact in a slightly delayed fashion. And when they drift down, we see the
impact of that as well.
I mean, they're modest impacts but still meaningful. And then the second impact is, as we came into 2014, we think
we've gotten a little bit of a modest benefit from the Affordable Care Act. More patients being insured and moving
from essentially what was patients that we supported on a free basis to those switching over to commercial. Thanks for
the question.

Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q>: Hi. It's actually [ph] Katherine (31:17) for Ying. We just have a question on LINGO. What do you think is a
clinically meaningful improvement in VEP? 10 milliseconds, 20 milliseconds? And then what would you expect of the
placebo group? And then how much detail do you expect to disclose in January versus a presentation at a conference
next year? Thank you.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: This is Paul. I was going to take it, but I'll turn it to Al.
<A - Alfred W. Sandrock Jr., M.D., Ph.D.>: Hi. This is Al Sandrock. I don't actually look on the MVEP as a
clinically meaningful end point to begin with. We powered the study for about a 30% effect on latency, but I would
look on it more as a biological measure and not necessarily one where we can look for clinical meaningfulness.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird. Your line is now open.
<Q - Chris J. Raymond>: Just a question on TECFIDERA lifecycle management. I'm assuming you're probably not
going to want to be too descriptive of this. But we noticed a patent application that you guys filed in June describing a
deuterium-substituted DMF compound, and I guess it made us think a bit. How might this fit into your lifecycle
management efforts around TECFIDERA? And sort of, if you could maybe talk generally about the attributes you think
that could make for a meaningful improvement over the currently approved compound. Obviously outside of the IP, but
in terms of convenience, safety, that kind of stuff, that would be very helpful.
<A - George A. Scangos, Ph.D.>: Sure. First of all, great job scanning the patent literature. Look, obviously, the
lifecycle management for TECFIDERA is one of the key issues for us, and we have a lot of work going on. That
certainly is one aspect of it, but not certainly the only aspect. And we haven't gone into publicly all the things that we're
doing and things we're trying and certainly don't want to do that now. I don't think it's in our interest. Obviously if we
tell you, we tell all our competitors as well. But look, what would be the attractive life advantages? Modest changes
could be once-a-day, could be better tolerability. I think the biggest change would be increased efficacy. And so we're
working on all of those aspects.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I thought maybe now that you have the full Phase
III on daclizumab, you haven't talked about that asset a lot and maybe you could talk about how you think that could fit
in and how you might position that commercially. Thanks.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Yeah. Thanks, Matthew. It's Tony. So Phase III data was obviously very
encouraging. We believe it has an attractive product profile and has a place in the market, doing lots of more detailed
market research and positioning at this point to crisp that up. But we believe it has a nice efficacy. It has an MOA that
is interesting to many physicians that we talk to in the once-a-month subcu injectable. So the overall package is
attractive.
It's certainly something that makes sense for patients who require that level of efficacy. It could be a good switch-to
product for a lot of patients that aren't getting the efficacy that they need today. So more to come on that, but we
certainly think there's a place where we believe there's a place for it in the market.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: This is Paul. I'd just add additionally, we oftentimes think of this market as easy segments to
split up, is we're approaching 800,000 patients on disease-modifying therapies with lifelong disease that have lots of
different heterogeneous nature to the disease, so we think that actually plays well for daclizumab.

Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just about hemophilia, I was just listening to
your comments around the trends you're seeing. Curious, the 50% of the hemophilia treatment centers that are not using
the drug, how do they differ from the 50% that are? And how do you get [ph] after (35:48) those centers? And then
why do you think you're seeing so many patients [ph] there (35:52) once a week versus the twice a week patients
switch to longer acting, and what do you need to convert those patients, do you think? Thanks.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Thanks, Robyn. It's Tony. Look, I think I said, first, we're pleased to have gotten to
50% or 50-plus percent of the hemophilia treatment centers. I think we've said this is largely a patient-driven market,

meaning that's kind of where the activation comes. So as patients get interested in the proposition of the dosing regimen
for treating disease prophylactically, they are asking the hemophilia treatment centers. So we are in there talking to
them and having conversations.
We think as patients have good experience and as centers have good experience, it creates a virtuous cycle over time,
and we believe we're seeing some evidence of that as we go out and execute. So look, it's early days but the plan has
been to do that, get the patients, get the treatment centers to provide good coverage and build that virtuous cycle over
time, and we believe we're on a good path on that front.
In terms of dosing frequency, I think what I said on ALPROLIX is we believe most patients are choosing the
once-weekly which is the labeled dose. It's either once-weekly or once every 10 days. That is something that has made
sense for the majority of the patients. So I'd say that's on plan.

Love your view and opinion on the strength of your 514 dosing patent.
<A - George A. Scangos, Ph.D.>: I assume you're asking because of all the noise around Forward Pharma and their

Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Mayur I. Somaiya>: Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the questions on TECFIDERA. In the U.S., you've
gotten to – fairly rapidly have gotten to a roughly 20% market share. I mean, I just wanted to get maybe just your
thoughts on how we should think about growth going forward, factors we should consider when modeling on sales
going forward. And similarly in Europe, the sales came in a little bit below expectations, and would you attribute more
to that – would you attribute that more to the timing of country introduction, country-by-country rollout, or was there
sort of a bolus effect with the Germany [ph] late (38:39) introduction last quarter?
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Yeah, thanks, Ian. It's Tony. So look, the way to think about TECFIDERA growth is,
what portion of new starts does TECFIDERA capture. And we think – we believe TECFIDERA is capturing a nice
portion of new starts, and should. Physicians are comfortable putting new patients on it. And then the bigger question,
mathematically, is what portion of switches. And again, we believe that the product is capturing a meaningful portion
of switches.
There's a third factor which is market growth. We have said in some prior calls that the market in the U.S. has grown
faster this year than it has historically. Some of it is what Paul talked about before, which was the switch from free to
commercial patients. There's also the dynamic of the quitter pool, we think, has been favorable this year.
Essentially, TECFIDERA has probably kept people in the market who might have quit the market, so you've had some
additional growth on that standpoint. So you also have to look at how the market growth will probably moderate over
time as you get through a more one-time impact of the unemployment rate of Affordable Care, and then some of the
change in the balance in the switcher pool. But look, as I said, we believe we're capturing what we – a very attractive
portion of new starts and switches, and that's where we focus our effort. You want to talk about Europe, Paul?
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Yeah, Ian, just to add on Europe, and I think these comments are probably a repeat from last
quarter. We came into the year thinking Europe, the pace of penetration, would be underneath the pace of penetration
that we saw at TECFIDERA in the United States. We're very pleasantly surprised in Germany to see actually that being

on track or better. And we – and while Germany's the lion's share of our ex-U.S. revenue right now, all the other
countries that we've launched in, Nordics, Canada, Australia, we're seeing similar trends that we saw in Germany, in
terms of very strong uptake. So the delayed launch actually has played – it played in – we're effectively trying to do in
every country is learn from the prior launches and execute even better, and I think we're succeeding on that front.

Your next question comes from the line of Math Roden with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. I just want to better understand the potential
implications, if any, from the case of PML. And we recognize that there's a background rate of PML in lymphopenic
patients, including those with multiple sclerosis. We also know that TECFIDERA does lower lymphocyte count. Do
you think, in light of what's happened here, would you prefer that severely lymphopenic patients not be on
TECFIDERA? Do you expect that docs will reconsider use in lymphopenic patients? And lastly, do you expect that the
regulators will update the label, or will they wait for additional cases since there is a background rate in this
population? Thanks.
<A - George A. Scangos, Ph.D.>: Yeah, thanks. Those are good questions. Look, we're certainly not in a position to
make medical recommendations, right? Lymphopenia, especially prolonged lymphopenia like this patient experienced,
is a known risk factor for PML. TECFIDERA does result in lymphopenia in a small fraction of the patients who take it.
It's for that reason that screening, lymphocyte screening, is on the label.
We have reported this case to the regulatory authorities. We certainly will, as we said in the prepared script, be
discussing with them whether the language on the label is appropriate to inform patients and physicians. And what is
done with the lymphocyte results is, I think, up to the physician that's caring for those patients.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.
Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much for letting me jump in with another question. I just want to follow
up on the discussion of ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE, could you give us a sense of what proportion of patients on each
product are existing prophylaxis patients that are switching over? What proportion are new prophy patients and what
proportion is using demand? All right, look, I know the numbers are small, but it'd just be useful to see where the
majority of the uptake is coming initially.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: So I think, Geoff, it's pretty clear that the majority – the vast majority is going to be
existing prophy patients. That's the group that we expected in both cases to find the proposition of dosing frequency
most attractive. So – but I would say that's the vast majority of it. There's probably a little bit on-demand use, no signals
yet that we've seen that there is a meaningful conversion of bringing on-demand patients into prophy. We've always
said that's probably something that happens over time. So I'd say vast majority is existing.

<A - George A. Scangos, Ph.D.>: Yes. Those are good questions. Maybe I'll turn that over to Doug Williams.
<A - Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D.>: Sure. Thanks, George. Yeah, I think you can look at those hires as somewhat of a
mix of sort of building on our existing strengths. Don Johns would be a great example of that. Don is coming in to run
the clinical trial programs in ALS. As we take new compounds into the clinic, he'll be responsible for designing and
executing those studies. Chris Henderson is going to take over the research activities in Neurology Research. So again,
that just strengthens what is already a very strong group. And Chris will have the mandate to focus on new target
discovery and validation to really help push ahead with new initiatives that we have in some of our core areas like
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.
And then Olivier really represents, I think, an opportunity for us to take advantage of some of the advances that have
been made in gene therapy. I think we see that as another therapeutic modality that we want to have available to us.
Olivier's been involved in that field for some 20 years and brings a lot of expertise that can help us with both
partnerships, but also building out some of the capabilities that we'll need internally to carry that off. So it's a mix of
both expanding our capabilities and strengthening the ones that we already have.

Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Thanks for squeezing me in. Question it's for – I don't know if Tony wants to take it or Paul.
Just relating to how do we think about TECFIDERA inventory? It sounds like it's three and a half weeks. I'm trying to
get a sense, what do you think is a normal range especially given where you are sort of in the growth trajectory of the
drug? Thank you.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Yeah, good question, Yaron. The first thing I'd want to point out is it's our best estimate. Again,
I think I had mentioned that, But that's important. These things always wobble along. A therapy the size of
TECFIDERA, it's meaningful, so take it with a grain of salt. We think that each quarter – the other thing I'd level set on
is the three and a half week estimate is the combination of wholesalers and specialty pharmacies, which we've been
trying to point out from the early days. We have good visibility on wholesalers, there's a limited number of them, and
that's where our direct channel is. And we have decent visibility in the specialty pharmacies.
Over time, I would think that that will tighten up a little bit as people – early in the launch in particular, specialty
pharmacies wanted to make sure they had plenty of product on hand. So I think, if anything, over time, it tightens up a
little bit to a tighter supply chain, which is normal for other therapies and in particular other oral therapies. And we'll
try to keep everybody apprised if that happens, as it goes to the best knowledge that we have.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Great. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask, similar to a similar question on TECFIDERA
lifecycle strategy, I have one on hemophilia. So it looks to us that you have a pretty nice opportunity here with
ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX over the next couple years. But as you look out over the mid and long term, obviously,
there are other parties working on not only competing long-acting factors, but there's also other technologies being
brought to bear. And I realize that none of these other approaches are really derisked, but the question is, given your
leadership in this area, whether we should expect to see additional innovation coming out of Biogen, and bigger
picture, what's your strategy for growing the franchise over the long term? Thanks.
<A - George A. Scangos, Ph.D.>: Sure. Doug, you want to take that one?
<A - Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D.>: Yeah, as that's related to hemophilia, I think we are continuing to innovate in that
space. The first two products really represent the first two products. We have other programs further back in research,

one of which is a longer-acting version of Factor VIII that we presented some posters on. It utilizes the XTEN
technology and we think that that, if it does make it into the clinic, will really sort of get us beyond that one and a half
to two-fold half-life extension threshold that everyone seems to be caught in. All the long-acting factors for hemophilia
A are really in the sort of one and a half to two-fold half-life extension range, and this could actually double that from
what we've seen.
We're also looking into gene therapy as a possibility to extend the franchise in hemophilia. I think it's sort of a general
rule that when we move into an area and have programs and products that emerge from the pipeline, that we continue to
innovate in those fields where we think that there's opportunities to improve upon existing products. So hemophilia is
one area we're doing that, obviously, MS we continue to do that. That's just sort of a natural part of the lifecycle for any
therapeutic area we're in.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thanks for the follow-up. I guess I'll ask the capital allocation question again, and I know
you've been getting asked from time to time. You've got over $3 billion on the balance sheet now, Paul. You've been
saying that, I think, tuck-in acquisitions have been your favorite use of cash, but we haven't seen any of those of late.
And you've now reduced the guidance for bus dev in the back half of this year. So, are you not seeing the
opportunities? Are you changing strategy? What should we expect in the future?
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Thanks, Eric, for the question. Let me kind of address the second part of your question on the
bus dev thing. The pipeline of business development activity, the strategic intents, I think our – I personally think our
capabilities are at an all-time high. And it's just that you just never know when these things can turn into a deal. And as
a result, it gets a little bit bumpy quarter-to-quarter early in the year. Obviously the Eisai transaction, the Sangamo
transaction, impacted the R&D line. Third quarter just didn't really have anything. And I think that's continual way to
expect it. It's just – it's hard to then translate that into a guidance, so we all just have to be mindful of that.
More broadly, we certainly still believe those – bad word for it – but tuck-in acquisitions are a – it's part and parcel to
the business that we're in, but it's really all about the mission that we have and delivering – it has the potential to deliver
outsized shareholder value returns. We've seen that over the last 10-plus years.
As we move into 2015, we'll probably open and look towards figuring out what's the best way to return capital to
shareholders as the cash flow continues to generate. As I also pointed out, just want to make sure everybody's mindful
of, we do expect to have meaningful CVR payments to the former owners of TECFIDERA, which is going to be
captured into the cash flow statement as well. So I think it's kind of largely continued as we have and with a pretty
decent intent to rebuild the early and mid-stage pipeline.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird. Your line is open.
<Q - Chris J. Raymond>: Hey, thanks. Just a follow-up here on TECFIDERA. So we've done some of our own work
on the discontinuation rate, and at least from what docs are telling us, it looks like it's fairly flat and kind of consistent
with what DEFINE and CONFIRM showed. Can you guys maybe talk about the trends you're seeing there? Are we
right or is there some other sort of dynamic we should think about?
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Yeah, thanks, Chris. It's Tony. I think that's consistent with what we're seeing. As
we've said before, the discontinuation rates are – we expect to be similar to other inline therapies over time. We think
that – we believe that physicians are learning to manage the GI and tolerability issues, but you're still going to get some
drop-out with that. So we believe that your analysis is probably in line with what we're seeing.

<Q>: Hi. Thanks for the follow up. This is [ph] John (54:26) again, on for Michael Yee. I don't think this was
addressed on today's call, but for anti-LINGO on the last earnings call, it was noted that the data from the optic neuritis
studies will be expected in January of next year. I just wanted to confirm, is that still the guidance?
And as for the top line announcement we can expect, it's been quite a while since we've last seen a Biogen press release
on a mid stage proof-of-concept program. So for the anti-LINGO disclosure, how much data can we expect? Would it
be something [ph] detailed with numerics (54:53) from the multiple end points, or just a simple short commentary
whether it hit or the trends, et cetera? Thank you.
<A - George A. Scangos, Ph.D.>: Okay. Sure. Yeah, we're still on track for January. As to the data that we'll show, we
will – look, the goal here is to be as open as we can about the data without jeopardizing our ability to publish the data in
a peer-reviewed journal and have it accepted at a major meeting. Those are always the things that companies try and
trade off. So I can't tell you exactly what will be in the press release, but we will certainly be as explicit as we can with
those caveats.
