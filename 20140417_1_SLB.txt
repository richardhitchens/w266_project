Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per
share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.21. This is $0.14 lower sequentially, but $0.24
higher when compared to the same quarter last year.
As a reminder, during the second quarter of last year, we wound down our operations in Iran and classified the results
of the business as a discontinued operation and all prior period amounts have been restated.
Oilfield Services first quarter revenue of $11.2 billion decreased 5.6% sequentially, while the pre-tax operating margins
declined 80 basis points. Approximately half of the $667 million, sequential revenue decrease was a result of the
absence of the year-end surge in the product, software and multiclient sales that we experienced last quarter.
The remainder of the decrease was largely attributable to the seasonal weather-related slowdowns that we typically
experienced in Q1. These factors also accounted for the sequential decline in margins. Given the significant impact that
these seasonal factors had on our sequential performance, my comments will focus on year-on-year changes unless
otherwise noted.
Oilfield Services revenue increased 6.3% year-on-year, while pre-tax operating margins grew by 248 basis points.
Highlights by product group were as follows. Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.9 billion increased 1.8%, while
margins grew by 129 basis points to 27.3%. These increases are primarily attributable to a very strong performance in
Wireline on improved offshore exploration activity.
Drilling Group revenue of $4.3 billion increased 6.6%, and margin improved by 249 basis points to 20.3%. These
improvements were due to increased technology integration and robust drilling and measurement and M-I SWACO
activities in the Middle East and Asia.
Production Group of $4.1 billion increased 9.5%, while margin grew by 313 basis points to 17.9%. This growth was
driven primarily by a very strong performance by Well Services in North America land despite the severe weather.
Now, turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 22.6% in the first
quarter compared to 22.3% in the previous quarter. We generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations.
Net debt increased $610 million during the quarter to $5.1 billion, reflecting the consumption of working capital that
we typically experienced during Q1, driven by the annual payments associated with employee compensation. At 18%
of last 12-month revenue, working capital was lower in both absolute terms as well as percentage terms against the
same quarter of last year.
Additionally, we spent $899 million on our stock buyback program during Q1. We repurchased almost 10 million
shares at an average price of $90.31 during the quarter. As you know, back in July of last year, our board approved a
new $10 billion share repurchase program. To-date, we have repurchased $2.6 billion of shares under this program.
During the quarter, we spent $864 million on CapEx. We generated $688 million of free cash flow compared to $127
million in the same period last year. As it relates to full year 2014, CapEx is still expected to be approximately $3.8
billion as compared to the $3.9 billion we spent in 2013.
And now, I will turn the conference call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard
Thank you, Simon. In spite of severe winter weather impacting activity in our Russia, China and North America land
operations, our first quarter results were solid and fully in line with our expectations. Sequentially, revenue dipped from
the fourth quarter as a result of seasonal slowdown in activity and lower product and multiclient seismic sales, but grew

year-over-year by just north of 6% while pre-tax operating income increased by 21% to yield an incremental margin of
60%.
The driving force behind these results is further market share gains on the back of growing new technology sales and
expanding integration related activity as well as our relentless focus on operational excellence and efficiency.
In terms of revenue progression by customer group, our year-over-year growth was driven by the NOCs and the
independents which now represent more than 70% of our revenue, while overall activity for the IOCs was more or less
flat.
In the first quarter, we generated close to $700 million of free cash flow, which is an improvement of almost $550
million compared to the same quarter last year. Based on the growing strength of our free cash flow, we have decided
to accelerate our current $10 billion stock buyback program, announced in July of last year with the aim of completing
the program in two-and-a-half years versus the original target of five years. This does not change how we intend to use
our cash, where the priority continues to be a reinvestment in the business to drive growth while we remain
opportunistic when it comes to M&A and also plan to review dividend levels each year.
The acceleration of the buyback program is more a reflection of the confidence we have in our business performance
and outlook, and a signal of our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Our international business continue to perform well in the first quarter. The seasonal impact of weather and lower
product sales resulted in a sequential drop in revenue of 8%. However, pre-tax operating margins were resilient at
22.8%, down only 73 basis points from the fourth quarter.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, revenue was up 5% on the back of strong growth in the Middle East and
Asia, while pre-tax operating margins expanded by 286 basis points, driven by new technology sales and strong focus
on costs and resource management.
In terms of pricing, the international market remains highly competitive and we are not seeing any signs of a general
pricing inflection. However, our latest technology and our best-in-class service quality continue to carry a premium,
which together with the growth in integration-related activity is reflected in our revenue per rig pricing indicator which
is up compared to the first quarter of last year.
The improvement in effective pricing together with our ongoing transformation programs focused on reliability and
efficiency, puts us in a very competitive position in the international markets, which we are using to drive both market
share gains and to expand our margins.
In Latin America, revenue was down 12% sequentially, while operating margins were essentially flat at 21.1%.
Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue was down 8%. However, pre-tax operating income was flat due to
proactive cost and resource management and also supported by our broad and diverse contract base in the region.
The year-over-year reduction in revenue was predominantly driven by Brazil, where both activity and pricing were
significantly down compared to last year. Still, introduction of new technology and swift actions to right-size the
resource base in the country has enabled us to minimize the negative financial impact from the lower activity.
In Mexico, revenue was also down compared to the first quarter of last year, driven by lower budget spend from
Pemex, both on land and offshore. The Pemex Mega Tender process was concluded during the quarter, and we have
signed contracts worth $1.9 billion, which represents nearly half of the awarded work scope covering all the major
projects in the south and north regions.
The resource mobilization for the additional project is ongoing and will be concluded during the second and third
quarter as we gradually ramp-up the activity.
In Argentina, year-over-year growth was strong, driven by rig-based activity in the Vaca Muerta shale, where we also
actively engaging with a number of customers on subsurface studies and on projects to improve drilling and completion
efficiency.

In Venezuela, activity was also up year-over-year and we continue to work closely with PDVSA to help them grow
production and improve operational efficiency. And, in Ecuador, we posted strong growth compared to the first quarter
of last year as we continue to progress on the Shushufindi SPM project where we again set the new production record
during the quarter.
We also secured a right to negotiate for two additional blocks of fields in the country, in the latest production incentive
[ph] big round (11:53) that took place in the first quarter, and these commercial discussions have already started.
In the Middle East and Asia, revenue decreased 3% sequentially, while operating margins were essentially flat at
26.3%. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 19%, and margins were up by 349 basis points.
In the Middle East, year-over-year growth was again driven by Saudi Arabia where we continue to move in resources
to keep pace with the additional work we are taking on; and also by the United Arab Emirates where activity is at a
record high.
In southern Iraq, activity was down significantly compared to the same quarter last year as contract awards are delayed
due to ongoing discussions between the IOCs and the government. Based on this as well as the upcoming elections, we
do not expect any significant recovery in activity in southern Iraq in the coming quarters, and we are therefore already
taking actions to right-size our resource base.
Activity in northern Iraq, on the other hand, was solid in the first quarter, and we expect strong growth there in 2014,
leaving full-year revenue for the country flat with 2013 and the operating margins approaching the average of the
region.
Southeast Asia posted strong first quarter results, driven by high deepwater activity throughout the region, solid SPM
performance in Malaysia, and very good drilling performance in our IPM project in Queensland, Australia. In China,
we continue to ramp-up activity on our tight-gas SPM project with Yanchang Petroleum in the Ordos basin, and we
were operating a total of 12 rigs at the end of the first quarter.
In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue was down 11% sequentially and operating margins were down by 220 basis points.
However, compared to the same quarter last year, when the majority of the Framo activity was still included in our
ECA numbers, revenue grew by 1% and margins were up by 253 basis points.
The year-over-year revenue growth in the region was also negatively impacted by severe winter weather in Russia as
well as the weakening of the ruble that took place during the quarter. Still, the underlying activity, both offshore and on
land in Russia remains firm for the year.
There were also several positive activity signs in parts of Europe and Africa that helped offset the first quarter
headwinds in Russia. In Norway, we posted solid year-over-year growth driven by market share gains for our drilling
services, and we expect to see further growth in the second quarter as the seismic season starts, and where we – this
year, we'll have particular focus on the Barents Sea.
We have also been awarded a five-year integrated well construction contract by Det norske for exploration and drilling
activity where we will play an integral part of both the planning and execution process.
And in West Africa, we also posted strong year-over-year growth, driven by both exploration and development work in
several of the Gulf of Guinea countries, and we still expect strong growth in 2014 in the region, in particular from
Angola, Gabon, and Chad.
In North America, we posted a strong quarter with revenue up 1% sequentially while margins were down 107 basis
points to 18.5%, driven by pricing pressure and severe winter weather on land as well as drilling delays in the Gulf of
Mexico. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew 12%, while margins were down 53 basis points.
On land, we posted strong year-over-year growth in revenue, driven by market share gains and new technology uptake
in pressure pumping as well as solid growth in our artificial lift business where we continue to expand our market
position in the rod lift market.

Our margins on land were impacted by lower pricing in pressure pumping as we rolled over several key contracts at the
end of last year, and we also chose to incur additional sand transportation and fuel costs during the periods of severe
winter weather to avoid any disruption to our customers' operations.
In the Gulf of Mexico, deepwater drilling activity was down compared to the first quarter of last year due to a series of
operational delays, longer completion times, and more workover activity, and this impacted several of our product
lines. However, the situation is expected to normalize again in the second quarter and the outlook for deepwater drilling
activity in the Gulf of Mexico remains strong for the full-year.
Turning to technology. In 2013, we saw further growth in the rate of high-impact commercializations from our R&E
organization. This together with significant improvements in the out-of-box performance of our new products had a
clear impact on our financial results as presented in last month's Howard Weil Conference in New Orleans. In 2014, we
expect this trend to continue with a wide range of new technologies scheduled for introduction to the market at the rate
that will even surpass 2013.
We will showcase a number of these new technologies in our investor events that will take place June 24th and 25th in
New York. In addition to the latest technologies from Reservoir Characterization and Drilling, we will present a range
of new production-related technologies, including a revolutionary intelligent completion system, our latest multistage
completion technology, a new fracturing fluid innovation, and we will give you an update on our North American land
artificial lift business where we see strong growth potential for both ESPs and rod pump sales.
Together with these technology presentations, we will review progress on our ongoing transformation programs and
also provide an updated financial outlook for the coming three-year period.
Moving onto the macro picture, the global economic data has been mixed so far this year, with the U.S. suffering an
unusually harsh winter, China showing some signs of slowdown, although still projected to grow around 7.5% in 2014,
and the situation in Ukraine adding a new risk to the outlook. However, the fundamentals of the global recovery remain
intact, as the above factors are likely to only have a temporary impact.
In contrast to this, the oil markets have been significantly tighter than anticipated, as strong demand trends in the
OECD and in the Middle East, together with continuing supply disruptions in various regions have led to lower spare
capacity figures and pushed OECD stocks down to the largest deviation from historical averages since 2003.
The North American supply surge continues to be just enough to equal the world's growing demand, while all other
growth regions including Iraq, Brazil and the Caspian are struggling to meet their production targets. This should
continue to support oil prices around $100 per barrel and, therefore, encourage oil-directed investments in both the
North American and international markets.
U.S. natural gas demand reached a new all-time record in Q1 due to the severe winter weather pushing prices to a
six-year high. However, U.S. supply trends remain strong on the back of the Marcellus. And as the weather normalizes
over the spring and summer months, we expect the North American market to return to a balanced supply-demand
situation for natural gas.
International gas markets remain relatively tight, largely driven by Chinese demand, which continues to grow at
double-digit rates while European gas demand has eased in the past months on a mild winter.
Based on these market conditions, we continue to expect well-related E&P spend to grow by more than 6% in 2014,
with spend growth relatively balanced between North America and the international markets.
We further expect our year-over-year growth in 2014 to be driven by the NOCs and the independents. After several
years of strong growth, our revenue from the IOCs has dropped over the past few quarters, and was in Q1 flat
compared to the same quarter last year.
However, the first quarter should be the low point for IOC revenue this year as our latest activity outlook indicate
sequential revenue growth from this customer group in the coming quarters, and with full year revenue expected to be
flat with 2013.

Equally important to the level of E&P spend and the way we translate this into revenue is our ability to convert the
top-line growth into profits. While we plan to deliver solid incremental margins on the challenging market conditions in
North America, we see potential for higher levels in our international business as demonstrated by our first quarter
year-over-year incremental margins of 86%.
We're not likely to maintain these levels throughout 2014, but our international incremental margin potential should
offer strong support to our earnings growth in the coming year.
Furthermore, our broad geographical footprint, our balanced technology portfolio, and our agile organization provides
us with insulation for market downsides as recently seen in Latin America, and allows us to swiftly capitalize on
market opportunities, whether in North America or anywhere else in the world.
We therefore remain positive and optimistic with respect to the 2014 outlook as we continue to aim for solid
double-digit growth in earnings per share, fueled by a combination of top-line growth, margin expansion, and the
acceleration of our current stock buyback program.
That concludes my remarks. We will now open up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] First question comes from the line of David Anderson from JPMorgan. Please go
ahead.
<Q - David Anderson>: Thanks. Good morning, Paal. I just wonder if you could expand a bit on your comments with
the IOCs. So 30% of your business, it looks kind of flat. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of headlines about IOCs cutting
CapEx. I was wondering if you could put that into context for us a little bit. Can you help us understand how you see
this progressing? Is it simply a function of day rates and, when day rates come down, the projects start moving ahead? I
was just wondering if you can help us how you see that kind of progressing throughout the year?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Okay. So let me first clarify one thing. So I said that the IOCs are now making up well below
30%. So it has dropped over the past couple of quarters. So we have already seen a reduction in their spend. And what
we're saying is that, it's already flat now year-over-year. The forecast we have from the various geomarkets [ph] are
rolled up (23:09) indicates progression in the next couple of quarters, and we see the full year basically being flat
year-over-year.
Now, what's driving that? As we've said before, we believe that the primary focus of the CapEx cuts from the IOCs will
be on projects that are heavy on infrastructure and probably less so on the well-related CapEx, although we have seen
some impact of this as well.
<Q - David Anderson>: So if I think about kind of the exploration spend side of that, I guess, that's the part that I
wonder the most about. It seems like that might be a little bit more at risk than, say, the development CapEx. Can you
talk about that from that standpoint and how that could impact the WesternGeco, because obviously you guys have
more exploration risk. So just kind of help us kind of quantify, is that a risk for you going forward this year? Or are you
seeing – are you feeling pretty good about that exploration spend even with these kind of chatter about the cuts out
there?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: We haven't really changed our view on exploration spend or the seismic spend since the
January call. We still expect to see growth in exploration spend in 2014. It's going to be lower than 2013. And within
the exploration spend, we see flattening or flat seismic spend. And the growth is going to come through well-related
spend, through appraisal and exploration, that type of drilling. So we have really changed the view on either
exploration or seismic from the January call. That was already factored into the plan.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of James West from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - James C. West>: Hey. Good morning, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - James C. West>: Want to just step into the North America for a second. Clearly, the rig count trends have been a
little bit better than, I think, most people anticipated early in the year. How do you see the progress for your business in
North America going forward? Is it more that you're going to gain margin and share from technology? Or do you
actually see some pricing power developing?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, if you look at Q1, first of all, in terms of our performance, we saw very strong
year-over-year growth, as I said, with revenue of 12%. And it is a combination of market share gains and new
technology uptake, and we continue to gain share in pressure pumping. And this is on the back of efficiency gains and
new technology uptake, and we added another two fleets in Q1 from our idle asset program.
Now, in terms of activity outlook for North America, on land, we expect solid activity growth in U.S. land in 2014. We
see this being led by South and West Texas. And in addition to the number of wells, we also see supported by, again,
efficiency gains and further uptake of new technology.
In terms of Canada, the breakup is going to have the normal impact on Q2, and we see Canada slightly up compared to
2013. And in Gulf of Mexico, Q1 was slow for us because of lower deepwater drilling activity. We see this coming
back in Q2 and onwards. So a strong outlook again for Gulf of Mexico.
<Q - James C. West>: Okay. So you do it in the Gulf, but this was, I think, a 11 or so deepwater rigs scattered into the
Gulf in the second half of this year. You do see all those rigs come in, going to work, and seen a big uptick in the
second half of this year?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, we do. And, also, the number of rigs in Q1 wasn't really the problem. We generated less
revenue. Although we have completion work there, the amount of revenue per day in completion mode versus full
drilling mode is obviously significantly less. So there was not a rig count issue, was an activity type of issue in Q1.
<Q - James C. West>: Okay. Got it. Thanks, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Thanks a lot. Paal, just taking one step back and I want to just have you clarify a little bit a high
level question. You mentioned that the oil markets are tighter than once anticipated, and I know you don't like talking
about client production or anything like that. But once you made a statement, I feel I can ask you to elaborate a little bit
more on it. I think consensus has probably never been more divided on where oil prices are going. And this year and
next year are meant to be the big sort of surge in production from and, as you highlighted, Brazil, Iraq, Caspian and, of
course, North America. So what is it that you see here that you don't think the other – all that causes you to make that
statement?

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think if you want to build a very kind of bullish case on production, I'm sure you can
do that, is just that if you go back and look at the previous years, there is always an element of project delays and
production disruption. And what we said in January is that we expect there to be a normal dose of that in 2014, and so
far this year we have seen that. So the market is still relatively tight, OECD stocks are down, OpEx space capacity is
down. And there is nothing dramatic in it other than that all the things aren't lining up as maybe the bull case was at the
beginning of the year for production.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Will you tie that to what you see at the customer level of increased project delays now with IOCs
being more capital disciplined or taking a step back, having to borrow for their dividends? Is this something that you
think permanently delayed? I mean, how have you changed your view on, let's say, 2017, let's say longer term supply
growth as a function of what's going on at a CapEx level at the moment?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think what's going to happen at least over the next couple of years is that the IOCs will
focus more of their spend where they can drill wells and generate production from existing infrastructure or from
infrastructure that cost less, so huge infrastructure projects. I would expect to be kind of lower in frequency and some
of them might be postponed as we have already seen, while the focus again is going to be on generating production
which generates cash. So the ability to do that at the lowest possible investment, I think, is going to be the focus, which
is still good for us.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: So does that mean that you're more than positive on the areas like the North Sea, let's say, mature
areas, the Gulf of Mexico, than what you will be on frontier exploration like Arctic Russia or Barents Sea?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think for the frontier areas, you will still see exploration. I think there is still a push
towards delineating and trying to assess what these frontiers contain. So I think although there is lower growth in
exploration this year, I still think there's going to be a lot of interest to try to assess what kind of potential these areas
have. Now, how the economics of the projects will stack up and when development starts, that will – I think, is going to
be a function of what they find and what the economics look like. But I still think there'll be a push towards doing
exploration in frontier areas, yes.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay. And finally back to the U.S., again, you had a very impressive growth. You highlight that
this was market share gains through new technology. Could you kind of help us understand a little bit now how much
was market share gains on new technology and how much did the underlying market grow by, in your view?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, if you look at the overall rig count, it was up about 4.5% year-over-year. And I would
say partly offsetting that growth also was inefficiencies due to the weather, right? So a fair bit of this I think, for us, is
market share as well as new technology. So I'm not going to give you a detailed number, which I'm sure you know. But
I'm quite pleased with how we are continuing to progress, in particular in the pressure pumping market. We added
about four fleets in Q3, one fleet in Q4, and another two fleets in the first quarter of this year. And this is all at decent
incremental margins, so we're pleased with how we're progressing.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Anything on the technology side you can share or do you want to wait to do it?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I've already said a lot more about them, what we normally do. So I think that's going to
be it.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thanks.

spend and so on, in great detail. So thanks for that. Question I would have would be, how do you risk assess from this
point forward, right? You put out your targets, you kind of take a look at what's going on with the offshore elements. It
looks like the offshore rig market is still kind of on a slide downward.
So from this point forward, Paal, if you were to look at the offshore market, how would you risk assess it from here?
What do you think is the biggest driver? Is it more – what's the risk on activity is really what I'm trying to ask you,
from your standpoint. Is it Brazil? Is it outside of Brazil? Where – how do you see that dynamic splitting up?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, if you're focusing in on deepwater where I think the biggest discussion has been, this is
where the biggest projects are and this is where the biggest discussion around rig rates are, right? We looked at it in
detail. And if you look at a deepwater market, it's really two separate stories; you have Brazil and you have the rest of
the world.
In 2013, Brazil represented around 30% of the global deepwater drilling activity. And in Q1 of 2014, Brazil was 20%
down in activity while the rest of the world was up 3%. Now, for the full-year of 2014, we expect Brazil to be down
more than 20% versus last year, while the rest of the world we see as being up high-single-digits. And as we previously
indicated in January, the growth in the rest of the world deepwater is going to be driven by Sub-Saharan Africa and
Gulf of Mexico, so really no change to that. And we also see decent growth in both exploration as well as development
for deepwater.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: And then if you take that information, Paal, and you roll that up into your outlook for 2014 from
a total international revenue growth standpoint, how should we think about that? Is that kind of mid-single-digit or
double-digit – still double-digit growth? How would you look at the international revenue dynamic for the year?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, if you look at the activity outlook or revenue outlook for us in the international markets,
again, we see well-related CapEx spend growing north of 6%, and it's going to again be driven by both land and
offshore.
There are a few offsetting factors versus what we said in January. So if we quickly go through those, we do see solid
growth in deepwater drilling activity, excluding Brazil. In Latin America, specifically, we now see this as being flat,
driven by low revenue, in particular in Brazil, but also to a certain extent in Mexico.
In Europe and Africa, we are still showing good growth and basically in line with the previous outlook. In Russia, the
activity outlook is unchanged, but the revenue will potentially be lower due to the currently weaker ruble. So what's
going to happen with the ruble as the year progresses, we'll have to see. But if it stays where it is now, then revenue's
going to be somewhat lower than what we initially expected, while activity is the same.
Now, Middle East and Asia is stronger than we initially expected, and that's driven by several countries in the Middle
East as well as Australia. So that's kind of how we see overall international.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Right. And then one last follow up, one of the key drivers for the margin performance and
earnings performance over the last couple of years has been this internal dynamic for technology and excellence and
execution and everything else. As you look out at the North American market going forward, you've now established
firm leadership versus your peer group. Do you expect the excellence and execution program in technology if your peer
group were to grow margins by 100 basis points or 200 basis points? Is that something that you think you can keep
pace with or exceed given the dynamics in play right now?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, like you say, we've outperformed our competitors in terms of both top line growth and
margin evolution [ph] now since, what, (35:36) mid-2012. So at this stage, I'm quite pleased with our position, both on
land and offshore in North America. So we expect to maintain our margin leadership and, at the same time, grow faster
in revenue. So if our competitors can grow by 100 basis points and 200 basis points, I don't see why we cannot do the
same or exceed it.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. All right. Paal, thank you so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Co. Please go ahead.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thanks. Good morning. Paal, so at a recent industry gathering, you offered some
interesting commentary about industry challenges and you referenced the fact that E&P CapEx over the last 10 years
had grown by 400% whereas oil production was up only 15%. And you mentioned the fact that in the E&P value chain,
the oil companies were the ultimate integrators of all the technical work associated with finding hydrocarbons and the
collective oil services community was accountable for not delivering on required performance progress.
And you also mentioned that the required improvement was not going to come from yet another round of
procurement-driven price reductions across the E&P value chain. So along those lines, as the industry is in an
introspective mood [ph] where the IOCs and deepwater NOCs (36:53) in terms of getting their deepwater costs in
alignment, apart from the mix shift from infrastructure to well CapEx, what structural reforms are your clients
contemplating, implementing, and the discussions you're having with your clients along those lines?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think if you look at the short-term actions they're taking today, they're looking at
bringing the deepwater rig rates down. I mean, if you look at what's happened on deepwater day rates over the past
three years, four years, five years, they have increased significantly, and they have been completely disconnected from
the other deepwater oilfield services, right?
So today, the rig rental makes up around 50% of the deepwater well costs. So our customers have really been looking
for the opportunity to get the rig rental rates down. And the opportunity is here in form of the high number of new
arrivals, old contract expiring, and a significant reduction in activity in Brazil. So I think this is the opportunity in the
short-term they're trying to get some relief on cost.
Now, my comments in terms of a procurement-driven exercise across the industry, is more focused in on we need to
basically drive up the technical performance as an industry, whether that is process efficiency or reliability of the
projects that we execute. So what some of our customers are doing is they are approaching us a lot more than in the
past in terms of doing fully integrated projects, where we are a lot more engaged in the upfront planning and design of
the work and where we have more performance-based contracts in terms of how we execute the work as well.
So these are some of the short-term actions that they're taking. And I think beyond that, I think the service industry
needs to take responsibility in terms of finding way of transforming themselves to drive both their internal efficiencies
and their technical performance versus the customers. That is how we can create more value and support our customers.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. And, secondly, coming out of the last quarter, you offered some helpful, I guess,
parameters for the first quarter earnings possibilities. Do you have just high level broad commentary with regard to
what we should be focused on with regard to second quarter earnings possibilities?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, if you look at Q2, we should see seasonal recovery in Russia and China, and also less
weather impact in U.S. land. Now, this is going to be partly offset by the normal spring break up in Canada, which has
already started. And, beyond this, we're expecting steady growth in the underlying business as per the other discussions
we've had so far today. So our aim for the second quarter is to bring Q2 EPS back to the level of Q4 of last year. That
is, for us, a good target.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. Thank you, sir.

<Q - James K. Wicklund>: Good morning. And, Bill Herbert, thank you for asking the question and, Paal, thank you
for the answer on the integrated projects. Let me carry that on. You mentioned several times in the press release about
integrated projects, their accretion to margins. Can you talk about performance-related contracts and what those returns
look like relative to the rest of your business?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I mean, in general, Jim, the performance-based contracts are accretive to our margins. So
we take on performance-based contracts where we have a pretty good handle on the environment that we operate in.
We have a very good handle on how our customers are operating and are interfacing and supporting our operations and,
also, what kind of controls we have to drive performance.
So I would say, in general, our performance-based contracts and a lot of them are within the Drilling Group if you take
away the production incentive contracts. They are generally accretive to our margins. And if you look at the Drilling
Group margin evolution over the past two years, three years, you see a very steady improvement from the time we took
over Smith in, back in 2010.
<Q - James K. Wicklund>: Okay. Thank you for that. My follow-up question is, your self-help efforts, your
transformational efforts internally, those mean a lot and they're structural and will last for a long time. Which markets
do you see those efforts having the biggest impact in over the next two years to three years?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think they will have impact globally. We piloted some of these things in North
America when we did the initial restructuring of North America land back in – when we started in 2010, and that's been
some of the basis for our improvements in North America over the past three years, four years. But what we're doing is
now starting to pilot in small scale in various other parts of the world, and this is going to take several years before we
get fully implemented. But at the end of the day, the transformation programs that I've been talking about publicly over
the past year will impact all parts of the company, both geographically and in terms of technology.
<Q - James K. Wicklund>: Okay. And, if I could, in the – when we look at a globe of the world, what area, what
region, do you think has the best upside to margins over the next two years to three years?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: It's difficult to pinpoint. I would say that, as I said in my prepared remarks, if you look at
incremental margins, we are going to focus in on driving incremental margins throughout our business. With some of
the, I would say, challenges in particularly in North America land with – that we've been facing on pricing, it is still
more difficult to drive very high incremental margins in North America although we are going to try. But the overall
international markets, I still think has significant incremental margin potential. And as I also mentioned,
year-over-year, Q1, we had 86% incremental margins in international.
<Q - James K. Wicklund>: Okay. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Appreciate it, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Crandall from Cowen. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Thank you. Paal, if well-based CapEx is up 6% globally, is that an environment that you can
grow your revenues in double digits?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: It's a difficult question to answer. I mean, is it possible? Yes. Are we going to get to double
digits? I can't really say and I wouldn't commit to it. But the fact that we have the potential of growing our revenues
higher than the 6% is – I think, is very clear.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Okay. Second question, Paal, is getting back to North American pricing, for today's
technology, not newer technology, but is a 6% increase in well-based CapEx in the U.S. in 2014 sufficient to drive
pricing anywhere in the U.S. in any product lines for, again, today's technology?

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I think, overall, I don't think 6% is going to be sufficient to have a widespread price increase in
commodity type of technologies. Now, you might have small pockets where there is a surge of activity and there's
insufficient capacity to deliver. You might have situations where new technologies are introduced or where efficiencies
are stepped up, where you can drive your effective pricing. But, at this stage, I would say that we are expecting North
America land pricing overall, we are hoping it's going to flatten from where it is now. That's the going to be the
forecast, I would say, that we have going forward. And then we are looking on top of that to drive up our effective
pricing through a new technology introduction and by driving efficiency of our operations.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Okay. Good answer. And then last question. Paal, you talked about Brazil, what is the risk in
your opinion of continued slides in activity in Brazil throughout this year and even into 2015? It seems like every rig
that's coming off contract, they're releasing.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, as I already said, I think Brazil activity – Brazil revenue for us this year is going to be
significantly down versus 2013. It's a combination of both activity as you say as well as the pricing on the new
contracts that we took on during 2013. So there's no surprise that Brazil revenue is going to be down significantly. And
that's already factored into these discussions and the outlook that I've been giving today.

Your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Thank you. Paal, you mentioned before of China, there was some weakness in the quarter.
Where do you see the outlook? Is this temporary? And then what's going on there for the year and beyond?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, we still expect solid growth in China in 2014. It's going to be a bit lower than 2013,
partly due to some of these budget reductions that we have seen from the NOCs. But our focus in the China land
market is very much on penetrating it further. And if you look at our overall penetration of that market, it is still very
low. So we aren't immediately impacted significantly by these budget reductions.
We are seeing significantly high demand for our new technology, for our technical expertise and also for project
management. So that's why we're still quite optimistic about China. And growth is going to be driven by land, both in
terms of conventional type gas and shale gas. And offshore is also going to continue to be solid. So I would say solid
growth in 2014, a bit lower than 2013.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Okay, great. And then in the Middle East, seems to be pretty active area as you mentioned. Is
there a way to quantify what kind of revenue growth could be possible from the Middle Eastern areas; Saudi Arabia,
UAE, Kuwait, that area?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: There is a way, yes, and we have done it. But I'm not going to share the outlook with you in
great detail other than we see it – we saw it as a major growth driver for 2014, and it has confirmed its potential and it
might even be slightly up in April versus where we thought it would be in January.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: So could we be in the upper teens growth rate there or mid-teen growth rates in that kind of
range?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I'm not going to give you a number. You can look at the Q1 year-over-year number, which was
pretty solid.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I found your comments on southern Iraq interesting. I know
Iraq had been one of the five countries, I think, you had outlined previously as kind of the highest growth markets for
you. Has there been any change in terms of your thought on Iraq in general here and how that proceeds for
Schlumberger [ph] as you think might (48:42) going forward and maybe just on a year-over-year basis?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, for 2014, the main change has been that the activity in the south is going to be down,
and this is mainly driven by ongoing discussions between the IOCs and the ministry. There are things that they need to
sort out and agree upon before they will move forward and award some of these lump sum turnkey contracts that are
pending.
So until that happens, there isn't going to be a lot of work awarded in the south. And with the upcoming elections, we
don't think that that situation and these bids are going to be awarded in the next couple of quarters. We think that is
probably a late year event before it happens. So that's why activity in southern Iraq for this year is going to be down.
Now, offsetting this is very strong activity growth in northern Iraq. And here we have an excellent market position, it's
a lot focused on high-end exploration. And we are able to offset the reduced activity and revenue in the south with
growth in the north so that 2014 Iraq revenue is going to be flat year-over-year and the margins are also now quickly
approaching the average for the region. So overall, somewhat downgrading of the growth in Iraq, but both margins and
as well as the offsetting factor of the north is positives.
<Q - William Sanchez>: My follow-up would be, I know you spent some time talking about the top-line expectations
in Latin America and the headwinds in Brazil. Your commentary on Mexico, I think, as least as we start to think about
exiting 2014 on a year-over-year basis seemed more positive. Just thoughts there in terms of when you perhaps see
year-over-year growth in Mexico, I guess number one.
My follow up [ph] to it (50:36) would be just on the margins in Latin America, you've done a pretty good job of
holding those relatively flat. Perhaps I missed it, but I don't think I heard any thoughts on the margin growth if we
should expect that to move forward here in Latin America or just is relatively flat a good expectation?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, I think overall for Latin America, I think, flat is a good word. I think we see overall
revenue to be flattish this year and we are going to work very hard on maintaining our margins around the levels that
we had in 2013. So, so far this year, that's worked out well, and we will continue to focus in on that growth. So,
obviously, a significant negative on Brazil, which we already talked about.
Mexico is more of a positive story, but in the short-term here what we see is a lot more budget discipline from Pemex
and also a little bit more hesitance towards spend as this ongoing reform process proceeds. But, as you know, we have
some significant wins in the Mega Tenders, where we have gained significant shares and we will be ramping up
activity in Q2 and into H2. So we expect to be exiting Mexico this year on a pretty good note and that will be a good
driver for us in 2015.

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yes. So we are interested in North American land artificial lift markets and we have followed
it for some time. There is clearly significant growth potential there. It's a huge market. There are hundreds of thousands
of wells that installed rod lifts, and we see a significant opportunity to apply more science and technology into this
market and also to help drive production and cost per barrel.
So if you want to be part of transforming a market, which obviously our ultimate goal [ph] is here (52:54), and
transforming it to the benefit of our customers, we are firm believers that you have to play in it. You cannot change it
from the sidelines. So while we have a growing ESP business in North America land, for the shale liquid wells, we also
believe that we need to have a complete offering.
And what we are looking to do now is to combine our ESP offering with these rod lift companies that we have bought
over the recent quarters, and then ultimately provide a life of well lift solution to our consumer base. And that could be
ESP for part of the life and it could be a rod pump for the other part of the life. So we are working on this, and we will
give a further update on this business, both, I would say, further strategy as well as technology in our June investor
event.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Great. And an unrelated follow up in Russia. Rosneft appears to be taking a new strategy
toward contracting rigs. Have you noticed a change in how they cooperate with the service companies? Are they
starting to push back on pricing for any of your services?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: As far as I know, we haven't had any recent discussions with Rosneft on pricing beyond what
is normal for our services. Exactly what Rosneft do in terms of our contracting rigs, I don't have any further comments
to what their strategy is, [ph] no (54:21).

Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. But, Paal, I wanted to ask you about
Saxon and sort of more strategically Schlumberger in the last few years has been moving away from the more asset
intensive segments with the sale of rigs in Russia and obviously the SPARK business model in U.S. pumping. Can you
– is something changing with respect to that strategy or was this just an acquisition of – or a consolidation of
opportunity?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: No, you're right. I mean, we continue to focus on return on capital employed and to be, I would
say, capital efficient as we go forward. So there's no change in the strategy here. But let me just give you a little bit of
the rationale for why we are acquiring Saxon. So land rigs has always been a key part of our integration platform for
well construction.
Now, in the past and what led to the setup of Saxon, where we have basically sold them the rigs, we sold rigs to Eurasia
in Russia as well, is that our priority in the past have been basically to have access to rigs from a trusted provider. So
it's more a capacity issue that we've been focusing in on in the past. What we are doing now is that we are evolving this
view to also seeing the land rig as a critical element of how we drive drilling performance.
So what we plan to do at this stage now, and Saxon is generally focused on the international market where we have
basically all of our integration-related business, we plan to invest in optimizing rig design and rig operations by
combining Saxon's rig engineering and rig management capabilities with our existing drilling expertise from both IPM
and the Drilling Group.

So there are some third-party rigs within the Saxon fleet today, there's quite a few. And we will continue to support
them and if there are opportunity to do third-party rentals, we will continue to do that. But we are predominantly
buying Saxon because we want to have our own rig provider that we can help us drive the performance of our
integration business [ph] with our (56:37) construction.

IOCs in the Orinoco Belt to try to work with terms and get activity higher to raise production. Can you maybe talk
about what you see happening in that market over the next year or two years? Do you think there'll be success there and
the 2015 could be a much bigger year in Venezuela potentially?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, for us, Venezuela today is actually quite good. Activity in Q1 was solid, was up more
than 20% year-over-year. And as you say, we have a close working relationship with PDVSA and, as such, we put our
payment agreement with them in place. Payments are regular and they're according to plan. So we are in reasonably
good shape there.
So looking forward for this year, we see continued increase in rig count, and these addition of rigs are mainly focused
in on the Faja, and we continue to ramp-up our resources and expertise in the country, right? We have a number of
projects with PDVSA where we are working with them to drive operational efficiency, and obviously to help them
drive up production. So we see Venezuela for 2014 to be one of the positives in Latin America.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Okay, great. Thanks, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.

And your final question today comes from the line of Jeff Tillery from Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Wondering if you guys have introduced a couple of fleets back to the U.S. frac market from your
stack capacity, I wondered if you could just talk us through how you're thinking about further efficiency gains in your
frac fleet here in the U.S. as well as the ability to – for the market to absorb incremental capacity for new well this
year?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think the overall activity in terms of new wells and in terms of frac stages is going to be
up in 2014. And whether we will add more capacity into this, I think is going to be a function of the pricing and the
incremental margins we will get on the additional fleets that we put in.
All the fleets that we have introduced over the past three quarters, these criterion have been met, and that's why we
have been adding them, right? So we are currently, today, operating at 82% in terms of 24-hour operations, which has
been, obviously, a key driver for efficiency.
And other than that, we are focusing in on term contracts. So we have about 90% of our pressure pumping contract
volume on term. And we do that because we see that as a key element to help drive efficiency. That's how we get
predictable work and we have a close working relationship with our customers for planning and scheduling.
And, also, having term contracts and longer term relationships other than the spot also helps us in the way we work
together with them in terms of technical collaboration as well as new technology introduction. So I'm reasonably
optimistic about our ability to continue to gain share in that market. What's going to happen to base pricing, I think,
base pricing as of now, we are looking for it to flatten out.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Great. And then my second question is just around the seismic outlook. I know the backlog can be
choppy for that business, but it was up a reasonable amount sequentially to exit Q1. Does that – has that changed at all

the Schlumberger outlook for the marine seismic business as the rest of the year plays out?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: No, we haven't changed our outlook for the seismic business since January. So like you said,
the backlog was up $196 million sequentially and $49 million year-over-year. This was driven both by land and marine.
And in terms of the 2014 outlook for seismic, we maintain the outlook that we did in January, that it's going to be
flattish in terms of overall spend this year. We continue to see pressure on basic marine pricing, we saw that in Q1. But
in terms of Q2 and Q3 activity and our bookings on utilization is looking quite reasonable. So really no change to what
we looked at in January.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.
