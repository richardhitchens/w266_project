Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. You
should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information
and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measure to the closest GAAP financial measure.
With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.
Moray P. Dewhurst
Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy had an excellent quarter, capped off by the successful
launch of NextEra Energy Partners. All parts of the NextEra portfolio performed well and both NEE and NEP remain
on track to deliver the financial expectations, including cash flow and credit metrics, that we have previously disclosed.
I will provide more detail on expectations later in the call.
At Florida Power & Light, we have invested roughly $1.6 billion of capital year-to-date, consistent with our strategy of
improving the long-term value we offer our customers. Our major capital projects remain on track and we continue to
expect the last of our three generation modernization projects at Port Everglades to come online in mid 2016. Our
reliability and storm hardening initiatives are also progressing well.
In addition to these efforts to improve our electric delivery system, we are now exploring opportunity to help us deliver
lower and more stable natural gas costs for our customers. Last month, FPL announced an innovative plan to invest in
long-term natural gas supplies, which I will talk about more in a moment.
And we were particularly pleased to learn that FPL was named the most trusted utility in the nation, based on a large
nationwide sample of utility customers.
At Energy Resources, our development and construction programs remain on track and our backlog of contracted
renewables projects continues to develop, with a PPA for another roughly 100 megawatts of U.S. wind signed since the
last call.
Earnings growth was driven by new contracted renewables projects as well as strong results in our customer supply and
trading business. At NextEra Energy Partners, the assets operated well and delivered financial results in line with
expectations. In addition, just after the close of the quarter, the last of the projects in the initial portfolio became
operational.
Now let's look at the results for FPL. For the second quarter of 2014, FPL reported net income of $423 million or $0.96
cents per share, up $0.04 cents per share year-over-year. The principal drivers of FPL's earnings growth in the quarter
were continued investment in the business and an increase in wholesale operations.
FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $570 million in the quarter and we expect our full year capital
investments to be roughly $3.2 billion. Regulatory capital employed grew 6.2% over the same quarter last year and net
income grew 8.2%.
Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes for the 12 months ended June 2014 will be approximately 11.3%. Similar to
last quarter this includes the impact of transition costs associated with our enterprise-wide productivity initiative,
Project Momentum that we incurred over the 12-month period, all of which were incurred in 2013. Absent these costs,
regulatory ROE would have been 11.5%, which remains our target for the full year 2014. As a reminder, the impact of
the 2013 transition costs will roll off our reported regulatory ROE as we move through the year, since the regulatory
ROE is measured on a 12-month trailing basis.
We utilized $6 million of reserve amortization during the quarter in order to achieve this predetermined ROE, bringing
our year-to-date utilization of reserve amortization to $131 million. Under the current rate agreement, we record reserve
amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each 12-month trailing period. In this case, the
11.5% that I previously mentioned, excluding special charges such as the Project Momentum transition costs.

As we've mentioned before, we always expect to use more reserve amortization in the first half of the year than the
second half given the pattern of our underlying revenues and expenses. Over the remainder of the year, assuming
normal weather and operating conditions, we expect to reverse the reserve amortization taken in the first half of the
year and end the year with a balance roughly equal to where we started or possibly even a little better.
Looking beyond 2014, we continue to believe that our reserve balance, when combined with our weather normalized
sales growth forecast of 1.5% to 2% per year and our current O&M expectations as well as the commitment of a total
of roughly $7 billion in infrastructure CapEx for the period 2013 to 2016, will allow us to support regulatory ROEs in
the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% for the remaining period of the current rate agreement. We expect
that we can do so in ways that will further improve our already outstanding customer value proposition and will
position us well for 2017 and beyond.
In Florida, most economic indicators we follow continue to show improvement year-over-year, while some appeared to
have recently stabilized. Most notably, Florida's focus on economic development and an overall improvement in the
business climate continue to encourage business expansion and additional hiring, while measures of confidence in the
state of the economy have generally improved. As a result, the Florida labor force participation rate has increased in
recent months, even while the U.S. rate continues to drift downward. Clearly, the return of previously discouraged
workers into the labor force is positive, although it will naturally mean that further reductions in Florida's
unemployment rate will come at a slower rate.
Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in June was 6.2%, down 1.2 percentage points from a year ago. The
number of jobs in Florida was up 237,500, an increase of 3.1% compared to a year earlier. And June was the 47th
consecutive month with positive job growth in Florida, following more than three years of job losses. Nationally, the
number of jobs was up 1.8% over the year. Florida's annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation's rate since April
2012. Florida's private sector continues to drive the state's job growth and more than 620,000 private sector jobs have
been added since December 2010.
Turning to the Florida housing market, recent data appear to show indicators settling into a steadier and hopefully more
sustainable pace. As the accompanying chart shows new building permits have stabilized and remain at comparatively
healthy levels as Florida ranked second highest in the U.S. in new housing permits.
Mortgage delinquency rates continued to decline and the Case-Shiller Index of South Florida shows home prices up
14.6% from the prior year. Other positive economic data across the state include continued improvement in retail
taxable sales as well as the Consumer Confidence Index. Overall, Florida's economy continues to progress well.
Our customer and usage metrics at FPL this quarter show mixed results. We saw the largest average increase of
customers since the second quarter of 2007, with approximately 91,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter
of 2013, representing growth of 2%. Roughly half of the increase can be attributed to the rollout of our remote connect
and disconnect capability enabled by our smart meter program that we highlighted last year.
As a reminder, these new customers, which are disproportionately low usage and residential, have a lower impact on
our sales. Taking this into account, we estimate the customer growth accounted for about 1% of the increase in sales
during the quarter. Overall usage grew by 0.6%, driven by favorable weather comparison. Underlying usage per
customer however decreased 1.3% compared to the same quarter last year. As you may recall, usage was in line with
our long-term expectations during the first quarter. And as we have often pointed out this metric can be somewhat
volatile on a quarterly basis. Our long-term expectation of underlying usage growth continues to be approximately
0.5% per year, net of the impact of efficiency in conservation programs, at least through the period of the rate
agreement. The 12-month average of low-usage customers fell to 8.1%, its lowest level in seven years, while the
average number of inactive accounts for the quarter declined to levels not seen since early 2004.
As I mentioned earlier, FPL has announced a plan to invest in long-term natural gas supplies and has filed a petition
with the Florida Public Service Commission seeking approval. As a first step in the plan, FPL will partner with
PetroQuest Energy to develop natural gas production wells in the Woodford Shale region in Southeastern Oklahoma.

FPL's overall natural gas needs, we view the transaction as an important first step in what we hope will be a larger
program that will improve the value we deliver to our customers even further.
Acquiring an interest in natural gas reserves is expected to lower long-term fuel cost and provide a long-term hedge
against potential volatility in the market price for natural gas, which is a large component of the price of electricity, and
would thereby address a concern that a number of policymakers have raised.
In addition to the initial proposal, FPL has also requested that the PSC approve a set of guidelines for subsequent
natural gas production projects to allow the company and in turn its customers to take advantage of future beneficial
natural gas investment opportunities. FPL expects the PSC decision by the end of 2014 or early 2015.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2014 GAAP earnings of $81 million or $0.18 per
share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $213 million or $0.48 per share. These adjusted results include
two unusual items, both associated with the launch of NextEra Energy Partners: first, a negative impact of $0.05 per
share from restructuring and direct transaction costs associated with the creation of NEP; second, a negative impact of
$0.10 per share, which represents an income tax charge driven by separating our Canadian projects to enable them to fit
into the overall NEP structure. This is a non-cash item and any real cash tax impact, if there were to be any, would
occur many years in the future. In fact, there may never be any cash impact, as we believe this item may be reversed in
future periods pending discussions with Canadian tax authorities.
Together, these two items reduced Energy Resources' adjusted results by about $0.15 per share, so the underlying
operating results were very strong and in fact exceeded our expectations, with excellent performance in virtually all
parts of the portfolio.
As you know, the launch of NEP came at the end of the quarter and NEP was not operational in the second quarter. As
a result, Energy Resources' second quarter results do not reflect any deduction for non-controlling interest. Going
forward, Energy Resources will continue to consolidate NEP for accounting purposes and you should expect to see a
deduction from income representing the NEP LP unitholders' interest in Energy Resources results. Our Investor
Relations team will be ready to address any questions you may have about the inter relationships between Energy
Resources and NEP.
Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted EPS decreased by $0.08 year-over-year. Setting aside the combined
negative impact of $0.15 per share from the unusual items associated with establishing and launching NEP that I
discussed earlier, the core business delivered great results. Strong contributions from growth in our contracted
renewables portfolio added $0.05 per share, reflecting new wind and solar investments placed into service during or
after the second quarter of 2013.
Consistent with our commitment to recycling capital, asset sales collectively added $0.06 per share, including $0.03 per
share due to a gain on a sale of wells in our gas infrastructure business. We expect to continue to recycle capital from
time to time within the gas infrastructure business, keeping our overall commitment of capital to this business to a
small fraction of the total.
The customer supply and trading business added $0.07 per share, primarily reflecting structured transactions tailored to
meet specific customer needs.
The contributions from existing assets declined by $0.05 per share, driven primarily by the planned refueling outage at
Seabrook. However, this was better than we had anticipated and Seabrook's outage was the best ever for the facility at
just over 23 days.
In addition, wind resource overall was strong during the quarter, although the year-over-year impact was small as the
second quarter of 2013 was also well above average. All other factors reduced results by $0.06 per share, including
$0.02 of higher interest expense associated with the growing portfolio and $0.02 of dilution.
For the full-year, we continue to expect to elect CITCs on roughly 265 megawatts for our Mountain View Solar project
and the portions of Genesis and Desert Sunlight solar projects that are expected to enter service in 2014. This equates to
roughly $60 million in adjusted earnings, down from roughly $70 million in 2013 on 280 megawatts of solar projects.

Let me now turn to NEP. As I just noted, NEP was not operational during the second quarter and therefore while it has
released results and we'll file a form 10-Q, the presentation of results follows what is known as predecessor format,
which is the same basis as was presented in the S1. I must caution you that this is likely to be different from what you
will see going forward, in particular because the tax treatment of the NEP assets will be different under the NEP
structure. As a consequence, analysis of NEP second quarter reported results is not particularly meaningful. Moreover,
we recognize that most NEP investors will be focused on EBITDA and cash available for distribution and we expect to
provide analysis of these variables for the third quarter and beyond.
During the second quarter, the NEP assets performed in line with our expectations. Consequently, the EBITDA and
cash flow of the portfolio were also consistent with our expectations. The second unit at our Genesis project entered
commercial operations late in the first quarter and operated well throughout the second quarter, while the last of the
initial portfolio assets, our Bluewater Wind project in Ontario, started commercial operations just after the end of the
quarter.
Overall, we were very pleased with the performance of the NEP portfolio during the second quarter.
Shifting back to the broader Energy Resources portfolio, the team continues to execute on our backlog and pursue
additional contracted renewable development opportunities. In Canada, we continue to expect the remaining
approximately 400 megawatts of wind in our backlog to enter service by the end of 2015, with the majority expected to
come into service by the end of this year.
Our solar backlog remains on track and during the quarter, we brought 13 megawatts of solar into service with the
partial commissioning of Desert Sunlight. We continue to expect to bring the remaining roughly 635 megawatts of our
backlog into service by the end of 2016. In addition to our existing contracted backlog, we continue to pursue
additional solar opportunities that could come online by the end of 2016.
Turning to our U.S. wind program, the team recently signed a PPA for a roughly 100-megawatt project, which is
expected to come into service in 2015, bringing our total contracted U.S. wind development program for 2013 through
2015 to approximately 1,770 megawatts. Based on everything we see at the moment, we continue to believe our total
2013 to 2015 U.S. wind program could be 2,000 to 2,500 megawatts. In the appendix of our earnings presentation, we
have provided a reconciliation of all anticipated megawatts at Energy Resources through the end of 2016, which may
be helpful to NEP investors as well.
Turing now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the second quarter of 2014, NextEra Energy's GAAP
net income was $492 million or $1.12 per share. NextEra Energy's 2014 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted
EPS was $630 million and $1.43 respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment increased $0.01
per share compared to the second quarter of 2013.
You may recall that when discussing the possible creation of NEP, we indicated that an important factor in our decision
making would be the impact it might have on credit. We are pleased to note that S&P, Moody's, and Fitch, all affirmed
our ratings and stable outlook. Looking forward as NEP grows, we will continue to focus on ensuring that we sustain
our strong credit position both in terms of our credit metrics as well as in our focus on portfolio mix and business
composition.
The development of both Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection continue to progress well through
their respective processes and we continue to expect to submit necessary filings with FERC later this year.
During the quarter, we also announced a non-binding open season for a 330-mile natural gas pipeline project called
Mountain Valley Pipeline, partnering with EQT Corporation. The project is designed to connect the Marcellus and
Utica shales with markets in the Southeast region of the U.S. in order to support growing demand and improvements in
reliability. The results of the open season, the details of which we are currently evaluating, were very strong and
confirm our view that the Mountain Valley project is very attractive to a wide range of potential shippers. The next step
towards firming up a commercially viable project is to convert these strong expressions of interest into binding
economic commitments. We look forward to providing more details at a later date.

Before turning to our expectations for 2014 and beyond, I would like to say a few words about our involvement with
the Energy Future Holdings bankruptcy case. While our general policy is not to comment on individual transactions,
whether real or potential, obviously a number of documents have been publicly filed in this case and various parties
have commented and speculated on our involvement. We have on many occasions articulated our view that we believe
we have the necessary skills to effectively manage large regulated utility businesses in a fashion that delivers values to
both customers and investors.
We have also indicated that we would be open to expanding our portfolio of regulated utility assets through acquisition,
if we can do so within acceptable financial and risk parameters and if we can see a reasonable path to all necessary
regulatory approvals. With that in mind, it is no secret that we have made a tangible revised proposal to EFH in the
bankruptcy court. Our commitment to Texas runs deep, having invested more than $7 billion in transmission, power
generation and other operations in the Lone Star State. We also bring to the table proven track record in the utility
industry, highlighted by strong performance in the areas of reliability, affordability and customer focus. And I will
simply reiterate our belief that our revised proposal would provide substantial value to all stakeholders, including
Oncor's customers.
Our performance in the second quarter was stronger than we expected, and our expectations for the second half of the
year have not changed significantly. Based on these observations, we now believe it is reasonable to expect our
full-year results to be somewhere in the range of $5.15 to $5.35 per share, even including the $0.15 of one-time effects
from the launch of NEP, which of course were not anticipated when we originally shared with you our 2014 view back
in the summer of last year.
While we're very pleased with our progress so far this year, it remains to be seen how much of the "goodness" of this
year will carry over into 2015 and beyond. Accordingly, at least for now, we are not changing our view of 2016, with
an adjusted earnings per share range of $5.50 to $6 or 5% to 7% compound annual growth rate off a 2012 base.
However, we do expect to update our view of the 2016 timeframe later in the year or early in 2015 when we will have
more clarity around a few important uncertainties.
As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating
conditions.
Last year, we shared with you our expectations for improvements in our credit metrics for both 2013 and 2014, and we
continue to be on track in terms of cash flow and leverage to meet those targets, which are fully consistent with our
current ratings.
Turning now to our expectations for NEP. We remain confident in the forecast we presented in the S-1. We expect the
initial portfolio to yield EBITDAR of about $250 million and cash available for distribution of about $87 million for
the 12 months through the end of June 2015, and these results should support an initial distribution at an annualized
rate of $0.75 per unit. Our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.
Looking beyond the first year, we expect unit distributions to grow about 12% to 15% per year for at least three years
and we believe this is achievable with the acquisition only of assets from the ROFO portfolio assuming current market
conditions. On average, we expect the ROFO portfolio to look fairly similar to the initial portfolio on a per megawatt
basis, with annual EBITDA expectations of 250,000 to 260,000 per megawatt and cash available for distribution of
about 85,000 to 95,000 per megawatt once all ROFO assets have entered into commercial operation. But the last of the
ROFO assets are not expected to enter service until late in 2016.
While NEP has no special contractual rights to support further acquisitions, we believe it is reasonable to expect that
Energy Resources will want to make available additional projects from its existing portfolio as well as of some of those
currently under development. As of the end of last year, Energy Resources had another roughly 7,000 or so megawatts
of contracted renewables projects in its operating portfolio and while not all of these projects would be suitable
immediately for NEP, many or all of them could become eligible over time.
In addition, we expect to have a further 1,800 to 2,300 megawatts of additional contracted renewable capacity entering
service prior to the end of 2016. And finally, beyond contracted renewables, Energy Resources has other projects that

may perhaps be suitable for NEP over time.
Overall, we continue to believe that NEP offers investors by far the largest and highest overall quality portfolio of
potential assets that can help drive growth and distributions for many years to come. We expect to be in a position to
provide additional ongoing forward-looking disclosures with our third quarter conference call.
With that, we will now open the line for questions. Since this is our first combined conference call for NextEra Energy
and NextEra Energy Partners, it will be helpful if you can be clear, which entity you are referring to in your questions.
Thank you.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: I wanted to touch on Mountain Valley and just understand the feedback you gave on the
expressions of interest. Could you speak a bit to the timing that we might expect as you assess what you perceived and
just better help us understand what sort of milestones we should be looking for?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure, let me ask Armando to address that.
<A - Armando Pimentel>: Hey, Stephen. We're in the middle of going back and looking at all the expressions of
interest that we received and having individual discussions to make sure that we can enter into agreements with all of
the interested parties. My expectation is that by the end of this year, we will be in a position to understand whether to –
whether we're going to move forward or not with the project.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Okay. So we should – you'd be communicating that back by the end of the year it sounds like
is the general timeframe you're thinking. Okay.
<A - Armando Pimentel>: Yeah, I expect it to be no later than then. We might have updates before then. But I think
for investors and analysts, they should expect by the end of the year, we should know whether we're moving forward.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Okay. Great. And just over for NextEra, not NEP, but just thinking about equity needs in the
future and what as you think about further dropdowns into NEP, can you talk at least broadly about how having NEP
impacts your need for equity funding, how you think about that, does it largely eliminate external equity requirements?
Or just a little bit more color on equity needs?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure. The way to think about the contributions coming up from NEP from a financing
perspective is to expect that they will get rolled into our overall financing plan at Capital Holdings. So obviously that
implies that at the margin there's some implicit reduction in whatever the other – or the equity needed otherwise would
be. Having said that, I would just remind you of what we'd said previously, which is with the equity issuance last year
and the forward that comes in this year, unless we see significant additional incremental CapEx, we would not expect
to be coming back to the market for incremental equity.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Can you just give a – maybe a little more commentary on adding the natural gas reserves into
rate base? Kind of how the process will work with phase one and then how you're thinking about layering in additional
reserve additions over time and what the Commission is going to view as successful implementation in this program?

<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure, I mean, it's pretty straightforward. We have a tangible proposition on the table right
now, which we are asking the Commission to approve. It has good economics for our customers. We think it makes a
lot of sense from fundamentals and fundamental policy reasons. But it's just one transaction and it's obviously very
small in the context of FPL's overall gas needs. So what we're also asking for is approval of a set of guidelines which
would allow us to move forward with the potential to execute additional deals on a timeframe that's consistent with the
commercial realities of doing business in that upstream space.
Obviously, the decision-making timeframe commercially for the plans in that sector is fairly rapid and we would want
to have agreement and essentially the blessing of the PSC that within certain parameters we would be okay to go ahead
with additional deals.
Having said that, all deals even if they're executed, are going to be subject to annual review through the fuel clause
filings, so the Commission would still maintain oversight over the specifics of each transaction.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: And how comfortable do you guys feel about the scaling of that – of those projects? And how
much fuel would you like to ultimately have from controlled reserves versus buying in the market?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, we haven't set an ultimate target yet. Obviously, it could be very significant over
time. Our main focus is on establishing the framework and getting started on the program, but clearly we think there are
plenty of other potential opportunities over time. They may not come in a smooth steady stream. Obviously, that's
going to depend upon the commercial realities in the upstream space. But it's very clear that from a customer
perspective, if we can convert what is today a variable and uncontrolled cost into something that's much more
predictable, there's real value to customers in doing that.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Got it. Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Can you kind of just think about your rationale of not stripping out that $0.15? And kind of
given that we are incurring that now and guidance is unchanged, where the upside came from to maintain guidance?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, there's a number of areas. As we said, the wind resource was strong, so that was –
our expectations are always around this average wind resource, so we had that. The Seabrook outage was shorter than
we'd expected. Some of the customer supply transactions that we closed this quarter pushed us a little bit above where
we had otherwise expected to be. We're a little bit better on our interest rates. There's a whole variety of areas. But
when you put them all together – there was also a little bit on the FPL side, the wholesale results were a little bit
stronger there. So there's a number of areas that have pushed us up.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Okay. And then in a couple places in your slide deck, on the one hand, we had 109% of normal
wind, but then when you're talking about NEP, you said that the wind and solar resources were very slightly above
normal. Is this just the different geographies of the assets?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: It's partly the different geographies and partly the solar was actually below expectations.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Okay. And then – oh, I'm sorry, just, do you have a pro forma of what NextEra Energy
Resources would have looked like under the new NEP accounting?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: No, we don't.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Okay. Thank you very much.

We will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So kind of a twin question relating to the parent company. Can you talk a little bit
about how to minimize dilution from the sell-downs to NEP and the roll down of the ROFO? And perhaps coupled with
that, discuss the 2016 outlook. You mentioned that you're looking for clarity on a few caveats later this year to perhaps
provide an update. What are those key moving variables that limit you from providing that update today as you think
about it?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Okay. On the first, again, maybe I'm just repeating what I said earlier, but the way to think
about the proceeds coming up is they get rolled into the overall financing program. So in the short-term, if you have a
particular transaction and acquisition by NEP of Energy Resources assets, there will be some temporary accounting
dilutive aspect until you have moved forward and adjusted your financing structure so as your credit metrics are back
where they would be. But that's going to be a relatively small amount. So it shouldn't meaningfully move the numbers.
It will make this year, for example, very – maybe there's a penny of effective dilution from that effect, so. But then
going forward, we just integrate it into the overall financing plan.
On the 2016 outlook, obviously, by the end of the year, we will know where we are on the election here in Florida.
We'll have a much better insight into where we are on the – completing the portfolio, the backlog portfolio of
renewables and projects. We're working on a number of things there that we are pretty optimistic will come to pass, but
we'll know a lot more by the end of the year on that front. And of course the other thing is we'll know a lot more where
we are on the PTC.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Right. Absolutely. And to that point, can you discuss real quickly what is your – you
didn't change your outlook per se, but I'm curious, is the potential for a PTC extension delaying PPA signups? And then
coupled with that also, what is the outlook for third-party acquisitions? And has your view on third-party acquisitions
down at the NEP level changed in light of the relative currency that you have in hand?
<A - Armando Pimentel>: Hey, Julien; it's Armando. I think the uncertainty about the PTC and when it would be
extended this year certainly caused a lull in our view in PPA signings during the – particularly during the second
quarter. But we saw a little bit of that in the first quarter. What we're actually seeing in the market right now is the
continued uncertainty is bringing a few more people back to the table, which we were not necessarily expecting, I
would say, three or four months ago. So that's a positive. We don't know exactly when Congress will take up the PTC
extension. But if history proves or if history tells us anything, it will very likely be towards the very end of the session
this year. I'll let Moray answer the NEP question.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: So in terms of outlook for third party acquisitions, I don't think the existence of NEP has
fundamentally changed our view. We've always been very active in the market for the third-party acquisitions. We'll
continue to be, but we've also historically been disciplined in our pricing there and we expect to continue to be
disciplined. I do think it gives us a different vehicle. So depending upon the nature of the potential acquisition, it might
fit better in NEP or it might fit better in Energy Resources.
In general, I think that if we see something that requires what I'll call a fair degree of cleanup, for example, perhaps a
project that hypothetically we see having some operational improvement potential or requiring a contract restructuring,
something of that nature, other things equal it would seem logical. But we would start with that at the Energy
Resources level, work on making those improvements and then make it available to Energy Partners. Because a key
part of the strategy at NEP is to have clean and de-risked projects because those are clearly what the investors in NEP

value very highly.
So to the extent to which the potential asset was already very clean in that sense, it might be a suitable candidate for
direct acquisition by Energy Partners. But those are just kind of conceptual guidelines, obviously that we'd have to see
in any practical situation.

We will take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Sort of quickly on slide seven, the load growth, I'm sorry if I missed what caused the 1.3%
non-weather related decrease?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, I guess the bottom line is we're not sure. That's the underlying usage growth and
other is essentially a residual from our calculation. So we have a – we apply our regular forecasting model which says:
okay, given what happened with temperature, given what happened with the economy, given what happened with
relative pricing, here's what we should have expected. And so this is really measured relative to that, which is one of
the reasons that it is often volatile from quarter-to-quarter.
Having said that, I think what we're seeing in here, although I can't be sure of the exact reasons, is some reduction in
usage or lower-than-expected usage among the higher volume customers. Because the lower volume customers, the
metrics associated with them all look pretty good. So I think what we're seeing is some cutbacks among higher volume
customers, whether that is deliberate conservation efforts, whether it's the effect of more energy efficiency than we
have anticipated, we're not sure. So we're going to be digging into those numbers to figure out what we can about
what's going on there. But do recognize that from quarter-to-quarter just mix impacts within the customer base can
have quite an impact, an indirect impact on that residual usage.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then on Oncor, looking at the legislation that was passed, I think it was 1364 last
year regarding the sort of standalone tax concept and what have you. How should one think about or what can you
share with us the potential use of leverage in an acquisition such as Oncor? I mean, one might think that it could be
substantial. I was just wondering if...
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah. I really can't say anything more than we shared in the prepared remarks.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Fair enough, thought I'd try though. Okay. So then – and then finally, on the structured
transactions in the trading and marketing of $0.07, could you give us little bit of a flavor for what happened there?
What the nature of that is, I guess?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure. We've, for a long time, been in the business of tailoring power and gas products to
meet particular customers' needs. Commonly these customers are munis and co-ops in different parts of the country
who don't necessarily have the capability to manage all their varying energy needs directly. And typically these will be
for kind of non-standard amounts of power, varying over the course of the year or varying over years so they're sort of
customized products in that way, but they're still relatively straightforward into that they're power and gas delivered to
particular locations. And so we will customize a product to meet that need and then essentially back-to-back it, hedge
out the components in the regular market and there's obviously a spread to be made on that. I would say that with the
pullback of some of the major financial services firms from the physical commodity world, we've been seeing perhaps

a few more of those kinds of opportunities more recently. So it's good business; it maintains relationships with folks
who are often customers of ours on the wind side, so provides a nice extra portion of the mix.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Sort of look at gain on sale though when you do these transactions or is this sort of an
accrual kind of – how should we think about sort of the ongoing nature of something like – of this sort of a structured
transaction. In other words, do you take a gain as you do these transactions? Or is there – or is it more like an annuity
stream? How should we think about that?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: It's a little bit of both and it depends upon the nature of the transaction. Mostly they are an
accrual transaction. On occasion they may have an element of mark-to-market upfront. We try and minimize that
portion for obvious reasons. It's better to spread them out over time, but depending upon the specific nature of the deal,
the accounting may require you to take a day-one gain, so to speak.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: So that $0.07 just sort of the flavor of that would you say is mostly accrual? Or mostly sort of
mark-to-market? One time-ish? How should we sort of think about that?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: I would say it's mostly stuff that continues on.

And we'll take our next question from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Yeah. Hi, good morning, Moray.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Just a couple of things. First, do you have an official schedule for the E&P approval?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: I'm going to turn to Eric. I'm not sure that the PSC has formally scheduled it. We're
certainly hoping to have a decision by at least the early part of next year.
<A - Eric E. Silagy>: Hey, Steve; this is Eric. So we're right now working with the staff of the PSC and other
interested parties on schedule. We're hoping for hearings in October and then we're still hoping for a decision by the
PSC sometime by the end of the year, beginning of next year at the latest.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. And then just a question on NEP, we never really because of the filing and your
kind of inability to comment once you file the S-1, we never really got the kind of story on why this is good for
NextEra and how you made the decision and the like. And I don't know if you could just spend a short period of time
on how this is – how you see the value of this to NextEra?
<A - Eric E. Silagy>: Sure, obviously there's different ways of looking at it and I think different individuals look at it
somewhat differently. As for myself I view it very much as a way to highlight the value of a very attractive portion of
the portfolio that arguably wasn't receiving full value in the existing structure. As I'd sort of hinted at in the response to
an earlier question, a lot of what we are really doing in separating out the assets that are part of NEP is segregating two
distinct aspects of the business of Energy Resources. There is the development construction early-stage operations
getting a project to the point where it is as, I referred to it earlier, clean and de-risked. And then there is the long-term
ownership of the financial interest in those assets. Those two aspects of the business [ph] are (47:02) quite different.
They have different risk profiles. And they can certainly appeal in different degrees to different sets of investors. And
what we've done through creating NEP is we've really created a vehicle that allows us to segregate those activities. And
in so doing, I think we've highlighted – begun to highlight the real value of those, the long-term financial interest in
those projects. So to me, it's mostly about highlighting of the value. But we've done so in a fashion that I believe
promotes alignment of interests and that speaks to the – obviously, the structural characteristics of NEP.

Other people will get a – see it somewhat differently. So a common way that certainly a number of investors have
expressed it and folks internally just see it as accessing a lower source – lower cost source of capital. So I think there's
a number of ways that in a sense different sides of the same coin. But I see it as really highlighting the value.

We will take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys, congrats on a good quarter. One or two nuts or bolts questions: Florida Power
& Light's O&M for the quarter and year-to-date basically flat year-over-year, just curious is there anything unusual in
kind of the quarters for 2014? Do you still expect kind of flattish O&M in 2014? Anything that could make second half
of 2014 higher or lower than second half of 2013?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, recall that we undertook this initiative that we call Project Momentum last year and
that produced a great many ideas that in FPL's case will deliver O&M savings over time. Not surprisingly those savings
tend to build over time. So we would expect the full year of 2014 O&M at FPL actually to be down relative to 2013. So
you should definitely expect the second half to be down. But there's nothing particular that I can point to there because
the gains from Project Momentum were very widely shared across different parts of the organization, so it's really
progressed in all areas. We're very pleased with the way the implementation of those initiatives has been going. We're
actually a little bit ahead of where we had expected to be.
Recall, of course, that those don't directly affect FPL earnings because of the nature of the settlement agreement. So if
we do better than we expect on O&M, that simply gets reflected in the amount of surplus depreciation that we adjust.
But that's really what's going on there.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. And then when thinking about NEP's portfolio over time – and when I say over time
I mean multiple, multiple years, and the risk profile of NEP, just curious for your thoughts. It's one thing when you've
got renewable assets in there that honestly have very, very, very low maintenance CapEx or even kind of one-time
CapEx requirements, and have 25- or 30-year contracts. How do you think about what adding other types of assets,
whether it's gas-fired power plants that typically have shorter-term contracts or whether it's nuclear, where they may
have longer-term arrangements, but there's also, I don't know, kind of binary capital spending risk, meaning Crystal
River 3 or SONGS or Davis-Besse related risk that just kind of don't exist with a lot of other type of power plants.
How do you think about the pros and cons of adding to the EBITDA and the [indiscernible] (51:06) for NextEra Energy
Partners by putting non-renewable assets, even something like a T&D utility in there versus the potential impact on
maybe valuation or multiples or CapEx given kind of what the CapEx risk looks like for those other type of assets
versus the CapEx risk of a renewable plant?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Okay, let me try and address that in a number of pieces, because I think there's a lot of
things in there. I think the short answer is we are going to evaluate all those issues that you've just talked about over
time, and we're going to receive, I suspect, a lot of investor feedback and that will help us in our evaluation. One of the
great things you pointed out, but you're talking many years down the road, one of the great things about the NEP
position is it can look to long-term sustained growth simply through adding contracted renewable projects, which it
may hope to acquire from the sponsor. So long before you have to even consider some of the things that you've just
raised in your question.
Having said that, let me take the fossil assets. Clearly, they're examples in the market where those assets have been
added to a yield co type portfolio. So it clearly can be done. I think there are a couple of issues that go different ways.
On the one hand, you get an extra dimension of diversity, so that should be attractive to a NEP investor. But as you
pointed out, they do have different characteristics. So I think we're just going to have to evaluate the relative weight of

those, broadly speaking, those two factors and see what investor reactions are.
And the same general criteria apply as you start thinking about extending the universe of assets more broadly, although
introducing even more complexity. So for example, in the nuclear assets, obviously the binary nature of the event risk
that you're implicitly referring to would need to be taken into account. I don't know, but I suspect that that's not a kind
of risk profile that most of the NEP investors would be particularly – would be pricing into their valuation today. So we
need to see what the reaction is. So there might be structures that you would need to put in place to isolate that portion
of the risk.
So it – in a sense it goes back to the response from a couple of earlier questions, which is one of the nice things about
the NEP platform is that it enables us to segregate out different types of activities and focus them in the two different
companies. And in particular, I suspect that means there will be – we will take on specific types of risk within Energy
Resources and NextEra Energy that we would not take on within NextEra Energy Partners.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Thank you, Moray. Last question, any update on transmission investment
opportunities, electric transmission investment opportunities outside of Florida?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Not a lot new to report. As I've said on a number of occasions to many folks, the
transmission development business is long-term in nature. The decision-making timeframe for a lot of these projects,
particularly the ones that go through the regional, the ISOs, the RTOs tends to be fairly long; and so nothing in
particular. The project, the development project in Canada is moving along as we would expect. We continue to have a
very healthy portfolio of initiatives that we're working on.
But as I have also said many times before, all of these things are long-term in nature, so things that would not begin to
contribute but [ph] toward (54:56) 2018 or 2019 in most cases.

We will take our next question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group Inc.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Okay, I think we'll have time for one more after this.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thank you, guys, for fitting me in. So two questions, first on the TXU transaction, I know you
can't comment specifically on it, but can I ask a broader question with regard to your philosophy on acquiring regulated
assets? So when you talk – when you think about what acceptable financial and risk parameters are in any acquisition
of any regulated utility, what are the cornerstone sort of financial pillars of your decision-making? For instance, the –
with the Wisconsin acquisition of [ph] tag (55:48), they had never commented explicitly on any transaction, but always
had said it had to be accretive in the first full year, not dilutive to the growth rate, not dilutive to credit. So can you sort
of give a comparable set of characteristics that you look for when you think about the price you're willing to pay and
the risk you're willing to take in acquiring an additional regulated asset?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, I'm not sure I can give a comprehensive list, but let me just try and provide some
color at least around that. Recognize that your ability to add value in these situations depends upon your ability to
develop synergies across two platforms, to improve operations in a platform that you may acquire or to find other ways
of delivering incremental value on which the shareholder may hope to earn a regulated rate of return. So you have to
look at what is the realistic potential to create value. And while that can be quite meaningful in this industry, it is
typically not as large when expressed as a percentage of the existing market value as you will see in many other
industries. So you've got to make sure that you can retain significant portion of the value that you create for your
investors, otherwise, there's no point in doing the transaction. And that obviously in turn depends upon the terms on
which you can expect to get regulatory approval.

We would certainly want to make sure that anything that we do is supportive of our existing credit position. As we said
on many occasions, we're very comfortable with our credit position; it's an important competitive weapon to us. So we
certainly would not want it to be dilutive to credit. We have traditionally said that with respect to accretion dilution,
while we don't have any absolute hard and fast rules, if a transaction is significantly dilutive in the first couple of years
that's usually a warning sign about its fundamental economics. So there can be some particular accounting reasons why
an individual transaction might be dilutive in the first year, but normally that should be a red flag.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks, Moray. The final question is circling back to the opportunity to create value by hedging
out your risk through reverse integrating into natural gas, someone asked you that question earlier? You...
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: ...indicated that the request that you're making is only to sort of hedge out about 2.9% of your
expected 2015 gas burn. And your gas burn is likely to rise in the future by a fair amount. If we want to sort of size up
the potential expenditures, if you were to fully hedge, and I understand you'd never do that, is it fair to just take the $70
million to $190 million range and sort of gross that up so that the – hypothetically, if the regulator were to say: look,
we'd like you to hedge it all that the range of potential spending would be sort of $2.4 billion to $6.5 billion? Or is that
way oversimplifying the math?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah, I am not sure that it's going to scale linearly certainly as you get up higher and
higher. But for the first few percent, it probably is not far off.
