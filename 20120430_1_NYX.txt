MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 NYSE Euronext Earnings
Conference Call. My name is Chanel, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] We will be facilitating a
question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. For the Q&A session, we ask that the callers limit their
questions to one – to allow one follow-up question for broader participation.
I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at NYSE Euronext. Please go
ahead, sir.
Stephen C. Davidson

Duncan Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter, update you on the macro
environment and our new initiatives and then, close by highlighting the momentum we are seeing in listings and the
progress we have made on Project 14.
Michael Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer, will then review the financial results for the quarter. We will then open the
line for your questions. We are incorporating slides for the call today, which are available for viewing on our website
and Duncan and Mike will refer to the slides during their remarks.
With that, let me turn it over to Duncan.
Duncan L. Niederauer
Thanks, Stephen. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the call today. Just to preview it a bit to start out, given
that we did our Investor Day at the beginning of April and then, we just had the Annual Shareholder Meeting just a few
days ago. I think since we've communicated so much recently and I think we can tell by the attendance on the call
today, it's a little lighter than usual as well. We're going to keep our prepared remarks shorter than we normally do,
figuring there's not a lot of new news in here.
We'll leave the usual time that we leave for questions and then, our expectation would be, we'd have everybody back to
work by about 8:45 a.m. or so.
From our point of view, the story of the first quarter is what we've done already and what we're continuing to do to set
the table for growth, so that when the challenging market conditions we now face, revert to what we believe are more
historical norms, we are positioned to not only capture the revenue that comes with that recovery, but to enhance our
overall performance with new streams of revenues in a lower cost and reduced share count environment, which will
magnify the operating leverage of the model.
We're doing this for executing our plans through Project 14, as we discussed at the Investor Day in early April. The
actions that we are taking with this comprehensive initiative will drive a step up in the underlying earnings power of the
company, which we believe will become evident in a more normal environment in 2013 and 2014.
So with that as a backdrop, let's turn to Slide 3. For the quarter, we recorded earnings per share of $0.47 per share on
net revenue of $601 million, down from $0.68 per share on $679 million in the prior year period. Cost discipline, a
hallmark of our team, continued in the quarter with costs down 3% year-over-year on a constant dollar and constant
portfolio basis. We were number one in listings globally for the fifth consecutive quarter and our share of technology
IPOs in the U.S. year-to-date is approximately 60%.
In summary, we knew and expected this would be a challenging quarter for us, given the difficult environment. We are
seeing modest improvement in economic indicators around the world, which would generally bode well for our
business, but unfortunately, we are still waiting for signs that trading volumes will return to the levels we have
witnessed in 2010 and 2011.
Please turn to Slide 4. This is a slide that we've used in other meetings, I think at the Investor Day as well and it tries to
depict the various crosswinds in the economic environment and the macro-environment in which we're operating our
business. With a focus on what we can control and a solid execution of our strategy, we are optimistic that we can
navigate through these in a way that will actually provide us with some opportunities.
First, in terms of derivatives reform, we have always supported regulatory efforts that bring transparency and better risk
management to markets. We support these efforts, because it makes sense for our markets and will significantly reduce
systemic risk. Both EMIR in Europe and Dodd-Frank here in the U.S., encourage derivatives to move toward a more
centrally-cleared environment and we have been actively involved in the dialogue in both regions.
The overhang of these reforms, however, is causing some uncertainty for our clients with regard to their business
models and as a result, they continue to under-invest. As customers look to reduce costs, however, we are well
positioned to serve as a major provider of outsource trading infrastructure. With capital becoming increasingly scarce,

capitally-efficient clearinghouses, like NYPC, are also poised to offer a lot of value.
Next, we are operating in a low volatility, low-growth environment, driven by the lingering effects of the financial
crisis, which is keeping rates at or near zero. This type of environment dampens volumes and results in even greater
internalization in the U.S. cash markets. On the flipside though, more stable markets mean companies are better able to
raise capital on the public markets, which is good for our listings business. It also highlights the benefit of a diversified
revenue model.
Uncertainty continues to also persist around the euro and that is naturally taking a toll on investment and growth in
Europe. However, the silver lining here, is that spikes in volatility drive volume and the evolving landscape may also
present new product opportunities for us in cash and derivatives. If April was any indication, volumes have already
picked up in the first half of April and throughout the month.
Lastly, while the low interest rate environment is conducive to balance sheet repair, our European derivatives business,
which is focused on the short end of the yield curve, is at a cyclical low and market participants see more opportunities
to trade other interest rate underliers. That said, our derivatives trading volumes in Europe are holding up reasonably
well. When the prospect for rate changes emerge, we should return to a more normal growth trajectory.
Please turn to Slide 5. On Slide 5, we highlight a number of the growth initiatives that we are in the process of
executing. This is a chart we showed at Investor Day. Though in the quarter we provided you with our approach to
building out clearing, announced Project Trinity and launched a new initiative in rates for our European derivatives
business. I'm not going to go through each of them, as the team went through these a few weeks ago in a lot of detail,
but we will be continuing to update you on these initiatives in earnings calls in the future.
I would, however, like to comment on our technology services business. While we continue to see our technology
business as a growth driver, we have experienced some dampening of demand recently. The spending growth rate in
the technology sector has slowed more than we anticipated, which has resulted in lower technology sales in the first
quarter. This is partly due to geo-economic factors, but also uncertainty over the future regulatory landscape.
Our clients are demanding that major initiatives which they undertake, should pay back in 12 months to 18 months and
cost no more than their current operating and capital expenses to implement. In other words, no running costs, financial
engineering is becoming a major part of deal structures now.
Decision making for many of our clients and prospects has also become more complex and as a result, takes more time
and when you do get close to a deal, there's a lot more parties involved in signing off. New initiatives have slowed and
our customers are focused on cutting costs from existing infrastructure, such as reducing the number of vendors and
cutting costs from existing vendor spend and we are seeing this in the reduction in unused cabinet inventory in both our
Basildon and Mahwah data centers.
The silver lining we hope to all of this, is that these issues support a managed service model that we have created with
our business over the last 12 months to 18 months. We have hit a temporary air pocket, which we will have to work
through, but we are confident that we will return to double-digit growth in revenue once the environment stabilizes.
Why are we confident? We have several key deals in the hopper and we are seeing some nice developments as a result
of our acquisition of a 25% stake in Fixnetix, where we are building a joint product pipeline. Other recent deals include
a hosted matching engine for a global investment bank, a recently announced partnership with the Americas Trading
Group to provide access to South American markets and our agreement with the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing
to improve our customers' market data experience, by delivering market data for all securities and derivatives traded by
Hong Kong in a common message format.
Please turn to Slide 6. On Slide 6, we highlight the progress that we have been making in technology IPOs over the last
few years and the strong pipeline for deals already on file with NYSE language. One of the areas on which we have
been focused and has been a growth driver for us on the new listings front, is emerging growth companies in the
technology arena.

In the early 2000s, we had less than a 10% market share of the technology space. In 2008, we had about 20% and we
have since grown our market share to approximately 60% year to-date in 2012, which includes success more recently
with companies like Yelp, LinkedIn, Pandora and Millennial Media.
There is also currently a strong pipeline with 118 IPOs on file with NYSE language, adding up to roughly $20 billion in
proceeds, which includes the likes of Avaya, ServiceNow, Silver Spring Networks and MobiTV. While we have seen
European market concerns creep back into the market, we still believe that the IPO window is open and we will see
more companies come to market in both the U.S. and Europe.
Lastly from me before I turn it over to Mike, please turn to Slide 7. Consider this the first of many updates to come on
what we call Project 14. We're purposely calling this project Project 14, because it is not about this quarter or even this
year, it is about the time between now and 2014.
Our goal is to spend this year, next year and the year after, executing against three pillars; targeted growth, cost
efficiency and strategic deployment of capital, so that by the end of 2014, we are in an even better position to compete
and win in our core businesses. Larry and Mike will be spearheading the cost efficiency part of this project and we will
be as transparent as we're able to, to allow you to track our progress, so nobody will have to guess how far along we are
in this program.
We are going to be focused on a series of short, medium and long-term actions around our technology platforms,
streamlining our organization and optimizing how we do business. We will divest underperforming assets and we will
build-out clearing, both of which we believe will provide us with incremental revenue that Mike will discuss in more
detail, but will also allow us to reduce costs.
So in the four weeks since we first announced the program, how are we doing? On the growth side of the ledger, we
have lots of initiatives that are in progress, which we believe will yield return on our investment, regardless of how the
market environment evolves. Our focus is not only on executing these initiatives shown in the growth bucket, but also
seeking additional opportunities to create value.
On the efficiency front, our costs are down and following our closure of SecFinex, we finalized the unwind of NYSE
Blue. This is not meant to be a verdict on the environmental space, just simply a recognition that this market will take
much longer to develop than we, or our shareholders are willing to wait.
On the capital front, I think we can check a couple of boxes and it is nice to see that several of our peers are taking a
page from our playbook, by adding to their buybacks or establishing or increasing their dividends.
Lastly, we bought back $125 million of stock in the quarter, our CapEx was $43 million, in line with our full year
guidance of about $200 million and we announced plans to re-evaluate several more of our minority investments.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Mike for a review of our financial results.
Michael S. Geltzeiler
Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 8 provides comparative GAAP results for the first quarter of 2012. This
quarter, there are several reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.34 per share and our non-GAAP EPS of
$0.47 per share. In the quarter, we reported a $31 million charge for merger and exit expenses, which included $16
million related to final fees on the DB merger.
Severance and exit costs were higher in the quarter, as we launched our Project 14 efficiency effort. Our GAAP results
also reflect the impact of several discrete tax items related to a favorable tax settlement with U.K. tax authorities, which
was more than offset by a noncash expense related to changes of several legal entities in the U.S.
Our review of our financial results from this point forward, will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs
and the discrete tax items.

Slide 9 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter. As we saw this quarter, operating leverage
cuts both ways and that is really the story for the quarter. Lower volatility and volumes in all our venues, but
particularly European derivatives, coupled with a weaker euro have negatively impacted revenues versus Q1 2011 and
last quarter.
Revenues of $601 million for the quarter, were down 11% year-over-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter. Volumes were
down an average of 17% year-over-year and were down an average of 7% from the traditionally slower fourth quarter
period.
While we continue to make headway in diversifying our business model, trading related net revenue still makes up
approximately 50% of our revenue base. This revenue stream was down $88 million or 25% year-over-year. Revenue
from other streams were up $10 million or 3% versus Q1 prior year.
Our costs were lower $10 million or 2% for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter, down from 26%
in the prior year. The decline in the effective tax rate year-over-year was due to the aforementioned tax changes in the
U.K. and U.S. And our diluted share count was reduced 3 million shares to 259 million shares this quarter. The period
end outstanding share count was 255 million.
Slide 10 provides our consolidated and segment results on a currency-neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened this
quarter versus prior year for both the euro and the British pound. For the first quarter, 45% of our net revenue was
denominated in either euros or pounds and 55% in U.S. dollars. Currency impact on net revenue for the quarter was
negative $9 million versus prior year and unfavorable $5 million versus the previous quarter. Foreign exchange
contributed an unfavorable $4 million to operating income this quarter versus prior year.
On a currency-neutral basis, first quarter net revenues were down 10% and operating income decreased 24% versus the
first quarter of 2011. Operationally, revenues for our Derivatives and Cash Trading and Listings increased 24% and 6%
respectively. Our Technology segment revenues were up an adjusted 6%.
Slides 11 and 12 detail the financial performance for our Derivative segment. Derivatives accounted for 29% of our
consolidated net revenues and 35% of our operating income in the first quarter, due to the decrease of $60 million in
net revenues year-over-year, principally driven by lower European derivative trading volumes. Volumes were weakest
in the rates area, while equity future and option volumes were also impacted by the underlying reduction in equity
trading.
Open interest has moved higher from year end 2011 levels, but is 17% lower than Q1 2011. We are at cyclical lows for
this business, which is geared to the short-end of the yield curve, but we are confident that when expectations for rate
increases escalate we'll return to a growth trajectory for this business. Revenue capture for the quarter was lower for
NYSE Liffe versus both Q4 and prior year first quarter.
The decline year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was principally due to a shift in volume mix, specifically lower
volumes and higher capture, short-term interest rate products, as well as modified pricing for the trading of individual
equity options and index futures and options on the NYSE Liffe, Amsterdam and Belgium.
Capture for the competitive U.S. options business was lower year-over-year, but stable on a linked quarter basis.
Higher percentage of dividend strategy trades over Arca, the fee caps, was offset by a stronger capture on NYSE Amex
Options. NYSE Amex Options is on track for a record monthly market share in April, of 16%.
A clearing build is in full swing with a target date for fully in sourcing LiffeClear by Q3 2013. This is expected to save
an annualized $30 million. Additionally, moving continental clearing to LiffeClear is targeted for Q1 2014. This move
will enable us to realize approximately $40 million in annual revenues, a traditional Derivative clearinghouse margins.
Similarly, Slide 13 and 14 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading
and Listings accounted for 51% of our consolidated net revenues and 53% of our operating income in the first quarter.
Cash trading and listings net revenue was $304 million in the first quarter of 2012, down 7% versus the prior year
period and down 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. The decrease was principally due to lower volumes,
driven by a lower consolidated tape and an increase in loss exchange trading in the U.S.

European cash ADV of 1.6 million transactions, decreased 12% from the first quarter of 2011 levels, but was in line
with fourth quarter 2011. For April 2012, we have seen a dramatic improvement in European cash volumes, with ADV
rising nearly 20% from Q1. In U.S. cash equities, volumes decreased 23% to 1.8 billion shares, compared to prior year
and decreased 16% from fourth quarter 2011 levels. April month-to-date, U.S. Cash Trading volumes remain at
depressed levels.
Non-exchange traded share or TRF share, has increased several percentage points year-to-date March, to approximately
34% of the U.S. Cash Trading, due to lower volatility and has impacted our market share in the U.S. Cash, which was
down in Q1, both against fourth quarter 2011 and first quarter 2011 levels.
Market share in Europe has stabilized for the last few quarters at 65% in our four European markets, compared to 70%
in the prior year. European share figures exclude loss exchange trading volume.
Revenue capture for the U.S. Cash increased to $0.042 per 100 shares handled for Q1, well above the $0.037 recorded
in the first quarter of 2011 and above the $0.039 in Q4.
Revenue capture for European Cash decreased to $0.57 from $0.67 in the first quarter of 2011 and was down slightly
from the $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2011. The 14% decline in capture year-over-year, was driven primarily by the
overall decline in value traded in a weaker euro, partially offset by higher average basis point fee.
Slide 15 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information
and Technology Solutions accounted for 20% of our net revenue and 12% of our operating income in the first quarter
of 2012. Information Services and Technology Solutions revenue was $121 million in the first quarter, an increase of
$5 million or 4% from Q1 prior year. In constant exchange rates, revenues were up 6% on prior year.
Software sales in particular, are traditionally weak in quarter one versus quarter four, but in 2012 the economic
environment accentuated this trend. While the Q1 results are below our expectations for this business, they reflect a
very challenging environment for financial technology spending in the industry. Clients are delaying technology
decisions, reducing staff levels, which impacts market data revenues and the lower volatility and trading environment is
impacting co-location and connectivity revenues. We expect this trend to continue at least through quarter two.
Medium term, we remain convinced that we can resume double-digit top line growth. We have a solid pipeline of
managed service opportunities and new product offerings.
Slide 16 provides a reconciliation of our underlying cost base and details investment spending for the quarter. This
format also provides a comparison to our full year cost guidance. This will enable investors to track our realization of
the $250 million in annualized savings we committed to at the Investor Day as part of Project 14.
Current period expenses of $405 million are rebased to currency rates for our 2012 cost guidance, resulting in a rebase
cost base in 2001 – Q1 2012 of $409 million. Expenses' total is $8 million in the three growth initiatives during the
quarter, this translates to a first quarter core expenses of $401 million. The cost guidance for core expenses to range
between $1,580 million and $1,600 million, which represents a projected 25% savings on the $250 million Project 14
goal.
Using our traditional methodology and measuring expenses year-over-year on a constant dollar and constant portfolio
basis, costs were down $12 million or 3%.
Looking to Q2, the April divestiture of NYSE Blue should save us $5 million in cost and $1 million in operating losses
per quarter. Additionally, we expect to ramp up spending for our clearing and contract-for-differences initiatives.
Slide 17 details our cash and debt position as of March 31, 2012. Our cash and debt positions were similar to Q4 2011,
with gross debt at $2.1 billion. This, despite a first quarter where we paid annual bonuses, repurchased $125 million of
stock and dispersed accumulated Section 31 fees. Although debt levels were constant, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage
ratio increased to two times, reflecting a weak Q1 for EBITDA.

Capital expenditures were $43 million in the quarter, compared to $35 million in the prior year quarter. First half of the
year is our strongest period for free cash flow generation, as a result of billings for annual listing fees.
We executed $125 million in stock repurchases in the first quarter, repurchasing 4.3 million shares at an average price
of $29.73. Last week, the board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the second quarter of 2012, which is
payable on June 29.
Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Duncan for closing remarks.
Duncan L. Niederauer
Thanks, Mike. So just to wrap up and then we'll – as I said, we'll leave the normal time for some questions and I know
we've got several queued up already, so we'll take them – as many as we can.
So in conclusion, despite the challenging environment, we're pleased with the progress we're making on our strategy to
create a global capital markets community that will empower our clients to innovate and collaborate. As we move
through 2012, we are not sitting still waiting for the operating environment to improve. As we said at our Investor Day,
we believe there is further value that can be unlocked by having these businesses under one umbrella. We are focusing
on unlocking that potential, which is what Project 14 is all about.
We're focusing on the leverage within our control to execute against our community strategy and drive a step up in our
underlying earnings per share growth between now and 2014. This will be accomplished, as we've said a few times
today, through a mix of targeted revenue generating initiatives, accelerated cost efficiency efforts and strategic capital
deployment.
With that, we'll open the line for your question and thanks for listening.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Howard Chen of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Hi. Good morning, Duncan. Good morning, Mike.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Hi.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Morning.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Duncan, just on the Technology business and the delayed decision making you're speaking
to, can you quantify that in terms of backlogs as you guys all see it? And second, how long would this take to – does it
need to persist for you to rethink that $1 billion target and the spending you've all allocated to that? Thanks.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Yeah. Thanks, Howard. Yeah. Look, one quarter does not make a trend. We realize that
a lot of our big customers are – who are the most obvious users of the – of some of the hosted and managed services are
going through their own business re-invention discussions internally. They are being asked to do that in a
macro-environment that is impacting them as much as it's impacting us, as you can see from some of the results that the
integrated investment banks have been publishing.
So I don't think – we are certainly not [ph] leading (29:31) internally at this point to worry about whether this quarter,
after three years of pretty consistent growth, is suddenly the beginning of a new trend. I think if this persisted
throughout this year, we would have to rethink where we are on that, but we continue to believe there is good bolt-on
acquisition opportunities and there is good organic growth opportunities in that business and I will say what I've said
before, I think that will largely – the success in that arena, will largely define the longer-term success of this company,
because I think that's where we and others in the industry are going to have to head.

Your next question comes from Niamh Alexander of KBW.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Can I just go back to the clearing, because you're on
target, you're tracking ahead, but I don't think we had the opportunity to talk at the Analyst Day about the capital
requirements? Because your leverage ratio picked up a little bit this past quarter. Are there some numbers you can share
with us, just in terms of leverage ratios or interest coverage or certain levels like bad debt you've talked through with
the rating agencies, that you want to be comfortable with? Because you're going to become the guarantor, right, once
you fully own the clearing?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Yes and no, because, yes you're – all those statements are correct. But if you look at
what we've done with NYPC and things like that, where our contribution when we started that remember, we had to
fund the guarantee fund there as well. And the issues there are – that was a $25 million to $50 million funding.
Remember that in our LiffeClear business, we are doing most of the clearing already. We in source everything both the
treasury and risk management functions. So of course, we will continue to stay focused on that. We'll seed it with
whatever's required, that we're undertaking the discussions with the FSA now to talk about what they want that to look
like, but we don't think that's going to be a huge hit to capital if indications to date are any barometer.
We also continue to think that although our credit rating is obviously well above investment grade, well into investment
grade territory, I continue to believe, as I mentioned to some of you before, that looking at the credit rating of the
parent company of any clearinghouse, I believe is a strange way of thinking about it. If you really get down to it, when
the exchange's guarantee fund would be tapped is so far down the risk waterfall, that I continue to say and I can't say
that anybody's listening, but I'm going to continue to say it anyway, that the right way to think about the credit exposure
at any clearinghouse is really a weighted average of all the clearinghouse's participants. I think that's much more
important.
And I think we're much more focused with the regulators that we're talking to about the real time risk controls in the
clearinghouse and how to manage all of that. I think that's much more important than A, the credit rating of the topco
and B, whether we put in $25 million, $50 million or $100 million in a guarantee fund, those are interesting facts, but
not terribly relevant as compared to the other stuff.
So I'll do some more homework into that with my derivative specialists and if the answer they give me is quite different
than what I just shared, we'll make sure we circulate something on that.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Okay. Thanks, Duncan.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Thanks, Niamh.

Your next question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Yeah. Good morning. I know this is small part of revenues now, but I was surprised on the
U.S. cash equities, because a lot has been talked about the market share declining, but your revenue capture actually
went up 8%, your peers went down 10%. So I guess the question is, the dynamics of what was going on, we know stuff
moved to the TRF, but could you explain a little bit more what was going on with your revenue capture going up versus
the peer going down? And actually your revenue declined less than your peer as well.

<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Right. So it's a good question, Rich. Larry is out of the office today. So I'll do my best
to answer that. And then, if Larry's got more details or Joe does, we'll ask them to follow-up with you and others on this
and Mike may have something to add as well, but I'll start by saying this, I think we're not going to pat ourselves on the
back. Everyone can see the market share trends, right? And as I said in my remarks and have said to some of you, in a
low volatility, low volume environment, it lends itself more to internalization and it's not obvious to us why if volatility
and volumes stay here, why the dark pool percentage of the market isn't going to stabilize or even increase potentially
higher.
Now our view maybe relative to some of our competitors, is it's fairly simple calculus. You either chase revenue
capture and profitability, or you chase market share. Obviously, in this macro-environment, it's difficult to do both. I
think some of our competitors have chosen that they believe the optics of market share are better. I think we continue to
believe that the market's pretty fragmented. I'm not sure getting a couple of market share points is going to convince
anybody that we have a better business model. I think the revenue capture is more important because our view is, if you
return to a more normal volume and volatility environment, we know that volatility's highly correlated with our market
share and I think we've been a little more focused on revenue capture in reasonable ways, which the clients are fully
aware of, and I think we do that rather than chase market share. Is that – Mike anything you want to add to that? And
then, I can have Larry follow-up too.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Right. We chose not to chase some of that market share and there have been some
modest price increases on port fees and some other aspects of the business during the quarter. But I think it's mostly
what you suggested, our source is the competitors.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Right.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Okay. And Rich, I'll check with Larry and Joe, who aren't on the call and if they've got
more to add, we'll circulate something to you and your peers.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Okay. Do I get my follow-up, that's what you said in the beginning? One follow-up
question would be -
<A - Stephen C. Davidson>: When did I say that?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Okay. Go ahead, Rich?
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: In the stated instructions.
<A - Stephen C. Davidson>: Bend the rules, buddy.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: I had my guys check the transcript, it said you had a follow-up. But anyway. On IDCG, I
guess I'm trying to – the debt to EBITDA jumped up and I know it's a crazy calculation how they annualize year
to-date. But when you're looking for that excess capital, I guess the question is, how do you come out on IDs on LCH,
given that they've sold – they're acquiring IDCG and partnering with NASDAQ and taking majority share hold over
LSE. So how would you – how quickly – what's your strategy there with LCH?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Okay. I'm going to pretend that was a question, Rich and I'll do my best to answer it. So
I will follow-up later. But here's what I think is going on. So let's just have it all pretty clear. So we already partnered
with DTC and NYPC and I think we were hopeful that one future arena of that, the NYSE/DTC partnership in NYPC
could explore was having already coupled Eurodollar futures and the cash funds to create a more capitally-efficient
clearinghouse. I think the next obvious leg to that stool, will be to try to figure out a way to get into interest rate swaps.
It's no secret to anybody on this call, that LCH's SwapClear subsidiary, which is more or less governed by the
important banks who are the liquidity providers in the swaps market, has been looking for a partner on U.S. soil for that
for quite some time. And it's also no secret that they are the dominant force in the interest rate swap business.
So our view was – and we've announced that with Project Trinity, which we referenced at the Investor Day, the idea is
LCH picks up basically the license by buying IDCG from NASDAQ. I don't view that as a partnering strategy. I view
that as them buying the license to actually partner with us and DTC. So now, we can bring that third leg of the stool

into NYPC over time. So that's what Project Trinity is all about.
At the same time on the other side of the pond, LSE is going to acquire a majority share of LCH, assuming that deal
gets approved sometime this year or next year. The timing on them getting approval will more or less coincide with us
finishing the vertical integration of our own clearinghouse. So remember, we in sourced, as I said earlier, all but the
treasury and risk management functions, that's what we are working on, that's consistent with the press release that we
put out a few months ago about our timetable on all that. So roughly this time next year, maybe a little later, we will be
completing that migration into the clearinghouse. So we will have our own clearinghouse. LSE will own a majority of
LCH and we and LCH and DTC will hopefully by then, be partnering on that three-legged stool I referenced earlier, so
that we'll be able to clear interest rate futures, the cash underliers, as well as interest rate swaps and I think that will be
an unprecedented cross-margining opportunity as well. So hopefully that addresses most of what you were asking
about.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: And just, Rich, one quick thing to add, because it's come up twice now. On the debt to
EBITDA, all we're doing when we went to 1.6 times to two times. We took the first quarter EBITDA, multiplied it by
four, because that how the agencies look at things. So the one-time bump is clearly moving from 2011, where EBITDA
was higher to a pretty weak first quarter.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: And we have plenty of capital flexibility to fund the – to put the funds that are
necessary in the clearinghouses that we'll be operating. So no worries on that.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Thank you.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: All right? Next?
Operator
Yes. Your next question comes from Roger Freeman of Barclays.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Good morning, Roger.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Good morning. Just on the Technology Solutions revenues, just the sequential
decline, you mentioned a few things during the comments. I think one of the more interesting, taking down some of the
unused space in the data centers. I guess I'm just trying to get what drove the sequential decline? Was it really just on
the margin cost cutting on the side of the dealers, as opposed to any significant contracts rolling off?
And then B, if you look at that total revenue pie, how much of it is subject to short term, cancellation notices?
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: I'll address that, Roger. So the first thing is, I know we've been only at this a couple of
years, but the first quarter is always weak relative to the fourth quarter in almost any software business and our
business no different. So I think the sequential review always tends to suffer now. In a couple of previous years we had
some offsetting good guys in the first quarter, that made the first quarter results maybe look more robust. So the
principal reason why moving sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter is lower software, which would
happen in almost any year.
I think when we talked on top of that, is with the lower volumes one of the other revenue boosts we've been getting is
people purchasing more cabinets, more safety connectivity, et cetera. And clearly in the lower volume environment, we
didn't say there were a lot of cancellations, what we were saying is, there is some excess capacity. And clearly, we're
not getting incremental sales, when in this volume environment. So it's really those two things, but I think again, we
had a pretty well robust fourth quarter for software sales. And the first quarter always is weaker, this particular quarter
was even a little weaker than normal, because of some of the things Duncan and I mentioned earlier.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell, ISI Group.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Hi. Good morning, folks. Hey, Duncan, just a question on high frequency trading. To what
extent do you think lower high-frequency participation this quarter impacted results versus last quarter? Obviously in a
weaker volatile – lower volatile environment, HFT typically declines, but to what extent do you think it has an impact,
not only on trading, but also some of the recurring revenue streams? And then going forward, to what extent do you
think it might be structurally lower? So if we do get an improvement in volatility down the road, do you think it will
snap back to say, 2011 levels, in terms of...?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Yeah. It's something we think about here a lot, Brian and it's – and you try to have as
much insight into it as you can, given, we don't – given the fact that we don't have all the information. I do think that
the confluence of factors, including lower volatility, lower volumes, the high frequency community diversifying into
other asset classes and geographies, not being as reliant on the U.S. And frankly, as we've articulated I think publicly a
couple of times, the regulatory – the potential for more regulatory scrutiny and in the interim, a lot of politics if I can
use that word, around this subject, some of the high frequency folks we talked to are simply saying, look if there's
going to be that much focus on it, when the majority of what we do is liquidity provision, I think whether it's an
unintended consequence or not, some of the rhetoric from the regulators and politicians may be leading the high
frequency community to think about a lot of other alternatives and maybe in fact accelerating their move to either A,
other asset classes and geographies or B, some of the more lightly regulated liquidity pools. Right?
I mean if you and I were high frequency folks and every day we're reading headlines in the paper, informed or
uninformed, that say, we're going to be bringing a lot more scrutiny to bear, it is a rational decision to go look at other
market opportunities or to trade in the less regulated markets. And I actually think that part of the increase in dark pool
liquidity is coming from a change in demographics there as well, because I don't think the high frequency guys have
left the U.S. market entirely, but I do think they have shifted some of their volume from the regulated to the less
regulated markets, which you have to say is a rational decision on their part.
So that's as much information as we've got at the moment, some of that's obviously speculative and again, as I said to
Rich or someone earlier about their question, I can have Larry and Joe, do a little more work on that and if they have
some different views, I'll encourage them to share with you guys.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: That's great. That's helpful. Thank you.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Good thing. We'll take one more, guys and then, let everyone get back to work. Okay?
Operator
Yes. Your final question comes from Alex Kramm, UBS.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Hey. Good morning. Just a very quick one on your next, Mike, you mentioned the strong April
volumes so far, do you think this is just driven by some of the uncertainties and volatility in Europe? Or is there some
sort of mix shift going on in terms of users that we should think about, when we think about pricing in the second
quarter? Thank you.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Yeah. We had no pricing changes. So I think it is volatility. It's hard to say any one thing.
But I think we definitely are seeing with some of the European issues coming on the table again and some concerns,
elections happening as we see, I think we're just seeing a pickup in trading really started in the beginning of the month
and it's been pretty consistent through the month of April.

So it's again, volatility is a funny thing, you never really know when it turns on or off, but that's why we're not
long-term concerned, but we've been through the rough patch the last five months or so. And this one market, we're
seeing a little more volatility. We didn't see it in the U.S., but we're seeing it in Europe.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Great.
Duncan L. Niederauer
Okay, guys, as always we thank you. Mike and Stephen and the team will be available for any follow-ups or if you'd
like to do one-on-one. And Larry and Joe, will fill in any holes that I left in some of the answers to questions that were
more specific to the demographics in the U.S. markets. So thanks for your attention and we'll talk to all of you soon.
Have a great day.
