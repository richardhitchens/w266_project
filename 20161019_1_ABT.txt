MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. All
participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions]

question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by
Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission.
I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Scott Leinenweber
Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are: Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer; Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration; and Brian Yoor, Senior Vice
President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand
Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable
GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on
our website at abbott.com.
Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange
unless otherwise noted.
As you recall, Abbott issued a press release on April 28, 2016 announcing the transaction with St. Jude Medical and a
related press release on October 18, 2016. Please refer to those releases for additional important information about
Abbott, St. Jude, and related matters.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Miles D. White
Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.59, at the high end of our
guidance range. We also raised the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range
to $2.19 to $2.21, exceeding the initial guidance we set at the beginning of the year.
Sales increased 4% in the quarter or more than 5.5% excluding the impact of Venezuela. Growth was led by strong
performance in Established Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices. We achieved our expectations overall, and our
pipeline continued to deliver a steady cadence of new product approvals and launches that are contributing to growth.
At the same time, we continued to actively and strategically shape our portfolio. In September, we took the next logical
step in shaping our Medical Device business with the announcement that we will sell our Medical Optics business to
J&J. This action is in line with our strategic decision to sharpen our focus on building leadership in cardiovascular
devices.
I'll now briefly review our third quarter results. And I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 5.5%
in the quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in core laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics. In
August at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry [AACC] conference, we unveiled our next-generation suite
of instruments called Alinity. The Alinity suite includes new instruments for every segment of the diagnostics market in
which we compete. Over the next few months, we'll launch new systems for point-of-care, immunoassay testing,
clinical chemistry, and blood screening in Europe. Over time, we'll introduce additional systems and launch the full
Alinity suite into additional geographies, providing a highly differentiated platform for sustainable long-term growth.
In Nutrition, sales declined 1% in the quarter, below our expectations due to soft performance in China pediatric
nutrition. As you may recall, I expressed caution on the near-term outlook in China in our last earnings call. Over the
last few months, market conditions have remained challenging there, including rapid channel shifts and new safety
regulations that are driving an oversupply of product in the market and aggressive levels of discounting.
While those conditions are expected to remain challenging in the near term, the long-term fundamentals of the market
remain attractive. We have the right portfolio of products for the various channels and the best-in-class global supply
network. We've also continued to focus on strengthening our competitiveness in order to deliver growth over the long
term. Outside of China, we continue to perform well in Southeast Asia and Latin America, and again achieved
above-market growth in U.S. pediatric nutrition.
In Medical Devices, sales growth in our vascular business was led by double-digit growth of MitraClip, our
market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation, and high single-digit growth in
endovascular products, driven by vessel closure products and Supera, our unique stent for the treatment of blockages in
the leg. During the quarter, we received FDA approval for Absorb, the only fully dissolving vascular stent and an
important addition to our drug-eluting stent portfolio.

In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of more than 20% was driven by continued consumer uptake of our
revolutionary FreeStyle Libre system in Europe. In September, we received FDA approval for our FreeStyle Libre Pro
system in the United States. Libre Pro will help healthcare professionals make better customized treatment decisions
for their patients and at a significantly lower cost than other professional continuous glucose monitoring systems.
We also submitted the consumer version of the FreeStyle Libre system for FDA review during the quarter. This system
is designed to eliminate the need for routine finger sticks and provides glucose data in a simple format that allows
people with diabetes to achieve better health outcomes.
And in Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales grew 9% in the quarter. Double-digit growth in key emerging
markets was led by strong growth in India, China, and Latin America. EPD continues to execute at a very high level
and remains well aligned with the fundamentals of driving long-term growth in emerging markets, a rising middle
class, improving access to healthcare, and consumers that are seeking and willing to pay for high-quality brands.
So in summary, we achieved our financial expectations for the quarter, and our diverse business model continues to
deliver reliable growth. We continued to advance our leadership and competitive position through several new product
approvals and launches across our businesses. And we continued to take strategic steps to shape our portfolio, building
leadership positions for long-term growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?
Brian B. Yoor
Great. Thank you, Miles. Sales for the quarter increased 4% on an operational basis; that is, excluding an unfavorable
impact of 1.1% from foreign exchange. Reported sales increased 2.9% in the quarter.
Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.3% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment
was 6.2% of sales. And adjusted SG&A expense was 29.7% of sales, in line with our prior guidance.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2016, we narrowed our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.19 to
$2.21. The midpoint of our guidance range reflects double-digit underlying growth, offset by the impact of foreign
exchange on our operating results.
We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year 2016. Based on current
exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact somewhat above 2% on our full-year reported sales.
This would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2016.
We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes
underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We also continue to forecast adjusted R&D
investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approaching 31% of sales for the full year.
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.66, again
reflecting double-digit underlying growth. We forecast operational sales growth of mid-single digits in the fourth
quarter.
We have now annualized the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar that began late in the second quarter of last
year. And at current exchange rates, we expect a favorable impact to sales from exchange of somewhat more than 50
basis points in the fourth quarter.
Turning to other aspects of the P&L for the fourth quarter, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above
57%, adjusted R&D investment somewhat above 6.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of around 28% of sales.
And finally, we project specified items of $0.25 in the fourth quarter.
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick summary of our fourth quarter operational sales growth
outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit sales growth. In Nutrition, we

forecast sales growth similar to the third quarter. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid-single-digit growth. And lastly in our
Medical Devices business, for Vascular we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In Diabetes Care, we forecast
double-digit sales growth. And in Medical Optics, we forecast low to mid-single-digit sales growth.
With that, we will now open the call for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. Let me start with Nutritionals,
Miles. That's now your challenged business, so to speak. Can you just spend a few more minutes on China? What you
see playing out in that market, and how much of what's playing out today is transient versus a longer-term or structural
change?
<A - Miles D. White>: I'll try to. I'd say that the market in China has been in a bit of a transition for a number of
months, it would appear, maybe even a little more. And it depends on who you are and what channels you're in and so
forth depending on how it affects you. We expected this year to see 7% to 8% growth in China, slightly above the GDP
growth, et cetera. And what we're seeing now is flat to low single digits, and I think some of our competitors have
reported the same. So we've gotten some triangulation on just underlying market growth rate.
But beyond that, a number of dynamics are at work here. There are some pretty rapid channel shifts from traditional
channels like modern trade to various e-commerce channels and so forth, and I don't think that's a surprise to anybody
in terms of just overall trends. But the speed and magnitude of it I think has hit China differently than what you'd see in
the U.S. or other countries. And so that's been a pretty big chunk. In the process of that, what's happened is some
inventories have piled up in let's say traditional channels while the market's needs have been satisfied by e-commerce
channels. And so the market has burned through that, I guess, to some degree, so we've seen growth slow. And in our
case, there's been a loss of about 0.5 share point we estimate.
We're also seeing a fair amount of market and competitor reaction to the anticipated new food safety laws, which will
become effective in a little over a year, in January 2018. Those new laws will limit the number of brands per
manufacturing plant, per competitor, et cetera. All products have to be re-registered and so on. And the government's
got a number of goals for that, but I think what's at work here is we're seeing a lot of competitors oversupply this
market. And under those scenarios, you see a lot of discounting. So we're seeing that. We're seeing the discounting.
We're seeing the channel shift. We're seeing slower growth there. I do think it's transitional. I do think it's transient, but
I don't think it's going to be a quick adjustment.
I'm cautious for 2017 because I think that it's a little hard to predict the reaction of the many competitors and many
brands in the market to these new food safety laws. So I think what we're seeing here could be with us for a while. But I
think the long-term attractiveness of the market is definitely there because there aren't fewer moms, there aren't fewer
babies, et cetera. But we're in an odd transition period that I don't think was anticipated by the government's intent with
its new food safety laws or, frankly, even the channel shifts.
So I know that's a long-winded answer, but there are a lot of things stacked up here happening at the same time. We've
watched the results of some of our competitors and see that it's hit all of us, but all of us differently depending on what
channels we might be more prominent in. And taking that apart and trying to understand all the dynamics there I'd say
has been a key focus of the last couple of quarters here, and I think we've got a pretty good handle on what's happening,
but I think it's going to be this way for several quarters.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Understood. I'm going to just ask a question about 2017. And, Miles, I know you're not
going to give 2017 guidance, but I just want to think about the framework for it. When we had the call to announce the
St. Jude acquisition, and then on the call that you and I had back in June, you talked about the goal of the company

historically of delivering double-digit underlying EPS growth. Let's just say that's 10% and that the goal for 2017
would be to try and deliver that, and then on top of it you'd get the accretion from the transactions. Obviously, we don't
know yet what's going to happen with Alere, but it looks like St. Jude is on track to close. If we think about the base
business piece of that, given that Nutritionals is obviously looking weaker than it was six months ago, the Device
business is looking better, so there are some pluses and minuses. Is the underlying business on track to deliver 10%
next year? And is the right way to think about 2017 the underlying 10% plus the accretion, or should we back off of the
underlying expectations? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: I'd say first of all, you're right. It's too early to be giving 2017 guidance or even be able to be
precise about it. But I would say look, the underlying growth does continue to be strong in our businesses. Fortunately,
we are very diverse, many companies, many businesses, many products, many geographies. And we are not that
over-indexed in China in any particular case. So I can't say that I think the China pediatric business is going to be great
growth next year, but I don't think it's going to impact in a fashion the overall strength or the growth of the company
globally.
So I'd tell you that I see the underlying growth continuing to be strong. Clearly, that will have some impact on us. But
at this point, I think we're seeing great growth in our Pharmaceutical business. We're in the midst of preparing to launch
a number of new systems in Diagnostics. FreeStyle Libre I'd say is going gangbusters in Europe, and we're looking
forward to having that in the U.S. shortly. There's a lot of new product launched and approval happening, so there's a
lot of drivers of growth here. And frankly, I think there's a lot of growth to be seen in St. Jude as well. So I remain in
the same position.
I know we've got a slower situation in China, but I don't see us as so over-indexed in China that that is somehow going
to knock us back in a way that I can forecast for you right now that this is going to have a huge impact on the company
next year. Frankly, if it was going to have a huge impact, in a fashion you'd have seen it this quarter, and we did. We've
seen it in our China numbers, but look at how the company performed. We exceeded our expectations yet again and
owing to the strength and the diversity of the company and the strength in Pharmaceuticals, the strength in Medical
Devices. I can remember a couple of years ago we were talking about Medical Devices as the weakness, not so much
the strength.
So I'd say the good news is we've got a lot of parts of the business that are performing well, if not better, in the midst of
new product cycles and launches. And frankly, the other parts of Nutrition are doing reasonably well. If you look at the
U.S., which I think everybody has become accustomed to ignoring in the numbers, the U.S. is having a better year than
planned, a better year than in a long time, and it's better than solid.
So I think there are a lot of things happening that offset China to some degree, so I'd caution this way. I'd say look, we
always start the year looking for double-digit earnings growth, and yes, we will have the addition of St. Jude on top of
that. And as you said, Alere remains to be seen. But in any case, I'm not in a position yet where I can say no, I've got
different expectations for 2017. I actually think the underlying growth continues to be strong and everything tracking
according to expectations on strategic moves otherwise.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Perfect, I'll let some others jump in. Thank you, Miles.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital. Your line is open.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Miles, two questions on St. Jude. So the deal is on track to
close by the end of this year, but in the third quarter, you had a cyber security report issued. You had a St. Jude issue,
an advisory regarding battery depletion on some of its older ICDs. So I know you've been in contact with St. Jude, but
maybe talk about what gives you the confidence that these issues will not impact St. Jude's business post the deal close.
And then I had a follow-up.

<A - Miles D. White>: What I'd tell you so far is I think St. Jude has handled all this pretty well, pretty thoroughly, and
not only in terms of their taking it seriously, their own investigation, the third-party consultants and investigators that
they've worked with and employed. I have to say they definitely put patient safety and patient credibility and physician
credibility and the product performance and so forth first, and that's right.
And I think that they've done all the right things. They've been in great communication with us. And based on
everything that we know, I don't see this impacting the close of the deal or the business long term. I've seen a lot of
speculation in the press. Every time there's a product issue or a hiccup or whatever it may be, everybody wants to run to
the headlines and speculate about the deal. I'll tell you, based on everything I see, this deal is going to close. And
determined by the timing of regulatory approval, it's probably going to close by year end. And I haven't seen anything
to date that would suggest otherwise.
Regarding the performance of the company after that, I'll tell you honestly, what I'm most anxious for is for their MRI
compatible claim to be approved by the FDA in the U.S. And frankly, if you look at the rest of their businesses, they're
all growing at a pretty healthy rate and particularly overseas. And I think their success overseas has demonstrated that
when they do get their MRI compatible claim in the U.S. that their recovery of share, recovery of growth rate et cetera
there should be strong. So I haven't changed my expectations about the performance of St. Jude going forward. I can
probably someday give you my opinion about the current circumstances with the cyber security claims and so forth, but
I'll keep my thoughts to myself right now and we'll wait until the deal is closed.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Okay, and just a quick follow-up. St. Jude is going to be accretive to 2017. But did your
accretion calculations, did it contemplate the divestitures that you just announced to Terumo? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: In a fashion, Glenn, it has.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus a little bit on the core business. We
already talked about Nutrition. But maybe you could just discuss some updated thoughts on how you think the
Diagnostics business in Abbott can perform over the next few periods with the Alinity launch, and how things are
going in Medical Devices and some specifics on Absorb and MitraClip and other moving parts there.
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay, that's kind of a big question. Let me start with Diagnostics. I think the Diagnostics
business has been one of the consistent, reliable star performers of the company. It's been good mid to higher
single-digit performing overall. It does have a fair number of moving parts. The core laboratory business I think has
performed exceptionally well; continues to. I think the point-of-care business has. We're going through the exit of an
agreement in our molecular business that we will lap in a number of months. But in any case, I think all of those
businesses are performing commercially well.
What I'm more impressed with, with this team, than anything is that over the last four to five years, they have had an
unprecedented number of systems, new diagnostic systems, in development in R&D that are all beginning to launch
now. And I don't think ever in the history of this industry or this business has any company attempted to develop and
launch multiple new systems simultaneously across every category of its business. And our Diagnostics business is,
both in immunoassay, in clinical chemistry, in hematology, in blood screening, in point-of-care, and then to be
followed in molecular diagnostics. And that's an unprecedented pipeline move. We will see that roll out over years
now.
They're beginning to launch in Europe. We've gotten approvals to go. So we're in an unprecedented launch phase that I
think sustains the growth of the Diagnostics business across the board for years to come, and no other competitor is in a
position to say that. And I think that the value proposition, the performance proposition, the economic proposition of

those systems was well thought out, well designed. They were unveiled and shown at the recent AACC meeting in the
United States to a great reception. So I have nothing but high and positive expectations.
Now having said that, customers roll slowly. They tend to be long-term contractors. They tend to be five, seven,
sometimes 10 years in contracts and in tenders and so forth. So I don't expect it to be a vertical line in terms of sales.
But I think if you think about the gradual rolling of a customer base and taking of share as tenders come due and so
forth, I do expect that our Diagnostics business has a long positive trajectory ahead of it, and no one else does. So I'm
pretty excited about that. I think they're in a uniquely strong position as we look forward, and we're all pretty happy
about that.
It's a challenge to launch that many systems, but we're reviewing them all closely, looking at them all closely. And
while you have all the natural hiccups at the end of a project that you do that cost you a week here and a week there, a
week in the grand scheme of things isn't much. So I'm pretty pleased with how that's going.
With regard to Medical Devices, also pleased, and again, I can start at the top. And let me mention, in Medical Optics,
where I think the cadence of new products and the performance of that R&D team has been exceptional, and
particularly even recently with the launch of the Symfony Intraocular Lenses. And while we have made a deal to sell
that business to J&J, we sell it in great shape, with great products, great technology. They're gaining share in the
cataract and intraocular lens business. I'm really pleased with what the team has been able to do there, and I think that
the business will be in a strategically great home at J&J. We think we got fair value for the business, and we're working
on the integration transition of that to J&J. But I think they've been innovative. They've had a great cadence of new
product development over time. I realize that's mostly to the benefit now of J&J shareholders. But the point is, across
our businesses, we're seeing productivity out of our R&D and new product development like we've never seen before.
If I move to Diabetes Care, our FreeStyle Libre launch in Europe has gone well. We have over 200,000 patients now.
That's a lot, and that's a really good success rate so far. We have very ambitious plans for this product. And to be
honest, we're behind our plan by a month or two, but it's a fairly vertical ramp. It's a pretty high ramp. And that ramp is
occurring at the trajectory we projected but about a month or two behind what we projected, and it will probably stay
that way. So we're going to have a terrific performance, as you can already see in the numbers for this year, and even
that was behind what we had hoped. But it's not because it's not on that trajectory. It just started slower than we had
planned, but now it's pretty on track. And we're anxious to launch the consumer version in the United States and enjoy
the same sort of success here.
And I think it owes to the capability of the product, the unique medical proposition of the product, and frankly the
economic proposition of the product. A lot of payers and a lot of governments will tell you today, don't bring me new
technology. Bring me something more cost-effective that impacts my ability to spread my budget further and treat
patients better. Libre has got that in the equation in a big way. So we're looking forward to the launch of that.
Our Medical Device business will certainly be enhanced by the addition of St. Jude. But at the same time, I think
there's a lot of good things happening in our Vascular business. MitraClip is going well. Supera is going well. We
continue to do well in our stent business in what is otherwise not a growth business. We still remain the world leader in
that category. And Absorb has been licensed and launched in the United States.
So I think across the board in Diagnostics and Devices, without exception, even including AMO, all these businesses
have shown in the last few years real progress, real progress, tangible progress in R&D, in innovation, in development,
in meeting their timelines in a disciplined fashion, bringing new products to market, and we're seeing all that roll out
now and over the next couple of years. And frankly, I think it's going to be sustained after that. Now having said that, I
expect the same out of our St. Jude piece, and I think there's nothing but good there. So we're pretty bullish about it.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Great, thanks for all the thoughts.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.

<Q - Frederick Wise>: Hi. Good morning, Miles.
<A - Miles D. White>: Good morning, Rick.
<Q - Frederick Wise>: Miles, maybe the first question is just on Alere. Obviously, there's been a lot of public noise, if
you will, a lot of headlines, a lot of discussion. But I think when people ask me about it, they just want to be reassured
that the long-term post-merger opportunity that you saw initially is still there. Is that the way – do you still see it as
basically intact and a plug-and-play for the portfolio, Abbott's Diagnostic portfolio still makes sense? Where are you
today on Alere?
<A - Miles D. White>: I'm going to be very limited in the comments that I'm willing to make about Alere, but some of
that's easy to answer. So first of all, yes, there's been a lot of noise, and it's come from a lot of places, not us. And it is
imprudent for us to respond to noise. I think the questions you asked are the right questions. Is the strategic fit there?
Yes, it is. We like the products. We like the businesses. We've said that and I continue to say that. Is the long-term
post-merger opportunity and fit there? Yes, it is, and I've never wavered on that. And I believe that right now, even this
minute. So none of that has changed for me or for us. I believe – I just told you how great I think our Diagnostics
business is doing. Do I think that the Alere businesses are good fit to expand that footprint and especially our
point-of-care business? I do, yes, I've had no change in my view strategically that way at all.
<Q - Frederick Wise>: Okay. So turning to a different topic, back to China briefly and Nutritionals, am I right in
thinking – a couple of parts to the question. Am I right in thinking that China pediatrics is 3% or less of sales? Does it
get worse in 2017 from here, or are you where you are and yes, it will take a year or so to work through?
And maybe two last aspects of the question, knowing you and the way your hands-on approach to management, maybe
are there things that you can do to maybe mitigate some of the near-term challenges? And maybe last related to all this,
the long-term outlook and how confident are you that the excellent performance in Latin America and Southeast Asia is
a sustainable offset in the next few quarters as we get ready for 2018 in China? Thanks, Miles.
<A - Miles D. White>: Are we talking just Nutrition there, Rick?
<Q - Frederick Wise>: Yes. Yes, thank you.
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay, there's a lot there. China I think is about 3% of overall sales. Now that said, yes, it's a
small part of the company as a whole. Nevertheless, it's an important business. It's a big business. It's a business we pay
a lot of attention to. Frankly, China is an important country for us for a lot of our businesses. But it is true that in the
grand scheme of Abbott, as China pediatric goes, the company isn't necessarily going to be driven by just that. So we
think all of our businesses, particularly large ones and that's a large one, are important. But the diversity of the
company and the size of the company obviously absorb shock when it happens in other parts of the company.
So to your question about are we hands-on mitigating and dealing with what we think we can do with the challenges?
Yes, we are. The EVP of that business is spending a lot of time in China. We have made some management leadership
changes in China in a proactive way to enhance our management, our experience, our knowledge, our skill, et cetera
there. I think hope always springs eternal when you make changes in your leadership team, et cetera. But it's getting a
lot of focused attention by the senior leadership team on down and in the right ways. The CFO, the Controller,
everybody who's got any kind of way to have a stake in this has weighed in.
We do as a team look at our spending allocations, our capital allocations, how we're spending, where we're spending,
where the bang for the buck is, et cetera. So I think we've looked at just about everything we can, not only to
specifically focus on improving the situation and the performance in China, but also how to mitigate it if it doesn't
improve enough or fast enough. And so yes, it's getting a fair amount of attention that way across the company.
With regard to Latin America and Southeast Asia, I'm pleased with the progress in both places, pleased with the
performance of the business, frankly pleased with the performance of the business in Europe and other places too. But
I'm going to be careful not to project what I think can happen in any given country because the year always starts with a
certain set of expectations and then has some surprise you didn't anticipate, which is one of the reasons I always tout

the diverse model because somewhere, something is going to go awry or different from your expectations no matter
how tightly you manage everything.
In our case, I'm pleased with our management teams in the various geographies you mentioned. I think they're all doing
well. We've got a lot of talent in our organization. We've made some changes where we needed to in this particular
case. And our challenge in China wasn't talent based as much as market driven and a lot of dynamics that changed
rapidly there that we've had to react to and deal with.
So I think there are a number of other countries picking up slack here, the U.S. surprisingly one of them in the Nutrition
business. I think you can see that in the numbers in the earnings report. Vietnam doing well, strong for us. A lot of
other smaller countries doing well. Vietnam, as you know, is a big business for us in the Nutrition business. And we've
got a terrific manager there and have had for a long time, and that's doing well. So there are some places that are
picking up some of the slack there, and frankly so are other businesses of Abbott like the Pharmaceutical business and
so forth, having a great year in China and other countries and good sustained high-growth performance.
So again, yes, it's proactive. We are mitigating. It's why we're not giving any guidance or anything at this point. As I
answered to Mike Weinstein earlier, the underlying fundamentals of the overall growth rates in our market are good.
The one place that sticks out right now as a challenge is the Pediatric business in China, which is about 3% of the
company's sales.
<Q - Frederick Wise>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Lawrence Biegelsen>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question, just two for me. First, Miles, I know it's a
sensitive subject. But on Alere, the other question we get is now that Alere has fulfilled its reporting requirements and
the business trends have been decent, what else does Abbott want to see before closing the deal? And along those lines,
if you don't complete Alere, how should we think about the dilution from the AMO divestiture and offsetting that in
2017? I did have one follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: First of all, Alere is not a sensitive subject. And at this point, I'm just not going to make a lot of
comments about it. I'd say we are pursuing all the necessary regulatory approvals for the deal. And at this point, that is
the path. The things that have to happen between now and whether a deal finishes here is regulatory approval. So all
necessary approvals are being pursued. We're doing everything we're supposed to do in the contract, and beyond that
I'm not going to forecast it or try to. But that's it. I can't say a lot more about Alere or express opinions or whatever. I
think I've said about what I can say to Rick Wise's question and to yours. And other than that, we'll work through the
regulatory approvals and see what happens.
With regard to AMO, we've said that the perceived dilution of that business will be offset in some fashion, so you don't
need to adjust your model, et cetera. I assume that's the basis of the question because, net of all considerations here in
the mix of our financing of these deals, there are enough moving parts that we won't need to absorb dilution there.
<Q - Lawrence Biegelsen>: That's very helpful. And then you talked about focusing on cardiovascular devices earlier,
and your Diabetes business is doing well. It seems to have a bright future with Libre. I guess my question is, is
Diabetes still strategic for Abbott now that the focus is more on cardiovascular devices? Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah, Diabetes is definitely strategic for Abbott. There have been a number of occasions over
the past gosh, I think five years when I've had inbound phone calls of people interested in acquiring the Diabetes Care
business. And we have absolutely said no because we had a program here that started with Navigator years ago that
became Libre that fundamentally changes diabetic monitoring, glucose monitoring, et cetera, that we believe is
game-changing, market-changing, healthcare-changing, et cetera. And we believe that the notion and the opportunity
was such that we just plain had a different game plan than everybody else, and that it was worth us making that core

and pursuing it, and we have. And we're seeing the benefit of that now with the rollout of Libre in Europe and soon a
rollout in the United States. And there's a lot of opportunity for Libre beyond that depending on how we develop it and
how we take it.
So it is strategically core to us. If you think that's on my radar screen for some strategic move, take it off your screen.
That is core to Abbott and will remain core to Abbott, and the opportunity there we think is nothing but great looking
forward.
<Q - Lawrence Biegelsen>: Very clear, thanks for taking the question.
<A - Scott Leinenweber>: Operator, we'll take one more question.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jayson T. Bedford>: Good morning, thank you for taking the questions. Maybe just to actually follow up on the
Diabetes, clearly it was a standout in the quarter, a noticeable step up from trend, and the guidance implies a
follow-through in the fourth quarter. You have a unique offering with Libre. Is double-digit growth how you expect this
franchise to play out over the next couple years?
<A - Miles D. White>: You've got two franchises going here. You've got the old established legacy franchise of blood
glucose monitoring, and then you've what we call flash glucose monitoring or Libre. And that older blood glucose
monitoring market is clearly under both volume and price pressure. And Libre is growing rapidly in Europe, and we
expect to grow rapidly in the United States. So at some point, we would hope that Libre would grow so significantly
that it would overtake the other.
So I don't expect obviously that kind of growth out of base, but I think we're going to keep experiencing pretty heavy
double-digit growth out of Libre for the foreseeable future. So yes, I think it drives a lot of growth. But we're at crosses
and the overall business is somehow double-digit, I'm not sure I can project.
<Q - Jayson T. Bedford>: Okay, that's fair. And then just the second question on gross margin, it's down year over
year. My understanding that FX has weighed on this metric. Is there a point where we anniversary the FX headwinds
and are able to see some gross margin expansion in the base business, meaning excluding St. Jude and Alere?
<A - Miles D. White>: I'll tell you it's interesting. We put a fair amount of focus on gross margin – oh gosh, more than
four or five years ago in a couple of our businesses. And you could see that. You could see it in the performance. You
could see it in the bottom line of those businesses. You could see it in the bottom line of the company. You could see it
in the gross margin in the company.
So we expanded those efforts across the company and in a number of places. And I think what we've obviously learned
from that is there's always opportunity to improve your business model, improve your cost structure, improve your
gross margin, et cetera. And it hasn't been done with price. It's been done with the fundamental inputs in costs and the
way we do business, the way we manufacture, the way we do a lot of things. So I think there's always opportunity, and
we approach the business and the businesses every year with that in mind.
And it's fortunate that we have, because we have had some great success there in a couple businesses particularly,
which has offset the effects of exchange over the last, say, three, four years, which as you know has been pretty heavy.
And without that, the company would have obviously been under a lot more profit growth pressure. So for us, it's
become a routine; we look for more gross margin improvement opportunity every year. And if I look across the
businesses, there are still many opportunities for us as we benchmark competitors or other models, the business models
we see out there to improve the cost structure of our business in ways that are meaningful to the corporation. Included
in that is even the cost of new things launching. The costs of our new diagnostic analyzers will be a tremendous
improvement over the cost of our current diagnostic analyzers. And one of the ways you can affect gross margin over
the long term is to design it into your products, and we are.

Page 11 of 11
So I think there's a lot of initiatives internally at the company and across businesses now that make this part of routine
daily life to keep improving gross margin. I can't forecast to you right now how that will impact us, but I think in a
world where you're denominated in dollars and every year exchange tries to erode some of your top and bottom line, it
becomes a routine part of your business to always be looking at ways to improve your margin, and we do and we are
and we're having a fair amount of success at that.
