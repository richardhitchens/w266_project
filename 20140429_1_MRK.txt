MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to Merck's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Today's call is being
recorded.
At this time I'd like to turn the call over to Joseph Romanelli, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Joseph Romanelli
Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. We'd also like to say good afternoon and good evening to
everyone listening outside the United States. Welcome to Merck's first quarter 2014 conference call.
Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to point out just a couple of items. First of all there are a number of items in
the GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that
we've excluded those items in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables and you can see them in our press release in table
two. This will give you a better sense of the underlying performance.
There are three tables in the press release. The first table provides the GAAP results. Table number two reconciles our
GAAP P&L to the non-GAAP results for the first quarter. And table three provides the sales performance for the
company's business units and our products both on a reported basis and excluding exchange. During the call we will be
referring to table two when we discuss the P&L and table three when we talk about revenue performance.
Finally, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call may be considered
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation

Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to
significant risk and uncertainties. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results
may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
The company's SEC filings including Item 1A in the 2013 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements
that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking
statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement. Our
SEC filings can be found on the website at Merck.com and you can also find our earnings release and all the tables
there as well.
Now since it's a busy morning for earnings and we'll be together next week for the investor briefing in Boston, we're
going to have a shorter call today. This morning I'm joined by Ken Frazier, Peter Kellogg, Adam Schechter, Roger
Perlmutter and Rob Davis, our newly appointed CFO.
So with that, I'd like to introduce Ken Frazier. Ken?
Kenneth C. Frazier
Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining the call today.
As expected, we delivered another solid operational quarter with growth in several key brands and disciplined cost
management. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, which we believe will keep us on track to deliver on our
full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance.
Looking beyond the first quarter, this is an exciting time at Merck as we prepare to commercialize the next wave of
innovation coming out of our labs over the next few years. Our commitment to innovation remains strong, as it's only
by bringing to market new products that make a meaningful difference to patients, healthcare providers and payers that
we will continue to create value for society and shareholders. '
This quarter we delivered on this commitment in a number of important areas including oncology, where we continued
the rolling submission of a BLA for MK-3475, our anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in advanced melanoma. MK-3475 is
currently being studied in 17 clinical trials estimated to enroll over 4,000 patients across more than 30 types of cancer.
Earlier this month, we presented promising Phase II data from our investigational hepatitis C treatment, which has
accelerated our path to Phase III development. We also presented Phase II data for MK-1439, our investigational
next-generation HIV therapy, which will move into Phase III development by the end of the year.
Each of these candidates represents the kind of innovation that has the potential to make a meaningful difference to
patients. Roger will talk more about our pipeline and the status of our regulatory applications for our near-term
candidates later in the call. We look forward to providing a more comprehensive update regarding these and our other
promising pipeline programs at our upcoming Investor Meeting on May 6 at our Research Campus in Boston. For now,
I will reiterate that we are excited by our pipeline and what's to come.
Turning back to the first quarter, we saw growth in many key areas of our Human Health portfolio including diabetes,
immunology, vaccines, and obstetrics. We are preparing for many upcoming product launches.
In March we announced the appointment of Robert Davis as Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Peter Kellogg who has
served in that role since 2007. Peter has been an important member of our leadership team and instrumental in helping
guide Merck during a period of significant change in our company and in our industry. Peter will leave Merck a
stronger company and we're grateful for his many contributions. As we announced previously, Peter will remain at
Merck through mid-May to ensure a seamless transition and is with us today to discuss our first quarter's results and to
answer your questions.
Rob joins us from Baxter where he most recently served as Corporate Vice President and President of that company's
Medical Products business. He previously served as the company's Chief Financial Officer. Rob is an accomplished

executive with significant financial expertise both in pharma from his time at Lilly and in broader healthcare from his
time at Baxter. I believe his broad global business, financial and healthcare experience makes him a great addition to
our team.
Rob?
Robert M. Davis
Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. I must say it's a privilege to be a member of the Merck team. I've spent
many years in the healthcare industry and I've long viewed Merck as the premier research company in the
pharmaceutical industry. There's a strong legacy here of translating science into medicine, so when Ken called to
discuss the opportunity with me, I jumped at the chance. I look forward to working with the management team and
leading the financial organization. This is my fifth day on the job, but know that I'm excited to be here and I look
forward to seeing many of you next week at the investor briefing in Boston.
Ken?
Kenneth C. Frazier
Thank you, Rob. We're also excited to have you here.
In closing, our strategy of focusing on our best opportunities while being disciplined about managing our costs
continues to deliver bottom line performance. Our robust pipeline contains many promising candidates representing a
suite of near and long-term opportunities that will continue to drive growth and shareholder value. I look forward to
seeing all of you at our upcoming investor briefing where we'll share more about how we're sharpening our commercial
and R&D focus, bolstering our innovative pipeline, and preparing to launch and commercialize our many near-term
opportunities.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Adam.
Adam H. Schechter
Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide you with an overview of first quarter Global
Human Health results. My comments will be on a constant currency basis.
As we anticipated, Immunology, diabetes and vaccines continue to be areas of growth. Sales growth in these areas were
offset by a few things: the continued impact from the loss of exclusivity of several brands; product divestitures that we
previously announced; and the biannual price declines in Japan.
We continue to take action to focus our resources on areas that provide the greatest potential for long-term growth.
Those include our top markets, our core therapeutic areas and our launch opportunities. We're making critical choices
and are prioritizing our resources, and you can see these efforts reflected in our reduced expenses.
Let me provide more details on the performance of our core products and core markets, and I'll start with the
JANUVIA franchise. The franchise had sales of $1.3 billion and 5% growth in the first quarter. In the United States,
sales increased by 4%. Our International market sales, which now represent about 50% of our total sales, grew 6%. We
drove double-digit growth in Europe and the emerging markets, but we also saw the impact of customers reducing their
inventory levels in Japan ahead of the April 1 price reductions. Globally, the diabetes market is significant and the
macro trends support a growing market. We will continue to focus resources around the world to ensure continued
leadership in the branded global diabetes market.
Moving to ISENTRESS, we had another good quarter with ISENTRESS with 8% global growth. That's despite new
competition.

Turning to immunology, the combined immunology business consisting of REMICADE and SIMPONI grew 13% in
the quarter. Sales of SIMPONI alone grew over 40%. SIMPONI is the fastest-growing immunology biologic in the
markets where it's available. Sales of REMICADE grew 7% and that's despite biosimilar entry in some of the smaller
E.U. markets. As an important reminder, we maintain patent protection for REMICADE in markets that represent 80%
of our sales until early 2015.
Lastly moving to our vaccine business, in the first quarter, vaccine sales grew 4%. Demand for our vaccines portfolio
remains strong and there are many global growth opportunities. GARDASIL sales increased by 2% in the quarter. 10%
sales growth in the U.S. and strong sales in the emerging markets were offset by the loss of sales in Japan.
Looking now at ZOSTAVAX, ZOSTAVAX sales were $142 million this quarter. As expected, sales in the United
States declined sequentially due to seasonality. As you may recall, last year we saw a benefit to sales from flu season
extending into the first quarter. This year, the flu season did not extend into the first quarter.
In addition, we're continuing to educate customers on the broad managed-care coverage for ZOSTAVAX and the
process for getting reimbursement. Internationally, we've launched ZOSTAVAX in select Asian markets and the U.K.
and we're seeing good uptake in those markets.
Now I'd like to briefly touch on our performance at a regional level beginning with the United States. In the U.S.
growth in our core areas of diabetes and vaccines was offset by the TEMODAR loss of exclusivity, revised cholesterol
guidelines and the changes in the HCV market.
In Europe we drove strong growth in immunology and diabetes and with ISENTRESS. We also saw generic entry for
NASONEX and pricing pressure continued throughout the region.
Japan sales declined 7% primarily due to wholesalers reducing inventory levels ahead of the April 1 biannual price
decreases and GARDASIL. Sales in emerging markets grew 3%. Strong growth in key emerging markets like Brazil,
Turkey and Korea was partially offset by declines in Russia and Mexico this quarter. The timing of tenders affected our
performance this quarter as well. Looking ahead this year we continue to expect that the emerging markets will be
strong growth drivers for us.
In summary, in the first quarter, Global Human Health drove growth of key franchises including diabetes, immunology
and vaccines. As we anticipated, there were headwinds including loss of exclusivities, divestitures and buying patterns
in anticipation of the biannual price declines in Japan. We continue to prioritize our investment, we're sharpening our
focus on the best opportunities for long-term growth, which includes our core products, our core markets and our
launches. We have multiple near-term launch opportunities and I look forward to discussing these with you next week
at our investor briefing.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg.
Peter N. Kellogg
Thank you, Adam, and thank you, Ken, for the kind words. Good morning, everybody.
Our first quarter results demonstrate that we are on track and executing against our plan to reshape and refocus the
company for future growth. This morning I'll provide additional color on our accomplishments in the first quarter and I
will comment on reconfirming our outlook for the rest of the year. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials.
On this basis we earned $0.88 per share in the first quarter as compared to $0.85 per share in the prior year. EPS growth
was driven by growth in key brands, effective cost management and contributions from asset sales.
Now I'd like to walk through the P&L starting with revenues. On an ex-exchange basis, total company revenues in the
first quarter decreased 2%. As expected, this decline reflects several moving parts including the impacts of divestitures,
loss of exclusivity of certain brands, partially offset by growth in core products. Building on Adam's discussion of
Global Human Health results, I will speak to the other revenue elements in the quarter on an ex-exchange basis.

Animal Health revenues were flat year-over-year. However, however, excluding ZILMAX, sales in Animal Health
grew 5% in the quarter. Consumer Care revenues declined by 3% as a result of product divestitures and the shortened
allergy season in North America this quarter.
Other revenues increased by approximately $85 million this quarter driven by proceeds from the divestiture of U.S.
SAPHRIS rights. These proceeds were partially offset by the continued decline of supply sales to the AstraZeneca joint
venture. Regarding the joint venture, we continue to expect AstraZeneca to exercise its option, which would bring the
long-standing partnership to a close on June 30.
Moving to expenses and starting with product gross margin, PGM was 74.1% this quarter, which was slightly higher
than expected due to exchange and the SAPHRIS proceeds. As noted in February we still expect the 2014 full year
gross margin ratio to be slightly lower than the 2013 full year ratio of 74.3%. Our SG&A expenses were about $250
million lower than prior-year driven by reductions in promotion, direct selling and administrative expenses as well as
some foreign exchange benefit.
While we are focusing our resources on key markets and core products we are also preparing for several product
launches this year. While we will invest in the launches to maximize these opportunities, we do remain on track for
full-year SG&A reductions versus 2013. Similarly research and development expenses were about $340 million lower
year-over-year as a result of continued prioritization of R&D programs and some phasing of spend that we now expect
to occur in the second half of the year.
As communicated over the last few weeks, we are initiating a broad, Phase III program for our investigational hepatitis
C regimen and we are continuing to invest heavily in immuno-oncology but as with SG&A, we continue to expect
full-year reductions in R&D spend compared to 2013.
Moving to other income and expense, this quarter we had other income of $39 million reflecting a gain from divesting
Sirna. Also recall that in the prior year we had significant foreign exchange losses as a result of the devaluation of the
Venezuelan bolivar.
Moving to tax, our non-GAAP tax rate was 26.1% in the first quarter. This is in line with our expectations for the year.
We continue to anticipate the tax rate for the full-year to be between 24% and 26%.
Now turning to the outlook for the rest of the year, on the top line we continue to expect revenue of $42.4 billion to
$43.2 billion at current exchange rates. Similarly we are maintaining our bottom-line guidance for earnings of $3.35 to
$3.53. On a GAAP basis we expect to earn between $2.15 and $2.47. Both of these EPS guidance ranges reflect a
potential devaluation in Venezuela this year, although the timing and magnitude of such a devaluation remains
uncertain as we indicated in February.
Also, as noted earlier, both SG&A and R&D expenses will be lower than 2013 but the timing of some of these
expenses has shifted from the first quarter into the second half of the year. However, we still expect earnings for the
second half of the year to be stronger than the first half of the year.
Now touching briefly on capital allocation, a year ago we announced a new $15 billion share repurchase program with
the intention to repurchase $7.5 billion over the first 12 months. We have now accomplished that milestone. In fact,
over the past 12 months we have returned over $12 billion in total to shareholders through these repurchases and the
dividend. These accomplishments place Merck as one of the top performers in the industry in returning cash to
shareholders.
So in conclusion, Merck is entering a new phase of innovation and launches and we are preparing to drive growth in the
future. You can see results of our efforts in the form of a lower cost base, growth in core product franchises, an
acceleration of key pipeline assets such as our anti PD-1 and hepatitis C programs. With our first quarter results in
hand, we are on track to accomplish the goals set forth to reshape Merck for future growth.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger. Roger?

Roger M. Perlmutter
Thanks, Peter.
The first quarter was an especially busy one for the regulatory affairs group at Merck research laboratories. During the
last two months we obtained FDA approval for both GRASTEK our sub-lingual desensitizing tablet for patients
suffering from grass-induced allergic rhinitis and RAGWITEK, a similar tablet for patients suffering from ragweed
allergy.
Both agents, developed in collaboration with our colleagues at ALK-Abello, demonstrate a significant efficacy in
alleviating the troubling symptoms of patients suffering from seasonal rhinitis. As with some other desensitizing
agents, patients prescribed these drugs are to have access to an epinephrine pen to ensure that these severely allergic
patients are protected against the possibility of an anaphylactic reaction.
Also in the first quarter the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines
Agency, provided a favorable opinion regarding the conditional approval of vintafolide for the treatment of advanced
folate receptor-positive, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, when used in combination with pegylated doxorubicin.
We are developing vintafolide in collaboration with colleagues at Endocyte, who have the lead responsibility for a
companion imaging reagent, etarfolatide, used to assess the degree of folate receptor expression on tumor cells.
Vintafolide binds to the folate receptor and thereby delivers a cytotoxic vinca alkaloid, resulting in significant tumor
cell destruction. Conditional approval of vintafolide requires ratification by the European Commission, which should
provide an opinion in the second quarter.
Meanwhile, we're making good progress advancing the review of vorapaxar with the FDA. As you will recall,
vorapaxar, an antagonist of the thrombin receptor on platelets, was evaluated in a large outcome study in combination
with aspirin and clopidogrel as a means of reducing atherothrombotic events in patients who have previously sustained
a myocardial infarction and who are considered to be at high risk for subsequent events. Details of potential vorapaxar
labeling language are currently under review. We are optimistic that it will be possible to gain agreement on this
language in the very near future.
There are numerous other products for which regulatory evaluation is proceeding. The FDA has accepted our
application for V-503, our new 9-valent papilloma virus vaccine, which we have demonstrated can expand the
protection offered by GARDASIL to five additional viral serotypes. We are eager to bring this important new vaccine
to patients around the world.
Also in the first quarter, we resubmitted our application for suvorexant, an orexin antagonist for the treatment of
insomnia, for which we received a Complete Response Letter last year. Our resubmission provides data regarding new
lower starting doses for this drug in accord with FDA recommendations. Suvorexant is also under review in Japan and
other jurisdictions.
And in Japan we are pursuing registration for vaniprevir for the treatment of Hepatitis C virus infection when used in
combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. We've received priority review from the Japanese PMDA for this
agent.
Finally, we made very good progress in the first quarter advancing the rolling submission of MK-3475, our PD-1
specific antibody for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma refractory to other therapies. Details about this
program will be presented as part of our business review meeting next week, so I'll not cover them here.
I do wish to say, however, that the prioritization process that we introduced last year is clearly bearing fruit, as can be
seen in the reduced R&D expenses that we are reporting this quarter. These expense reductions were not achieved
without substantial effort, and I'm grateful to all of my colleagues for their diligence in focusing our investments on
programs that can make a real difference for the patients whom we serve.
Finally, we're looking forward to the business review next week where we intend to review some of our most important
programs addressing metabolic disease and diabetes, hepatitis C virus infection, improved therapies for patients

suffering from human immunodeficiency virus infection, and cancer. We're building in each of these cases on a long
legacy of scientific achievement which positions us well to make further contributions to human health.
Joe?
Joseph Romanelli
Great, thank you, Roger. And before we open up the call to your questions, Stephanie, just please as a reminder, please
limit your questions to one or two so we can get through as many callers as possible.
So with that, Stephanie, if we can open up the lines for the first caller.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Thanks a lot for taking the question. First of all, hats off to Peter. Thanks for everything
you've done for the biotech and the – and now the pharma community. And welcome, Robert. We're all looking
forward to working with you.
Number one, maybe on PD-1 if I may, I suspect I'm going to get an unsatisfying answer to this Roger, but I'm going to
try anyway. But we learned today that Bristol, I guess, is going to file for lung cancer around the end of the year it
sounds like, probably in 4Q. And I'm just wondering if you could give us any kind of an update, I know we'll hear
about this next week but on your potential filing timelines in lung cancer, base case and an upside case?
And then maybe for Peter, these asset sales that helped boost EPS this quarter, was that something that you had planned
for when you issued 2014 earnings guidance?
And then maybe for Ken, just big M&A, obviously what's going on at Pfizer has created a lot of discussion around the
merits or lack thereof of big M&A, Merck's a big company capable of doing big M&A. I think it would be a good time
for the investment community to hear your updated views on such transformative deals. Thank you.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Thanks, Mark, for the questions. Let me take a crack at the third question. So our strategy
is to remain true to who we are, a research centered biopharmaceutical company that seeks to make a long-term
difference through cutting-edge science. Our preferred route, therefore, of driving long-term shareholder value is
through innovation rather than consolidation and we believe Merck is at its best when it's inventing new treatments
such as anti-PD-1. Therefore, we will remain focused on the opportunities that are right before us in advancing our
pipeline.
We also announced a new global initiative last October, as you know, to sharpen our commercial and R&D focus and
we're making critical choices about the areas where we'll compete and the investments that are required. In doing so,
we're also reducing our cost base by $2.5 billion and this is on top of the $3.5 billion worth of synergies from the
merger.
As you heard this morning, the initiative is already showing progress and we're divesting assets and making structural
changes to increase our operating leverage and we're also exploring strategic options for Consumer and Animal Health.
So, while we continuously evaluate external opportunities, our preference is to enhance our pipeline commercial
business with smaller bolt-on acquisitions versus large mergers for consolidation purposes. On the other hand, of
course we carefully monitor and evaluate what is happening in the industry and we'll continue to be objective and
comprehensive in our sentiments but to be clear our strategy is one of innovation.

<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah, Mark, with respect to non-small cell lung cancer, we have quite a lot of studies
going on, as you know, with nearly 1,500 patients under study. We'll have the opportunity to go through all of that and
to describe our registration strategy next week and I think that's probably the right way to approach this. Suffice it to
say that we look for every opportunity that we can to bring the benefits of MK-3475 to patients who need this drug and
where we see substantial evidence of efficacy we're going to pursue the most accelerated kind of registration program
that we can imagine. We think it's that important.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Mark, this is Peter. Thanks for your comments. So relative to the asset sales and the sale of
the commercial rights for SAPHRIS, yes we did. I mean, as you'll recall last fall, we announced our strategy of
focusing on growth opportunities whether it be by franchise or geography and we also at that time announced that we
would be taking some of our lower prioritized areas and potentially divesting them if they were better off in someone
else's hands. As we put together guidance for this year, we were well aware of these transactions and we incorporated
that into our guidance.
And so on the one hand, we're getting some benefits from the sale of the U.S. SAPHRIS rights in the other revenue line
and the gain from the sale of Sirna in the other income expense. The flip is, of course, we're giving up the revenue of
some of these assets that we're divesting so just as an example for Q1, the loss of revenue on divested assets was about
$120 million and on a full year basis this year, which is incorporated in our guidance, the total is about $600 million
based on 2013 sales.
So as you implement this sort of focused portfolio strategy you're going to end up with a little bit of a period where
you're getting some reductions in revenue. On the other hand, you're getting the impact of the transactions in the P&L.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Thanks, Mark, for the question and, Stephanie, next caller?
Operator
Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Thanks very much and, Peter, just wanted to wish you the best of luck with everything.
It's been great working with you.
So a couple questions here. Maybe first coming back on the capital deployment priorities, it's obviously been a lot in
the press about potential to sell the consumer franchise. Can you just give us an update or should we think about repo
as the preferred use of capital to the extent that you are to monetize one of these businesses?
The second question was on the HCV program. Can you comment a little bit on how you see differentiating your
combo relative to the two primary competitors who are going to have a little bit of a head start in terms of time to
market here? And would you be willing to comment on type of market share targets that you think you'd be able to take
as you look to commercialize this product looking out a few years? Thanks very much.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Thanks, Chris. I'll take your first question. So as you know, it's pretty well-established and
we've said that we're going to evaluate our Consumer Care business and our Animal Health business. We've also been
clear that we might reach very different conclusions about the two businesses.
So with respect to your fundamental question you asked, I don't think we're in a position to comment on hypotheticals
at this point. In general, our framework for the utilization of cash has not changed. First, we will allocate resources to
those areas that we feel present the highest potential growth opportunities, for example, our anti-PD-1 program which
we intend to be studying for multiple tumor types over time.
Second, we will execute on compelling business development opportunities to strengthen our pipeline and that can
create value.

Third, we plan to return a high level of free cash flow to shareholders through both the dividend and the stock buyback
and just note that we've returned over $12 billion in cash to shareholders over the past 12 months.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Thanks, Ken. Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: So with respect to the HCV combo, Chris, just as you have the opportunity, of course, to
see the data that we presented at the European meetings, 5172/8742 has very desirable properties as a fixed dose
combination and in particular we showed really quite impressive sustained virulogic responses in patients with – who
are quite difficult to treat, those who have cirrhosis who are co-infected with HIV.
And the other thing to note about the combination, of course, is that the drugs can be used in patients with substantial
co-morbidities, which is really quite important. That's something that I mentioned before. So as a single agent in those
settings I think there's quite a lot of differentiation and obviously we're looking at every possible means of accelerating
the process of completing the registration, enabling trials and the registration of these drugs for which we have a
breakthrough designation and with respect to the market share I guess I'll speak for Adam.
[Laughter]
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Chris, what I'd say is that, we've taken a hard look and we know this market pretty well.
We think it's a very large opportunity that's going to play out over many years. It's not going to play out in just one or
two years, it's going to play out over years across the globe. There's some drugs, obviously, that are ahead of us but
we're not thinking of it as a winner-take-all scenario in just a couple of years. There's going to be plenty of opportunity
for promising drugs in our pipeline as we move forward and we'll be talking a bit more about that next week.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Thanks, Chris, for the questions, and, Stephanie, next caller?

Your next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Just to follow up on some of the M&A-related questions, Ken, what's going on in the industry is
obviously very exciting, companies are getting more aggressive, increasing their focus on areas that they're good at,
getting out of businesses where there is less focus and as you said, we're all anxiously waiting to see what happens to
your Animal Health and consumer business but beyond those two businesses, which are relatively smaller contributors
to your top line, are there other strategies that you could pursue, other carve-out opportunities that you see that would
allow you to accelerate your shift in focus from primary care to specialty biologicals? And we've seen a lot of this
activity from many of your peers.
And then secondly, Peter, to you, and again I wish my congratulations to you as well and best of luck in your next
opportunity, but why wouldn't you raise at least the bottom end of your guidance? It's a very wide range at this point,
you beat on the first quarter, just what should we be thinking about as we think about the rest of the year? You did say,
I think, second half would be stronger which is I think how we've always modeled it but just wondering why you
wouldn't take the opportunity to raise the bottom end of guidance? Thanks.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Thanks, Jami, for the questions. Let me just go back to what we said back in October
which is that we intended to sharpen our commercial and R&D focus as we move forward, you've seen some of the
things that we've already done and I think we will continue to look for those opportunities to focus in those areas where
we know we can compete and make investments; where we know we can bring forward innovation like PD-1 and
where we think we can win in the marketplace. So we'll continue to do that. There are going to be opportunities and at
the same time on the other side of the ledger we're also looking through M&A to enhance our pipeline through the right
kinds of value-creating opportunities that may be out in the marketplace.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Thanks, Jami. This is Peter. So you're right, in the guidance range we gave for this year,
obviously, we had a lot of the factors incorporated. We recognized that we'd be making a certain amount of investments
for launch and for the pipeline, we understood that the AstraZeneca joint venture would go away and that was included

in our calculation. We did know about the divestitures that we've announced so far, that was also put in there as well as
the loss of exclusivity for certain products.
The bottom end of the range, though, is more defined actually by our trying to estimate what might happen with the
Venezuelan bolivar. So quite frankly, you can think of the high end of the range as sort of our performance, ex- that
impact and the low-end of the range is just trying to make some estimate as to what might be the case. You'll recall that
last year that devaluation took place in the first quarter and it was about a $0.07 per share impact on us and we've tried
to make some estimate. It's very hard to estimate what that is.
So that's why we've left the range fairly wide and as we see what happens in Venezuela, we'll adjust – we'll see how
kind of what that means to our P&L and if necessary, or if appropriate we'll adjust our EPS range accordingly.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay, great. Thanks, Jami, and, Stephanie, can we open it up to the next caller, please?

Your next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bernstein.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: On JANUVIA, it came in a little bit weaker, I guess, than what we and I think
consensus, were looking for. In the U.S., you've taken I believe more than 20% in price increases at least on a list price
basis, but you don't report that obviously in the U.S. number, so I'm wondering if you can just talk about net U.S.
pricing trends going forward with the DPP-4s?
And then internationally, sales seem to be on the weaker side. I'm wondering what the driver was of this.
And then, can you talk about the timing of top-lining the TECOS trial? Can we think about that possibly as a third
quarter event, and can you discuss the what-if scenario whereby TECOS may show a heart failure signal like we've
seen with one or more of the other DPP-4 inhibitors in the category?
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: So, Tim, let me start with the JANUVIA performance. And ex-Rx, we had 5% growth and
if you look at the U.S., we had 4% growth. We had a couple points that came through on price and we had some
increase in inventory as well. That was partially offset by a small decline in TRx volume.
If you look at TRx volume in the U.S., we've seen this month better than last month and last month better than the prior
three months, so we've certainly seen a stabilization of the TRx volume when you look at it year-over-year, and now
we're looking to see if we can actually turn it around.
If you look at new-to-brand share, we're actually doing better, and if you look at new-to-brand volume, we've actually
seen an increase in the months of – in the month of March, which is the first time we've seen an increase in
new-to-brand volume in a very long time.
So it's still early yet, but we feel like we've certainly stabilized the U.S. and now we're looking to see if we can actually
grow TRx again.
If you look outside the U.S., we had very good growth in the emerging markets and in Europe. If you look where we
saw some softness, it was in Japan, and the reason why is because wholesalers stopped purchasing or reduced
purchases prior to the repricing that took place and we've seen the wholesalers begin to purchase again after that
repricing occurred in March, so they're beginning to repurchase again in April.
Overall, the diabetes market continues to show reason for strong growth. If you look at the epidemiologic incidents, if
you look at governments around the world and the importance that diabetes plays in their overall health care
expenditure, the market certainly shows why it should grow. And we're going to continue to invest strongly in the
marketplace to not only be successful outside the U.S., but do everything we can to increase our success in the U.S.

<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah, Tim, with respect to the TECOS trial, we continue on track with that trial for
14,000 patients studied. But I need to point out, of course, that it is an event-driven trial, and so those events ultimately
drive timing. We're not seeing anything that suggests to us that there will be an acceleration in terms of the readout of
that trial earlier this year, so it continues on track.
And then with respect to any signals that one might see in that trial, there has been an interest in the question of the
specific finding of heart failure hospitalization based on other studies. Understandably, we have looked at it both in
terms of our pharmacovigilance activities as well as the Data Safety and Monitoring Board has looked at it with respect
to the TECOS trial, because these are adjudicated events. At their most recent meeting which was the – at the end of
last year, just a few months ago, they reported no reason not to continue the study as planned, and we've seen no
evidence of a signal in our pharmacovigilance study.
So we're not seeing anything there. We'll wait to see the final data. We're hopeful that the trial will complete at the end
of the year.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay, great. Thanks, Tim, and, Stephanie, next caller?

Your next question comes from John Boris with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions. I just have two, the first question for Roger.
If I look at your competitors' PD-1 clinical development plans by trying to piece those together from clinicaltrials.gov,
you can certainly see where there's certainly holes in some indications where you might be able to use your
breakthrough designation to be able to file additional early-stage data if it comes out well. So let me just focus on a
couple areas like hematology or head and neck as examples where you might be presenting data at ASCO. Is there an
opportunity to potentially file those additional data sets with the FDA, and by using your breakthrough status, getting
potentially an accelerated approval on those?
Second question has to do with M&A for Ken, certainly tax inversion very important, not only company issue but
certainly policy issue, just your thoughts about large-scale M&A versus franchise-enhancing either asset swaps and/or
franchise-enhancing acquisitions versus large-scale M&A. Just your thoughts on that and your thoughts on tax
inversion?
And then certainly want to wish best to Peter Kellogg in his new endeavors and welcome Rob Davis and look forward
to meeting him. Thanks.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Thanks for your question, John. I just have to repeat what I said before for us, a major
consolidation of the industry type transaction is not our preferred strategy. The best way for us to create sustainable
value is through innovation and that's why we're focused on value-added, bolt-on opportunities as a priority for us.
With respect to the policy implications of inversions and the business implications, I think we'll just all have to wait
and see how that plays out and I don't have any particular comments on the strategies of the companies or what the
government's reactions might be. So I think that's it for me.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Okay. John, again as I kind of said before in response to Mark Schoenebaum, we are
eager to bring the benefits of MK-3475 to patients wherever we can demonstrate them. We have breakthrough
designation in the melanoma setting based on the data that we obtained in patients with advanced melanoma refractory
to other therapies but that's not a broad breakthrough designation for any cancer, and nevertheless, the opportunity
exists always to pursue an accelerated approval where the results are favorable, where you have patients who are
refractory to other treatments, have no other options and where you can bring something of real benefit, meaningful
benefit rapidly to the marketplace.

Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Thanks for the questions and again, congratulations, Peter and good luck in your future
endeavors.
Just very quickly as it relates to, Roger, the question around HCV, is there any chance in your view to see this product
actually achieve an eight-week duration? And is there a material difference in your opinion between an eight-week
duration and a twelve-week duration for an HCV dual combination?
The second question, can you help us understand why you chose to work with Agenus for these Merck targets? Maybe
you can just walk us through the Agenus transaction and help us understand why Merck wouldn't be the one generating
those targets internally?
And then lastly, is there anything written into your immunotherapy collaboration announced earlier this year with
Pfizer, Incyte and Amgen that would allow you to continue working together? And why I'm asking this question is; do
you have something written into these agreements to prevent a Pharmasset like outcome were one company helps
generate lots of great data and then another company swoops in and basically prevents you from advancing those
combinations? Thanks.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Okay. Let me try and get at these here. First of all, with respect to HCV treatment, I
think we're always – we, and the entire community are always looking for more rapidly-effective regimens, effective
regimens that can – in these patient populations and of course there are a lot of patients infected with hepatitis C virus,
a sustained virulogic response that can be achieved rapidly is a good thing. We and the entire community have moved
that back substantially from where we were previously and we have the expectation that we're going to be able to
continue to drive that process using our drugs and we'll have a chance to talk about the additional molecules that we
have in the HCV space at the business review next week. So I think that will be a good time to get into that.
You asked about the Agenus transaction which we announced earlier this week. We've been talking for some time now,
quite a long time, with 4-Antibody, which is a Swiss company that Agenus acquired in February. So the transaction
really was one that we spent a long time talking with 4-Antibody about.
They have a technique that enables them to generate human antibodies of high affinity against a variety of different
targets, and we have worked with them to look at that technology and to see if we could apply it to some of the more
difficult targets in the immuno-oncology space. This goes back a while that we've been doing this. And so we were
prepared to go forward with them to try and explore whether or not those antibodies could be useful. They of course
were acquired by Agenus and that led to the transaction that was announced, but no other special details to be
concerned about there.
And then with respect to can someone swoop in and take the data, I guess, is the question from our ongoing
collaborations with respect to combination products, really I don't think so. I mean these data will give us the
opportunity to ultimately see which kinds of combinations can be most effective with MK-3475, and we hope, if there
are some very effective ones, to commercialize MK-3475 in combinations in those indications. So no special things
were written in that would have an impact on that.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay, great. Thanks, Seamus, for the questions. And, Stephanie, I think we have time for
two more callers.

Your next call comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen.
<Q - Stephen M. Scala>: I have two questions. On the Q4 call, the company said that H1 EPS would be lower than H2
and of course that was repeated today. But at that point it was also said that Q1 would be the lowest quarter of the year.
Is Q1 also still expected to be the lowest quarter of the year or if not, is Q2 now expected to be the lowest quarter of the
year?
And secondly, I'm just curious what your plans for full odanacatib data? What meeting is being targeted and will we get
important new data at the meeting next week? Thank you.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: So, Peter, why don't you go ahead?
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Thanks, Steve, for the question. Everything you said is correct relative to second half still
remains the higher EPS quarter. Really what happened in the first quarter was that our expenses came in even more
favorably than we anticipated. I think everything else was pretty much in line with our plans and our thinking. Some of
those are true efficiencies that will help us and then some of them will be things that are just timing related that will
show up in the second half of the year.
Very specifically to your second question which is Q2, we didn't actually provide any specific update on that, so I'm
going to hesitate to do it right now. But in general I think you can kind of see that the operating expense benefit
allowed Q1 to look a little better and so I think we're very much on track to be in the range for the full-year. So we
haven't given specific guidance for Q2.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great, thank you, Peter.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: And, Steve, with respect to odanacatib we do have the full data set in-house, and so
we're in the process now of looking through that, cleaning up that data set and evaluating it assuming things go well, I
hope we'll be a position where we can say something at the business review about it because we have the data set and
that's what we're trying to do. Then we'll be able to give a full discussion of what our plans are with respect to that
molecule. But we need to make our decisions here first.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Thanks, Steve. And I think, Stephanie, we have time for one last caller.
Operator
Your final question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Peter, congrats from me as well. Good luck.
Just follow on to the last comments you were making about expenses, can you give us a flavor for the beat was more in
efficiencies or was it your timing of things, was it 50-50, just give us a sense of how we should think about the
spending gating throughout the year would be helpful?
And then on the allergy pills, I was kind of curious what the strategy was for that product. I mean no one really talks
about the product and your level of excitement and obviously the doctors make money on these shots. I was curious
what the strategy is with this product?
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: So let me take the OpEx question first, Marc. Thanks. There's a lot of different moving parts
obviously in the operations of a company the size of Merck. Let me take first R&D. I think R&D in general, Roger's
managing quite a broad portfolio. I'd say there it's probably more timing related. That said, he's still targeting to be
below prior year overall but he's got a lot of – I won't speak for Roger, but there's a lot of things gearing up in the focus
areas both in oncology as well as hepatitis. There's a lot of clinical work going on.

In SG&A, I think we have made a lot of effort that we announced last fall to re-tune our cost structure and take head
count out as well as take some operating expenses out, that's very global effort. I think that we made a big effort to try
and move ahead of schedule, if you will, as we went through this year. So I think that, that's very broad-based in
SG&A. That said, as we go through this year we do anticipate – we already know we've got a couple launches, we
anticipate perhaps more and so we are recognizing we have to make the investments to really launch these products
extremely well. I would think of it in terms of overall efficiency in SG&A and then some very focused efforts to drive
growth opportunities as we go through the second half of the year.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Mark, to answer your question regarding GRASTEK and RAGWITEK, our launch
strategy is really focusing on introducing those two products to a specialist audience of allergists and [ph] viodo doctors
(50:25). We're trying to do that while we get access quickly with the payers and we have some education in-market
development work that we have to do.
Frankly we missed the grass season this year, so we'll have to try to do a lot of work to get ready for the grass season
next year. But as you look at the overall market, there's about 25 million people that have severe allergy to moderate
allergies in the United States and only about three million people get immunotherapy shots today. If you look at that,
there's still, we estimate, about three million people that refuse shots altogether. So the three million that refuse shots
are definitely a target for us but of the three million that get shots, it's estimated about 50% of those stopped getting
their shots after one year. So that will be another target audience for us as we move forward.
So every launch is important to us, I'm actually heading out to a launch meeting this week and we're looking forward to
doing a lot of market development work as we go through this year to prepare for next.
Joseph Romanelli
Great. Thanks, Adam. And I'll turn it over to Ken.
Kenneth C. Frazier
Let me just summarize very quickly, so in the first quarter we ended up more or less where we expected to be and we're
on track for the full year. We saw solid growth from JANUVIA, immunology vaccines and ISENTRESS and we're also
seeing strong progress from our initiative to sharpen the focus on our commercial and R&D expenditures including
evaluating what assets are core to our strategy.
The more exciting thing for us is, as we look to the future, we see steady and substantial progress in the pipeline and so
we're looking forward to meeting all of you at the business briefing on May 6 so that we can talk about our future in
more detail.
Thank you very much, and we look forward to seeing you.
