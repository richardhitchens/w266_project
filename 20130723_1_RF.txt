MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin.
M. List Underwood
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Regions Financial second quarter 2013 earnings conference call.
Our presenters today are Chief Executive Officer Grayson Hall and our Chief Financial Officer, David Turner. Other
members of management are present as well and available to answer questions as appropriate.
Also as part of our earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor
Relations section of regions.com.
Finally, let me remind you that in this call and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking
statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details,

O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Regions and participation in our second
quarter 2013 earnings call.
Regions' positive momentum continued in the second quarter with results meeting or exceeding our expectations as we
remain focused on executing our strategic priorities and our business plans.
Let me highlight a few of our accomplishments in this quarter. Loan production increased and more importantly we
grew loan balances outstanding. We expanded our customer base and grew core checking accounts. We invested in
improved technology and experienced bankers to enhance our revenue producing capabilities. We continued our
disciplined focus on expense management. We completed several actions to improve our debt and capital structure, as
well as reduce our future funding costs. We raised our common stock cash dividend. And finally, we began executing a
common stock share repurchase program.
I am encouraged by our accomplishments in the first half of 2013 and believe that we are better positioned for
continued progress in the second half of the year. Overall, our balance sheet is positioned to benefit from an increase in
both short and long-term rates. Moreover, rising rates indicate an improving economy, which should ultimately lead to
greater demand among our customers for products and services that translate into additional business opportunities.
In addition, we are encouraged by the outlook for the Southeastern U.S., where the majority of our franchises are
located. According to a recent research report from Moody's, the Southeast continues to lead the nation in job creation
and hiring rates. Furthermore, the Southeast is at the forefront of the national recovery in residential construction, as
housing starts have risen by 84% since May 2011 versus the national average of 62%.
We have experienced similar trends as the mix of mortgage applications is shifting more towards new-home purchases
and away from refinances. This quarter, 53% of mortgage originations were for new-home purchases compared to 35%
in the previous quarter.
Our success this quarter was driven by loan growth, which is broad-based across our markets. Importantly, 70% of the
markets we serve experienced loan growth in the second quarter. Commercial and industrial loan growth was a primary
contributor to the improvement, but we also experienced strong growth in indirect auto lending and a modest pickup in
credit-card balances.
In addition, we observed a slowdown in the pace of decline in the investor-real-estate portfolio and moderating declines
in residential mortgage loans. Further, new loan production remained strong at $8 billion, up 23% over prior quarter as
all loan categories experienced an increase in production.
Additionally, we made progress during the second quarter in growing our customer base, which includes business
customers, as well as consumer and wealth-management customers. Growth of this essential measurement should, over
time, provide additional revenue opportunities.
Over the past several months, we hired close to 100 financial consultants and placed them in our branch offices. These
financial consultants have generated approximately twice the amount of business that we had initially forecasted, and
we plan to further expand and enhance this activity.
Our continued focus on prudent expense management is also paying off. Excluding debt extinguishment costs, second
quarter's decline in operating expenses drove a linked-quarter improvement in our adjusted efficiency ratio of
approximately 180 basis points. We've done this while continuing to make appropriate investments in people, in
products, and in technology. To illustrate, this year, we've hired over 500 net new associates, many in
revenue-generating roles.

Finally, regarding Basel III final rule recently approved by the regulators, we are pleased that our capital position will
be less impacted than our previous estimate, and we have greater clarity in our capital planning process going forward.
I'll now turn the call over to David, who'll provide you greater detail about second-quarter financial trends. David?
David J. Turner
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with the balance sheet on slide 3.
So we were very pleased with our loan growth this quarter. At quarter-end, balances stood at $75 billion, which is an
increase of $1.1 billion or 1.4% from the first quarter.
Starting with business lending, which includes our commercial and investor-real-estate portfolios, these loans increased
2% from the end of the prior quarter. This growth was broad-based geographically and continues to be led by our
commercial and industrial category, as ending loans in this portfolio grew 5% versus the prior quarter. Areas that
experienced growth included Regions business capital, real estate corporate banking, as well as healthcare,
transportation and technology lending.
Meanwhile, total new C&I production increased 36% over the prior quarter. And pipelines remain strong, and we are
beginning to see a pickup in loan production extending beyond middle-market into the small-business segment, which
is encouraging. Notably, line utilization increased 30 basis points from last year to 44.7%.
The second quarter is usually a seasonally strong quarter for commercial growth, and while we expect growth in
commercial and industrial loans to continue, we do not expect the pace of growth to remain at this level during the
seasonally slower third quarter.
We were encouraged that we experienced a more modest pace of decline in the investor-real-estate portfolio. This
portfolio declined 4% linked quarter, compared to the previous quarter's decline of 5%. At quarter-end,
investor-real-estate ending balances stood at $7 billion, down 26% or $2.4 billion from one year ago.
Notably, new and renewed production in the investor-real-estate portfolio has continued to improve, as we see more
opportunities to make loans to qualified borrowers, consistent with our risk appetite. In fact, we've seen a variety of
new lending opportunities within homebuilder finance, which was 28% of total investor-real-estate production in the
second quarter, compared to 17% this time last year. Overall balances in the investor real estate portfolio may fluctuate
depending on productivity levels, de-risking, and payoff activity.
Turning to consumer lending, this portfolio totaled $28.9 billion and was steady linked-quarter as consumer
de-leveraging began to subside. Importantly, our mortgage portfolio was relatively stable linked quarter, due to the
retention of $222 million of 15-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages in the second quarter.
Declines in our home-equity portfolio, which includes lines and loans, continued as customers take advantage of
opportunities to refinance. However, we are encouraged by recent results, as loan production increased 47%
linked-quarter due to an improvement in residential home valuations and customers taking advantage of our
home-equity-loan product. This production is expected to continue to reduce the pace of decline in our overall
home-equity portfolio.
Indirect auto loans increased 8% quarter-over-quarter, and total production was up 21% as we continued to expand our
dealer network. At quarter-end, we had almost 2,100 dealers and plan to increase the number of dealers by another 10%
by the end of the year. There are currently approximately 8,000 dealers located in our footprint, further illustrating the
opportunity we have to increase our dealer network.
Credit card balances were also up this quarter, as our number of cardholders increased 2%. And we remained focused
on increasing our penetration rate of our credit cards into our current base of 4 million households. We believe that
over time this will result in a substantial increase in the number of customers that carry a Regions credit card.

Overall, we're pleased with the determined efforts of our bankers, which have translated into improved loan production
and growth in balances this quarter. Historically, the summer months have been typically slower production months for
the industry; but we will continue to stay focused on growing our business.
Let's move to the liability side of the balance sheet. Deposit mix and cost continue to improve in the second quarter.
Total average low-cost deposits increased $230 million linked quarter and time deposits fell to just 12% of total
deposits. This positive re-pricing and mix shift resulted in deposit costs declining 3 basis points down to 15 basis
points. While the opportunities for continued reduction in deposit costs is now more limited, we have an additional $3.6
billion of CDs maturing in the second half of 2013 at an average rate of 43 basis points and this compares to our current
average going on rates, for new CDs of approximately 21 basis points.
Let's take a look at how all this has impacted our net interest income and the resulting margin. Net interest income on a
fully taxable equivalent basis, was $821 million, up $10 million or 1% linked quarter. The increase was driven in part
by an additional day in the quarter, incremental loan growth, continued declines in deposit cost, and liability
management activity. The resulting net interest margin was 3.16%, up 3 basis points linked quarter. Again, the
reductions of deposit and borrowing costs were principal drivers. Although, our net interest margin was also impacted
by a decline in excess average cash balances.
As we have previously stated, rising interest rates are beneficial to our net interest margins, as our asset-sensitive
balance sheet reacts favorably to increases in both short-term and long-term interest rates. Despite the outlook for
short-term rates being stable for the foreseeable future, the recent rise in long-term interest rates has increased our
expectations for future net interest margin. If rates remain at current levels or increase further, we expect modest
margin expansion over time.
As long-term rates rise, we experienced higher reinvestment yields in our investment portfolio and as mortgage
prepayment slowed, we experienced less premium amortization, which amounted to $73 million in the second quarter,
down from $77 million in the first quarter.
At the end of the second quarter, mortgage-backed securities represented 84% of our investment portfolio. So, as
long-term interest rates rise, we continue to see a benefit to our portfolio yield.
Let's move on to the next slide, where we illustrate this point. We estimate that if short-term rates increase an additional
100 basis points, our net interest income would increase approximately $81 million over the next year. And separately,
if longer-term interest rates were to increase an additional 100 basis points, our net interest income would increase an
additional $132 million. Each of these scenarios would be additive to our base scenario, which assumes increases in
longer term interest rates over the next 12 months.
Considering that the recent changes in interest rates occurred during the latter part of the quarter, it was not a
significant factor affecting the second quarter's net interest income. It takes time for rate increases to impact net interest
income by way of reinvestment yields, prepayments and other customer behaviors. However, these recent increases
negatively impacted the change in the unrealized gain in the securities portfolio. So, I want to provide you a little more
color on some adjustments we've made to the investment portfolio during the quarter.
The overall size of the portfolio declined $2.7 billion linked quarter, and we also moved $2.4 billion in securities to
held-to-maturity. These actions will allow us to reduce wholesale borrowings, reduce the overall balance sheet size,
reduce tangible common equity volatility, and increase flexibility in asset liability management.
In connection with these actions, we offset portfolio sales with derivatives, in order to maintain our sensitivity profile.
We will consider additional strategies as loan growth continues, and we get more clarity on fiscal and monetary
policies. Including the assets moved to held-to-maturity, at quarter end, the securities portfolio was $24.4 billion, or
24% of earning assets compared to 26% in the previous quarter.
Let's take a look at non-interest revenue on the next slide. Second quarter non-interest revenue declined 1% linked
quarter, primarily related to a decline in mortgage and service charge income.

As expected, mortgage banking revenue was down in the second quarter. Mortgage loan production was $1.9 billion,
an increase of 6% over the prior quarter. This production was offset by changes in market rates that affected mortgage
servicing rights hedges and gains on sale, which ultimately lowered mortgage revenue. And as mentioned earlier, the
retention of 15-year production on our balance sheet also impacted mortgage income. However, in order to generate
additional mortgage revenue, we are also focused on cross-sell opportunities as only 13% of Regions' banking
households have a Regions' mortgage.
Service charges during the quarter were impacted by a couple of factors. In viewing service charges during the quarter,
we determined that we needed to make $12 million in additional reimbursements to customers related to our
non-sufficient funds policy change that we made last year. Excluding this charge, service charges would have been up
over the prior quarter, due primarily to household growth that we experienced.
Additionally, we continue to focus on other revenue-generating products and services like our Now Banking suite of
products. During the quarter, the number of households using these products increased 4% and the number of active
Now Banking debit cards increased 6%. Of note, almost 60% of these customers are new to Regions, providing us with
additional opportunities for revenue growth.
Now moving on to expenses; non-interest expenses totaled $884 million. However, excluding debt extinguishment
costs related to the early termination of certain debt and preferred securities, non-interest expenses declined 2% linked
quarter. Credit related costs continued to decline as well as professional and legal fees. Salaries and benefits increased
slightly this quarter, due to additional staffing in income producing areas, as well as increases for merit and incentive
compensation. However, we continue to expect that 2013 expenses will be lower than 2012 expenses, illustrating our
commitment to prudent expense management.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 31%, and was impacted by the debt extinguishment costs associated with the early
termination of certain debt preferred securities. Approximately, $24 million of the $56 million was not deductible for
tax purposes, that added about 2 percentage points to the effective rate. So, if you exclude that impact, the tax rate
would have been closer to 29%.
Let's move to asset quality. We continue to make progress with respect to asset quality. The provision for loan losses
was $31 million, or $113 million less than net charge-offs. Total net charge-offs were down $36 million linked quarter,
and net charge-offs as a percent of total average loans, was 77 basis points, which is the lowest level since the first
quarter of 2008. Both non-performing loans and non-performing assets declined 5% linked quarter.
In addition, total delinquencies declined 7% from first to second quarter. Inflows of non-performing loans amounted to
$328 million, which was within our range of $250 million to $350 million that we've previously discussed. And while
this represents an increase from the prior quarter, it's important to note that the increase represents a small number of
large credits, which create volatility in migration from time-to-time.
Notably, criticized and classified loans, which is one of the best and earliest indicators of asset quality continued to
decline, with commercial and investor real estate criticized loans down 4% from the first quarter.
Our coverage ratios remained solid. At quarter end, our loan loss allowance to non-performing loans stood at 109%.
Meanwhile, our loan loss allowance to loans was 2.18% at the end of the second quarter. And based on what we know
today, we expect continued improvement in asset quality going forward.
So, let's take a look at capital and liquidity. We successfully completed several actions in the second quarter that served
to improve the efficiency of our capital structure, while reducing funding costs. Specifically, we call virtually all of our
remaining trust preferred securities, tendered for higher cost senior debt, and issued lower cost debt.
As a result of these actions, along with scheduled debt maturities, our overall funding costs improved 5 basis points to
40 basis points and our run rate will improve going forward. These actions have been included in our margin guidance
that we have provided.
We also increased capital returns to shareholders by raising the corporate dividend and repurchasing shares. For
additional information related to the early termination of debt and preferred securities, refer to the index, which is at the

end of the earnings presentation.
Our capital position remains strong as our Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter stood at 11.7% and our estimated Tier 1
common ratio was 11.2%. We continue to analyze the final Basel III capital rule issued on July 2 and we're pleased that
many aspects of the proposal were modified or removed from the final rule.
Based on our interpretation, we estimate our pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will be approximately 10.4%, a
significant improvement from our original estimate under the proposed rule.
Liquidity at both the bank and holding company remains solid, with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 81%. Lastly, based on
our understanding of the new amendments, Regions remains well positioned to be fully compliant with respect to the
liquidity coverage ratio.
In summary, we continue to be confident in our ability to maintain positive momentum as we strive to prudently
capitalize on Regions' opportunities and deliver consistently positive returns for shareholders.
I'll now turn it back to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. List?
M. List Underwood
Thank you, David.
We are ready to begin the Q&A session of our call. And in order to accommodate as many participants as possible this
morning, I would like to ask each caller to please limit yourself to one primary question and one related follow-up
question.
Operator, now let's open up the line for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Hi. Good morning, everybody. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the
progression for earning asset growth. It's great to see the loan progression moving the right way, and you talked about
the – shrinking the portfolio a little bit on the security side. So with period-end earning assets lower than the averages,
I'm just wondering, are we at the point where we get to that bottom of average earning assets? And what do you expect
to see as far as that trajectory?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, Ken, this is David. We had, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, taken some
actions with regards to our securities portfolio and de-leveraged, you don't see all that coming through. There's a little
piece and other assets that will settle and you'll see reductions there. But our earning asset number, in general, if you
kind of look at it over a longer term, we think we're pretty close to where we can get net growth from here. We may
have some minor adjustments depending on what we do from a de-leveraging standpoint. But I think the – it really
comes down to us is the loan growth, which we see continues to be positive.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: All right. And then my follow-up is just, any update with regards to ordering around NSFs? And
any potential changes you might have to make – affecting revenue in that regard?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: No. I mean, we continue to – we continued to review and challenge ourselves on policies,
continue to try to make our policies very customer-friendly, very transparent, continue to make adjustments here as
guidance comes out, but no news to disclose is forthcoming at this juncture.

Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: I just wanted to ask about your NIM guidance. You indicated that you could see some
positive upward movement. Could you just give us a sense as to how much you're expecting from the funding cost and
the asset re-pricing versus the mix shift?
And part of the reason for asking is, you do give the chart on the 100-basis-point rise in rates at the long end of the
curve, which – 132 bips is 12 basis points to NIM. We did get that in the last quarter. I know it comes over the next 12
months, but I'm wondering if we're triangulating to 12 basis points, and that's what you mean by modest?
<A - David J. Turner>: 12 basis points is above what modest is. We've been kind of in a stable discussion with –
relative to our NIM. And Betsy, it's really dependent on what happens with the interest rate environment. We've seen
pretty incredible volatility over this past quarter, so it gets a little harder to pin it down exactly. And we understand
that's why you're asking the question. We try to put a little guidance both on the short-term and long-term rates to give
you our thoughts.
So modest to us, there would be some increases perhaps a tad higher than what stable has been. Stable has been within
one or two points. So, modest can be slightly more than that. But I think your number's a little high.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: But – I do think Betsy when you look at it, we've had a fairly disciplined approach to
deposit pricing. We're down 3 basis points again this quarter. But, when you look at where deposit pricing is today, the
opportunities to drive that number lower are diminishing. But we did make with the debt and capital restructuring we
did this quarter, we did reduce our funding cost.
Loan yields continued to be under pressure, but – and you saw a slight compression this quarter in loan yields, but our
portfolio yield should improve incrementally over time. So, we do believe we've got a modest opportunity for
expansion. But, a lot of that's going to depend on how rates move and what the slope of the curve eventually turns out
to be.
<A - David J. Turner>: Betsy, I would add to that. You need to really think through it. I mentioned the impact of
prepayments on our investment portfolio. The premium that we have that we're amortizing was down $77 million in the
first quarter, $73 million in the second. So, that change in the tenure really does impact that amortization quite a bit. So,
that's really one of the things to look at.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. The follow-up is just on that page 6 slide, where you do indicate the interest rate
sensitivity summary, that assessment of the 100 bps, long end of the curve, of $132 million NII impact. Can you just
give us some color as to what the assumptions are in there? Is that just static portfolio, static moves. And your modest
increase in NII takes into consideration, competitive actions that you would take? Is that how I triangulate the two
statements?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, I think you've got to take all that into account. It's not just the static portfolio that has
baked in. We think our balance sheet changes are going to be our productions, loan production's going to be,
prepayments assumptions on the investment portfolio. So all that's really baked in, deposit costs, funding long-term
debt costs. And so it's really everything's in that guidance.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah, thank you very much. Going back to your C&I loan growth, was that new stuff that was
coming in, or is it your people tapping the utilization rate? And what is the utilization rate at this point on those
portfolios?
<A - David J. Turner>: The utilization rate was up to about 44.7%. That was not the big driver. The big driver really
was new production from customers.
And as I mentioned in the prepared comments, it was really broad-based geographically. Over 70% of our geographies
grew loans. We had not only that, but broad-based in products. Healthcare and transportation were a couple. REIT
lending was embedded in that too.
So we're seeing a little broader push towards production. We also have seen that drift a little bit into small business.
That's too early to call. We're starting to see that, which is very encouraging for us.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I would just add to that is this quarter versus last quarter, the diversification of our loan
production was much better. Obviously, we'd love to see even more diversification and granularity in that production.
But it was more broad-based across markets, more broad-based across products, and in particular, more broad-based
across the size of the corporate borrower.
Most of our business over the last several quarters in C&I has come from a larger end of C&I middle-market. We're
seeing demand further down into that customer segment today. And as David said, it's still too early to call. But the
small-business owner, the small middle-market customer, coming back some, but too early to call it a trend.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And how is the multi-family markets? Are you participating in any of this type of lending, or is
that something you guys don't get involved with?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah. We do. If you look at commercial real estate for us, one of our big drivers has been
multi-family. It represents about 27% of our production year-to-date. And it's right behind our homebuilder product,
which I touched on, is starting to come back as well.
So we're looking at multi-family – in particular, where that multi-family is, to make sure we don't let that get out in
front of us. But we feel good with those projects that we're putting on today.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Thanks very much, gentlemen. Go ahead.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: When you look at it, the commercial real estate production has been historically –
compared to historical volumes, had been very low. We saw production pickup in 2011. We saw it pickup even further
in 2012, and the pace we're at in 2013, it will be a little bit above that.
But as David mentioned in his earlier remarks, that portfolio continues to reduce in out-standings. We're down to about
$7 billion. While we are encouraged by the new production, we still have not reached an inflection point on that
portfolio.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. Thanks a lot, gentlemen.

<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Good morning. My first question is a follow-up to Betsy's.
Even with some of the redemptions that occur this quarter, it seems like you still have a higher-cost long-term debt
footprint. And I guess this is a two-part question. One is what is the propensity to redeem some of that long-term debt,
especially given your capital ratios are quite high under Basel III? And if so, is that included in the NII guidance that
you gave on slide 6?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, I mean we do continue to look at our long-term-debt costs and ways to get that down.
So we haven't stopped looking at it.
Any of those instruments, though, that have any type of capital attached to it requires approval from our regulatory
supervisors. So it goes through a little longer process to get approval to do that. But we are continuing to look at
opportunities to get our total funding costs down to 40 basis points. We'd like to get that lower. And our long-term-debt
cost is somewhere in the 4.5 range. So it's a good point.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Is redeeming that included in the NII upside guidance on slide 6 or not?
<A - David J. Turner>: It is not.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Got it. And my second question is on losses. I hear you loud and clear, in terms of the
trajectory of asset-quality improvement from here. But if you think about how the improvement in the Southeast is
going, where do you think normalized losses will be for Regions, as we think about earnings power a year from now,
two years from now?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I'm going to ask Barb Godin, our Chief Credit Officer, to answer that. Barb?
<A - Barbara Godin>: Erika, good morning.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Good morning.
<A - Barbara Godin>: We've talked a lot about 75 basis points through the cycle is what our risk appetite is. What
that actually means as we come out of the cycle – that we should see something better than 75 basis points. Somewhere
down in that 50-basis-point area would be appropriate. And then as we move through the coming years, that will move
somewhere around that 75 basis point, depending on the mix of our portfolio between consumer and commercial book.

Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Craig.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Good morning, guys. So first just on compensation here, it's up modestly year-over-year.
And I understand that you're adding bodies and income-producing roles. And of course, variable comp's going to move
with loan production here.
But what is really the outlook here, now that loan growth is positive and your guidance is positive? Should we expect to
see continued kind of modest growth in comp here? Or could we see it kind of revert back to the downward thrust we
saw the last two years?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, I think that clearly we're still focused on rigorous expense management, and we are
looking for opportunities to make our organization more efficient.
That being said, we also are continuing to add resources that are customer-facing, revenue-producing. And where we
see opportunity to do that, we're going to take advantage of them to grow and diversify our revenue streams.

If we're successful in growing our revenue streams, then I think you should anticipate that our salaries and
compensation would follow that success. That being said, in our non-revenue producing, non-customer facing parts of
the company, we continue to try to become more efficient each and every quarter.
<A - David J. Turner>: And Craig, I'll add to that. Our guidance that we had over the past several quarters for our
efficiency ratio to be in that low to high 50 range, which is dependent on an increase in rate is really – the efficiency
ratio, which came down, is more dependent on the revenue growth.
And we see opportunities to hire talented bankers to help us grow that revenue line. And there is some time where you
make investments that get the new folks up and running to generate the revenue.
But to Grayson's point, we are very – we're wanting to make sure we look at our expenses. We still believe 2013 will be
lower than 2012, as we mentioned, but we are rigorously reviewing expense management. But we don't want to stop
making investments in people and technology as we've done, because that's really what the future of the franchise is all
about.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: All right. Understand. One follow-up on deposit growth versus earning asset growth. Your
deposit growth actually has been quite negative. We understand why, CD runoff, you've been shrinking the banks in
certain areas. But also you think earning asset growth now actually will trend up, given kind of your response to a prior
question.
So do you think earning-asset growth will materially exceed deposit growth in the next year or two? And if so, how do
you expect to fund that?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, first off, I would say, our loan-to-deposit ratio is 81%, which is about 9, 10 points below
our peers. So we have some room there.
We're always looking at growing earning assets – loans, in particular, as well as households and deposits. So we would
– we've mentioned before that a loan-to-deposit ratio in the low-90s would be fine with us as steady-state. We want to
make sure we don't have too much reliance on deposits.
From a funding standpoint getting the overnight market like most banks did in 2008. But 81% we would argue is a little
lower than we want. And that's why we've been stressing really wanting to have appropriate loan growth to match off
with the great funding that we have.
And when you own deposit market share and have the density, we do in the Southeast, that's our competitive advantage
coming through. But we still want to grow deposits and grow households.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys.

Your next question comes from Josh Levin of Citi.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: Good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Josh.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: I want to follow-up on the check-posting question from before. Are you still doing high to low?
And if so, if you switch to low to high, how should we think about that impacting earnings?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I think, Josh, that we continued to look – we are still high to low from a posting standpoint
on most of our transactions. But you have to look at your availability policy as well as your other policies surrounding
insufficient funds, all in aggregate, to decide where a level turn out from an earnings standpoint.
We've not finalized on exactly on all of those decisions and have not put forth what we believe would be an earnings
impact to that. But that continues to be an internal conversation that is being nailed. And as we get further guidance, we

will share that with you.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: Okay. Secondly, I guess this is one of the more upbeat and optimistic regional-bank earnings
calls I've heard this earning season. You seem to be more opportunistic on loan growth than a lot of your peers. Why do
you think that is? Is it your footprint? Is it something else?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, I think it's a number of reasons. I think one is that we've been showing good
loan-production numbers for several quarters now. But the runoff in the commercial-real-estate portfolio and the runoff
in our residential-mortgage portfolio, if you will, has muted the benefits of that loan production.
As both of those asset segments – as the attrition slows in those segments, we've been able to show positive growth. We
do believe that we've got a lot of bankers that are calling on customers and trying to put forth a very determined effort
to grow our business in a prudent manner.
We think the Southeast is recovering a little faster than some other parts of the country. But the most encouraging part
of this is how it's broadened. Out of the markets we're serving, we had over 70% of our markets show net growth this
quarter for the first time. And it's a real improvement over where we were.
I think that if you read the other reports, we probably are a little more optimistic than many of the peers in this report.
But from a place we've come from, over the last few quarters of showing net declines, this has been sort of a very
important quarter for us in demonstrating that turn.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Michael.
<Q - Michael E. Rose>: Hey. Good morning. I just wanted to get a sense on the loan pipeline. You talked a lot about it
by product, but can you talk about it on a geographic basis? I mean are you seeing more of the pipeline come from
some of the more distressed areas that are now rebounding?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, I mean the – clearly the more distressed areas in our franchise footprint have been
Georgia and Florida. We're seeing good response out of both of those markets at this juncture. As I just mentioned, the
demand is more broad than it was a quarter ago – certainly two quarters ago.
We are seeing, if you will, on the business side of our lending, we demonstrated pretty strong production quarter in the
fourth quarter. Things slowed down a little bit in the first quarter. And then strong production here in the second
quarter.
Third quarter is typically a slow quarter for our business-lending production. Our pipelines are good, but we aren't
forecasting third quarter to be as strong as second. But that is really more of a seasonal bias on our part. We are seeing
– but we are seeing strong pipelines. So third quarter could surprise us to the upside. We'll wait and see.
On the consumer side, we are seeing – with I guess over 100 basis points increase in mortgage rates, we are seeing
some mix shifts in our application volumes. We did $1.9 billion in mortgage production in the second quarter. It's up
about 6% from the first quarter. So good production there, and our pipelines look good.
But we are forecasting that we think that mortgage applications will decline. It's a little early to predict that decline, but
it would look like that it's somewhere in the 15% to 20% range for the second half of the year.
I would tell you the mix has really shifted. We saw that mix shift start in the first quarter in our application pipelines.
Today, purchase mortgages is running better than 50% of total production. And in the applications, it's even higher than
that. So we do think that there will be a fairly sizable shift in mix in mortgage originations.

Auto lending applications continue to be up. We're seeing strength in those. We've seen good production of new
accounts on credit card.
So on the consumer side of the house, I think we are seeing some improving signs of strength. In particular, I think the
rise in home valuations in some of the more distressed markets that we serve – we've seen that provide some
opportunities for financing, particularly on the equity side of the house.
That was probably more than you asked for, but -
<Q - Michael E. Rose>: No, I appreciate the color. Just as my follow-up, I just noticed that the branch count was
actually flat this quarter for the first time in a while. I wanted to get your sense for the branch network from here. Are
you looking to continue to consolidate maybe some smaller branches? And then how should we think about that going
forward? Thanks.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: We continue to rationalize our physical footprint. We continue to believe that physical
branch office is very relevant in our business model. But we also recognize that customers are moving to other
channels, and we're investing in those channels.
We will continue to consolidate some of our offices. We look at that. We go through a very detailed analysis on where
consolidations make sense. And you'll see us continue to do that. We've been more aggressive. We were more
aggressive earlier in that regard, but we continue that. And you'll see a very limited number of new offices being
opened.
But on a net basis, I would say you should look for us to continue to be stable to slightly down.

Your next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Hey, Ryan.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Good morning, guys.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: David, just a follow-up to what you're referring to, the premium amortization falling from $77
million down to $73 million. So [ph] you saw rates (48:02) of 100 basis points. So I think the amortization is down $4
million.
First, is the $73 million a good run rate, assuming rates stay at the current levels? Or should we see a step down into the
next quarter? And also should we think about a 100-basis-point-decline would lead to roughly $4 million of decline on
a go-forward basis?
<A - David J. Turner>: I think if you looked at rates where we are today that you should see a reduction in the $73
million. This has been an awful volatile environment, so it's hard to pinpoint. But I think directionally, you're correct to
assume that the $73 million would be down on a – and if you get an increase in rates from here, it's going to go down
obviously that much quicker.
But – yeah, so that's the direction you ought to think about it.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Okay. And just as a follow-up to a question that had been asked earlier, just in terms of the $12
million of reserves for customer funds, is that a one-time item? So should we expect that not to resume over the coming
quarters?

<A - David J. Turner>: Well, we believe that we have evaluated all our refunds relative to the policy change we've
made last year. And $12 million was the official number. So based on what we know, that's the final number. So we
don't see that recurring.
Yeah, we constantly look at our service charges and how we treat customers, and make adjustments. But we don't
anticipate anything at this point.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Got it. If I can just squeeze in one last question. I mean, you've obviously given us a lot of
disclosure around the rate sensitivity. But if I were to look at your most recent 10-Q, I think it says for 200 basis point,
parallel shift you'd see $312 million rise in NII. Given the changes you've had where moving securities, adding
derivatives, so first, how's that overall sensitivity changed? And do you guys have any customer facilitating derivatives
that will be rolling-off over the next years, such that you – we could see your asset sensitivity increasing over time?
<A - David J. Turner>: You know that our – we wanted to really maintain our asset sensitivity. So, you saw an awful
lot of actions that we took during the quarter. But, we really have maintained that asset sensitivity, in particular, by
entering into received fixed swaps, if you will, with a portion for about $2.5 billion worth of received fixed swaps.
To maintain that, I think we're up 6% on 100 basis points. And that's about where we are right now. Obviously, higher
rates, that much more of an increase in income that we could expect. We like that position and want to keep it.

Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore Partners.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning.
<Q - John Pancari>: I'm wondering if you can get some – just can you give us some additional color on new money
yields that you're seeing in your loan book, particularly on the commercial real estate and C&I side, given the steeper
curves here?
<A - David J. Turner>: You know on the, frustratingly, that the short-end of the curve really has remained anchored
in, for us, one month LIBOR in that 19 basis point to 21 basis point range. Spreads have come under some pressure, but
we still are off the lows that we have seen before. We're kind of – we feel okay with those spreads. They've been in that
225, 250 range for a while, and we feel good about that.
We are seeing some pressure on structure that we're not chasing. But we've seen that anecdotally in the marketplace;
but from a spread standpoint, we feel good about that.
What's important on spread is to think about the customers that are in there. And Grayson touched on it earlier, we
really are a middle-market company, small business lender. And if we can get the small business segment really
demanding credit, then our overall yields and spreads will improve. When you're at the larger end in corporate – largest
in the corporate, the spread tightens up quite a bit, not as profitable, but obviously not as risky either. So, you have to
trade-off risk and profitability there. But in our core middle-market business that we're in, spreads have hung in there.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, I mean, I think if you look at it, you know, early on in the crisis, spreads really
widened. And obviously, they came under competitive pressures and have compressed. And I would say, it appears
stable at the moment. There's an awful lot of competition in the market, got some very strong competitors, and so
you're seeing competition on every transaction. We still are staying very committed to our relationship-banking model,
trying to make sure that we're banking customers that have full relationships with us. And we believe that we're
keeping our new ongoing business, that from a pricing standpoint, we believe, we're keeping that stable at this juncture.
You do see the strength of our customer base improving. I'd say the overall credit quality of our customer book
continues to improve, which certainly helps those customers from a rate standpoint.

<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. Thank you. Then on the expense side, I want to get a better feel of what is a good run rate
in your eyes, in terms of total expenses. I know you indicated that your answer on the comp expense seems to imply
that it may not pull back from the jump at the comp expense you saw this quarter. So, if that doesn't necessarily pull
back, but you do see that negative unfunded provision go away, could that mean that your expense levels on the core
basis, ex the debt extinguishment could actually go up from here?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, again, I'll start with the end in mind, that is, we believe 2013 expenses will be down
from 2012. We do acknowledge the unfunded commitment credit that came in. That line item has a tendency to be a
little volatile. That being said, we are looking very hard at every expense category.
Obviously, our largest one is related to salaries and benefits. We do and have made investments in talent. We believe
that's important to us long-term. But we do continue to look at and make sure we have the right people and the right –
the right number of people and the right people to do what we need them to do.
We look at occupancy, and furniture and fixtures as the next two biggest ones, and continue to look at square footage
and trying to become as efficient as we can. So, I think, it's hard to get on a specific run rate, but we are continuing to
stay focused on improving expenses each and every day.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, I mean, the conversation is really around creating positive operating leverage. We try
to take a balanced approach running the business, a very disciplined, rigorous focus on expenses, but also
understanding that not all expenses are bad. We need to figure out a way to grow our revenues, and that requires
investing in people and technology.
And so, our determination is to deliver positive operating leverage. That's been challenging in this economic
environment. But I think just focusing on expenses alone is not in the best interest of the long-term sustainability of this
franchise. But at the same time, we realize in this environment, given the economy and given reduced demand for some
of our products and services, we really have to be disciplined around expense management, and we will continue to do
that.

Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Hi, guys. Just one more clarification on the moving pieces in the net interest income.
Clearly, the earning asset base is a little bit smaller at the end of the quarter, and I assume that's the level that you're
talking about kind of growing plus or minus. And then the NIM's up on a modest amount with some additional kicker
from the premium amortization coming down. So, when you bring all those moving pieces together, do you think you
can grow the net interest income dollars in 3Q versus here, you know call it assuming stable rates and your loan growth
assumptions?
<A - David J. Turner>: That's where we're kind of guiding in the prepared comments that if rates will stay where we
are right now, we think we can have some modest improvements in NII and the resulting margin there. It's just hard to
gauge exactly, Matt, how much that is with this kind of volatility, but I think that would be the appropriate guidance.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just longer-term, as you think about the mix of the balance sheet, the
security, its earning assets, is there a longer-term target as loan growth hopefully eventually picks up for everyone
including you? Is there a longer-term target versus the 24% currently?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, we – we're sitting here at 81% loan-to-deposit ratios, so our ability to attract, maintain
low cost deposits is really a strategic advantage for us. We hadn't had the loan growth we wanted, so we've had to put
the delta in the securities book.

So today, we probably have the second highest concentration of earning assets in our investment portfolio. We've
talked about that before. And within that portfolio, we at one time had them virtually all in mortgage-backed, and we've
diversified a way by introducing a little bit of credit risk in the investment portfolio, since we weren't growing credit in
the form of loans. But we do believe that as loan growth comes about the economy generally improves, then you go
back to a more standard relationship of the securities book, which would be in the high-teens. So, call it, 18%, so it's 6
points away from there right now.

Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Hey. Good morning. A couple of questions on credit quality. I was noticing in your NPL
migration schedule; in commercial segment, there was a fairly significant up-tick and I'm wondering if that was just
one particular credit that moved or a combination of a few?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, I mean, if you look at migration and you ask what's changed, it's really the mix.
You're seeing much more commercial and industrial loans in that migration mix and less commercial real estate loans.
That's just sort of where we're at in the cycle.
Commercial and industrial loans by their nature are going to be a little more uneven. There is obviously you know
more substantial credits in that category. The other thing we do is that if, we have a credit come in to a non-performing
status in a given quarter, we count it as gross migration into NPL. And even if we resolve it within the same quarter,
this quarter, we had that situation occur, and so you see a fairly large credit in our migration, but that's already been
resolved and now out of our numbers for the next quarter.
So, with commercial lending credits, you're just going to see a little more unevenness. It's still in our $250 million to
$350 million band that we sort of think is normalized, but you know will be some unevenness from time-to-time in that
migration.
<A - David J. Turner>: And, Eric, that's where we – I was trying to leave you with comments. Based on all that, if
you look at criticizing classifieds and you see that continuing downward trend, early late-stage delinquency is getting
better. Everything tells us that credit quality is going to continue to improve from here. So, we aren't overly concerned
with that migration.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great. And then just one quick one. The – can you give us what you think your tax rate's
going to be for the back half?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, we had a couple of points in the effective rate this quarter, because of the lack of ability
to deduct certain of the charges that came through on the termination costs. That was 2 points and we were at 31%, so
if you take that out, we'd be in the 29% range, which we think is a reasonable proxy for going forward.

<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one quick question going back to the issue I
think that you brought up of regarding cross-selling, I think in the mortgage business. I'm just curious if you have any
more detail on how exactly you're going to go about the cross-sell opportunity and how high you think you can
reasonably drive that 13% that you referenced kind of in the near and longer-term?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, what we've been trying to do over the last several quarters is really push a
relationship banking model that focuses on the customers and focuses on delivering the full benefits of Regions
banking relationship with our customers. We've sort of internally branded that as Regions360.
We've been having – been having meetings in every single market across our franchise, pulling together different lines
of businesses, mortgage being a very, very important part of that to try to stimulate more conversation between teams,
more referrals between teams. We've seen referrals from our branch offices, they're predominantly focused on
consumer banking. We've seen a lot more referrals from those offices into our mortgage bankers.
Likewise, we've seen a lot of referrals coming out of mortgage banking into our branches. We're driving that across our
company. There's nothing special about that effort. It's an effort you would probably hear of and be espoused by. Most
banking institutions, the key is in the execution, is how well can we execute that and part of what you're seeing in our
numbers this quarter is that execution has materially improved over the last few quarters.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: And – but do you have any area, where you'd like to drive that 13% kind of penetration rate
too, or no?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, I don't know that we've set a defined limit on that. The way we're really measuring it
today is sort of quality referrals from our branches. They've more than doubled in the last nine months. We'd love to
keep that number going higher. The – obviously, with the way the mortgage market is changing at this point in time,
certainly changes the mix of those referrals, but we haven't internally set a penetration number that I know of.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much for the color.

Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good afternoon, Matt.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Grayson, one for you and then maybe one
for David. Grayson, given what appears to be a substantially greater level of capital flexibility with your – under the
Basel III final rule, and I appreciate that you're still thinking about some other steps that you can take in terms of the
reduction in your debt costs, but I'm curious if that – if the Basel III – your current Basel III position makes you any
more confident about going for potentially bigger buy-backs in the 2014 CCAR and capital planning process than you
might have originally thought?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, I mean, clearly, we were encouraged by where the regional banks landed on Basel
III. And, in particular, where we landed in that final set of rules. We believe it does provide opportunities for us to think
differently to some degree. As we go through our capital planning process more than anything else it provides clarity.
And that clarity, I think gives us all more confidence. And so, we're integrating that into all of our capital planning
thoughts and processes. And I do believe it gives us as a company some flexibility that at one point, we're concerned
we might not have. But today, I think we feel pretty good about our capital position and are building the appropriate
plans to manage that.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Great. David, a question for you related to the securities portfolio. I guess I'm just curious if
you could provide a little more color as to what investments you moved into the held-to-maturity bucket this quarter. It
looks like it's about 10% of your total investments at this point. And if the portfolio duration has changed meaningfully
from the 3-plus years that it was at the end of the first quarter.

<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, we really took those assets that are more sensitive to interest rate movements, so longer
duration, mortgage-backed securities that we pushed in there. And our duration in our investment portfolio, as a result
of the rate change did increase. Now we're probably in the 4-year range to-date. And that's acceptable to us given the
interest rate environment that we have.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.

Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good afternoon, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Good afternoon. Thank you. Coming back to capital; clearly, with the final NPR from the
Federal Reserve, the Tier 1 common ratios for the regional banks comes in at 7%. You may have a small SIFI buffer,
possibly 25 basis points or 50 basis points. Recognizing that you're not probably going to want to run close to that 7%
number, what level do you think you're going to see your Tier 1 common ratio, which, obviously is currently over 10%,
settle in that? What – have you guys given much thought yet on where you want to put that number, so that there could
be greater amounts of return of capital down the road to shareholders?
<A - David J. Turner>: Gerard, we think about that every day. And, it's hard to tell exactly where it will settle out. I
will tell you, without OCI in there, and having the volatility that would have been there under the original proposal, it
was going to probably cost us 25 basis points, 50 basis points just for that.
We had talked about being in that 8% to 8.5% range. We'll see how it settles out. I will tell you really the gating factor
for us has been and we believe will continue to be a severely adverse stressed Tier 1 common ratio versus the spot
capital. And so, you really have to kind of reverse engineer that. We don't know what the severely adverse level will be
under Basel III, today it's 5% under Basel I. You would expect there to be some reduction in that given that the
risk-weighted asset number, in general, changed for everybody.
And – but we'll see what our regulatory supervisors do. But I think, it's – broad-based, we would put it, best guess, 8%,
8.5% right now, but really reserve the right, but that's not to be the correct number, based on how we see what the
regime looks like through this next CCAR filing.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: And speaking of that, do you think that the folks that do the CCAR – the Federal Reserve,
the regulators, are they going to move – now that the final NPR is in and statutorily, everyone knows what the capital
ratios need to be for banks, will they move away from the percentage of – assuming, of course, you've passed with
strong numbers on the CCAR, but will they move away from percentage of earnings to just – or can you guys argue
that, 'look at our capital levels, we're 200 basis points above where we should be, we should be able to give most of that
back in some sort of timeframe'? Or they – do you think they'll stick with this percentage of earnings thing?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, clearly, our regulatory supervisors, as do we, want a safe banking system. And I think
there's been a lot of change that's been pushed through the marketplace. I think there's been an awful lot of thought that
has gone through, trying to do the right thing by everybody. And we've had a recent change, obviously, in Basel III. We
need to see how that thinking evolves. So, it's a little premature to bet on exactly what will happen. Clearly, there's
more capital in the industry than we've had. We expect that the amount of capital in the industry will not go back to
where it was pre-crisis, and I know that's a pretty large gap. But I think we need to be careful about getting ahead of
ourselves, and let's see how this thing evolves in an appropriate manner, but...
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: And then finally, on your securities portfolio, as a percentage of assets, you pointed out that
your loan-to-deposit ratio is lower than you'd like. Where should we see – when things get back to normal, possibly in
2 to 3 years, where should we see the securities as a percentage of assets? Where are you guys comfortable with that
number?

<A - David J. Turner>: That came up a minute ago. We really think if you look at history, we would have been in that
high-teen, call it, 18% just if you want a spot number. So, it's about 6 points away, and that's a percentage of earning
assets. So, 6 points away from where we are today...
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Great.
<A - David J. Turner>: ...which is $6 billion, $7 billion.

Your next question comes from Brian Foran of Autonomous.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good afternoon, Brian.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: Hey, guys. I guess most of my questions have been asked, but maybe one on deposits. If you
could remind us, any embedded assumptions as you think about asset sensitivity? And then just more broadly, the way
we measure it, you guys have one of the bigger jumps in non-interest bearing deposits as a percentage of total this
cycle, from about 20% back in the mid-2000s to 32% now, and just thoughts around sustainability of that increase.
Clearly, there's been a lot of efforts internally that you've made to increase that number. But clearly also on a low-rate
environment, non-interest bearing deposits tend to be a little higher?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah. And I think, I'll make a few comments. Obviously, this is a very different rate
environment for our depositors than we've seen before. And so, a lot of the historical evidence we have, I'm not sure
how valid that is coming out of this cycle. We're having to stress-test our deposit portfolio to make sure we understand
what some of the possibilities are, depending on how rates move and how fast rates move, the pace of increase in those
rates.
And when you look at our portfolio today, we have dramatically reduced our dependence on higher-priced deposits, in
particular, time deposits, as well as some high-priced depository accounts that we just have been less competitive on in
this kind of environment. Obviously, as the market moves we'll all have to move, and we've run a number of scenarios
to try to forecast what those movements might be. But clearly in this environment, it's a little different than anything
we've seen before. David?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, I think we ought to be – we need to be real careful that we don't allow history to unduly
influence what can happen as we go around. As we all – our industry has a lot of non-interest bearing on the balance
sheets that could move – historically, that's a – there is a core level of non-interest bearing that's going to be with us.
We have some pretty drastic moves off the balance sheet. I think, we're, like, 25% higher than we experienced last time
in terms of our assumptions. That's been baked into our guidance.
And I think it's important to think about these moves, not only in the sense of thinking about what our net interest
income and margin would be, but liquidity risk management, which is as important to us, and although we are sitting
here with an 81% loan-to-deposit ratio. We can never lose sight of that. So, you've asked a great question. It's
something we look at all the time, but we have higher outflows, I assume, today than we had before. And we shock it a
number of ways just to make sure that if we're wrong, what does that mean to us; again, in particular, as it relates to
liquidity.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: Thank you. That's very helpful. That was it for me.

Your final question comes from Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good afternoon, Marty.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thanks. Dave, before I let you off the hook, I want to go back to your interest rate
sensitivity analysis. And if I'm looking at this kind of steepening of the curve that you're doing on the long end, now
kind of drilling down into that premium amortization; right now, we're running in the 70s. If you were to extend the
duration by 50%, it seems like it would probably bring that down into the 50s, which would generate about $80 million
to $90 million worth of benefit, which is curious if that's relative to the $132 million. Is 65%, 70% of that coming from
a premium amortization or is that out of line with what you are building into that number?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah. We have a piece of that – a pretty large piece of the change in the premium
amortization coming into the margin guidance at $132 million. So yeah, two-thirds is built into that.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Okay. So about two-thirds of the impact is from premium amortization coming down?
<A - David J. Turner>: Right.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Okay. That's about what I was thinking. And then, when you go over to the short-term
increase here, what are you assuming on deposit pricing? Are you – as 100 basis point increase, are you assuming that
money market accounts and your CDs are going up one for one? Are you giving yourself some credit for lagging those
deposit rates?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, I think that we'd end up having about 60% of those that would be adjusted pretty
quickly. Again, maybe that's higher than what we've experienced before, but we have a pretty immediate increase in
rates to the extent that that starts happening.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: So, you're not really building any deposit lag into the benefit of the $81 million?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, less than before.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Okay. All right. Because it seems like as we come off the floor at least for the first 100
basis points we've typically seen, especially with money market, mutual fund accounts maybe not being as competitive
that there will be room for some kind of lagging as you first go through that first moving rate.
<A - David J. Turner>: We're certainly seeing this in a really low deposit cost standpoint. So, all these are best
guesses, but we really need to – we're going to be competitive – competitive with regards to our rates that we offer our
customers. So, it's really also dependent on the funding that our competitors have and peers have, too.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Very good. Thank you.
