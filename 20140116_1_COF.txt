Thanks, Jeff. Let me begin on slide 3 this evening. Capital One earned $859 million or $1.45 per share in the fourth
quarter. Like last quarter, we have included a reconciliation table in the Appendix that shows non-GAAP deal-adjusted
net income in the quarter of $1 billion or $1.75 per share.
Pre-provision earnings of $2.3 billion were down $240 million from the third quarter, primarily driven by seasonally
higher marketing expenses and nonrecurring restructuring expenses. Additionally, linked quarter revenues were lower
driven by the portfolio sale. Provision expense increased on a linked quarter basis as we recognized seasonally higher
charge-offs and a smaller allowance release. Consistent with the estimates we provided in January of this year, 2013
pre-provision earnings were approximately $10 billion excluding nonrecurring items. Operating expenses for 2013
were also in line with our previous estimate, with actual operating expenses coming in a little higher than $11.1 billion.
Moving to slide 4. Let me touch on net interest margin which decreased 16 basis points in the fourth quarter to 6.73%,
primarily driven by the impact of the sale of Best Buy. This was partially offset by higher yields on our investment
portfolio. Average interest earning assets were down quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by the full quarter impact of
the Best Buy portfolio sale and expected run-off in mortgage loans partially offset by growth in commercial and auto.
Total interest-bearing deposits were down quarter-over-quarter driven by planned run-off in our legacy direct bank. We
continue to expect portfolio run-off of about $1 billion in card and about $4 billion in mortgage in 2014.
Moving to slide 5. Our Tier 1 common ratio on a Basel I basis declined about 50 basis points in the quarter to end at
12.2%, reflecting the completion of our previously announced share buyback program as well as higher assets in the
quarter. We estimate our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III standardized Tier 1 common equity ratio to be 10.9% as of
December 31. This will become our primary regulatory capital ratio beginning in the first quarter of 2014.
While there's still work in progress industry-wide [ph] on the complications (4:49) for Capital One to the Basel III
advanced approaches, we continue to estimate we are above our target of 8%. Our own estimates of earnings and
capital under severely adverse stress scenarios, bolstered by our actual performance in the Great Recession suggest we
have substantial flexibility to return capital to shareholders and remain well capitalized.
However, we note that the Fed's modeling under CCAR will potentially result in material lower ratios under stress than
our own internal modeling. For some time, we have highlighted for our investors that the Federal Reserve has
increasingly done its own modeling in successive CCAR iterations and would take on balance sheet modeling in the
2014 CCAR.
On December 16, the Federal Reserve released additional information about how it will independently project banks'
balance sheets and risk-weighted assets for the 2014 CCAR process. It appears that the Federal Reserve will assume
loan growth of about 2% in loans under severely adverse stress across the banking industry and across different types
of loans. This is particularly noteworthy for credit card and consumer businesses, as we would expect significant
contraction in loans in our credit card and auto businesses in our stress scenario, consistent with the industry and our
own experience in past recessions.
All that said, our view of our own capital strength and trajectory and our intent to distribute capital to shareholders,
have not changed. In our recent 2014 CCAR submission, we requested share repurchases that, if approved, would result
in a total payout ratio well above the 2013 industry norm of 50%.

Let me close tonight with a brief comment on 2014 expectations. We expect 2014 GAAP pre-provision earnings
excluding nonrecurring items of approximately $9.8 billion with a reasonable margin of error. We continue to expect
2014 operating expenses of approximately $10.5 billion, again excluding nonrecurring items. And we expect marketing
expenses to rise in 2014, although as always, actual marketing expenses will depend on our assessment of market and
competitive opportunities. After adjusting 2013 revenues for the loss of Best Buy, which contributed a little over $630
million in revenues, this year, we expect very modest revenue growth in 2014.
There are other important factors which drive the ultimate earnings to shareholders. Rich will spend more time on
credit trends by line of business. In addition, rep and warranty and litigation continue to be a significant source of
uncertainty for the industry, and Capital One is no exception.
With that, let me turn the call over to Rich.
Richard D. Fairbank
Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin on slide 7 with an overview of the Domestic Card business.
Ending loans grew seasonally and were up about 5% from the third quarter, despite the continuing planned run-off.
Ending loans declined about 12% year-over-year. Excluding the Best Buy portfolio sale and the planned run-off, the
year-over-year decline in ending loans was about 1%. Purchase volume on general purpose credit cards, which
excludes private label cards that don't produce interchange revenue, grew about 8% year-over-year.
Looking below the surface, the trends in loans and purchase volumes continue to reflect our strategic choices, which
focus on generating attractive, sustainable, and resilient returns. We're avoiding high balance revolvers and allowing
the least resilient parts of the acquired HSBC portfolio to run off.
In contrast, we're seeing strong underlying loan growth in many segments, including transactors and revolvers other
than high balance revolvers. New account originations are growing and we're seeing more opportunities to increase
lines for existing customers, which should improve the trajectory of both loan growth and purchase volume growth
over time.
As we said last quarter, we don't expect these improvements to result in overall Domestic Card loan growth until
sometime around the second half of 2014. For the next couple of quarters, we expect underlying loan growth will
continue to be offset by shrinkage in the parts of the business we're avoiding.
Revenue margin for the quarter was 17.3%, down from the third quarter due to the absence of held for sale accounting
impact. Recall that the third quarter revenue margin excluding held for sale accounting impact was 17.2%. The
underlying revenue margin was relatively stable on a linked quarter basis as expected seasonal declines were offset by
the favorable run rate margin impact from the sale of the Best Buy portfolio. The portfolio sale also drove the quarterly
decline in revenue dollars.
Noninterest expense improved by $49 million in the quarter, driven by the absence of the third quarter legal reserve
addition, partially offset by an increase in marketing expense. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate increased
seasonally by about 22 basis points to 3.89%. Delinquency rate decreased about three basis points to 3.43%. Fourth
quarter charge-offs and delinquencies were impacted by the temporary increase we discussed last quarter.
Recall that in July, we changed a number of customer practices on the HSBC branded card portfolio to align them with
Capital One policies and practices. These changes temporarily increased Domestic Card delinquency rate by about 20
basis points in the fourth quarter and temporarily increased the monthly domestic charge-off rate by about 35 basis
points in December.
We expect the monthly charge-off rate to remain temporarily elevated by about 35 basis points through March in
addition to normal seasonality. We expect the impact will diminish in April and will be mostly out of the charge-off
rate by the end of the second quarter. To be clear, these estimated impacts are only one of the many factors that will
drive charge-offs and are not meant as forecasts for specific quarterly or monthly metrics.

Looking beyond the short-term trend, we expect that our focus on resilience and our strong credit risk underwriting will
continue to drive relatively stable credit results and historically strong levels with normal seasonal patterns. Our card
business remains well-positioned. We're delivering strong, sustainable, and resilient returns and we're generating
capital on a strong trajectory, which strengthens our balance sheet and enables capital distribution.
Moving to slide 8. The Consumer Banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans declined
about $500 million from the third quarter. Continuing growth in auto loans was more than offset by expected mortgage
run-off. Auto originations declined modestly in the fourth quarter, in line with seasonal trends we've observed in the
past. For the full year 2013, subprime originations were relatively stable while prime originations grew as we captured
additional prime share from our existing dealers. More prime originations add to the pressure on margins and partially
offset the expected increase in delinquency and charge-off rates.
Ending deposit balances declined by about $800 million in the quarter. We have ample deposit funding in a period of
relatively low overall loan growth, so we've throttled back on growth, mostly in legacy Capital One direct deposit
businesses.
Consumer Banking revenue was relatively stable compared to the third quarter. The revenue impact of declining
Consumer Banking loan balances and margin compression in Auto Finance was partially offset by an increase in home
loan yields resulting from higher estimated cash flows that we expect to collect on acquired home loans portfolios.
Noninterest expense increased $91 million in the quarter, driven by higher marketing in our retail deposits business and
a number of individually small operating expense items, many of which are nonrecurring. Provision expense was stable
in the quarter. Auto charge-off rate and delinquencies increased in line with expected seasonal patterns and the
continuing cyclical trend we've discussed for several quarters. As we've said before, we are now past the cyclical low
point for auto charge-off and delinquency rates.
The industry continues to normalize to more business as usual underwriting, following significant tightening during the
Great Recession. And we expect some softening in historically high used car auction values. As a result, we expect
Auto Finance credit losses will continue to gradually increase from the historic lows of the past few years but will
remain comfortably within ranges that support an attractive and resilient business.
Home loans credit trends remain favorable and continue to perform well inside of the assumptions we've made when
we acquired the mortgage portfolios. The overall Consumer Banking charge-off rate remains strong at about 1%.
As we enter 2014, we that expect Auto Finance revenues, margins, and returns will continue to decline as we move
from exceptional levels to more cycle average performance. We expect that Auto Finance returns will remain resilient
and well above hurdle rate. Additionally, we expect that the inexorable impacts of the prolonged low rate environment
will continue to pressure the economics of our retail deposit businesses, even if rates begin to rise in 2014.
As you can see on slide 9, our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of solid growth and
profitability. Loans grew 6% in the quarter and 16% year-over-year, driven by growth in specialized industry verticals
in C&I lending and CRE. Revenues were up about 12% from the third quarter and about 18% compared to the fourth
quarter of last year.
The year-over-year increase was mostly the result of growth in loan and deposit balances and spreads. The quarterly
increase was driven by ongoing balance growth and the addition of Beech Street Capital on November 1st, which
increased revenues and noninterest expense in the quarter.
Commercial credit continued to improve, while the current very low charge-off levels are not necessarily sustainable,
we continue to see low levels of nonperforming and criticized loan balances, so we expect the credit performance of
our Commercial Banking business to remain very strong.
While increasing competition, particularly in middle-market lending may continue to impact the pricing and volume of
new loan originations, we expect our focused and specialized approach to commercial banking to deliver strong results.
Across our Commercial Banking businesses, loan growth, credit, and profitability trends remain healthy.

I'll conclude my remarks this evening on slide 10. Capital One delivered strong results in 2013. We successfully
completed the integrations and brand conversions of two transformational acquisitions. We've made significant
progress on operational and infrastructure improvements, including our digital agenda. We expect these improvements
will help us stay ahead of rising regulatory demand and achieve cost savings and to enhance our customer experience
and build and sustain the value of our long-term customer franchise.
We added great talent at every level of the organization, including the board of directors and our senior leadership
team. We delivered strong financial performance from the company and across our businesses. And we continued to
generate capital, increased our dividend, and completed a $1 billion share repurchase program.
Of course, many of the significant challenges we faced in 2013 will continue into 2014. We still face a difficult growth
environment, significant planned run-off and the revenue impact of selling the Best Buy portfolio. Interest rates remain
persistently low, creating ongoing economic pressure, even if rates begin to rise in 2014. And we'll need to stay ahead
of regulatory demands from ongoing Dodd-Frank rulemaking, U.S. regulators implementation of Basel capital and
liquidity requirements and the evolving CCAR process.
Despite these continuing challenges, Capital One is earning very attractive risk-adjusted returns today and we expect
that will continue in 2014. We're always focused on the important levers that will sustain and further improve our
profitability. We are committed to tightly managing costs across our businesses. We don't view this as a one-off
project. It's a major multiyear agenda and it's a focus in all of our businesses and in every budget cycle. Our credit
results are strong, driven by our longstanding discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our continuing focus
on resilience.
Growth remains a high priority for us, but it's always in the context of a preemptive focus on generating attractive,
sustainable, and resilient returns. We expect the planned run-off will drive declining home loan balances. On the other
hand, we expect growth in areas we're emphasizing, including Commercial Banking and Auto Finance, will continue
and we expect year-over-year growth in Domestic Card loans to resume in the second half of 2014.
Finally, capital management remains an important part of how we expect to deliver superior and sustainable returns to
our investors, and Steve affirmed our capital return intentions for 2014. Our capital and liquidity positions remain
strong. Our businesses continue to deliver attractive and sustainable returns and generate capital on a strong trajectory.
We're comfortable with our strategic footprint and planned run-off frees up capital. All of these factors support our
planned capital distributions in 2014.
Now Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?
Jeff Norris

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you. A couple questions I'll ask upfront. I was just wondering if you could talk about
the marketing budget and kind of where the opportunities are to take that up in 2014. And then just conversely, to the
extent that you're going to tweak it one way or the other, what factors would determine that? Would it be credit related?

And, I guess, secondly, on capital, if the Fed were to disagree with your version of the test, do you envision having the
opportunity to resubmit? Thanks.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Sanjay, let me start with your first question and I'll let Steve take the second one. So, the
marketing budget for 2014, which is – as we mentioned, is up from the 2013 budget, I think is a reflection of increased
opportunity that we see. And, of course, the biggest part of the marketing budget is relative to our card business. I think
these opportunities are across the areas that we are investing in, Sanjay. So continued investment in the heavy spender
and transactor space where we feel we're getting very good traction, continued and increasing investment in the
medium and low balance revolver part of the business where we feel we're getting increasing traction as well.
And what factors will affect that? And you asked, is credit a leading one? Well, big changes in credit, obviously, can
cause significant impacts on that. All you have to do is look at the last Great Recession. But the biggest things are
really dialing up and down based on traction we're getting, response from our test sales, how rollouts are going and
what do we want to accelerate or slow it down. So it's really mostly response-driven line of scrimmage calls with which
we tweak that.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: [indiscernible] (22:22) answer on having an opportunity to have a second bite, we
believe we would. We passed qualitatively in 2013. The Fed's expectations for people's filings, clearly the standards for
that have gone up over the year. We think we've made a substantial investment to continue to improve our processes so
we have every reason to expect that we would have another opportunity.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Brad Ball with Evercore.
<Q - Brad G. Ball>: Thanks. Actually I have a question for Steve and for Rich. So, Steve, the $9.8 billion [ph] pre-pre
(23:03) that you guided to, you talked about $630 million of BBY revenues lost and it's the same, I guess, roughly $600
million of expense savings. What is the main difference going from $10 billion in 2013 down to $9.8 billion in 2014?
And then for Rich, in terms of the outlook for potential card growth in the second half of this year, what areas do you
see that growth likely coming in? Are you still focused on prime, the high-end of prime? Or might you go to the
lower-end of prime? And what are the implications for the card revenue margin? Are you thinking the card revenue
margin will hold in here around the 17% range? Thanks.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah, at least with respect to forecasts, I think we've kind of gone out as far as we're
prepared to go in terms of precision. We gave forecasts in 2013 and kudos to the team for how close we actually came
to those forecasts from 12 months ago. And there's obviously a lot of puts and takes but we wanted to center around the
pre-provision, as you've mentioned. And like last year, there were some trade-offs. There could be in the coming year
as well. So I think we've probably been as definitive as we want to be with respect to line items.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Brad, the card growth is – we're getting traction pretty much in all the areas we're
investing. And so – and, again, the heavy spender transactor space and the revolver space excluding the kind of high
balance revolver, it's pretty much across the ranges there where we are continuing to get traction. So I think the nature
of our growth will be kind of similar to the kind of mix of growth that we sort of generally have gotten at Capital One.
And so I don't think there will be an outsized impact on the revenue margin from the increased traction that we're
seeing on the card side.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.

<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Great. Thanks. Rich and Steve, just following up on the PPNR guidance, I guess. You've told us
the implications on revenue. You've given us a good sense on cost. And I look on slide 10, it says, one of the things that
you're focused on is improving profitability. So I guess the two pieces there are we could have growth, which clearly
you've pointed to in the back half of the year but credit could also get better. And I guess outside of the 35 basis point
increase, do you think we could see credit continue to get better from the current levels? And my follow up question is,
just in terms of the capital with the Fed modeling your balance sheet, you said they're going to assume 2% growth, how
much capital volatility relative to your past expectations would that create for you? Thanks.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Okay. So, on the – with your question with respect to credit, could credit get better from
here? We keep saying that we're at cycle lows and it's quite extraordinary on the consumer side of the business and
certainly let's really focus on credit cards here where I think probably your question was particularly directed. It's just
when you really look at why credit is so good, it's just sort of hard to imagine getting too much better from here. But on
the other hand, I think in many ways if you strip away the sort of – if you adjust for seasonality effects and HSBC
temporary effects, there was a slightly better than sort of seasonal effect we saw in the fourth quarter on the
delinquency side. I really wouldn't read too much into that.
I think what I would take away from all that we observed is that the prospect for really good credit looks very good. I
wouldn't really trumpet the upside benefits from here but what I really like is how solid the prospects are for very
strong credit at the kind of best part of the credit cycle here.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: So I don't want to pick out individual pieces of what the Fed is doing and try and isolate
what that impact alone could be because as we've talked with you over time, they're estimating PPNR, they're
estimating losses, they're estimating balance sheet. To try and help you out a little bit more, though, in the release that
they had, they talked about average loan growth that they saw under stress of 1% to 2%. In contrast, if you look at the
average bank in the 2013 CCAR, I think the loan decline that they modeled was around 8%. And as you know, we're
not the average bank given our higher concentration in consumer. So you would see naturally more attrition in our
loans.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
And that will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question about your commercial loan
yields. Unlike the rest of the portfolio, and I appreciate there were one-time items in that, the yield on the commercial
portfolio continues to rise. Can you give us a little color as to what's driving that and what your expectations might be
for 2013 yield in the Commercial Banking portfolio?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: So, Matt, quarterly loan yields, as you know, they're up five basis points and it's driven
by seasonally high originations of equipment leases that earned higher tax equivalent yields so there's depreciation
benefits of certain leases. They're recognized as an increase in yield. There was a similar seasonal increase in yields in
the fourth quarter of 2012. This increase is temporary because tax equivalent yields normalize after the fourth quarter.
Looking at the longer-term trends, rather than the temporary fourth quarter increase is a better indicator of the trend in
loan yields, and year-over-year loan yields decreased by 23 basis points and that's driven by a few factors. Obviously,
there's – competition out there is pretty heavy in certain parts of the marketplace, a little less so in the specialty areas
where we have most of our growth but still there's increasing competition.
Also, we are shifting our portfolio toward floating rate loans on an increasing sort of trend there. And then finally,
we're focusing our new originations on loans with higher credit quality within the commercial real estate space. There's
been – even if we look at some of the projected losses of the new originations, they're even lower than recent
originations. And so there's a bit of a credit offset relative to the tighter yields there. So, that's pretty much the picture

on loan yields.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please. I'm sorry, Matt. Do you have a follow up?
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Yeah. I just wanted to ask that you've mentioned run-off a couple of times. Have you updated
your estimates for what the mortgage portfolio and card portfolio run-off will be in 2014?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah, $4 billion in mortgage, $1 billion in card.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: And then presumably that's done by – the card is done by 2015?

<Q - Brian D Foran>: Hi. Good evening. I was wondering if I could ask about the capital ratios you gave us and
specifically as we look out over the next couple years, stress test this year, clearly you're guiding to the standardized
ratio being the key one. Is it still the key one next year? To what point, would you kind of expect to flip to the advanced
ratio? And also within that, is it a given that the advanced ratio versus standardized ratio gap always stays this big? Or
over time can that roughly 300 basis point difference kind of shrink?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: So I think we'll be primarily under-standardized at least until 2016. We're relatively early
in the parallel run process. And as you've seen I think with a lot of peers who are in parallel run and maybe someone
will emerge at some point in time, there's an opportunity to incorporate that into the way that the business actually
operates. So I think while I wouldn't count on it, convergence is a definite possibility.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

Certainly. The next question will come from Jason Arnold with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Jason Arnold>: Hi. Good evening. I was just wondering if you could update us on the competitive environment
perhaps both in auto and card please.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Okay. Sure, Jason. So, in the card business, competition, it's really pretty stable. You've
seen industry – just in terms of the balances and originations, you've seen them down significantly from the peak,
slightly ahead of 2012. But in general in the last few quarters, we've seen industry balances kind of with 0%
year-over-year growth. So things aren't going anywhere fast overall in that space. The direct mail volumes for 2013
were higher than 2012 but only modestly and far from the pre-recession highs. But the significant decline we've seen in
direct mail volumes has been partially offset competitively by a sizable increase in digital marketing volume. So,
unfortunately as we all use that index of direct mail volumes, let's just realize that it probably understates – the trends
understate competitive effects because of the digital trends.
But all of that said, still we see stability on the pricing side and really most aspects of the competitive environment.
Long-term pricing is rational in segments that we compete in. And the high balance revolver space, where we see very
long teasers, and we don't believe that the pricing there is to our own projections resilient enough, but in the rest of the
business I think it's competitive but pretty stable.
And the rewards space is intensely competitive, as we know, but I think it's kind of stable within the context of being
intensely competitive. But, overall, pulling way up in card, I think it's a fairly rational market that offers the opportunity

for us to generate exceptional returns in growth and to grow in the segments where we are choosing to compete. So we
feel good about that. And frankly, when I cross calibrate to some of the intensity that you see across all of banking, I
think general – regular old sort of vanilla C&I lending I think is certainly that a lot of banks are just rushing into that.
You have quite a run in the auto business as well. I think the card business stands out in a stable place and one that the
survivors in that business can, I think, do well on a stable basis.
In the auto business, we had this phenomenon, Jason, of kind of once-in-a-lifetime set of conditions that existed
competitively in the auto business where a lot of competitors ran for the hills. As the consumer became extremely
cautious, the consumer continued to – you had the consumer being very cautious but continuing to, of all things, be
sure to pay on their auto loans kind of thing. And then finally on the manufacturing side, we had so much reduction in
supply. So what's happened competitively in the auto business is just a regression back toward the mean from a
once-in-a-lifetime kind of situation.
The thing [ph] that most people (37:22) look at competitively is really what's happening in underwriting and in pricing.
So if I divide between the prime and subprime business in margins, on the prime side, they're challenged at this point.
I'd say a little bit below cycle average at this point, and frankly they're at pre-recession levels. In subprime, they're
healthy but slowly falling toward the mean.
LTVs that we really have to keep an eye on are stable and healthy in prime. They're starting to increase moderately in
subprime. That's a slight change from last time. We talked about this. But well below peak levels still at this point.
FICO scores in both segments are stable. And the terms of loans, there's been some sizable growth of beyond 72-month
loans in both prime and even subprime. Overall, prime has intense competition and is overall competitively a little bit
below the kind of equilibrium in the cycle. And in the subprime, it is above, in a better place than the equilibrium but
moving toward that equilibrium.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
Certainly. Our next question will come from Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Scott J. Valentin>: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just with regard to costs overall, the banking
industry is facing revenue challenges and looking to cut costs to kind of offset that. Just wondering, I know you have
the built-in merger-related costs that go away in 2014 but just wondering what other cost-cutting opportunities you see
out there?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Okay. I think the biggest areas for cost management are in digital and in third-party
management. Digital is one we're going to be talking about for years and years and years. And the opportunity is – but
it's a subtle and complex one. And by the way, all the work we do in digital isn't first and foremost motivated by cost
savings. I think it's a bit of a fool's errand and really off the bull's eye to chase digital for the sake of cost reduction. But
it is a byproduct of a transformation of a company and very significant things can come from that.
So, with respect to digital, how do we generate cost savings? What we need to do is build the capability to offer a great
customer experience to our customers. And there's a lot of work for all banks to do that and we're making a lot of
progress in that. When one does that? It's only the beginning of the journey because when you build it, they won't
necessarily come. So there's a huge effort to drive customers to digital as well. And we have very comprehensive kind
of campaigns with respect to that and building deeper digital relationships with the customers as we do that.
Then additionally, we need to make digital how we do business, not only with our customers, but also how we operate
the company. So the back-office, basically, the way we do business and most importantly of all is who we are and how
we think about the business. And in the same way – I really want to point out, in the same way that we built an
information-based company over these past 20 years, this is a lot different from just getting some smart analysts and
some databases and appending it on the side of the company, really becoming an information company becomes in the
end really making that who you are. We have set our beacon with respect to digital that aggressively to say in a sense

that is our destination of who we are, the type of talent we have, and so on. So there's a lot of years in that but I think
there's a lot of economics as a byproduct of that that come.
The other area I really want to kind of highlight is third-party management. Well over half of our operating costs at
Capital One are actually things that we pay to third-party vendors and there's a lot of work going on comprehensively
with respect to the talent side and the governance side and the negotiating side and the whole way that we – and even
in-sourcing a bunch of this stuff to drive better quality and, frankly, significant savings out of that. None of this will
transform any year's kind of metrics but our year-after-year emphasis on cost is one that goes far beyond we'll just try
to see what we can cut today. This is really comprehensively trying to redesign how we run the business.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

And the next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks. So, could you give us some idea as to what we could look at from an
external standpoint to judge kind of the effectiveness of the marketing? I mean, we sort of don't know that much about
accounts. Could you just talk about what we should be looking for?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Well, Moshe, I think that – let me first of all talk about how we look at it because I can
appreciate that there's no one single metric that you can look at that has a direct link. There are a number of ones that
are very important over time. The most important thing to us is the creation of value. So what we do, as you know,
Moshe, in everything that we do before, during and after we do it, we measure the net present value of every initiative
to generate more business, either be it something with existing accounts or the origination of new accounts.
And when we look at our net present value per – total projected net present value created in a year of originations, what
we're projecting sort of these days is as high as I've seen in total over – you'd have to go back a long time to see
numbers quite as high as this. Now I mean they're not going to massively show up in metrics tomorrow. A lot of what
we're originating is, frankly, things that build value in the long-term that have lower attrition, low credit losses, and
build balances over time.
But where you see in the metrics, though, now back to more of the metrics that you see, Moshe, on the purchase
volume side, you can see can see quite a bit of traction there. We try to give you the branded card purchase volumes, so
that it can be separated from the private label side of things. If you look beyond that and actually look at the heavy
spender part of our portfolio, we're getting more traction than manifested just on that particular metric.
You've also seen that despite the significant run-off portfolio, we're talking now about outstandings growth
year-over-year, quarterly outstandings growth returning somewhere in the second half of next year. So we're starting to
pick up more traction on the outstandings. But again, relative to some other competitors and relative to some of the
older days in Capital One, most of what we're booking is not stuff that is heavily balance-intensive. It's really stuff that
is more long-term value and slower balance build over time. But – hopefully, that's a bit helpful but that's how we view
it.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question.

And the next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. I have a question and then just a follow up. My question is, with respect
to your representation in warranty reserve, you have one of the lower reserves relative to outstanding UPB. So I'm just
wondering how you're thinking about that in light of some of the settlements we've seen and if there's been any increase
in your possible loss above current reserves expectation? And then I have a follow up on the Basel III issue.

<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: I don't know that you can look at UPB as an indicator of – and do that as a ratio. I don't
think anybody's done that of what your potential exposure is. There's so many categorizations under that that are
important and I think we've done actually a really nice job in our disclosure, which I always point to whenever anybody
wants to talk about rep and warranty kind of taking you through all of the factors which drive kind of where we are and
what our reserves are and what the principal factors are which could amount to changes going forward.
So I don't think just a simple calculation of UPB to exposures is really the way to look at it. This continues to be a
source of uncertainty for us and other companies on the mortgage front and we've tried to keep that front and center.
There weren't a lot of changes quarter-over-quarter for us in our numbers. And obviously a big part of what we try and
do in thinking about rep and warranty is making sure we incorporate other things that we see in the marketplace to
make sure that that drives the assumptions we're making with respect to our exposure going forward.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks, Steve. And then just to follow up on the Basel III issue, what accounts for such a
significant difference in the RWAs between the standardized and advanced approach? Because it seems like the biggest
differential for a lot of institutions is the risk-weighting on commercial loans but that's such a small part of your loan
balances broadly. So what's accounting for the difference?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: I think that securitized assets are the biggest difference in terms of RWA. You have a
different treatment under Basel standardized. It's fairly punitive for the industry relative to the plain Basel I calculation.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question comes from Daniel Furtado with Jefferies & Company.
<Q - Daniel L. Furtado>: Good evening. Thank you for the opportunity. I have two I guess you would call them
follow up questions. The first is, earlier you said that you expected card growth would come from where it has always
come from but over the last couple of years we've noticed that you, like many in the industry, have gone substantially
up-market in terms of FICO exposure. So when you say it comes from where it always has, should we think over the
last couple years or roll back even further than that?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Daniel, our profile of originations has – the span of FICO has stayed pretty consistent
over the years. We haven't denominated our conversation so much by FICO score as much by the nature of how much
the customer is borrowing and some of the things we talk about with respect to high balance revolvers. So while, yes,
you've seen a big effort to penetrate at the top end of the market by Capital One with some of the things you've even
seen on TV and our Quicksilver card and Venture card and so on, we continue very consistently to market across the
FICO ranges that we have over the past. I think there's a little tightening that we've done over the years but our strategy
has stayed pretty consistent. What we were doing pre-recession is pretty consistent to what we're doing now.
<Q - Daniel L. Furtado>: The follow up would be, you had mentioned that you feel like we're past the cyclical low
point for auto credit. I understand that we may or may not necessarily be at the cyclical low for credit cards. And is the
simple reason because the equilibrium that you talked about earlier getting a little bit, I don't want to say overheated but
slightly out of balance in the auto space? Or how should we think about the, in essence, mismatch in the cycle low
point for auto and card? Thank you.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah, thank you, Daniel. You know, sometimes I think that auto may just be the first
mover. I think auto was the first mover before the Great Recession and maybe it's the first mover on the other side of
this. I don't know. That may be coincidental. I think the conditions in auto were – what happened during the Great
Recession in the competitive environment and the underwriting environment was a little bit more extreme in auto. And
as a result, the auto performance in the wake of the Great Recession was unusually strong, which caused a lot of
players to rush in and a lot of players to start changing some of their underwriting standards along the way. And so
that's led to a more dramatic reduction in losses and probably an earlier turnaround.

I would describe what happened in the card business is that, while everyone tightened up in the card business, there has
been a consistency and a rationality in this marketplace, I think overall every company has kind of gone back, looked
through the debris of the Great Recession and kind of picked their spots but it's been pretty stable, pretty rational. And
the bigger issue there has been sort of waiting for more demand to kind of pick up. And the lack of demand in that
marketplace was – the flipside of that is the just the conservative consumer. And I think the conservative consumer,
conservative banks, and a stable environment have just led to exceptional credit that persists to this day and is likely to
persist in card for some time.
