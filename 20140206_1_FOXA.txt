Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call such as segment operating income before
depreciation and amortization, often referred to as EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share, are expressed on a
non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings
release.
Also note that the historical results for periods prior to June 28, 2013, described in the press release and on this call
have been adjusted to reflect the separation that was completed at the end of fiscal 2013.
And with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to John.
John P. Nallen
Thanks, Reed, and good morning, everyone. As you will have seen in today's earnings release, our financial results
continue to reflect strong top-line revenue growth. We reported second quarter fiscal 2014 revenues for the total
company of $8.2 billion, which is up 15% compared to the second quarter a year ago. Approximately 40% of this
growth is organic with the balance reflecting the inclusion of revenues from our newly consolidated businesses namely
Sky Deutschland and our required cable sports channels.
Total segment EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.54 billion, a 4% reduction compared to the $1.61 billion reported
a year ago. This year's results reflect solid underlying cable channel growth, continued strength in retransmission
consent revenues and a strong TV production performance. These increases were more than offset by lower
contributions from our film business and weaker ratings for The X Factor, as well as the impact of the investments in
our new cable channels and the consolidation of Sky Deutschland's EBITDA losses. In aggregate, the impact of
acquisitions and new channel launches reduced our reported EBITDA growth by approximately 6%. Additionally,
unfavorable foreign exchange movements reduced the growth by a further 1%.
From a bottom-line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $982
million as compared to the $1.06 billion reported in the second quarter a year ago. Excluding the net income effects in
both years of amounts reflected in other net and our gains from participating in BSkyB share repurchase program,
second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.33 this year versus $0.35 in the prior year.
Now, let me provide some additional context on the performance of a few of our businesses, and let's start with the
Cable Networks. Overall, total segment revenues in the second quarter increased 14% from last year, highlighted by a
17% increase in affiliate revenues and 7% advertising growth. The 17% affiliate revenue growth was led by higher
rates across our channels. Domestic affiliate fees increased 15% primarily from higher average rates led by the RSN's
FX and Fox News, as well as our new channels, FS1 and FXX. Increased revenues related to the impact of last year's
NHL lockout and the inclusion of SportsTime Ohio also contributed to the growth.
Our reported international affiliate fees were up 22%. Within this overall increase, affiliate fees at the non-sports
channels at FIC and STAR, grew 16% in local currency terms. The balance of the affiliate fee increase was from the
international sports channel, which was partially offset by unfavorable currency movements.
Second quarter advertising revenue growth reflects domestic advertising increases of 7%, led by double-digit gains at
the FX channels and the RSNs, which were partially offset by political related advertising declines at Fox News. At the
international channels, advertising revenue increased 9%. Within this overall increase, local currency advertising at the
FIC and STAR non-sports channels grew at the same 9% rate. The increase generated by our sports channels was offset
by the overall negative impact of foreign currency.
So total Cable segment EBITDA in the quarter was $1.04 billion, a 2% increase above prior year levels. Similar to our
first quarter results, this quarter's strong underlying EBITDA growth generated by the RSNs, FX and Fox International
Channels was largely absorbed by the impact of the planned investments in our new channel launches and the impact of
unfavorable foreign currency comparisons. Combined, the new channels and currency negatively impacted the
year-on-year Cable segment growth by 10%, with the new channel launches alone representing a 7% impact to our

growth.
Turning to our Television segment, EBITDA in the quarter of $218 million declined $27 million from last year. We
had strong growth in retransmission consent revenues and improved network sports results led by the revenue increases
from solid ratings for the NFL regular season and the MLB post-season. These improvements were more than offset by
substantially reduced political revenues at the stations, weaker X Factor ratings and higher programming and marketing
costs at the Fox Network in support of our initiative to invest in the network.
At the Film segment, second quarter EBITDA was $337 million, down 21% from a year ago. This decline primarily
reflects lower theatrical revenues and higher releasing costs for this year's films including The Secret Life of Walter
Mitty, Walking with Dinosaurs and The Counselor, as well as difficult comparisons to last year's results which included
the theatrical release of Taken 2 and the home entertainment release of Ice Age: Continental Drift.
Revenues and EBITDA contributions at our television production units were up year-over-year primarily due to this
year's domestic syndication of Modern Family and higher SVOD revenues.
Our DBS segment reported EBITDA of $30 million in the quarter as compared to $55 million in the prior year. This
decrease reflects the consolidation of Sky Deutschland's negative EBITDA results, which more than offset a $25
million improvement in Sky Italia contributions, primarily from marketing and operating cost reductions.
Total revenues at the DBS segment increased by $605 million principally from the inclusion of $565 million in Sky
Deutschland revenue. Sky D this morning reported ARPU gains of 5.5% and a year-over-year direct subscriber increase
of 304,000 yielding 3.67 million subs at quarter end. At Sky Italia, local currency revenues in the quarter were similar
to a year ago as a slight ARPU increase was offset by lower average subs for the period. Quarter end subscribers of
4.76 million were unchanged from the end of September.
Now, before I turn to guidance, let me give you a quick update on our buyback activity and the delisting process. Since
the date of the separation, we've been consistently repurchasing Fox A shares resulting in approximately $2.3 billion of
repurchases from July 1 through yesterday. So we are on track to complete the $4 billion buyback within the 12-month
timeframe we previously announced.
Additionally, in the beginning of January, we announced our plans to delist from the Australian Stock Exchange.
Yesterday, we filed a definitive proxy statement with the SEC that includes detailed information about the delisting
process and key dates. If approved, the effective date of the suspension in trading on the ASX will occur at the close of
trading on May 1.
Finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2014 total segment EBITDA growth. Since our last earnings call three
months ago, we have updated our operational assumptions to reflect our first half performance and our outlook for the
remainder of our fiscal year. And while we have the usual pluses and minuses across most of our divisions that
essentially offset we are lowering our outlook in two areas. First, our Film division's results for the first six months
have been below our plans including the impact of our three theatrical film releases in the December quarter and this
will impact our full year outlook.
Second, primetime ratings and therefore, advertising revenues will be lower than anticipated at the Fox broadcast
network largely due to the mix performance of our shows led by the lower than planned ratings on The X Factor and
the early results of American Idol. Therefore, these network advertising revenue factors will also impact our full year
outlook.
So primarily as a result of these film and network factors and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our
projections, we now expect that our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2014 will be in the mid to
high-single-digit range, above the $6.26 billion total segment EBITDA base level of fiscal 2013.
This outlook does not reflect the impact of consolidating the YES Network results, although this factor would not
materially impact the 2014 growth rate. If that transaction closes when expected, we will consolidate the YES Network
results beginning in our fiscal fourth quarter, including approximately $1.7 billion of their debt.

As we look out to our expected performance for the second half of the year, we anticipate that a majority of our overall
annual growth will be realized in the fourth fiscal quarter, as we expect very favorable film comparisons led by this
year's comparatively stronger releases, including Rio 2 and X-Men: Days of Future Past. Additionally, results of the
Cable segment are expected to be strong, driven by continued top-line growth and a more moderate increase in costs,
principally from sports rights.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Chase.
Charles G. Carey
Thank you, John, and good morning, everybody. This may sound like an unexpected opening line after John just took
our guidance down a notch, but we've never been more excited about the future of 21st Century Fox, and let me be
clear that I'm not minimizing our disappointment in the adjusted guidance. However, that disappointment does not
distract from the momentum that exists across our company and the confidence in our ability to achieve the overall
three-year goals we outlined last August.
Structurally and strategically, we've never been stronger and better positioned. We continue to build a foundation that
will enable us to deliver sustained long-term growth. At our cable channels, that foundation begins with long-term
affiliation agreements that drive stable top-line growth and provide the base to build new channels like FOX Sports 1,
FXX and our new sports international channels. We continue to conclude agreements around the world that meet or
exceed our targets for both existing and new channels, which reflect our global strength. In the last few months, we
concluded such agreements with two of the top 10 U.S. distributors as well as leading distributors in Latin America and
Asia.
We also continue to take advantage of opportunities to add new dimensions to our cable business. Last month, we
agreed to increase our ownership in YES to 80% and we've recently rebranded multiple channels in Latin America and
Europe, building a global lifestyle brand called Fox Life, which creates an additional international tent-pole brand to go
with Fox, FOX Sports and National Geographic.
Another foundation to drive our long-term growth is our unique brands' content and long-term rights that distinguish
our business. Our U.S. channels continue to maximize these strengths and build on their market leadership positions. At
FX, American Horror Story had a great run with its best ratings ever while Sons of Anarchy finished its season as the
highest rated series in FX history. We also look forward to FX's launch of season two of The Americans later this
month and the premiere of new series like Tyrant from the creators of Homeland and The Strain, both of which will
premiere this summer.
Our RSNs continue to deliver on-target results and we're well positioned in the rights discussions. Fox News is as
dominant a ratings force as ever, although headwinds in the ad markets during this off-political cycle have been tougher
than expected, leading to results that are up year-on-year but behind our targets. Fortunately, we're headed back into
another political cycle and recent programming moves are delivering even stronger ratings. At Fox Business, we're
excited to welcome Maria Bartiromo and look forward to ongoing growth in profits with new and improved
distribution agreements on top of ongoing improvements at the channel.
We're still investing in building FOX Sports 1 and FXX while going through some of the growing pains of building a
program lineup, but those channels are on course and will be a source of new profits for years to come.
An issue that has been a topic of recent debate is the impact of consolidation in the U.S. distribution industry. We
honestly don't see any material consequences to our business; in fact, there may be some positive ones. First, unique
content and scale in an expanding digital world has never held a stronger hand. Second, new digital platforms in
over-the-top players may grow even more quickly with a consolidated distribution industry. Furthermore, the real issue
is how many choices an individual home has, not how big is the distributor. We already deal successfully with large
distributors. Cable consolidation will not change the number of choices. Consumer choice is actually likely to increase,
not decrease, as over-the-top digital platforms emerge.

Finally, consolidation may spur innovation and improve customer experience, and new technologies like targeted ads
as well as other enhancements that enlarge the pie for everyone.
Turning back to our channels business, another foundation for our long-term growth is our international leadership
position. Although we expect that the continued weakening of emerging market currencies will adversely impact this
year's cable results by an additional $50 million to $75 million from what we assumed at the start of the fiscal year, our
operational progress internationally, including at both Fox International Channels and STAR, continues to be a story of
across-the-board strength while adding new dimensions to the business. STAR recently launched the STAR Sports
brand across its six sports channels including STAR Sports 3, India's first 24/7 Hindi sports channel and the digital
sites, starsports.com, substantially increasing the reach of sports and establishing a new foundation for growth in India.
While the related investments are stemming our short-term profit, this initiative should prove to be one of our largest
drivers of growth 5 and 10 years from now.
On the broadcast side of our channels business, we've had mixed results. Sports have been a positive, particularly the
NFL, capped by Sunday Super Bowl delivering TV's largest audience ever. Retransmission is also an ongoing source of
growth and we continue to conclude agreements at or above our targets.
The one area that is delivering results significantly below expectations is the entertainment network. While we had
success with new series, Sleepy Hollow and Golden Globe winner Brooklyn Nine-Nine, the combination of
disappointing ratings from X Factor, larger programming write-offs than planned and a bit of extra programming and
marketing costs leave us well behind our goal. We also expect American Idol, which is a much better show than it was
a year ago to deliver results below our targets.
While these results are disappointing, we are quite bullish about the direction of the network as we break away from
decades-old antiquated rules of broadcasting where 100 scripts in the fall become 20 pilots in the spring, leading to
dozens of series being launched that September with each plan to deliver 22 episodes before the cycle begins again.
During the coming months, our new strategy for the network will start to evolve with events like 24 and Cosmos as
well as new series like Gracepoint and Hieroglyph, all launched at different times of the year, different series lengths,
and new programs ordered without pilots that go straight to series. We'll still rely on some of the historical industry
practices where it makes sense. However, we can't be bound by rules established in a three-network world. We need to
execute with an opportunistic agility to maximize its value. Our broadcast network is the strongest distribution platform
in the business and this new direction will enable us to build it to its full potential.
Our content business is also one with mixed results. Television studio continues to be a powerhouse with 43 scripted
shows on broadcast and cable this season and 17 new pilots for next season. We're more excited than ever about the
increasingly robust digital market for our product. We just concluded a new agreement with Amazon granting
exclusive SVOD rights to FX's hit show The Americans as well as SVOD distribution rights to other new and library
series. More details will come from Amazon later today on that.
On the flip side, our film company has had a difficult first half of the year. I don't want to try and put a silver lining on
the results, we're disappointed. However, this business will always have its ups and downs and we are energized about
a number of key releases over the next six months, including Rio 2, X-Men: Days of Future Past, and Dawn of the
Planet of the Apes. These results won't have a big impact on fiscal 2014 due to timing, but we're optimistic that they
will provide a great start to next fiscal year.
Finally, our satellite platforms in the U.K., Germany, Italy, and India continue to operate well and build on their
leadership positions. We're pleased with the recent subscriber additions at BSkyB and Sky Deutschland and have
stabilized subscriber levels and profits in Italy.
So in aggregate, while we have some businesses that aren't delivering plan short-term results, we feel good about the
strategy and direction of all our operations. Overall, we have solid momentum, which gives us confidence in achieving
our long-term targets.
With that, I'll turn it back to Reed.

Reed Nolte
Thank you, Chase. Steve, now, we'd like to move on to the Q&A part.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mike Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: Thanks so much. I have one to John, and then one for Chase and James. John, can you just
spend some time on Cable Networks? Expenses are up 22% in the first half. I wonder when we look at this fiscal year,
what you expect expense growth will be for cable nets for the year. Maybe you could separate the growth rates for the
year between domestic, international on expenses?
<A - John P. Nallen>: I'm not sure that I look at it that way, Michael, but I think the growth rate will be consistent as
we go through it on the sports side, internationally, it's probably consistent growth rate in expense as we go through. On
the U.S. side, the growth rate will moderate a bit in the fourth quarter, as I indicated, because the sports rights costs
particularly at FS1 are not as significant as they were or will be in the first three quarters. So there'll be a slight
moderation in the fourth quarter, but I think the increase will be fairly consistent for the first three quarters of the year.
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: Okay. And then for Chase and James, you talked a bit, Chase, about changes in the
broadcast model. One of the things we hear a lot about his VoD. And because you guys are on the network and studio,
there seems to be tension about VoD rights in terms of giving people MVPD stacking rights for the whole season. So
how do you feel about possibly changing the model to give full season stacking rights versus what it does to the back
end value of syndications or how are you guys feeling about that change to the model?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: There's no question that increasingly the value of these rights extends beyond the linear
networks and into the VoD world. And I think each of those businesses, which is what we're doing needs to pursue a
strategy that makes sense for them. So I think for our networks that's capturing and controlling a wider set of rights so
that they're able to deliver an experience to their consumers that enables people to watch what they want, when they
want, where they want. I think in order to do that, the networks have to be aggressive about controlling and negotiating
the rights they need. Negotiating those rights with our studio is really not that different than negotiating rights with
third parties. I think equally on the studio, on the content side, we recognize those rights add value and we expect the
content side to extract value for its rights in the marketplace.
So, yeah, I think owning both sides enables us to have a strategic understanding of sort of the business as a whole, but I
think the execution of that really comes down to each individual business pursuing what makes sense for it
strategically, which on the network side is controlling a wider set of rights in a digital world. On the studio side, it's
extracting appropriate value for its rights from distributors. I think we have the benefit of visibility to both sides of that
and hopefully make smart decisions about how much we'll invest in the networks to control those rights on the one
hand, and ensuring on the content side we're extracting fair and full value for those rights. So I think it has the benefit
of strategic understanding of those, but the actual execution really comes down to both businesses making smart
decisions.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of John Janedis of UBS. Please go ahead.

investments on scripted programming relative to prior expectations?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: I think Chase will probably address -
<A - John P. Nallen>: No. I don't think – I mean I think you're looking great shows, and clearly the scripted
entertainment area for us, both the studio and the network, as I said, this year we have two new shows we feel great
about, Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Sleepy Hollow. So certainly that's a great area for us, but equally we've had great
success over the years with non-scripted entertainment. And actually we have some – we just brought new executive in
place to energize that area, and actually he's got some great things coming later in the year. Look, I think it's important
for us to continue to be opportunistic and open-minded, and in some ways continue to try to find new programming in
whatever format that excites people and energizes people. And we think there are opportunities across the board. And I
don't – I think you just got to – we got to continue to really try and find and build that next hit franchise, whether it's
scripted or non-scripted. But we certainly expect to be aggressive in both sides of it.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, John. Okay. Next question, please?
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks a lot. Just wondering if the change in guidance has any bearing on your longer
term guidance targets, if you could just talk about that $9 billion EBITDA number? And then, Chase, would just love
an update on your thoughts on Aereo as we go into Supreme Court ruling in June, July. Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Sure. No. It's really doesn't. That's what I said up-front. I think structurally, we feel good
about where we're at. And, again, I don't – I want to be clear that I'm not trying to just gloss over the challenges we've
got. They're really in a couple businesses. In the film business, it is a business that has ups and downs. We feel good
about the films we've got coming as we look forward, but it's not a structural issue. The film business is still, look,
we've got a great management team that has proven its capability to be a market leader for years. It is a business that,
again, has some ups and downs and the network as well.
I think they're doing some really exciting things. And as I look out on the shows I touched on coming, we feel great
about where it's going. So I don't – for us, there are challenges we've got this year. We take them seriously, but when I
look at the structural underpinning of what gets us to that $9 billion target, those structural underpinnings are there and
we continue to execute on them. We continue to conclude distribution agreements that enable us to get there. We
continue to build the array of business platforms, channels, really are putting the fundamentals in place that are
important to reach those goals.
Our new channels, while we're investing in them, the investments in FXX and FS1 are pretty much on target with what
we expected to invest. So there's an investment going into it, but we're still very excited about the future of those
businesses. So as we look out, the fundamentals are really still in place. We need to execute better in a couple
businesses and that's really the core of what we're dealing with here.
On Aereo, it is headed to the Supreme Court in the next six months. I think we're cautiously optimistic that, that will
hopefully bring up an end to deliberate illegal theft of our content. I do want to be clear, because you hear a lot about
this. This case is about respecting copyrights, not about cloud computing.
You hear a lot of scaremongering that this case threatens cloud computing, nothing could be further from the truth. Our
content gets sold by Amazon, iTunes, others today that use cloud technology. We're a big fan and supporter of cloud
technology. It simply needs to be done in a way that respects our copyrights and we will pursue our rights. Right now,
we're pursuing it legally, we'll pursue them through the paths we've described before. But at the end of the day, we need
to – our business needs to have a dual-revenue model and it needs to be in a place that we could be competitive in the
marketplace and hopefully we can get those rights reaffirmed through this process.

<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thanks. Chase, do you think there's anything going on with cable news beyond just the
normal news cycle? I just ask because it's really across all cable news networks. We've seen weak ratings and I think
disappointing advertising. And then, James, could you talk about Sky Deutschland and the outlook there? They had a
really bullish print today and outlook, but Netflix is coming to Germany, the market seems to be a bit spooked about
what that could mean. How do you think that business is positioned in the face of a historically price-sensitive German
consumer and an over-the-top new entrant?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: For us and Fox News, realistically, no. Last year, they had – the end of last year, they had to
deal with the off-political cycle, and there's no question that the year-on-year comparisons were tough for a
non-political year against political spending from the year before. But actually, the news networks are doing great. I
mean, I think its ratings in January are up year-on-year and I think I said in the last call we made a series of changes
that are actually in the morning show with new talent. We reorganized the primetime lineup, I think Roger introduced a
little while ago, The Five at 5 o'clock, which has been a great addition to the lineup. I think put new energy in it, I think
the audience is actually – versus what it was recently, for January, it's younger and bigger.
So for us, we feel pretty good about where we're at, and again, we have to fight through the cyclicality of political
spending, which gets bigger and bigger, many people chagrin in other arenas, but becomes a bigger factor that creates
cyclicality here. But for us, Fox News is realistically just a locomotive that keeps going, and side-by-side with that, I do
think Fox Business is really beginning to hit its stride. I think some great moves, I think Maria Bartiromo is going to
add a great dimension to it. We continue to strengthen distribution agreements to Fox Business, and I think that channel
really has an increasingly exciting future as it really begins to carve out its space with the distribution platform finally
fully in place, and I think a lot of the moves Roger has made in the lineup are starting to get some traction.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: And, Ben, just on Germany, I think – I mean obviously Brian and the team reported
results earlier today, or I guess very early this morning our time, and so I don't want to add too much to that. But, look,
I'd say it's a very competitive marketplace, it's a marketplace that traditionally we've been competing with free satellite
channels as well as in cable and IPTV services, but I think Sky Deutschland's positioned really, really well. I think the
brand is increasingly established in a marketplace just only after a few short years, the quality of the product is very
high, and really Sky Deutschland's positioning where it's available over any infrastructure, be it cable, IPTV or satellite
as well as the very, very successful Sky Go, TV Everywhere products and now the new standalone over-the-top
products.
Now, I think the company is positioned well. Look, Germany is a very big market. I think we've shown over the last
two years that you can increase your revenue per customer there and you can attract new customers, which a lot of
people didn't think was possible. And the company has really a momentum to it and is on a trajectory that we think is
very encouraging. So I think it's not a zero-sum game. I think there is a lot of choice in the marketplace already. We
already have Watchever there and other things like that. And it's going to continue to be dynamic and competitive, but
as long as we can keep innovating and keep a good quality product on screen for our customers, I think the company is
going to continue to do well.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?

John or Chase, I think you implied, Chase, the company is still on track for $9 billion of EBITDA in fiscal 2016. Any
help you can give us for the cadence in fiscal 2015 growth versus fiscal 2016 growth given the lower fiscal 2014 base
would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: In terms of the Skys, I think we do think there are truly – there are clearly benefits with the
Skys working together to share technologies, to share many of the – certainly many of the operational fundamentals of
the businesses. They share across them. We went down a path to acquire BSkyB and part of that was a view that there
were values in having those businesses more closely aligned. We're obviously not on that path today. So I think we're
trying to do more and more of that and find ways we can capture the value by having those companies share things
they've learned, share expertise, benefit from each other in win-win ways. And hopefully, we'll continue to try and
exploit that, but I think it's an opportunity. I think we're aware there are opportunities to have those businesses learn
and benefit from each other, and I think we'll continue to try and find ways to tackle that given where we're at today
structurally.
I think in terms of guidance looking at the years – looking through the years, I mean, again, you take one of the two
issues in sort of 2014, if you take the two; one is film, which is sort of and I don't want to completely call it a one-off,
but in many ways it was the result of films released during the last six months. They don't have much of an impact
realistically. The issues that caused the shortfall in the film business in 2014 aren't going to really affect 2015 at all.
2015 will be affected by how our films perform in the next six months, we feel good about them, but the film – the
flow-through of the films we've released to date is a fairly marginal issue in 2015.
I think for the network, in many ways it is again sort of that transition. What we've gone through the network in many
ways was a network that had this unique franchise, American Idol, sort of transcended everything else in television.
And it's gotten to a place today where actually it's a great show, it's a top hit show, we'd love to have the ratings for that
on any other show, but it's not a show that sort of drives the whole network in the way it did in years past. And so we've
been planning that adjustment knowing that the show is 13 years old, hope it has 14, 15, 16, 17 years, but they won't be
years that look like years five, six and seven.
So this transition of the network from having this sort of locomotive that sat there in the middle of it the generated
unique profits, we've known is coming to the end. It's sort of winding down to a place where it becomes just a great
successful show. Again, hopefully, this year, we think it's a much better show hopefully that's traction – gets better
traction as it goes through this season. We think it has the potential. We think they've done a really good job and it's
very entertaining show, but it's going to be a good show. And what's happened is the ratings for that as well as The X
Factor fell faster than we hoped, but directionally, it's not different. We didn't expect those. We haven't been planning
on those to sort of all a sudden have a rebirth. What we hope to do is manage them through this process. So it probably
moves those to a slightly lower base but it really isn't directionally different than what we would have been planning,
which is those shows to be part of the lineup but really part of a broader diversified lineups where increasingly that
we're looking to develop is new hits to take them on.
So again, I don't think it puts the network, maybe a little bit but not really materially in a different place. So I don't
think those two items – films really, I won't say, change our view on 2015 much at all, I think the network probably
marginally and the rest of it, there's some issues that are tougher than we planned like the foreign exchange. We said
we started off the year thinking we had a $100 million hit from foreign exchange and now it's looking certainly well
north of $150 million. So there's some of those issues and those we put – and like John put in the ordinary course up
and down the upside in sports could absorb the hit on foreign exchange and other pros and cons. So I think those give
and takes, we had assumed we can sort of manage through those give and takes. So I don't think it would change our
outlook on 2015 that much again.
2015, we do expect it to be a big bounce up in 2016, and I think that's still true. We're still very much in that build
process. I think we talked about the investment in the new channels and actually said the build is actually – the
investment in the new channels is actually a little higher in 2015 than 2014 and that's been planned and that's sort of
due to the way the sports rights roll in. But again, it's a long-winded answer. If I look at it holistically, I don't think if I
look at 2015 and 2016, we're really in that different a place. Obviously, by end of the year, we'll see, we'll have six

<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Doug. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thank you. One for James and one for Chase. James, now that you control all of STAR
Sports for, I guess, roughly a year, can you just talk about what you've done differently and maybe you can provide
some color about investments still needed and the ultimate growth trajectory for that business? And then, Chase, on
FXX, with The Simpsons coming in August, it just seems like such an amazing branding opportunity, can you talk
about how that show can drive the channel and how quickly you can monetize that?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Jessica. On STAR Sports, I think it's been a really exciting period for us
since being able to take over ESPN share and move with ESPN STAR Sports and that's really been across Asia, really
the creation of a FOX Sports brand in Southeast Asia, East Asia and the STAR Sports suite of channels in India. And
just on START Sports, it's been very exciting. As Chase mentioned, six STAR Sports channels were launched at the –
towards the end of last year. And some of the things that's exciting about it, for example, doing a 24 hour Hindi
language coverage of Indian cricket would seem reasonably obvious and surprising that it hadn't been done before and
that's proving very, very successful.
From an investment perspective, it's a little bit lumpy. As you know, we had some additional ticket rights and
additional [indiscernible] (41:33) last quarter in India. And some of those things will continue to be a little lumpy
[indiscernible] (41:40) and things like that, particularly impacting the STAR Sports business over the next few years.
But we think it adds really a fundamental new dimension to the Indian business. We're a leader there in the general
entertainment category and many, many of regional languages of India and have really built the number one network
across the country. Adding sports to that portfolio, we think is very, very exciting, it gives us a whole new dimension
from the standpoint of affiliate revenue growth and we can really cement our leadership.
So we think it's a real component of getting that business as we've said in the past to the overall STAR business in India
should be a $0.5 billion profit business within a region of a horizon, but this investment in this year and next year and a
bit in the next given some of the rights cost that come through is a big investment, but it's really a testament to our
belief and what we can do in that region, and we think India is a marketplace that's going to be increasingly important
for us and one where we can relate – put even more distance between us and our nearest competitors.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thank you.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: And on FXX, I mean there is no question. Simpsons is a tremendously exciting and
important event and sort of opportunity for us. We do – it is more than a show, I have said it before. In many ways, we
look to use that. When I turn on The Simpsons channel, but in many ways it will be the face of the channel, it will
clearly be much more than just a series taking up a large block of hours. It will be a series that helps brand the channel,
helps drive the channel and we are doing – working really hard on it. We're also really excited that it has really gone up
in many ways the breadth of rights we have there will enable us to do some really unique things in the digital sense. So
it's not just branding the channel from a linear perspective, but really starting to – really create some precedence in
terms of creating a digital experience aligned with that channel that adds a whole new dimension to it.
In terms of monetizing, it's always in the cable – in this world, it's always a little complicated, because you can
monetize through two things: monetize through affiliations and you monetize through advertising. So the affiliation
side is largely tied to, as affiliation agreements come up. I don't have it off hand. I think fortunately we are in a place
and part of it was the timing where a pretty big block of our affiliation agreements in the sort of year plus post, I think
probably half the universe comes up for renewal within a year and change. I don't – again, I look at it, so I don't have
the exact dates off the top of my head from when The Simpsons roll in. So it would be great we can get momentum,

clearly the – monetizing it through the affiliation side is obviously a big part of it. I think from an advertising
perspective, it's going to be – depend on execution. I think FX has proved to be pretty good at sort of distinguishing
themselves from everybody else out there. I think there – I think they are second to none if you stack FX up against the
channels they compete with today. I think they have proven ability to distinguish themselves from the pack, and I think
they – we feel really good about their ability to drive a level of interest into that that we could monetize through
advertising, but we feel really good about it.
But I want to say that. At the end of the day, we're building an asset. I mean the question – I'm much more sort of
focused on where can you get this two to three years and where can you get this to in two quarters? So it is – this is an
opportunity to build a franchise that can be a real tent-pole for new growth in our business. And so I think it is. Yes, we
care about short-term and want to – and do what we can to drive short-term. But building an asset like that and
investing it, it was – I think the real key issues is where can you get that business to in two to three years, not two, three
months.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Jessica. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Richard Greenfield of BTIG. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rich S. Greenfield>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on Michael Nathanson's question.
When you look at a show like The Simpsons, you've actually acquired all of the prior season rights to use for your
application. And so instead of selling that to a Netflix or Amazon, you're keeping all of that for yourself to drive traffic
to your apps. Wondering when you look at shows like The Americans and any of your shows or content you're
creating, why is it not the right decision for Fox to keep those rights in-house to build your own direct-to-consumer
applications versus selling them to third parties? I realize there's a near-term cash infusion from selling them, but why
is The Simpsons decision not the right decision for all of your content as you look forward?
And then just a separate question on Formula One rights, there's a lot of noise about Malone and Discovery possibly
buying them. Is that something – it seems like something would fit very well with Fox globally. Why haven't or is that
something of interest to you?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, so on The Simpsons question, the rights question of why not keep all our rights
in-house. I think it's important. I think if you go back to Michael's question and again I think there is a real benefit to us
being – we believe the vertical integration of our business is the real strength. I think the strength comes from having a
strategic understanding of both sides of that, better insights and ability to make that's where they make sense. But I
think when you get to one-size-fits-all, I think that's – I don't think that's the right way to go. And I think at a more
granular level, you have to sort of look at decisions one level holistically and another level for each individual business
and those businesses have to make bets. And there are times when our distribution businesses have a unique ability to
take advantage of a set of rights. And for us, The Simpsons is the perfect example. We have a new channel that FX can
– that Simpsons could help take to a whole new level. So it made sense for us to probably invest more than anybody
else in The Simpsons because we can monetize it in terms of building a unique asset.
There are going to be other times when somebody else for a piece of content we own has a unique need that will end up
meaning they are going to pay more than its worth to our asset. And to just say we are going to keep it, nonetheless
even if somebody else thinks it's because they have a need worth a lot more than it is to us. I don't think that makes
sense and I think it's important that – and what we are not going to do is undersell the content. We have participants, we
have people in it, it's important that our content gets full and fair value and therefore somebody in the market sees
much more value in that content than we do whether it is because of a need or just because of a belief then there are
places where it makes sense to take advantage of that. Conversely, I think we hopefully have a breadth of assets that we
are increasingly let out, take advantage of assets, I mean example, FIC, Fox International Channels. There are a number
of places where we've taken series and bought out the international rights to shows we had. A unique need, we had a
unique franchise in Fox International Channels to take a show like The Americans, or I can't remember what, they have

done a couple. They bought the global right – global distribution rights to that and used it as a dimension. But it was
really based on the Fox International Channels having unique strategic need and the ability to build the value that
enabled them to make a bet.
But again, there'll be places where third parties will see a value that exceeds what its worth to us and I think that's the
right way to maximize the business. We have the benefit of the visibility to make intelligent decisions. So we think it's
worth making a bet. We obviously have the ability to see the picture holistically and make those bets intelligently, but I
do think you have to look at it from holistically as well as from each individual businesses perspective.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Formula One.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: And then Formula One, yeah, Formula One's a great ride. I mean at the end of the day, they
are buying, I guess, I don't know what's going on in Formula One, I read the same paper you do. We like rights. They
are talking about buying sport. I guess to what degree you can buy sports to get the rights, I mean, I think if you are
buying it, you have to buy because you like the sport. You believe that sport is a good investment. There are a lot of
things that go into the sport, and that Formula One is certainly – TV rights are a big part of it, but there are other big
elements on the revenue side, and obviously it's a big business that requires expertise and management. So I think a
very good business, but I think you'd go into it, if it's for TV rights, I don't think you buy the asset to buy – to get access
to the TV rights. I think you buy it because you think it's good business, and I think TV rights we license in the
marketplace and we obviously have a good relationship with Formula One and hopefully continue to build it, but I
think to the degree there is an investment in Formula One, anybody making that, whether it's us or anybody else, you'd
have to make it on the merits of what you think about Formula One and how good an investment it is and what's the
future of that and -
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: And Rich, it's James here. I just remind everyone we are a broadcaster of Formula
One in almost every region in the world. We are a very large part of Formula One's audience and in many places we
have very long-term rights agreements with Formula 1, and it delivers very well for our customers. We can –
irrespective of whatever speculation is out there in the market, we think that's been a relationship that's great for both
sides and is going to continue.

Our next question will come from the line of David Bank of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Bank>: Okay. Thanks. Chase, I was wondering if you could give us a trajectory to kind of benchmark over
the next 12 months to 36 months for viewership and ratings levels you expect to achieve at FS1. I also wonder if you
could talk about how you see the business mix with respect to affiliate fees and advertising revenue shaking out when
you get closer to maturity three or four years out when your new programming has sort been on for a while, like MLB,
when you have no more speed legacy deals in place, basically at maturity. How do you see the revenue split between
advertising and affiliate?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, hi. First, I don't think we probably would get to that level of granularity on
year-by-year sort of rate increase, that's probably just a level of detail beyond what we sort of put out there publicly. I
think if you look out over time, I think the mix of affiliate and ad revenues, particularly on the sport side, probably tilts
to the affiliate side of it. That's the nature of sports today, that the importance of that product, it is – again, I think
everybody recognizes it is the most important product, it is the most powerful product – a product that again and not
everybody certainly for a large segment of consumers, it is must-have product for a large segment of consumers, and
therefore, I think that's what leads for it to get reflected – its value to get reflected in the affiliation side of it. The
advertising is certainly important. The live nature of the sport as we said before makes it uniquely valuable to
advertisers. I mean, you look at the NFL this year, I think it certainly probably as good a reason testament as you can

find anywhere of how valuable sports is to advertisers. So I don't mean to – certainly not trying to minimize the
importance of the advertising side of it. But I think, in general, in the sports arena, the affiliate side will be the larger
piece of the pie vis-à-vis advertising.
<Q - David Bank>: Is that kind of a 50/50 mix or like a 70/30 mix? I'm sorry, I'm just taking one more pass at it.

Operator
Our next question will come from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Hi. Thank you. Just sort of staying on that sports theme, we keep seeing more evidence of
the rising competition for the sports rights and obviously the rising cost of these franchises. Do the revenues generated
– it sounds like from the affiliate fees more than the advertising, the growing [indiscernible] (54:42) and audiences. I
guess do they make up for the higher programming cost? You've got such great perspective from your expensive
franchise and obviously the Super Bowl. I am curious about the profit equation, and how that delta may be changing
going forward? Is it maybe for the better or for the worse, any color there would be great?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I'm not sure how to answer that. I guess, look, I guess what I'd say is our sports businesses,
we feel great about it. I mean – and obviously we're dealing with these costs. When we do affiliate deals, they're
multi-year deals and it's actually you get a pretty good roadmap for a fair bit of it if the affiliate is the larger piece and
you get deals that go out years, those rights agreements layer against that, you have to make some assumptions of rating
and ad dollars, but that's the smaller part of the top-line.
So I think we feel like a pretty good visibility given, again, the nature of long-term distribution agreements aligned with
long-term rights agreements and the ability to keep those two things in balance to have a really healthy business for us.
And certainly to date, we've done it. Yet there's pressure on rights, and that I guess, again as I said before, it's the
double-edged nature of sports. It's the most important programming out there and probably gets more important as
everything else fragments, it sort of continues to in many ways stand taller, and so that's a positive. The reality is it
comes at a cost.
I think we've got a pretty good track record, proven the ability to digest those costs and build real value. I think we are
helped by the fact, I think, players that have scale in that arena are probably best positioned because I think breadth and
depth, it's one thing to sort of have a one-off, but I think to the degree you've got a broad array of sports, for us;
regional, national global, domestic, you sort of got something for everybody. And I think that really helps and I think
gives it a bit of a one plus one is three. So I do think scale is going to become an increasingly important dynamic in the
ability to get full value – to maximize value for the rights you got.

would be the NBA. How do you look at potentially bidding for making an investment in the NBA relative to what your
revenue objectives are and is it important to kind of, from a competitive perspective, keep rights away from other
networks that to bolster your own network?

NHL back on the air this fall and can you give us any insight on what you think that pace is going to look like in the
new calendar year? Thanks.
<A - John P. Nallen>: I'll cover the second one for you is that of the 15% domestic growth we had in the quarter,
about 5% of it is the impact of the NHL and SportsTime Ohio. So the underlying growth is about 10% and we've said
that we expect double-digit gains in affiliate fees in the year and we're comfortable with that.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: In terms of the rights we have, I mean simple answer is yes, we actually have the rights in
place we need to execute the plan we've got. That doesn't mean we won't engage on new rights and I think those want
to be opportunistic and if there is a dimension of rights and we're not going to buy everything. So we are going to be
selective. But it doesn't mean that there won't be that there aren't opportunities to add something that we think we can in
turn down the road create incremental value. But the rights we have today, and we've got a broad set of rights
[indiscernible] (59:17), baseball, NASCAR, college football and basketball, UFC, soccer, Champions League, World
Cup, golf, we've got a broad mix of rights, broad mix of rights that spread across the year. We feel great about where
we're at. So certainly, we have the rights in place to execute the plans we've got. So I think we certainly will look at
incremental rights and make a determination. And so are – they are the rights we could take on it up and create
incremental value on them. And if not, that we feel very good about where we're at.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Does the potential for -
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I guess in terms of – I'm sorry, I didn't answer. In terms of keep – I wouldn't take rights to
keep them away from others. I think you build – you're probably building your own business not spending money. If
we can't make – we're – I think our sports channel will be strong enough, we're comfortable that we can, and we've got
enough breadth across the company that we can execute on delivering the value through our sports channel. I wouldn't
– we wouldn't invest in further rights, it'll have to make sense for us we wouldn't invest with the purpose being to block
others.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Mike.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Great. Thank you.
