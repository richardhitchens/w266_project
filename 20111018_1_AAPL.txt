Timothy D. Cook
Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. This is our first earnings call since the passing of Steve Jobs. The world has
lost a visionary, a creative genius and an amazing human being. Steve was a great leader and mentor and inspired
everyone at Apple to do extraordinary things. His spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple and we are dedicated to
continuing the amazing work that he loved so much.
Only Apple brings together software, hardware and services into such a powerful and integrated experience for our
customers. As we move forward we will continue doing that with relentless focus. I'd like to take this opportunity to
express our gratitude for all of the condolences and expressions of support that we have received following Steve's
passing.
With that, I'd like to turn over the call to Peter to discuss our Q4 results. Peter?
Peter Oppenheimer
Thank you, Tim. We are very pleased to report record September quarter revenue and earnings. We set new all-time
quarterly record for Mac and iPad sales and we established a new September record for iPhone sales. We are very
proud of these results and with the momentum of our business.
Revenue for the quarter was $28.3 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 39%. The year-over-year increase was
fueled primarily by strong growth in iPad, Mac and iPhone sales. Operating margins was $8.7 billion representing
30.8% of revenue. Net income was $6.6 billion increasing 54% year-over-year, and translating to earnings per share of
$7.05.
Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established a new
all-time quarterly record with sales of 4.89 million Macs, exceeding the previous record set in the last December
quarter by 760,000 Macs, representing a 26% increase over the year-ago quarter's results.
That is more than six times IDC's most recently published forecast of 4% growth for the PC market overall in the
September quarter. Mac sales increased strongly in each of our operating segments led by Asia-Pacific with growth of
61% year-over-year.
The increase in Mac sales was fueled by the very strong growth in MacBook Air as well as the continued strong
performance of MacBook Pro. In July we updated the MacBook Air with the next generation processors, high speed
Thunderbolt I/O technology and a backlit keyboard. And while the portables represented 74% of the total Mac mix, we
also generated record desktop sales in the quarter primarily due to continued strength of iMac.
We launched Mac OS X Lion on July 20th and customer response has been tremendous with over six million Lion
downloads during the September quarter. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac
channel inventory.
Moving to our music products, we sold 6.6 million iPods compared to almost 9.1 million in the year-ago quarter.
Though down year-over-year, total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations and iPod Touch continued to account for
over half of all iPods sold. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest
monthly data published by NPD and iPods continue to be the top selling MP3 player in most countries we track based
on the latest data published give by GFK. We ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod
channel inventory.
The iTunes store generated record results with revenue in the quarter of almost $1.5 billion. The iTunes catalog
continues to grow and customers have downloaded over 16 billion songs and 650 million TV shows to date. We've also
been very pleased with the growing popularity of the iBookstore with over 180 million downloads of iBooks to date.
I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were very pleased to sell 17.1 million iPhones compared to 14.1 million in the
previous September quarter. This represents 21% year-over-year growth and a new September quarter record. We

experienced particularly strong iPhone sales growth in our Asia-Pacific segment where iPhone sales more than doubled
year-over-year.
We were pleased with the iPhone sales growth as we prepared for the transition to the iPhone 4S. We expected iPhone
sell-through to decline sequentially from the June quarter as a result of new product rumors following the
announcement at our developers conference in June that iOS 5 and iCloud would become available in the fall. As we
predicted, iPhone sell-through did decline across the quarter especially in the second half as new product speculation
intensified.
We ended the quarter with about 5.75 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential decline of about 180,000,
which placed us within our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Recognized revenue from
iPhone handset and accessory sales was $11 billion during the quarter compared to $8.8 billion in the year-ago quarter,
an increase of 24%.
Given the October launch of the iPhone 4S, we opted to defer new carrier and country additions from the September
quarter until after the launch. As we indicated two weeks ago, we were very pleased that we recently added Sprint and
KDDI to our carrier lineup. These additions bring us to 230 carriers in 105 countries.
For the sixth consecutive time, iPhone ranked highest in Consumer Reports Wireless Consumer Smartphone Customer
Satisfaction Survey achieving the highest ratings for overall satisfaction as well as for performance, ease of operations,
features and design. IPhone continues to be adopted as the standard across the enterprise with 93% of the Fortune 500
deploying or testing the device, up from 91% last quarter, and 60% of the Global 500 testing or deploying iPhone, up
from 57% last quarter.
A recent example of iPhone's enterprise success is Lowes. Lowes is in the process of rolling out over 40,000 iPhones
with a custom application to allow their store associates to execute real time inventory checks, product orders, and
interact with customers with how-to videos. Additional examples of companies around the world supporting iPhone on
their corporate networks include: L'Oreal, Royal Bank of Scotland, SAP, Texas Instruments, Jacob's Engineering
Group, Tenet Healthcare, Jaguar Land Rover, Takeda Pharmaceutical, Lincoln National and CXS Corporation.
And, of course, we're thrilled to begin shipping iPhone 4S this month. We are extremely enthusiastic about Siri, the
iPhone 4 intelligent assistant that helps you get things done by just asking. And we think customers will love the
performance of the iPhone 4S's dual core A5 chip, all new camera and full 1080p HD video recording. Now shipping in
seven countries, we are working hard to get iPhone 4S in customers' hands as quickly as possible and look forward to
rolling it out in 22 more countries by the end of this month.
Turning to iPad. We continue to be thrilled with its incredible momentum. We set a new record with sales of 11.1
million iPads during the September quarter compared to 4.2 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 166%. We
said from the beginning that the tablet market is a huge opportunity for Apple, and we're very excited with our current
performance and the tremendous customer enthusiasm for iPad.
We launched iPad to an additional 28 countries and ended the September quarter with distribution in a total of 90
countries. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter were $6.9 billion compared to
$2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 146%. We ended the quarter with about 2.5 million iPads in channel
inventory, a sequential increase of about 1.45 million, which placed us within our target range of four to six weeks.
It's been just 18 months since we introduced iPad and the pace at which businesses worldwide are adopting this
technology is unprecedented. Today 92% of the Fortune 500 are testing or deploying iPad within their enterprises, up
from 86% last year. Internationally, 52% of the Global 500 are testing or deploying iPad, up from 47% last quarter.
Every day we learn about innovative new ways our enterprise customers are using iPad. The airline industry is a great
example of the momentum we're seeing. United Continental Holdings is putting iPads in every cockpit to replace heavy
paper-based flight bags. And Japan's All Nippon Airways is now using iPads in training programs for flight attendants.
Sonic Automotive is using iPad for customer check-in at the service department and also to provide analytics to
regional managers. AFLAC, Biogen and General Mills have developed internal apps that their field sales teams

leverage daily, and technicians at Siemens Energy are bringing iPads along when they do maintenance work at the top
of their wind turbines.
Combining iPhones, iPad and iPod Touch, we surpassed 0.25 billion cumulative iOS device sales in the September
quarter. We were very pleased to begin delivering iOS 5 last week and customers are loving its many new features
including Notification Center, iMessage, newsstand and Reminders.
We were also very excited to launch iCloud last week with breakthrough services including iTunes in the Cloud, Photo
Stream and Documents in the Cloud. We believe iCloud is the easiest way for customers to manage their content going
far beyond anything else available today and early reviews have been excellent.
The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 500,000 apps available and over 18 billion downloads to
date. We expanded the App Store to 33 additional countries during the September quarter, ending with a total of 123
countries.
I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. Revenue was $3.6 billion, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter.
The stores experienced very strong year-over-year growth in Mac and iPad sales, which was largely offset by a decline
in iPhone sales given the tough comparison to year-ago quarter when iPhone 4 was launched and compounded by
speculation about a new iPhone this year. The stores generated record-breaking Mac results with sales reaching $1.1
million compared to $874,000 in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 25%. And about half the Macs sold in our stores
during the September quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.
We opened 30 new stores in the quarter, 21 of which were outside the United States. On the last weekend of the
quarter, we opened seven stores in six countries including our first store in Hong Kong. With our highest opening day
for Mac sales ever, our Hong Kong store joins our five other China stores as the highest traffic and among our highest
revenue stores in the world. We ended the quarter with a total of 357 stores. With an average of 336 stores open,
average revenue per store was $10.7 million compared to $11.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment margin
was $679 million compared to $917 million in the year-ago quarter. Store traffic continues to be very strong. We
hosted a record 77.5 million visitors in the September quarter.
As we look ahead to fiscal 2012, we will continue to focus on international expansion. In total, we expect to open about
40 stores with approximately three quarters of them outside the United States. We will also be expanding or replacing
higher-volume stores primarily in the U.S. that are simply too constrained to deliver our desired customer experience.
Total company gross margin was 40.3%, which was 230 basis point higher than our guidance. This difference was
almost entirely due to lower component and other product costs. Operating expenses were $2.67 billion and included
$253 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $81 million, the tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%.
Turning to cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $81.6 billion at the end of the
September quarter, compared to $76.2 billion at the end of the June quarter, a sequential increase of $5.4 billion. This
increase was net of cash paid for the acquisition of Nortel patents and the Nokia settlement during the September
quarter. Cash flow from operations was $10.4 billion, an increase of 84% year over year.
As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of
forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. I'd also like to remind you that
approximately once every six years, we add a week to the December quarter to align our fiscal periods with the
December calendar. So this December quarter will span 14 weeks rather than 13 and will end on December 31.
We expect revenues to be about $37 billion compared to $26.7 billion in the December quarter last year. We expect
gross margin to be about 40%, reflecting approximately $60 million relating to stock-based compensation expense. We
expect OpEx to be about $3.25 billion including about $350 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect
OI&E to be about $85 million and expect the tax rate to be about 24.25%. We are targeting EPS of about $9.30.
In closing, we're extremely pleased with the strong conclusion to our record-breaking fiscal 2011. Over the course of
the year, we generated revenue of over $108 billion, an increase of $43 billion or 66% over our fiscal 2010 results. We
flew past historical records by selling over 72 million iPhones, 32 million iPads and almost 17 million Macs in fiscal

2011. We expanded our reach by opening 40 new retail stores, adding scores of new carrier and reseller relationships
and broadening our online presence through Apple stores and Apps Stores around the world. And last but not least, we
generated almost $26 billion in net income during the year, an increase of 85% year-over-year, which was even faster
than our revenue growth.
We're thrilled to begin selling iPhone 4S and to bring iOS 5 and iCloud to our customers this month and we remain
very enthusiastic about our new product pipeline.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton
Thank you, Peter. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Operator, may we have the first
question, please.
Q&A
Operator
From Goldman Sachs, we'll go to Bill Shope.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Great. Thanks. I have a few iPhone questions if I could. Given that the 4S was launched so
close to the holiday selling season, can you give us an idea of your confidence in the production ramp and the
distribution ramp and how you've mitigated the risk of a shortage here during peak consumer demand?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Hey, Bill, it's Tim. We've gotten off to a great start with the 4S. We've sold over four million
in just three days after launch. We're thrilled with the start that we have. We are confident that we will have a large
supply but I don't want to predict when supply and demand might balance because the demand is obviously extremely
high right now. But I'm confident that we will set an all-time record for iPhone this quarter.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Now, and just a question on the September quarter iPhone dynamics. So it sounds like the
primary negative impact on shipments was purely from a sell through pause? You didn't have any real channel
inventory draw down issues affect shipments, is that correct?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Not entirely. If you look on a sell through basis, the sequential comparison is down 2.4
million units. That's 19.7 from the previous quarter which had an inventory build in it to bring it to a sell in of over 20.
And to 17.3 this quarter, which had an inventory reduction of a little less than 200,000, which Peter talked about in his
opening remarks.
That 2.4 was much less of a reduction than what we were expecting and was a large factor in our revenue exceeding
our guidance by over $3 billion. We expected it to be greater than 2.4 because we knew that there was a great
anticipation of a June or July new iPhone because that was the pace that we have been on for the last several years. And
as we had predicted that sell through decline did occur in the quarter, but not nearly to the extent that we thought and
therefore we significantly beat our guidance.
The reduction happened largely in the back half of the quarter as the speculation hit extreme highs. However, we're
thrilled to be shipping the new iPhone 4S and iOS 5 and iCloud. And we are very confident that we will set an all-time
record in the December quarter for iPhone sales. We – in our wildest dreams we couldn't have gotten off to a start as
great as we have on the 4S.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yes.

From Morgan Stanley, we'll hear from Katy Huberty.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thanks. Peter, this quarter you were able to print north of the 40% gross margin despite the mix
shift away from your high margin product and towards a lower margin product. So just curious why you don't think you
can do better than 40% in December given how well the iPhone 4S is already doing and the favorable component cost
environment and then I have a follow up for Tim?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure. I understand your question, Katy. We expect the gross margin to be relatively flat on
a sequential basis. And we expect it, because as you pointed out, we do think the favorable component cost
environment will continue. And we certainly expect a very strong mix of iPhones, both of which are positive for gross
margins.
However, we expect both of these to be basically fully offset by the impact of higher cost structures and reduced price
points for the recently reduced iPhones and iPods as well as the stronger U.S. dollar. It's really strengthened in the last
couple of weeks from where we were across the summer. So that's why.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Okay. And then Tim, over the course of the last year, you've provided great insight into Apple's
traction in China. So I wonder if you could update us on how you're tracking in that region but also provide some
insight into how substantial China could be to Apple over time. For instance, is there any reason that China couldn't be
as big as the U.S. market once you open more stores and optimize the product set there?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yeah, thanks for the question. As you said, the China progress has been amazing. If you look
at our Greater China revenue, it represented just 2% of Apple in our fiscal year '09. And in the fiscal year we just
ended, it accounted for 12%. And if you just look at the quarter that we just ended it accounted for 16%. So it's our
fastest growing major region by far. It delivered $4.5 billion of our revenue for the current quarter, and that's up almost
four times or about 270% year-over-year. That brought the total revenue for the fiscal year to over $13 billion. And to
further put that in context, a year ago in fiscal year '10 we were just right above $3 billion. So it is growing at a feverish
pace.
We have placed new retail stores there as you know. We now have six in Greater China. Our online store opened at the
end of last year and so we still haven't hit our one year inventory there yet. We have over 200 mono branded stores that
we call APRs, which are resellers on there. It's a very premium shopping experience. And we are now up to over 7,000
point-of-sales on the iPhone in Greater China. So we're continuing to make investments in this.
How far can it go? Certainly in my lifetime, I've never seen a country with as many people rising into the middle class
that aspire to buy products that Apple makes. And so I think it's an area of enormous opportunity. And it has quickly
become number two on our list of top revenue countries very, very quickly. And we're obviously placing additional
investment. We're building more stores there, as well as doing quite a few other things to continue to deliver our great
products to the people of China.
We're also placing additional focus on some other areas that have shown great promise over this fiscal year such as
Brazil. Brazil was up 118% year-over-year and went over the $900 million mark. Russia is also beginning to look more
and more promising, and as I mentioned on the last call, the Middle East we believe has significant opportunities. So
there's several of these markets that historically Apple has not been strong in that the iPhone has really opened up and
introduced Apple to a whole set of customers that didn't get excited about looking at other products that we have. And I
think certainly the iPad will be doing the same. And so I think China, the sky's the limit there. And I wouldn't discount
some of these other places that I've mentioned as well.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?

We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions. First for Tim, if you could weigh in a
little more on Apple's historic strength in terms of manufacturing and supply chain strategies? I know we talked about
this before, Tim, but can you give us an update in terms of margin flexibility as you start to use more than one source
for certain parts of your supply chain manufacturing chain? And then I have a question for Peter after that.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yeah, Mark, I think we have an outstanding team in this area and a track record that's
unparalleled in the industry. Although we keep trying to improve it all the time, we've also used our balance sheet in a
favorable way here to do some strategic deals on different parts that we felt were very, very important to Apple across a
series of products. As we get larger, there are some areas where we've elected to diversify some. However, our
approach has been, and I think will always be, to do business with as few people as we can so we can be very deep with
them and do great innovative stuff together. And you can't tend to do that when you go out to many, many different
people. And I think they give us great quality and also reasonable prices. And so that winds up helping our margin.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: And then the second question is around the iPad. Recently Amazon with the Kindle Fire
is trying to make the tablet market more of a soapbox derby in terms of lower price points but maybe limited feature
sets. Can you kind of weigh in on what your view is and is this making it more of a hybrid market where it's not really a
tablet but kind of a hybrid and Apple has not really seen any affects from a demand perspective at this point?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: We had an outstanding quarter last quarter with setting a record with doing over 11 million.
And, at the same time, we were setting a Mac record, which is I think very phenomenal in and of itself. But we've seen
several competitors come to market to try to compete with the iPad over time. Some had different form factors,
different price points. And I think it's reasonable to say that none of these have gained any traction thus far. And, in
fact, as all of those competitors were coming to market, our share actually went up, such that in the June quarter,
according to IDC, we were responsible for three out of every four tablets sold. And I think when you really assess this
thing and look at iOS 5, iCloud, the ecosystem with iTunes and the Apps Store and books and movies and the fact that
we have over 140,000 native apps for iPad versus a number in the hundreds for the other guys, I feel very, very
confident about our ability to compete and extremely confident in our product pipeline.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks Mark. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator
From Piper Jaffray we'll hear from Gene Munster.
<Q - Gene A. Munster>: Good afternoon, everybody. And, Peter, did I hear that right that you mentioned the deferral
of iPhone for new carriers and new country additions? Wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on what that was and
the potential impact on the numbers?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Gene, as I said in my prepared remarks, we opted to defer adding new carriers or countries
during the September quarter knowing that we would launch the iPhone 4S very early in the October month. And we
wanted to launch our new carriers with our latest products so we waited. I think that did have some impact on the
September quarter. I think the biggest impacts were the rumors that were just very pervasive, particularly in the second
half of the quarter. There just seemed to be the rumor of the day, but that's behind us. We have just started selling the
iPhone 4S. It is off to a fantastic start and we're thrilled to be, including Sprint and KDDI in our carrier lineup and we're
heading into this holiday season with the best product lineup Apple's ever shipped and tremendous momentum.
<Q - Gene A. Munster>: Okay. Thank you. Tim, I realize the Amazon Fire question is out of the way here, but do you
have any just high level thoughts on the size of the tablet market? I mean it's not netbooks, it's computers. I mean, how

do you think about internally thinking about how big this market could be in the next few years?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: We thought, Gene, from the beginning of this that it would be a huge market and it has been
even greater than we thought. And we've now sold 40 million on a cumulative basis and it's pretty clear to me that if
you forecast out in time, that the tablet market – I still believe it will be larger than the PC market. That's not a
guidance number, that's just something that I very much believe. There will be many, many more people that can
access it and the ease of use is so phenomenal and off the charts that I think it's a huge opportunity for Apple across
time.

<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Gene. Can we have the next question, please?

From Barclays Capital we'll hear from Ben Reitzes.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Yeah, I was actually wondering if we could talk a little bit more about the iPhone. Just
do you have any idea of what – how many units do you feel were pushed out and deferred into the next quarter? And,
in general, how should we be thinking about the 4S launch given the pent up demand from the quarter, anything else
with regard to the velocity and how it worked into your guidance of $37 billion?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Ben, I think the number – you can't run the experiment twice. And so we can't tell you with
precision how many units we would have sold if there had not been rumors and people weren't expecting a new iPhone.
But I certainly believe it was substantial. And that's the reason that we called it out. And I think anybody monitoring
the press would probably come to the same conclusion. You can go out and talk to a group of customers and probably
get the same kind of answer.
On the 4S, I think it's off the charts. If you do a comparison of the three days after launch of last year on iPhone 4, we
came in at 1.7. This year we were over four in the same timeframe. And so that's the mother of all uplifts. So we're
thrilled with how we've gotten started and the feedback that we're getting from customers is just fantastic. And so I
couldn't be more pleased with where we are.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: And just my follow up is with regard to the iPad category, now that it's, I wouldn't call
it maturing, but a few more quarters of experience, do you – generally in Macs you're up a little sequentially lately in
the fourth quarter. You have an extra week now. Any thoughts on how the iPad seasonality may be working in the iPad
over the next quarter or two in terms of more experience or a gut feel for how that product progresses?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Ben, it's Peter. I'll give you some thoughts on the December quarter but we're not going to
provide our thoughts yet for the March quarter. We would expect to establish new company records for both the iPhone
and the iPad in the December quarter. These are fantastic products and the momentum here is tremendous. And for
Macs we would expect to outgrow the market on a year-over-year basis and report to you our 23rd consecutive quarter
of outgrowing the market.

going to interact with their devices? Just any color you can give would be great.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Well, the number of people using it already is amazing. And the questions and so forth and
the personality that it has is also incredible. And so we see this as a profound innovation. And I think over time, many,
many people will use it in a substantial way. And what percentage of their input will be by that, I don't know and what
percentage of their searches, I don't know. But our guts have been since the beginning of this is that it is substantial and
it's an incredible innovation and that's the feedback that we're getting from customers.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay, great. And then can you make a comment just on the supply chain given the HDD
issues in Thailand? What are your thoughts? Any clarity you've gotten from the people on the ground there? Thank
you.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: It's a very good question. Our hearts go out to all the people in Thailand who have
experienced these devastating losses of life and property as a result of the monsoons and the flooding. Like many
others, we source many components from Thailand and have multiple factories that supply these components. There are
several factories that are currently not operable. And the recovery timeline for these factories is not known at this point.
As you can appreciate, the weather really hasn't allowed an ability to assess those. From the work that we have done,
we would say that our primary exposure is on the Mac, because as you point out, of the number of drives or drive
components that are sourced in Thailand is a significant portion of the total worldwide supply of drives. And so I can't
give you a precise accounting. It is something that I'm concerned about. We do expect, I'm virtually certain there will
be an overall industry shortage of disk drives as a result of the disaster. How it affects Apple, I'm not sure but we
placed our assessment, to the degree that we can make one, in the guidance that Peter has already given you in the $37
billion number.

Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. I have two please. Tim, I'm wondering if you can comment on your
ongoing patent disputes most notably versus Samsung and other Android OEMs? Specifically I'm wondering if you can
characterize what your ultimate objectives are from litigation? Is it to get injunctions on violating products? Is it to
capture royalty fees? Or what is it?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Toni, I don't want to comment on any particular litigation. It's our policy not to do that. But
basically, as you know, we spend a lot of time and money and resource in coming up with incredible innovations. And
we don't like it when someone else takes those. So that's why we – unfortunately, we've been pushed into the court
system as a remedy to that. But I don't want to comment about any particular lawsuit.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: I meant generally speaking, you said as a remedy. What kinds of remedies do you see
coming from the court system?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: That's one of the things I particularly don't want to comment on.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Okay. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the price reductions on the 3GS
offering. You've gone to free on postpaid and dramatically reduced the price, $160 to $200 in most countries, on the
prepaid offering. How are you thinking about this price reduction in terms of its potential elasticity? Do you see it as
targeting a new segment of consumers? And how are you thinking about whether this will largely resonate with prepaid
customers or with postpaid customers?

<A - Timothy D. Cook>: We did it because we wanted to make the iPhone more accessible to a broader market. And
so not only did we take the 3GS to free on a postpaid basis – and that's the U.S. but it's free in postpaid in many, many
other markets as well. But we also lowered the price of the iPhone 4 to $99. And so we've done both of those because
as we looked at it, these are still fantastic products, and we think that we can do reasonably well selling those in the
postpaid markets. It also has the advantage of having a lower price in the prepaid markets. Obviously not free and $99,
but lower than where those entry points were previously. And so we did it for both markets, Toni, both the post pay and
the prepay markets. Both of those are very, very important to us and it has been our thinking for a while to do that.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?

From Citi we'll hear from Richard Gardner.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay. Thank you. Tim, as a follow-up to Shannon's question, I was hoping that you
might be willing to give us a more general view of how you view component supply, demand and pricing going into the
fourth quarter? And then also particularly unibody casings, given the issues that you've had with one of your supplies in
that area as well, do you expect that to have any significant impact on MacBook Pro or MacBook Air supply in the
fourth quarter?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: On the second question first, we treat every concern that we hear about our suppliers very,
very seriously and we're currently investigating and assessing the situation and we factored our supply outlook as we
currently see it into the numbers that Peter has given earlier. In terms of the general market for components, NAND and
DRAM, which were really declined last quarter, and LCDs, we see all three of these generally in a very positive supply
situation, and therefore, we expect the pricing to continue at favorable levels.
Most of the other components we expect to fall at or above historical trends. And so generally speaking, it's a very
positive market from a supply point of view. Now, that is with the asterisk of the disaster that just happened in Thailand
aside. I'm not sure how that will play out. But I do believe that the risk there is more focused on the Mac portion of our
product line.
<Q - Richard E. Gardner>: Okay. And if I could ask a follow-up, I guess for Peter and Tim, I know you don't give
operating margin guidance or gross margin guidance, but it does seem like we could be moving into is a new phase for
the company where potentially several of the fastest growing products in the product line, whether it be iPad or these
lower priced iPhones that could see some good price elasticity at the low end could be the fastest growing products for
the company next year, and could start to put some pressure on gross margins. I'm just on wondering if you A, agree
with that assertion; and B, if that is the case, is it still reasonable to think that the company can maintain or expand
operating margins next year if gross margins come under pressure due to product mix?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Rich, it's Peter. Let me make some comments about the December quarter and then I'll
give you our – more our philosophy beyond, we're not providing on future quarter, future year guidance. For the
December quarter, we anticipate our gross margin being at about 40%. And having nice leverage on our OpEx, yielding
an operating margin of just over 31%, which would be quite strong.
As we look forward we are going to just continue to offer the very best products to customers that we can. We are
going to be extremely innovative. We're very confident, excited about what's in the product pipeline. You'll see us be
aggressive in the future and where customers want to buy that – that's fine with us. We just want them to buy our
products. And look back over the last couple of years I think we've done a very good job gaining market share and
growing our top and bottom lines and running a great business. And we're just going keep coming to work every day to
do that in the future.

We'll go to Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you. I just had a clarification, one question, on the iPad side can you speak about
where we are on the distribution rollout of that product in particular, where we are with countries and carriers and
points-of-sale and was there any pause around that in the September quarter.
And then a question for Tim. Tim, you mentioned just the growth not only in China but also the potential that may exist
in Brazil and Middle East and Russia. I guess you could throw India there as well. What do you practically need to do
to actually realize the potential there? Is it a case of local manufacturers to those countries? Is it a case of carrier
distribution and how long might it take to realize that? I understand the focus now is on China, but I'm trying to
understand what Apple needs to do to realize the potential of that emerging middle class in those countries as well.
Many, thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yes. We are in 90 countries on iPad. We have about 40,000 points-of-sale around the world.
To put that in some context we have about 50,000 on iPod and about 120,000 on iPhone. So you can get a feel for the
extent of the rollout there. There are still countries left to do. But we are in the main countries with iPad.
Do I think there was a slowdown on iPad? Where the iPhone numbers, it's crystal clear in looking at the numbers that
there was a slowdown. That is not the case on iPad. And so where I believe we are from a supply demand point of view
on iPad is that we, somewhere during the quarter, entered a supply demand balance and stayed there for the balance of
the quarter.
If you recall on the last call, I said that we were coming in balance in a few countries. And then sometime thereafter I
think that we went into a supply demand balance around the world. And you can look at the share numbers that third
parties have reported and we're doing extremely well there. We couldn't feel better honestly. And the extent of the
usage, the comScore Group said that 97% of the web usage of tablets in the U.S. is from the iPad. So it's just mind
boggling. So we feel very, very good about that.
In terms of the other countries outside of China, we have already started placing efforts in the places that I mentioned.
It's not something that we are going to start next week or so. It's something we've already done or I wouldn't have
brought it up frankly. Obviously we wouldn't have done over 900 million in Brazil with no effort. There are some
countries in the world that have protectionalist-type of structures where the prices of the goods are extremely high if
there's not local content involved. And so we will assess each of those and decide what's in our best interest but today I
don't have anything to report there.
The basic approach in all of the countries are the same as the game plan that we used in China and it's just a matter of
the course, the rate and pace of the roll-out and whether to involve every one of the things that we did in China. In
China we picked everything that we knew to do. We are building retail. We went in with an online store. We are
building an APR channel. We're building a third-party channel. We're doing significant advertising. We're really doing
everything basically that we're doing in the United States, we're doing in China. We would not be doing that in each of
the other countries I named but we would be doing portions of that and have already started to achieve the numbers that
we did last year.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yep.

<Q - Scott D. Craig>: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Hey, Tim, I was wondering, first call as CEO, any thoughts on
any different strategy as far as cash allocation goes? And by that I mean dividend and a possible share buy-back and
maybe talk about the supplier investments also.
And then the second question is, you mentioned the tablet market potentially being even bigger than the PC market at
some point. Can you discuss the cannibalization levels you think you're seeing right now versus the PC market?
Thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Let me start with the second question first. I do believe that we're seeing cannibalization; and
I think that it's showing up in two ways. I think that some people are electing to buy an iPad rather than a Mac.
However I believe a materially larger number of people are electing to buy an iPad instead of a Windows-based PC.
And so I think we are overwhelmingly coming out very, very well in that cannibalization question. And I would point
out that despite that, the Mac had its best quarter by far ever last quarter. And so even with having the best quarter on
iPad with some cannibalization, the Mac has its best quarter ever, which is almost unbelievable. And so with
cannibalization like this, I hope it continues.
On your cash question, to date, as you know, we've wanted to maintain flexibility. I think everyone knows, that knows
us, knows that the cash isn't burning a hole in our pocket and we're not the type people to do silly things with it. We
invest it conservatively. If you look at Gary and his team's track record they've done a phenomenal job in an extremely
difficult market for the last few years. We've also taken money and done things with it that are in Apple's best interest.
For example, we've acquired several companies. We've acquired some IP as you know. We've invested in the supply
chain. And we used money to build out our stores and provide for a lot of new product tooling and the like. And so I
believe what we're doing with cash, the cash that we do spend, we're doing an extremely good job of it and we're very
frugal about using it and using it in the right places.
That said, I'm not religious about holding cash or not holding it. I'm religious about a lot of things but not that one. And
so we will continually ask ourselves what's in Apple's best interest and always do what we believe is in Apple's best
interest. And so it's a topic for the board on an ongoing basis and we'll continue to disuses it.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Thanks, Scott. I'd like to add to Tim's answer just to remind everybody that of the a little
over $81 billion of cash that we ended the September quarter with, a bit more than $54 billion or two-thirds of it was
offshore.

From RBC Capital Markets we'll hear from Mike Abramsky.
<Q - Mike Abramsky>: Yes. Thanks very much. Tim, following up on your last question, maybe I'll just ask this just
absolutely directly. Is buying back shares with your cash, which seems to be sort of the thing that everybody wants you
to do, at least certain investors want you to do it, is that perhaps kind of a philosophical white flag that you're not able
to create value through product innovation?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Mike, I think anyone looking at us and the track record that we've got would not come to any
conclusion that we're waving a white flag on innovation. We've had a series of unbelievable products, we believe the
best products in the world, and our customers tell us that, which is more importantly than us saying it. And we've got a
pipeline that's unbelievable. And so...
<Q - Mike Abramsky>: Sorry, Tim. I didn't mean to convey that you were doing that. I meant to say, would that be
holding you back philosophically from buying back shares?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: No. I view those to be totally separate and distinct things. So no, I don't believe it assumes
that – it certainly doesn't send that signal from my point of view. The cash is always a topic and we'll always conclude
to do what we think is in Apple's best interest. And I think we've done that so far and if you look at where we've spent

it, I think you would agree.
<Q - Mike Abramsky>: Okay. Then the original goal for the iPhone, at the time it was obviously classed as audacious
with 1% of the market in the first fiscal year after launch and you achieved five times that, Tim. In the recent
presentation when you highlighted that there's 95% of the market to go, I'm wondering if in your mind you've
established a similarly audacious goal for the next couple of years for market penetration?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Not one that I've published but we want the iPhone to be in as many customers' hands as
possible because we think it's the greatest phone by far. And that's why we live to do that. And so yes, we aspire to
much larger volumes than where we are. And we think the smartphone market will eventually absorb the handset
market. As I've made a point in that presentation, the handset market is this huge market. It's 1.5 billion handsets. And
the smartphone market, depending upon which service you believe, is a bit over 400 million or so. And so there's a
huge growth in the smartphone market and then we think that we can also grow within the sector at all. But the big win
is to eat into the 1.5. Not just for us but I think for others as well. And we are very focused on doing that. You can tell
that with the moves that we've made recently.

We'll go to Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Thanks. I have two. Peter, first for you. Is the extra week for the quarter truly linear on
both the revenues and the expenses? And included the reason I'm asking is just trying to set up, if you will, for the
March quarter, the potential impact of that extra week on the March quarter.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure, Keith. The 14th week will conclude on New Year's Eve day which has traditionally
been a good sell-through week for us, but not typically as strong as the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas
day. We'll provide further details on our January call about what we actually saw. So that's some indication in terms of
what we would see for sell through. For our expenses, we certainly will have variable expenses and payroll expenses
for that 14th week. But some of our fixed costs, such as leases and rents and such are fixed so there will be a benefit
there as well.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. And my follow up is on Japan. In terms of the year-over-year and sequential
changes, there was a bigger disparity on units versus revenues, CPU units versus total revenues in Japan. I was just
wondering if you could speak to that if you could?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I'm sorry?
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: In terms of the revenue performance on Japan?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yeah.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: It looked to be a bigger disparity between the units and the revenues than was true in the
other regions. I was just wondering why the bigger disparity in Japan? Was it FX or was it other reasons?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: A huge percentage of Japan's total revenue in the year ago quarter was from the iPhone 4
launch. It was the iPhone 4's first quarter as you know, and so when you do a year-over-year compare, that adversely
affects the revenue compare. The Mac, however, had an incredible quarter growing at 48% in a market that is barely
growing at all. And so we gained significant share on the Mac side of the business. The iPhone was a negative
year-over-year compare, but we have gotten off to a unbelievable start in Japan. It was one of the first seven countries.
And it's very clear that Japan is yet another example of the delay that we were speaking about earlier.

That will come from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Thanks very much. Tim, I wanted to ask about the medium to longer term iPad opportunity as
you see it from an ASP standpoint or segmentation standpoint. By that I mean do you see more opportunity to move
that product down market to drive elasticity, or up market to take on a greater percentage of the PC market?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I don't want to get into what we might do, which that answer might do. But let me just go
back to, we see the tablet market as a huge market. And we could not be happier with our position in it, and we've got
some fantastic things in the pipeline. And after selling 40 million in the first 18 months, which is more than our wildest
dreams were and selling three out of every four, I think we've got a fairly good handle on what to do next.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Okay. Perhaps I can ask on initial feedback or expectations around the lower price points of
the iPhone business into emerging markets. Can you comment at all or give some color on carrier receptivity of that
pricing change and any acceleration in carrier engagements on the back of that?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Maybe I can answer that in two ways. If you look at the channel inventory on iPhone, that
was there at the end of Q4 so this is at the September 24 cutoff point for our quarter, that was the 5.75 million that Peter
mentioned in his opening comments. Over half of that has already sold through and so one portion of the things driving
that is the elasticity question that you're getting at there.
We also did in a very few countries last quarter, we dropped the 3GS price a bit early. Particularly in some of the
prepay markets to see what would occur in those markets. We were extremely pleased with the results and it gave us
even more conviction to follow through with the planned change that we made earlier in October.
