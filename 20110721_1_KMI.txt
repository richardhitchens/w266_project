MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome and thank you for joining the Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. I'd like to inform all parties the call is
being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. Thank you, you may begin.
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Okay and thank you, Tamara, and thanks to everyone for calling in. This is the Kinder Morgan earnings call and we
will be talking about Kinder Morgan, Inc., and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners. Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, or
KMP, is one of the largest MLPs in America; and KMI, which is a C-corp, owns a General Partner of KMP together
with LP units in KMP and KMR and a 20% interest in the Natural Gas Pipeline of America.
As usual, we'll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. Also as usual, I'll give an overview of the quarter; then Park Shaper, our president, will take you through the
financial details; and then we'll be available for any and all questions that you may have.
Let me start with KMI. The news here is that we raised the dividend from $0.29 a quarter, or $1.16 per year, to $0.30 a
quarter, or $1.20 annualized. If you go back to the time of the IPO, you'll recall that we talked about we anticipate $820
million in cash available for dividends at KMI and that – so during 2011 – and that resulted in $1.16 per share in terms
of dividends. We're now on track to do better than $820 million and, therefore, we're raising the dividend to reflect the
improved performance in terms of cash generated. The higher cash at KMI is because of KMP's performance, including
acquisition and expansion opportunities that are exceeding our budget and which will result in higher distributions to
KMI during the course of 2011. So, we have raised that distribution and on an annualized basis now to the $1.20
instead of $1.16.
Now turning to KMP, there we also raised the quarterly distribution this time to $1.15 or $4.60 annualized. Now that's
a 6% increase over the distribution that we paid in the second quarter of 2010. Our budget target at KMP is to deliver or
to declare cash distributions of $4.60 a unit for 2011 and, as you recall, to produce excess coverage above that of $37
million, and we expect to meet or exceed that target this year. The second quarter results are slightly above our plan.
Year-to-date is slightly above our plan; and our current projections, which we update weekly around here, show us well
above our plan for the full year of 2011.
Now let me review our performance and other developments at each of our business segments, and I'll start with our
Products Pipeline segment. There, in terms of refined products volumes, the volumes were actually down 1.3% for the
second quarter compared to Q2 of 2010. Year-to-date we're up 1.4% in total refined products volumes. To put that in
context, the EIA numbers for the nationwide demand were down 1.5% in the second quarter and down 0.5%
year-to-date. So, we are doing a little bit better than the EIA numbers, but that said, I think it does show that there is a
fragile recovery and I think we are seeing some impact from higher gas prices. We also have some impact from a
couple of new competing terminals, particularly one in the State of Florida that I think has resulted in some loss of
volumes on our part.
If you break it down by product for the second quarter, gasoline was down 3.7%, diesel down 3.4%. Jet was the
positive factor, up 11.5%, and that was pretty well across the board, had a very nice increase in military volumes in the

West, over 20%. But on our commercial volumes of jet fuel across the system, they were up approximately 9.5%. So,
that's kind of the picture from a volumetric standpoint. In terms of performance within the Products Pipeline segment,
our Cochin operations, our West Coast terminals and our Plantation Pipe Line were positive compared to a year ago.
Our Central Florida Pipeline was down compared to a year ago, largely because of decline in volumes.
We had some other significant developments in this segment, some of which you're aware of. We are moving ahead
with our condensate line, running from the Eagle Ford Shale play in South Texas up to the Houston Ship Channel. We
expect to have that line in service in the second quarter of 2012. Things seem to be progressing according to plan there.
We're in the advanced stages of discussion with a number of customers to ship additional volumes above our 50,000 a
day commitment from Petrohawk.
Our Carson Terminal and Travis Air Force Base expansions in California are on budget and expected to be in service
somewhat ahead of our original target. Now, also pertaining to the Products Pipeline segment, that we did take a certain
item in this second quarter, we added to our legal reserve due to the ongoing rate case litigation on our West Coat
pipelines in the amount of $165 million.
We previously announced, as you know, that we got an adverse decision from the CPUC, the main intent of it which
was that, contrary to its own past procedures and certainly contrary to what the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
has ruled, it did not allow an income tax allowance. That is now a CPUC decision. We intend to fight that decision in
the appellate courts because we believe it is contrary to other decisions outstanding and to precedent. But accounting
requires that we go ahead and take that write-down now even though we may or may not be successful in our appeal,
and we've decided to do that and that makes up the large share of the reserve.
As we said in our release, the refunds mandated by this decision which stands will not in our judgment have any impact
on our distribution to our Limited Partners at KMP or on our dividends to our KMI shareholders.
Now turning to our Natural Gas Pipeline segment, they had a good second quarter, driven primarily by KinderHawk –
that's the Haynesville gathering and treating system; by Fayetteville Express Pipeline, which went into service the first
of this year; and by good results in our Casper-Douglas processing assets up in Wyoming. The negatives in the quarter
were lower volumes and fuel recoveries at KMIGT [Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission], higher property taxes
at Rockies Express, and an adverse decision on fuel recoveries at our – on our Trailblazer system.
Overall, our transport volumes were up 16% for the quarter compared to a year ago and we really had two big
developments in this segment since our last conference call. On July 1, we closed on our agreement to buy Petrohawk's
50% interest in KinderHawk Field Services and a 25% interest in Petrohawk's gathering and treating business in the
Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. As consideration for this transaction, we paid $836 million in cash and $77 million in
assumed debt.
Now we own 100% of KinderHawk, which has over 400 miles of pipeline in the Haynesville Shale play and
approximately 2 Bcf of capacity, 2 Bcf a day of capacity. We have throughput that is now above 1 Bcf a day and
growing. And we think this is just a tremendous long-term asset. We believe its value has been enhanced by the
pending purchase of Petrohawk by BHP, and if you look at BHP's presentation you saw some pretty significant
ramp-up in dollars expect to spend on their drilling program. Now that drilling program embraces Haynesville and
Eagle Ford together with a smaller position in the Permian. But we think this bodes very well for our assets both in
Haynesville and the Eagle Ford. We now own also the 25% of what's called the EagleHawk Field Services in the Eagle
Ford. That has 280 miles of gas gathering lines and 120 miles of condensate gathering lines, and we think the Eagle
Ford Shale is an area that – where throughput will grow dramatically as drilling down there continues to expand.
The other significant development is in our Natural Gas segment, also involves the Eagle Ford and let me just review
that with you. Eagle Ford Gathering, which is a 50/50 joint venture between ourselves and Copano Energy, entered into
three long term agreements with shippers in the second quarter, and we've now contracted for about 550 million cubic
feet a day of Eagle Ford natural gas production. We're providing transportation, processing, and fractionation services
to our customers.

Eagle Ford Gathering also entered into a long-term agreement with Williams Partners to process production at the
Williams' Markham processing facility in Matagorda County, Texas. Initially we contracted for 100 million cubic feet a
day of processing capacity, and we have the option to increase that to 200 million a day.
Currently the JV that we have with Copano expects to have about 400 miles of pipeline with capacity together about
700 million cubic feet a day. Remember, I said 550 has already been contracted for and we anticipate subscriptions for
the rest to be completed by the end of the third quarter.
The Natural Gas segment alone has now committed close to $200 million in expansion projects in the Eagle Ford,
including its 50% interest in the joint venture. We expect that number to grow as we are seeing lots of opportunities in
this play both within the JV and outside the JV.
In our CO2 segment, we produced growth in the second quarter that exceeded our plan in the second quarter of 2010,
but that was mostly driven by higher oil and NGL prices. On the oil volume front, both SACROC and Yates were just
slightly below their plan for the quarter. NGL volumes were strong for the quarter, although our net volumes were, as
expected, below the second quarter of 2010 because of a contractual reduction in our net interest and the production
from the Snyder Gas Plant. But the volumes themselves are very strong and we also were able in the second quarter to
reduce our operating expenses several million dollars below plan.
At Katz, the production response from the recently initiated CO2 plugs remains slower than plan but is within the range
of modeled outcomes. We now expect to realize only an incremental 250 to 300 barrels per day of oil production this
year versus an original budget projection of a little over 1,000 barrels per day incremental. And all of this is in our
forecast so when I talk about where we expect to end up the year, we have reduced the Katz numbers and the
production numbers at the CO2 segment accordingly.
Over on the other side of the fence in our CO2 business, we continue to see strong demand from our customers for
additional CO2 and we're pursuing expansion opportunities in southwest Colorado to produce more CO2. In fact, the
demand is so strong in the Permian Basin for CO2 that our customers really want all they can get, which means we're
actually to the point where we are pro-rating our system, including to ourselves. Our production up in southwest
Colorado is running at 1.3 Bcf per day. That's consistent with last year. It's consistent with our budget for this year, and
we think with some tweaks we've been able to do, we can get that production up just a little bit more above our plan in
the second half of the year. In fact, we believe we will either equal or maybe set a new all-time record for CO2
production up in southwest Colorado. And it's an area that we continue to see is a major opportunity for us to expand in
the future.
In our Terminal segment, we continue to see great opportunities for growth. In the second quarter, we benefited from
both acquisitions like the Watco rail transaction and like the recent purchase of the Port Arthur terminal that handles
petcoke for Total. From those acquisitions and from internal growth – and the internal growth was led by results at our
Pasadena, Texas, liquids terminal – our coal volumes were strong, up 12% for the second quarter and 11% year-to-date.
Steel volumes, not quite as strong but still up; steel volumes were up 3% for the quarter and over 10% year-to-date. In
this segment, we continue to experience really strong demand from our customers to handle export coal.
As you recall, we are already expanding our IMT Terminal, which is south of New Orleans on the Mississippi River,
and some of our Houston facilities in both cases to accommodate customer needs under long-term contracts.
We expect to sign additional contracts, resulting in further expansions, giving us the opportunity to serve our customers
and deploy significant capital at attractive rates of return. And, in fact, our board approved another such project today.
We won't publicly release that until all of the documents are signed with our customers, which we think will be in the
next few weeks.
We're also making progress on providing rail transportation for crude oil through our joint venture with Watco. This is
in situations where the pipeline capacity is constrained and our customers want to move crude volumes by rail, and we
would expect to have additional announcements on that during this third quarter of 2011.

Our final segment, of course, is Kinder Morgan Canada, and there our financial results are good and we continue to see
strong demand for the movement of oil sands production to the West Coast of Canada and down into Washington state.
This may lead to a major expansion opportunity for our Trans Mountain system but only if and when we can reach
agreement with our shipper customers for satisfactory throughput arrangements and at adequate returns on our capital
invested to justify the expansion. That said, we will be taking steps to see just what our customers want and that will
probably result in an open season sometime during this fall of this year.
In conclusion, let me just leave you with two thoughts. One's generic and one's more specific.
First, the generic thought. While the second quarter had its share of challenges for us, the long-term opportunities for
midstream energy infrastructure development, in my judgment, have never been better during the 30-plus years I have
been in the business. We talk a lot around here about tsunamis. Those are events or things that have the ability to move
the needle, and certainly in my view the opportunities in the shale plays and export coal opportunities certainly fit the
definition of tsunami.
Looking at a more specific indication of how strong things are, we've taken a very preliminary look at 2012. It's very
preliminary but we expect growth in all five of our business segments. As we look at it, given the increased price on
our oil hedges in the CO2 segment and increased cash flow from expansion and acquisitions in both our natural gas and
terminal segments. We expect 2012 growth in KMP's distribution per unit and, therefore, in KMI's cash available for
dividends to be above our long-range projected targets of 5% growth at KMP and 10% growth at KMI. So, if you look
out, what I guess we're telling you is that in 2011, we're going to do better than we thought, and it looks like in 2012,
we're also going to be able to chin the bar at better than the numbers we talked about just a few months ago when we
were on the IPO road show.
Now that said, we'll be able to give you a lot more detail and comfort on 2012 when we've completed our budget
process in the fall. But we're very pleased we're able to raise the dividend on KMI and have another increase in the
KMP distribution.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Park.
C. Park Shaper, President & Director
All right, thanks, Rich. And I will go through the financials. I'll start on KMP, and so the financial pages are attached to
the press release, behind the text. The first financial page in KMP is the page of the income statements. I'll really just
touch on towards the bottom just above the bottom section, declared distribution per unit, as Rich mentioned, $1.15 was
what the board declared today. That is up 6% from the $1.09 in the second quarter of 2010; $2.29 for the first half of
2011 is also up 6% from the $2.16 in 2010.
With that, I'll really go to the next page, which is where we believe the actual performance is much easier to track. And,
again, towards the bottom, the second to last numbers line, you have the DCS per unit before certain items. $1.01 in the
second quarter of 2011 versus $1.06 in 2010, but our budget was $0.95 for the quarter and so the quarter was nicely
above our budgets.
Similarly, year-to-date, $2.21 compared to $2.24 for a year ago but our budget for the first half of 2011 was $2.11, so
again we are above budget through the first half of the year. That seems a little bit unusual because our coverage in the
quarter was actually negative by about $46 million, and cumulatively through the first six months, our coverage is
negative by $26 million. But again, as I just told you, we are actually above our budget; we are ahead of where we
expected to be through this point in the year; and so what you are seeing is really just the effect of seasonality and a
little bit of timing.
Now a fair amount of this, and really more than this was expected. As I said, we are above our budget and so it's really
related to seasonality. We did publish our quarterly expectations in terms of distributable cash flow per unit and, again,
we are exceeding that. It is relatively consistent with what we've seen in years past. So, again, even though year-to-date
we are under coverage by about $26 million, we are ahead of where we expected to be in our budget.

Additionally, as we look out for the full year, and Rich mentioned this, we expect that we will be above budget for the
full year. Our budgeted excess cash flow was $37 million. We are above $70 million currently as we look at our
forecast. So, that's actually down a little bit from where we were at the end of the first quarter – you may recall that –
but that's largely due to lower oil prices now than where oil prices were at the end of the first quarter. And so really
performance has continued to be strong and we believe – and we know KMP has had a very solid year year-to-date and
we expect it to have a solid year going forward. And just another way to look at that: our budgeted distributable cash
flow per unit was $4.72; our current forecast calls for distributable cash flow per unit to be north of $4.80. And that
same number was $4.43 in 2010. So, again, we're nicely above our budget, showing very strong growth from 2010.
Moving up from that line, directly above it you have net income per unit. We don't believe that's an overly meaningful
measure. I think DCF per unit is much more relevant and so going above that, you have DCF before certain items,
you'll see about $324 million; that's slightly from the second quarter of 2010 and then the $706 million year-to-date is
up $30 million from 2010. But the second quarter was up $20 million above our budget. So, again, nicely above where
we expect it to be. Immediately above that, sustaining capital expenditures, about $49 million in the quarter, a little bit
more than what we spent in the second quarter of 2010. Similarly, for the six months, we've spent a little bit more in '11
than we did in '10. We actually have spent less than our budget year-to-date, and that's something that we see in a lot of
years where sustaining capital expenditures get pushed back to the second half of the year and lots of times even to the
fourth quarter.
Our full-year forecast on sustaining capital expenditures is about $223 million, and our full-year budget is $225
million. So, we are right on top of budget in terms of our expectations for the year.
Immediately above that, some small amounts related to cash in excess of earnings for Express, Endeavor and Eagle
Ford. And, again, what this line represents is the cash distributions that are greater than the earnings that we recognize
in net income. So, you can see about a $2.6 million in the second quarter, almost $6 million year-to-date; that is above
last year. It's consistent with our expectations, although on a full-year forecast, we actually think we'll be – we will be
ahead of where we expected to be.
Book cash taxes – again, this is just the difference between cash taxes and book taxes. So, we're essentially backing out
book taxes and replacing it with cash taxes. You can see in the quarter, they were about equal. Cash taxes were a little
bit greater than book taxes in the second quarter of '11. Year-to-date, cash taxes were less than book taxes by a little
over $10 million.
Now, above that you have DD&A. DD&A is a little bit higher than it was last year and it is a little bit above our
budget. You will see Limited Partners' net income net income directly above that and you'll see that it's a little bit
lower; although if you add those two lines together and you look at net income before DD&A, then you'll see that it's
higher. We think that's a more relevant way to look at it. Again, we are looking for cash flow as opposed to accounting
earnings. And above that you have the General Partner's interest. You'll note that the second quarter of 2010 is when
we had the interim capital transaction. We treated that as if it had not occurred from a KMP perspective because if we
had not added it back in, it would have shown KMP as generating significantly more cash than what KMP generates on
a recurring basis. So, that's what's going on on that line is that it's getting added back in. So, again, those are the
components that create or add up to the distributable cash flow.
Jumping up to the top, I'll talk briefly about the segments. Rich covered a lot of this. I'll just catch some highlights. On
the Products Pipeline side, a little bit down from last year in the quarter, up about $10 million year-to-date. Now it is a
little bit under budget for the quarter but it's actually under budget by less than it is down versus last year, which again
just demonstrates that we expected the Products Pipelines to be under 2010 when we built the budget. The main reason
were – or the inventory accounting change that took place in the second quarter of 2010 and that had a positive impact
on 2010 second quarter but the second quarter of '11 did not quite overcome.
Now as we look at Products Pipelines for the year, clearly we expect very attractive growth versus 2010. As we look at
our forecast, we expect and them to come in just a little bit under their budget, about 1% under their budget for the
year. Natural Gas Pipelines, up versus last year by about $6 million; up year-to-date versus last year by about $9

million. They were slightly under their budget for the quarter but we do expect the Natural Gas Pipeline segment to be
above its budget considerably for the year largely as a result of the acquisition of the Petrohawk assets. And so Natural
Gas Pipelines will be $45 million to $50 million above its budget for the year based upon our current forecast.
CO2 side up versus last year by $27 million; year-to-date, up $37 million. The quarter was above its budget and we
expect that CO2 will come in about $10 million above its budget in terms of segment earnings before DD&A for the
year. Now as Rich mentioned that – mentioned this but it's largely driven by oil prices and NGL prices being a little bit
ahead of our budget. Volumes are just a little bit below at SACROC and at Yates and a little bit below at Katz. But,
again, altogether as we look out for the year, we expect CO2 segment to be above its budget by about $10 million.
On the terminal side for the quarter, up about $7 million versus a year ago; year-to-date, up about $26 million. They
were a little bit under budget for the quarter, largely as a function of the impact of weather and really a lot of it on our
customers and their ability to get product to us and so this is a function of flooding and tornados that disrupted some of
the product movements across the country and resulted in slightly lower volumes at some of our terminals. And then in
addition to that petcoke volumes and its earnings were a little bit lower due to some issues at some specific refineries
primarily here on the Gulf Coast.
For the year, we expect terminals will come in slightly under its budget, just a couple of million dollars on a $713
million segment earnings before DD&A budget. So, essentially right on it.
Kinder Morgan Canada, nicely above last year, about $7.5 million for the quarter, over $10 million over last year
year-to-date, and also nicely above budget for the quarter, being driven primarily by incremental volumes moving to
Washington state. As we look forward for the entire year, we expected Kinder Morgan Canada will be above their
budget for the year.
Total segment earnings before DD&A, $851 million in the quarter, up from about $811 million, about 5% growth for
the quarter. $1.73 billion year-to-date, 6% up year-to-date and a little bit ahead of our plan for the quarter. As we look
forward, our annual budget was about $3.65 billion in segment earnings before DD&A. Our current forecast has it
slightly above $3.7 billion of segment earnings before DD&A. So, again, outperformance at the segment level helping
to drive expected outperformance overall.
With that, I'll jump over DD&A and skip over the segment earnings contributions and get to G&A. And you'll see it's
about $98 million in the quarter, about $5 million greater than a year ago; about $199 million year-to-date, about $7
million ahead of a year ago. It was slightly unfavorable to budget for the quarter, although when we look forward for
the entire year, we expect that G&A, our current forecast has it less than $1 million negative to forecast. And so
essentially right on for the year.
Interest, you'll see, is up slightly, so slightly greater interest for the quarter, also for the year-to-date, but it is under
budget for the quarter and it is under budget year-to-date. We expect it will be under budget for the entire year, and
basically what's going on there relative to budget is that rate is coming in lower. Now balance will be higher than
budget as a function of the Petrohawk acquisition. But net those two will still result in a favorable variance to budget on
the interest line. And so really those are the components of net income. I'll talk about the certain items quickly. Rich
has already touched on the largest.
Now, the allocated non-cash long term compensation, we will not have any more current amounts in that line but the
past amounts show up there. Allocated non-cash employee growth share plan expense, most of this was in the first
quarter. This is not something like the line above it, not something that KMP will ever have to pay for. It will never pay
any cash; it will never pay any equity; it will never pay any funds at all or have any economic impact at all from this
compensation. But for accounting purposes, we have to reflect it here.
Acquisition costs – again, these are costs related to acquisitions that previously were capitalized – we just show them
here in certain items. Legal and environmental expenses – that's primarily environmental and is very small. The legal
reserves at $165 million, those are the rate case reserves that Rich mentioned that are primarily related to the
unfavorable decision with respect to an income tax allowance at the CPUC.

Mark to market and ineffectiveness of certain hedges, let me just remind you here, that we continue as always to reflect
the full impact of these hedges in the segments when the transactions occur. What show up down here in certain items
are the amounts that have to be mark to market in periods prior to the transactions actually taking place, and so really
ultimately all of the amounts that show up on this line will net out to zero because the total impact is reflected in the
segments when the transactions occur.
Insurance deductible, casualty losses and reimbursements – again, this is where we show the impact of insurable
events. Sometimes you see write-offs there when an event happens and then you see positive amounts come through
like you're seeing here when we recover insurance proceeds and so that's what going on on that line.
And then the gain on loss of sale of assets and asset disposition expenses, we've been talking about this item for almost
a couple of years now but we did have to take some negative amounts related to this for some environmental
remediation and writing off some book value, which itself was non-cash, but we told you we're in the process of selling
this property. We have sold the first piece of it and did realize that cash in the second quarter and that's the positive
amount that you see here. There still is another piece to come – may not happen until next year – but we're pushing
forward with that subsequent sale as well.
Prior-period asset write off, this relates to the Trailblazer fuel recovery decision that we got out of FERC that was
unfavorable. Now it did result in our writing off a receivable that we had related to fuel recoveries. What shows up in
the certain item amount is all the prior periods related to that and so prior to 2011. The 2011 impact shows up in the
segment and Rich mentioned that when he talked about the impacts on the Natural Gas segments. And then other is de
minimis.
And so those are the certain items. One thing to point out it is in the press release and we mentioned this before in
conjunction with the Petrohawk transaction, we will have to take a valuation adjustment related to the first half of
KinderHawk that we acquired in 2010. Because that transaction did not close until the third quarter, we can't take that
adjustment until the third quarter, so you will see that next quarter. And it's approximately $170 million, although the
exact amount will be defined once we come out with the third quarter results in October. So, again, that's just a little bit
of our preview for next quarter. Again, not anything different from what we had previously announced.
The first page of the income statement, if you turn back, really is not overly meaningful because the certain items are
spread throughout there. And so I don't think there is a lot of reason to spend much time on that and so with that, I will
flip to the balance sheet, which is the last financial page in the KMP package. And just running down that fairly
quickly, cash and cash equivalents are up considerably; that's a function of some cash that we had in Canada and a
function of the pre-funding that we did for the Petrohawk transaction. So, we issued equity in June and we raised cash
then, but, again, the transaction didn't close until July 1.
The balance sheet and financials are as of June 30, and so we had cash on hand that the next day was utilized for that
acquisition. Other current assets is basically flat. PP&E goes up by acquisitions, by expansion, CapEx, by sustaining
CapEx, and then goes down by DD&A, and I'll talk more about our investments when we get down and reconcile the
debt balance. Investments is up a little bit. We had the assets that we acquired, including Watco because that did not
close until this year. Eagle Ford investment, the Deeprock acquisition, and then on REX and MEP some balances
moving the other way.
Deferred charges and other assets, that's largely the mark to market of the hedges. Notes payable and current maturities
of long term debt, we didn't have any commercial paper outstanding at the end of the quarter, but we do have the two
maturities here. Really it's one maturity and one put in the first quarter of 2012. We talked about this last quarter. We
have a maturity of $450 million, comes due middle of March, 2012. We also have a debt issue that can be put to us on
February 1, 2012.
As we said last quarter, we would love for that issue to be put to us. It's a 9% issue. We can refinance it at a much
lower rate. We do not expect that it will be, and so in all likelihood this amount will stay here until the end of the first
quarter in 2012 and then that number will move back into long-term debt. But again, if anyone wants to put those
securities to us, we're happy to take them.

Other current liabilities is basically flat. Long-term debt is up a little bit, and I'll talk about that when we reconcile the
debt. The value of interest rate swaps essentially just moves with the forward curve of interest rates. And then and other
is where you see the rate case reserve being added in, and so it's up about $170 million.
Accumulated other comprehensive loss largely moves with the mark to market on the hedges. Other partners' capital is
up over $300 million as a function of the equity issuance and I'll get into that in more detail in a minute. So, the total
balance sheet is about $22.3 billion; it's up about $0.5 billion from where it was at the beginning of the year.
Looking at total debt, a little over $11 billion at the end of the quarter. At the beginning of the year, we were at about
$11.4 billion. At the end of the first quarter we were a little under $11.6 billion. So, debt has actually come down $517
million in the quarter and come down $356 million year-to-date.
Now again, largely that is a result of the pre-funding of the Petrohawk acquisition. And so you'll see debt-to-EBITDA
of about 3.4 times. Now again that was temporary, the very next day the debt went up because we closed on the
Petrohawk transaction. And so we're really around about 3.65 to 3.7 times right now, although as we've said before, we
believe that that really understates the strength of the balance sheet, because that number is with all of the debt
outstanding related to the acquisition but includes none of the EBITDA, because we're doing a trailing 12 months
EBITDA number here. We are not pro forma-ing our EBITDA for acquisitions and expansions that come on
throughout the year.
So, really, we think that – or we know that our balance sheet is stronger than that. But if we look forward to where we
expect to be when we end the year, we'll probably end the year right around that range, in the 3.6 to 3.7 range. That's a
little bit higher than where our budget was, and the reason why it's higher for the exact same reason that I just
mentioned is the Petrohawk transaction. All of the debt will be outstanding related to that and of course we financed a
significant portion of it with equity, but again there is a debt portion of that and only part of the EBITDA will have
been earned, only half a year by the time we get to the end of the year. But again, that's where we expect to end 2011.
As we look at it right now, a little bit above our budget in terms of debt-to-EBITDA but still a very strong balance sheet
especially when you take into account the fact that that number is understated or conservative.
And so the debt reconciliation. As I mentioned, debt went down by about $517 million in the quarter and down by $356
million year-to-date. Now we invested in the quarter, in capital expenditures, a little over $230 million; in acquisitions,
a little under $70 million; in contribution to JVs, a little under $40 million. So, those are the investments in the quarter.
Year-to-date and CapEx, about $450 million; acquisitions a little over $80 million; contributions to JV, just under $60
million; and then the Chevron settlement, which was in the first quarter, was $63 million.
So, offsetting that, the cash that we raised during the quarter and year-to-date: first, for the quarter, the equity offerings,
$561 million: the at-the-market program raised equity of $83 million; KMR distributions raised equity of $107 million.
We issued about $24 million of equity for an acquisition and so that went out and then the General Partner contributed
about $8 million. And then we had a source of cash of about $65 million in the quarter. The same numbers for the
year-to-date, again the equity offering happened in the quarter, it was $560 million; the at-the-market program has
generated $165 million of equity issuance through the first six months; KMR has generated $211 million of equity
issuance through the first six months. Again, we put out about $24 million in conjunction with an acquisition. General
Partners contributed about $9 million and working capital and other items have been a source of cash of a little over
$30 million.
And so looking at the working capital and other items, again, a source of about $65 million in the quarter. Largely that's
come from a crude interest offset a little bit by other current assets and other current liabilities. Those are the big things
that generated the cash in the quarter. For the year-to-date, a source of cash of about $35 million. AR and AP generated
about $70 million. Other current assets and other current liabilities were a use of cash of about $50 million, and then a
few other items provided another $15 million source of cash.
And talking about the expansion, CapEx, as I mentioned, in the quarter about $230 million; for the year, about $450
million. Products was about $31 million to that in the quarter, a little over $50 million year-to-date, that's the
continuation of the Carson tank expansion, the Travis Air Force Base expansion, and the Cochin East leg expansion.

On the natural gas side, about $26 million in the quarter; a little over $40 million year-to-date. Largely that's the
projects going on in the Eagle Ford. Although what shows up in this number are just the pieces of that that are 100%
ours. The portions that are a part of the JV are in the JV contributions, and I'll get to those in just a minute.
CO2, about $117 million for the quarter, over $230 million year-to-date. A lot of that – or most of that going on at
SACROC and then, of course, the ongoing expansion at Katz. On the terminal side, a little under $60 million for the
quarter, about $120 million year-to-date, and that's a whole variety of smaller projects that are going on there.
And in Kinder Morgan Canada, about $3 million for the quarter, $5 million year-to-date. And then the contributions to
JV, as you may remember that I mentioned, a little under $40 million for the quarter and a little under $60 million for
the year. Most of that has gone to the Eagle Ford; it's about a little less than $30 million in the quarter and a little over
$40 million year-to-date. And we've also made some contributions to Red Cedar and to the Deeprock joint venture,
which is the oil tanks at Cushing that we bought into at the beginning of this year. And that is it for KMP.
I will move on to KMI and, again, similarly attached to the text, you'll find the KMI financial pages. The first page
there is a summary of our cash available to pay dividends. So, starting at the top there, it starts with the GP distribution.
One thing to recall when we talk about KMI, we are talking about what we have received in these quarters and so this is
based upon dividends and distributions paid and received by KMI during the quarter.
So, in the second quarter, the General Partner distribution increased by over 12% to $290 million. For the year-to-date
it's increased almost 13% to $575 million. Similarly the distributions on the KMP units and the KMR shares have gone
up. Now primarily as a function of the distributions themselves going up – the per unit and per share distributions going
up – but also recall that every quarter, we own more KMR shares and so there's a compounding impact there.
Total KMP distributions to us, $330 million in the quarter, up almost 12%; $654 million year-to-date, up over 12%,
almost 12.5%. NGPL PipeCo distributions to us, you'll see almost $6 million in the quarter, about $10 million
year-to-date. That's a little bit below our budget, although for the full year, our full year forecast we do expect NGPL
distributions to be on budget. Total distributions received, $336 million; it's up almost 14% for the quarter but that's in
part because there was not an NGPL distribution in the second quarter of '10.
For the six months, $664 million is up 11% from the second quarter of 2010. G&A, essentially consistent with our
budget. We actually expected slightly unfavorable and we expect it to be slightly unfavorable for the year, but it's
around $1 million in total and its related to legal costs and a little bit of incremental tax expense that's really related to
some state tax consulting work that has resulted in much greater savings. It's just that those savings show up on the
cash tax line, not in G&A.
Interest expense – now remember that this is cash interest expense and so we have small payments in the second
quarter and the fourth quarter, big payments in the first quarter and the third quarter. A little bit favorable to budget
year-to-date and expected for the year.
And then cash taxes, down below, is essentially on budget for the first six months, but when we look forward for the
year, we actually expect and it's actually slightly favorable for the first six months. It will be a little bit unfavorable to
budget, really for reasons that I'm going to get into a minute when I talk about the complete full-year forecast.
So, cash available to pay dividends, about $154 million for the quarter, $405 million year-to-date. And just thinking
about seasonality there, because if you look at the dividends – and the right way to look at this is the dividends that
were paid during the quarter – they were $205 million essentially in each quarter. Now some of you may recall that a
portion of the dividend that normally would have been paid in the second quarter was actually paid in the first quarter
because it related to the period in the first quarter prior to which we were public.
But again, effectively, there was a $205 million dividend in each quarter, which means if you look at the second quarter
of '11, you know that we didn't fully cover that. Now that's going to be normal seasonality for the second quarter
because we have two tax payments in the second quarter. And so, we went through this before but just to refresh
everybody's memory on kind of the big swings quarter-to-quarter.

In the first quarter, we tend to have high coverage because we have no tax payments. Now we do have a cash interest
payment but still we tend to have high coverage in the first quarter. In the second quarter, we tend to have low coverage
because we have two tax payments. The third quarter tends to be a low coverage because we have a tax payment and an
interest payment. And in the fourth quarter tends to be high coverage because we have a tax payment but no interest
payments.
Now then, the other things that are going on, again, just seasonally, is sometimes the NGPL distributions move around
and you can see that because we've received about $10 million year-to-date and I said that we expect to be on our
full-year budget, our full-year budget is $33 million. And so, those will be greater in the second half than they were in
the first half.
Additionally, the distributions from KMP tend to grow quarter-to-quarter because we grow distributions at KMP. So,
that means that KMI receives more. And so, again, beyond kind of the cash taxes and the cash interest you get from
KMP, you should expect a increase in distributions every quarter. Now, and Rich mentioned this, we have taken the
dividend for the third quarter that will be paid in the third quarter to $0.30, so that will be paid in August. We are on
track to generate greater than $830 million of cash available to pay dividends and our budget was $820 million. Really
a lot of that comes in the second half of the year when the General Partner incentive is going to be above our budget.
Now in conjunction with that, as I mentioned a minute ago, when the General Partner incentive is above budget, it is
fully taxable and so our cash taxes also will be above budget in the second half of the year. But, again, as we look at
our forecast we expect to be above $830 million for the entire year and that is what made us comfortable in increasing
the dividend to $0.30.
Now one other thing, just to think about with respect to KMI. Again, because we do it all on a paid basis, both in terms
of what we received and in terms of our forecast for the dividend that we will pay, once we're past November then the
KMI budget year is essentially done. I mean it's done in terms of what we expect to receive because we received
essentially all of our distributions from KMP at that point once the November distribution is paid. And it's also done in
terms of our budgeted and forecasted 2011 KMI dividend, because what we budgeted and forecasted is what we will
pay during the four quarters of 2011. So, when we talked about the $1.29 – sorry, $1.16 for the year, that was what was
going to be paid in the four quarters of 2011. Again, just something to keep in mind, another nuance of going off a paid
versus declared.
The next page is the income statement for KMI. I'm not going to spend any time on this. I don't think that it is overly
helpful in seeing what drives KMI. I really believe that the first page is; I think that lays out all of the drivers for KMI.
This also consolidates KMP. So, most of the movements that you see in here are related to KMP. It includes all the
certain items at KMP, and it includes all of the certain items at KMI. Just to refresh your memory, some of the certain
items that are at KMI but not at KMP will include the special bonus, although that showed up in part of KMP, as well.
The shareholder litigation, but especially the insurance recovery from the shareholder litigation shows up here. We
have not counted that as ongoing recurring cash flow. And then there are purchase accounting effects that show up here
that, again, I think distort the understanding of what is driving KMI.
There is one thing that I'll point out – when you get down to diluted earnings per common share, you'll see that there
are two numbers there and it's true, the basic earnings per common share as well. There is the Class C shares and the
Class A shares, and the Class A share amount is actually less than the Class P share amount. The only reason for that is
because there is some sharing amongst the Class A, the Class Bs and the Class Cs, and you'll find this in footnote 2.
But keep in mind that the total number of P shares that all of the As, Bs and Cs can convert into, it sticks. And what
that means is however things are divided between the As, Bs and Cs, the Ps have no impact. However this stuff is
divided between the As, Bs and Cs has no impact on the Ps. It will never dilute the Ps; it will never impact the Ps. It's
all just amongst; it is a pot and it's a fixed pot and it just – what will be determined going forward is how it's split
between the As, Bs and Cs. So, again, this number that you see there, the diluted earnings per common share for Class
A shares and the basic earnings per common share for Class A shares has no meaning and really there's not any reason
to pay attention to it. And there's not really and real reason, or there's not any real information you're going to glean
from the basic earnings per common share for the Class P shares as well. I think it's much more relevant to focus on the
cash flow on the first page.

Now the next page is the reconciliation between income from continuing operations and cash available to pay
dividends. I went through this in some detail last quarter. I'm not going to go through it in detail this quarter. Now the
reconciliation is there; you can look at it. If you have questions on it, we're happy to address them.
And so the last page, on the KMI financials is the balance sheet. Now this is the true KMI balance sheet, which means
it consolidates KMP. We do break out the KMP amount so that you can see the differences. Now that being said, there
are still distortions. For example, the property plant and equipment net KMI line – it's about four lines down from the
top – KMI does not actually have $2.4 billion of assets. What KMI has is investments in KMP and an investment in
NGPL. But because of the purchase accounting that had to be implemented at the time of the MBO. KMI has to carry
KMP's assets at a greater value than where KMP carries them. And so the vast majority of that $2.4 billion that you see
there relates to purchase accounting adjustments on KMP assets when they get consolidated into KMI. Again, I'm only
bringing this up because, again, I don't think that these numbers are overly meaningful. What is relevant are the debt
numbers and we show that down at the bottom and, again, as always, we'll take you through what's going on there.
So, KMI's debt, about $3.2 billion, a little over $3.2 billion. It's up about $17 million from where it was at the end of
2010. It's also up about $42 million from where it was at the end of the first quarter. And so, first starting with the
quarter change of $42 million, we had cash flow during the quarter of $154 million. We had dividends of $100 million.
Now normally that would have been the $205 million that I mentioned, but remember, a portion of that was paid in the
first quarter, and so the dividends actually paid in the quarter were just $100 million.
We paid out the special bonus, which was cash but didn't actually come from the company. We paid out that bonus of
$100 million in the quarter. We had a tax benefit that doesn't show up in our recurring cash taxes because it really was
a one-time benefit of $21 million, so that was a positive. We did get KMR distributions of $15 million that were not
converted to cash and so that is the use of cash. And then we had some fees and the General Partner contribution to
KMP of about a few more million dollars, which gets you to the $42 million essentially increase in debt.
Per year-to-date, debt's gone up about $17 million. We generated $405 million. We paid dividends of $410 million,
except the $64 million of that $410 million was retained in order to fund the after-tax amount of the $100 million
bonus, and so the total dividends paid is really $410 million less $64 million. Then, again, the $100 million went out.
We had the tax benefit for the year of about $21 million. KMR, again, was in essence a use of cash of $30 million
because we received those shares but we haven't yet converted them to cash. We had the MBO insurance receivable of
$46 million and then we had some fees and the GP contribution, which got us to $17 million of increase in debt
year-to-date.
So, again, those are the things that are going on impacting the debt balance. The big items, again, are just cash
generated and dividends paid. Although, again this year there's a little bit of noise because of the timing on when the
dividends were paid and because of the special bonus that was paid and the dividends that were retained as part of that.
And that is KMI. I'll give it back to Rich.

<Q - Darren Horowitz – Raymond James & Associates>: Good, thank you. Rich, I have just a couple of quick
questions; I want to go back to an earlier point regarding CO2. Can you just talk about the associated cost increase
production out of southwest Colorado above that 1.3 Bcf a day level? And, specifically, any additional color into the
scale of expansion opportunities you're evaluating would be very helpful.
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Okay, yeah, I'll start, and then I'll ask Tim Bradley,
who is sitting next to me – he heads up our CO2 segment – to talk about it, but basically we have a lot of demand from
customers very interested in signing significant long-term contracts that would be additive to the 1.3 billion cubic feet a
day that we're now moving, producing in Colorado and then moving down the line to the Permian. The costs associated
with that would involve, obviously, producing the CO2 in southwest Colorado and then either expanding the present
infrastructure to get it down to the Permian or building new infrastructure that would tie into other areas of the
Permian, and with that, I'll kind of let Tim take a crack at it.
<A - Richard Bradley – President-CO2 & Vice President>: Thank you, Rich. Our current look at what we are
planning to initiate an expansion on would include an increase of capacity by approximately 100 million cubic feet a
day above what our current production capacity is, and that type of expansion may very well last us for upwards of 10
years at that increased capacity, and the total capital costs of this project is still under study as a result of the front end
engineering money that we talked about last quarter, but would be on the order of $500 million, $600 million of
investment over the next several years.
If customers are willing to sign up for that increased take; we do have recent conversations with another customer that
is asking us to consider a proposal that would be a much more significant increase than just 100 million cubic feet a
day. Those discussions are very early; it's probably premature to get into that, but that's another element of our
valuation that we're going to start undertaking at present time that might increase the capacity by another 200 million
feet a day or even more beyond what we are currently producing. So, this is a bit of work in progress, and we're hoping
to pin these things down from an operational standpoint as well as from a contractual standpoint in the weeks and
months to come.
<Q - Darren Horowitz – Raymond James & Associates>: Okay. I appreciate the color. Rich, final question from me,
regarding that new 300,000 barrel a day crude-condensate line out of the Eagle Ford, recognizing that you guys are
further along with producers, but can at this point you give us a sense of the capacity commitments by third-parties that
you're targeting? I'm really just trying to get a feel beyond that initial 50,000 barrel a day anchor commitment. The
level of additional commitments that could be forthcoming and more importantly, the associated return on that $220
million project as that capacity gets committed.
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think we said last time, Darren, that even if
we didn't move any more than the 50,000 barrels a day, it provides an adequate return above our cost of capital. So,
anything on top of that would just increase. There is a couple of moving parts there. One is the volume, and we
certainly expect to fill the great bulk of the 300,000 barrels a day over some time period. The second moving part is
that we're perfectly willing to expand that system outside of Cuero to pick-up additional volumes. Some volumes lend
themselves to coming into the line at Cuero and some would involve expansions, which would be additional capital,
and that capital cost would get plugged into figuring up what our overall return is. So, it just depends on where in the
Eagle Ford play the producers want to intersect our line to move their volumes. But we think it's going to be a very
good project. We said earlier we would expect to get at least a mid-teens return on the overall project and maybe
significantly better than that.
<Q - Darren Horowitz – Raymond James & Associates>: I appreciate it, Rich. Thank you.
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you.

<Q - Bradley Olsen – Tudor Pickering Holt & Co>: Tudor Pickering Holt. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Good afternoon, Brad.
<Q - Bradley Olsen – Tudor Pickering Holt & Co>: Just a couple of quick ones, on the Natural Gas segment, I
guess, I was kind of expecting a little bit of a sequential ramp from first quarter to second quarter, just given the fact
that you have improving volumes on the KinderHawk system as well as the fact that Fayetteville Express is coming
online. Could you discuss just a little bit? You mentioned that it was Rockies Express property tax as well as some
issues at KMIGT. Are there issues on either of those – kind of either of those systems that are going to be persisting or
do you expect kind of a return to the margin levels from the first quarter going forward?
<A - C. Shaper – President & Director>: We typically have seasonality in the Natural Gas Pipeline segment. I think
we have published those, I mean, truthfully, you can just go historically and look at our segment earnings before
DD&A for the segment for the last few years and you will see that. And so what we saw this quarter was not unusual
and actually was expected.
Now the segment was a tiny bit under its budget, but we're talking about $2 million under its budget and so it was
consistent with our expectations. And so, I apologize if you were expecting sequential growth but I do recommend that
you go and you look at our historic seasonality and the numbers that we have put out that kind of show and lay out that
seasonality by segment and you will see how these things vary by season.
<Q - Bradley Olsen – Tudor Pickering Holt & Co>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: And the point on FEP, Fayetteville was in service on
the 1st of January of this year, so that was in both quarters.
<Q - Bradley Olsen – Tudor Pickering Holt & Co>: Okay. And there was no volume ramp-up? I guess I was just
looking at the significantly higher transportation volumes for this quarter?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well, that's compared with the second quarter a year
ago and of course it is because Fayetteville wasn't online the second quarter a year ago. There is a ramp-up but most of
the ramp-up is later this year.
<Q - Bradley Olsen – Tudor Pickering Holt & Co>: Right, okay, great. Thanks for that and as far as the charge that
you guys took in the PUC, the PUC case, are you guys thinking about how that might be allocated to the extent that it
would become a realized cash charge? Would you guys kind of approach it with the same way that you did the Santa Fe
settlement with an ICT, or how would you determine that being distributed between KMP and KMI?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well, let me say, first of all, of course, it's a long
way from here to Tipperary. We are going to appeal this and we'll just see what the – how the orders come out but if
and when the cash payments for refunds are actually due, we think at this time we probably would not require an ICT,
we obviously have a great deal of accumulated excess coverage over the years; but we just have to look at that and see
what our cumulative coverage is at that time and what it looks like going forward and where we are with regard to
when the actual cash payments get made.
<A - C. Shaper – President & Director>: We did take an ICT previously a year ago and we believed at that time that
that was going to be sufficient to cover the payments due then and any future payments. Now we were not counting on
the fact that the CPUC would refuse an income tax allowance and that's what resulted in the additional reserve this
period. But the ICT analysis is different from the accounting reserve analysis and so, as Rich says, we'll make that
determination at that time. I think the important thing is what we stated, when the decision came out and what we
reiterated in the earnings release is that we don't expect the payment of refunds to have any impact on the KMP
distribution or on the KMI dividend.
<Q - Bradley Olsen – Tudor Pickering Holt & Co>: Okay, great. And just one more question as far as the Watco
investment, you guys mentioned that there might be some announcements forthcoming throughout the third quarter.

Would you expect that those announcements have anything to do with rail projects which might help alleviate the
bottleneck at Cushing or are those more related to I think the Eagle Ford kind of area project that you and Watco might
have announced or made an announcement earlier this year about pursuing?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. No we expect to make announcements on at
least one of those and hopefully on both of them, but we think we may have more than one announcement but certainly
both of those are areas we're involved in.
<Q - Bradley Olsen – Tudor Pickering Holt & Co>: Great.
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: And this looks very good from the standpoint of –
again, that we talked about this at length on the last call, I won't go over it again, but our customers who want rail
capacity both in the Eagle Ford, and in fact in the Eagle Ford in some areas we're even going to be providing some
truck capacity for them to get them to a central point. So, anything we can do to help our customers on an interim basis
until pipeline capacity gets built up, we want to do and that specifically applies to the situation that presently exists in
Oklahoma, of course.
<Q - Bradley Olsen – Tudor Pickering Holt & Co>: Great, thanks a lot for the color.

Next question comes from John Tysseland. Could you please announce your company.
<Q - John Tysseland – Citigroup Global Markets (United States)>: Hi, guys, good afternoon. Citigroup. Rich, I
suppose once again we're seeing a number of different pipeline projects being announced, except this time on the crude
oil side of business. I'm interested on how you're approaching build-out costs this time around and what your, what
you've seen if any on cost escalations for the infrastructure, particularly at the Eagle Ford. Are your projects turnkey at
this point or have you just built in some cushion there?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we think we have the detailed engineering and
we have already contracted for the long lead time items and, so far, if anything we're running a bit under our estimate
on the condensate line, just a bit under the $220 million, but I wouldn't reduce that at this time, I think that's about
where we'll end up. We think we have numbers that embrace what the current situation is. And again, we've already
tied up the long lead time items.
<A - C. Shaper – President & Director>: And further protection to us, just remember that a significant portion of the
crude-condensate line is conversion of an existing line and so it doesn't require that we lay new pipe, we just have to do
some work to convert it from gas service to crude or condensate service.
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Just on some other indications, you know, with
regard to our joint venture line with Copano, that is basically finished now going into service on August 1 and that's
coming in right at its budget. So, we are not seeing any kind of wild inflation on the pipeline side and I know there have
been some increases, some of the upstream players have reported in Eagle. But thus far, we have not seen that on the
pipeline side, the kind of assets that we're putting in.
<Q - John Tysseland – Citigroup Global Markets (United States)>: And then I think back to Park's kind of point on
the conversion, I mean obviously that gives you a lot of cost advantage there. And during your cost cap, you could
charge a lower rate, do you just kind of see it as if producers do want to sign up for capacity or incremental capacity
coming out of that region that this is a low-cost option or do you see, I guess, some of the pipelines going to Corpus
Christi as being competitive?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well, certainly, I think any pipeline coming out of
the Eagle produced competitive. As we said before, it's a different mix of opportunities that are provided at Corpus
Christi. Clearly, if you can get into Houston, you have much more refining capacity. If you want to look just how that
condensate is going to get used, you have more opportunities for usage in Houston. Now you can get to Corpus and

once you've used up whatever you're going to use in refineries there, you can barge it out and there are plusses and
minuses to that. But we think what we're offering is very competitive and even to the extent that we think that
eventually we will be able to make use of some of our huge tankage position that passes into Galena Park for some of
this. And there is even talk, as I think you know, some of this actually going up, explore or elsewhere, and going all the
way through Southern Lights up into Alberta to be used in diluent.
I think that in the long run there is going to be just a hell of a lot of condensate coming out of the Eagle Ford. It's going
to seek the highest and best use. Some of it will end up in refineries in Houston, some in Corpus; some will go over to
Baton Rouge and go into other pipelines there. Some, I think, will end up being used as diluent. It's just all kinds of
different uses, and some of that depends on the exact grade of condensate coming through the line and there will be
blending opportunities. So, we think overall, we're going to offer, we hope, something close to one-stop shopping, but
there is lot of competition out there, and there will be a lot of good services offered to people who are producing
condensate in the Eagle Ford and that should be the case.
<Q - John Tysseland – Citigroup Global Markets (United States)>: That's great color and very helpful. On the –
does that mean that you potentially could be looking at some more Eastern tankage expansions given what's going on
right now?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: We are looking at those opportunities, yes.
<Q - John Tysseland – Citigroup Global Markets (United States)>: Yeah, and then lastly, a quick clarification
question on the S&T business in the CO2 segment. Is the strong demand that you mentioned for incremental volumes
for CO2, is that purely from third parties or is that incremental demand from KMP's own operations?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: That's from third parties, John.
<Q - John Tysseland – Citigroup Global Markets (United States)>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs & Co.>: Thanks. If I could get you to come back to – I know I appreciate the sort
of preliminary look on the 2012 outlook. Can you break down, if you say you are going to be above budget, how much
of that is, would you say, attributable to the CO2 segment in oil prices versus how much of it is the acquisition activity
you've done, the organic growth? Can you give us a little more detail there?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: No, I think, again, we've just done an overview at
the treetop level and I think to give any more color on it will need to wait till we get through the budget process, which
as usual we will put out in the mid-November timeframe.
<A - C. Shaper – President & Director>: I mean, if you wanted to calculate the impact of the hedges yourself, I
mean, we do publish what our hedge profile is, and so you can go and run those calculations.
<A>: There is an $18 increase in the hedge price.
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Does that help you?
<Q - Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs & Co.>: Yeah, that is helpful. Thank you. And then if you could talk a little bit
more about, you sound like you're pretty positive on the acquisition of Petrohawk, how much more upside you might
see in the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford from the acquisition?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well, you all need to judge that, too. The numbers
that we saw published by BHP show that, contrasted with Petrohawk spending about $2.9 billion, I think, at the present
time for drilling, that BHP said they were going to take it to $4 billion in 2015 and $6 billion by 2020. I believe those
are the numbers. Someone forwarded it to us, their actual presentation, that's where I took those numbers out of. So,

who knows exactly how it will turn out but I think the positive thing is clearly, this is a huge investment by BHP and I
think you will see them ramp up the drilling program and the production in the Haynesville and for that matter in the
Eagle Ford also.
But certainly, I think it will be a positive for our investment in both places and, again I know there is some Doubting
Thomas' out there about the Haynesville, we're very positive this is an area that's going to be producing for 30 years or
more to come and just by way of volume, you know, we're now over, we actually in the last couple of weeks of June
crossed over the Bcf a day. We're now running modestly above a Bcf a day. We said that's what we projected we would
average for the year and we hope to end the year at about 1.2 Bcf a day. So, we're over the one Bcf and still growing
now. So, we think that Haynesville is going to turn out to be a very good investment for us.
<Q - Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs & Co.>: That's helpful. Thanks. If I could just one more, do you have any
updates on the Bakken, I know you've tried to get some volumes on the Cochin there. Any update on the success you're
having there?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: We're still in negotiations and talking about our two
or three different alternatives and but no specific update at this time.

Next question comes from John Edwards with Morgan Keegan. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Hey John, how are you doing?
<Q - John Edwards – Morgan Keegan>: Yeah, good afternoon, Rich, doing well, thank you. Just real quick, you
mentioned very strong demand for CO2, and I'm just wondering, as far as pricing, are you seeing that firm up as well?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, our – and I'll let Tim jump in on that, but yes,
we are seeing a firming up of pricing. Tim?
<A - Richard Bradley – President-CO2 & Vice President>: Yes, I think without getting too specific, it's – we do
have a number of different customers and variety of different contracts but generally over the years our CO2
contracting has been tied to a certain percentage of oil price and what we're seeing is that that percentage of oil price is
increasing. So, we're able to capitalize on the tightening supply-demand picture by increasing the price; obviously, with
current oil prices being approximately $100 a barrel, the calculated value is going up as well as the percentage. So, very
strong conditions for us to look at some significant expansion opportunities.

<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: We'll just look at that. I think the third quarter would
probably be a good time when we would look at it. Right now, as Park said, we look to be well above plan and we run
our numbers for the third quarter, and I think, as Park mentioned, that's looking above plan in the third quarter also. So,
I think we will just look at that. Now, we're not going to do anything crazy here, because to us maintaining a healthy
level of excess coverage is important, so – but if the year continues to develop as well as it looks like it will, we are
going to look seriously at that for the third and fourth quarter.
<A - C. Shaper – President & Director>: And Rich, you actually reminded me of something that I forgot to say
earlier, but I talked about the second half, I didn't necessarily break it down by quarter. If we look at our forecast right
now by quarter, we have just slight coverage of our expected distribution in the third quarter and so then that means we
have tremendous coverage in the fourth quarter and that gets us to the excess coverage that we're talking about for the
year. So, again, I just wanted to provide that information for everybody's benefit.
<Q - Brian Zarahn – Barclays Capital, Inc.>: And then on expansion CapEx for 2011, are you looking at $2.5 billion
or above that figure?
<A>: $2.5 billion.
<A - C. Shaper – President & Director>: Yeah, including acquisitions.
<A>: Including Petrohawk acquisition.
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Including Petrohawk acquisition, about $2.5 billion.
<Q - Brian Zarahn – Barclays Capital, Inc.>: Okay, and then regarding the – BHP's acquisition of Petrohawk, does
that increase or decrease the probability of you acquiring the remaining stake at EagleHawk?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: We really don't know that. We will just have to see
what BHP's attitude is on that. We certainly – assuming the price is reasonable, we certainly would want to do just what
we did with KinderHawk, which is at the appropriate time, when we have a willing seller, and the thing's built out a
little more, to go ahead and buy the rest of it, but that will be a decision BHP will have to make, and we look forward to
working with them any way we can, because they'll be our biggest customer on KinderHawk up in the Haynesville and
we'll have this joint venture with them down in the Eagle Ford, so we want to work with them and we'll just see how
things come out.
<Q - Brian Zarahn – Barclays Capital, Inc.>: Okay. And then on the Products Pipeline business, the Central
Florida's volumes, do you expect that to be a short term issue or more sustained due to increased competition?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: It just depends on – the issue there is, of course,
we're a little bit captive of our customers. Our customers are bringing refined products into our terminal in Tampa and a
couple other terminals besides. And then, some of it will get distributed in the Tampa area and then some get put into
pipeline and moved over to Orlando where we have the terminal and distributed from that point. And what we've had is
competing terminal up at Port Canaveral that has brought in supply that the supply is apparently considerably cheaper
than – because of the source of supply, considerably cheaper.
So, that it's not really a matter of the tariff on the pipeline itself, because they've been able to take some volume away,
particularly in that area east of Orlando where they are trucking in. Now I have no idea whether that's supply source or
cheaper supply is going to stay or not, but I suspect it will not be permanent, but I don't know exactly when that would
change.
<Q - Brian Zarahn – Barclays Capital, Inc.>: Okay, final question. Are there any updates to your crude oil hedges?

Next question comes from Yves Siegel with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Yves, how are you doing?
<Q - Yves Siegel – Aroya Capital>: Terrific, thank you. Just if I could have some clarifying questions, just going back
to CO2. Tim, did you mention what you thought the infrastructure investment would be if you increase capacity on the
production side?
<A - Richard Bradley – President-CO2 & Vice President>: We have preliminary numbers now, Yves, at
approximately $600 million increased capacity by 100 million feet a day, but also to sustain that increased production
capacity for nearly a decade, that doesn't include the pipe options. The pipe options are still a bit up in the air, we might
be able to squeeze that additional capacity in our core test system or there may be alternative dispositions that we want
to evaluate and add to that capital aspect, but again that's very early estimates and we're still doing some front-end
engineering work to refine those estimates. And those numbers include both the cost of well drilling as well as facilities
that would be associated with that increased production.
<Q - Yves Siegel – Aroya Capital>: What's the timeline if you were to go forward with that?
<A - Richard Bradley – President-CO2 & Vice President>: The first phase of the project if we were to be able to
contract the volumes and to secure the approval of our board would be hopefully later this year, early next year, to get
that project evaluated and put forth. Really, the first phase of it, which would be approximately the first 50 million feet
a day or so.
<Q - Yves Siegel – Aroya Capital>: And how quick could you turn that investment into revenue?
<A - Richard Bradley – President-CO2 & Vice President>: Probably a two-year total construction project based
upon our recent history. When we've expanded McElmo Dome and did the Doe Canyon development we started that in
2006. It didn't get completely finished until sometime in 2008. So, I think that that's a reasonable framework to assume
at this point.
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: But as we will be talking about bring it on piecemeal
as we went and, for instance, there is a 50 million a day that could come on more quickly than the rest of it.
<Q - Yves Siegel – Aroya Capital>: Okay, could you also just expand again on what you are thinking on Trans
Mountain and how much capital that might absorb if you were to go ahead with it?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, this is, that has the potential of being an
enormous project, but again I don't want to get out in front of ourselves. The advantage that we have at Trans
Mountain, as you recall, Yves, is that we can expand it piecemeal – and this is all public data we have talked about
before and certainly with our customers. But just an order of magnitude to get something. We now move 300,000
barrels a day on this system. To get the next phase, which is some earlier partial looping in certain areas to get at

60,000 to 80,000 barrels additional, is about, we believe about $1.3 billion. If you wanted to go to 300,000 barrels a
day, which is a number some people have mentioned, then on top of what I just mentioned probably another – and
these are ballpark figures – something in the range of $3 billion.
But all of that is – I think that what I would take away from it is it would be large projects but it could be done
incrementally and it just depends on what the customers wanted. Right now, as you know, there is a lot of interest in
getting to ports on the West Coast. We could build ours, in relative terms, pretty quickly. But again, we're not going to

<Q - Yves Siegel – Aroya Capital>: And when do you think you may know if the customers would decide to go ahead
with it?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think in fact we're going to be up there next
week in Calgary going through with our team up there, so we'll know more after that. But I think they're certainly
thinking that sometime this fall we'll be able to go out, whether it's a full blown open season or what we're not certain
yet, but we would hope to get some kind of indication this fall as to what, if anything, our customers want to do. But
the advantage we have and I don't want to oversell it because, again, there's lot of issues on doing this, but the
advantage we have is the ability to do piecemeal. If you want to pick up 60,000 or 80,000 barrels, we can do that
relatively quickly with much lower cost throughput agreements than if you're going to build 500,000 barrels, obviously,
one time for billions of dollars.
So, that's an advantage we have and we also have a right-of-way that we've been on for 50 years and we think we have
pretty good relationships with the First Nations tribes along that right-of-way. But that is no guarantee that you won't
have drawn out proceedings with them and that you won't have issues to get this thing done. So, we're trying to be very
realistic about it. We think we offer a very good alternative, which seems – you know that old saying, it seems its time
has come but we'll just have to see how all this plays out.
<Q - Yves Siegel – Aroya Capital>: And then, Rich, on Rockies Express, what's the thought process of potentially
reversing some of that line?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well, it started out, I guess, in the mind of a reporter
who asked the question and we said – Mark Kissel, who runs our western pipeline said, well, yeah, we might do a back
haul and might move volumes west through displacement and I guess the confusion was that he thought displacement
was we're going to turn the line around. Look, if our customers wanted to reverse that line and wanted us to reverse that
line tomorrow, we'd be happy to work with them and do it. Now we've got contracts that still have 8.5 years to run that
call for us to move from west to east and it's completely full right now.
So, one would think that certainly as you have more production in the Marcellus, the first thing you would do is
actually have a displacement. So, for example, you could actually redeliver molecules coming into the line on the east
part of the system in Opal Wyoming and have that go on Ruby out to the West Coast. So, you actually, in theory, could
be somebody producing a molecule and Marcellus could actually get it to Oregon. Whether that happens, I don't know,
but that would certainly be a displacement. Back haul arrangements would be the first thing you would do long before
you reverse the line.
At some point in time you could reverse that line, you would have to add some, change some compression on some of
the stations and it depends on how far you wanted to go. I think we are far, a long distance from reversing that line. But
again, we've said so many times, if you have pipe in the ground I think you have a huge advantage and we'll make it do
whatever our customers want us to do in the long term with that very valuable huge 42-inch conduit that we have in
Rex.
<Q - Yves Siegel – Aroya Capital>: Let's just pretend I didn't ask that question, okay? And here is the last question,
and I am pretty sure I know the answer to it, but at Kinder Morgan, Inc., level, what's the thought process of perhaps
making acquisitions up there with the intent of dropping down assets into the partnership?

<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: You know, if the right opportunity came along, we
would do that, if we had a plan to drop them down. What we don't want to do is go back to being a mixed business up
there where you have some non-qualifying assets sitting up there and instead of being able to explain very simply, hey,
we're a General Partner and here's what we get from plan B and you get what we get less taxes and interest. We don't
want to get away from that story. But if we have the right opportunity where we can see a very clear open field to
getting it dropped down into KMP, then that might be of interest to us. So, we'll just continue to look at it.

Next question comes from T. J. Schultz with RBC Capital.
<Q - T. J. Schultz – RBC Capital Markets>: Hey, guys. Good afternoon.
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Go ahead.
<Q - T. J. Schultz – RBC Capital Markets>: Just two quick questions. First, on the Natural Gas segment, can you
give us the contribution from the segment earnings before DD&A from the recent HK transaction or alternatively just
talk about how the business ex that transaction is kind of tracking towards plan?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, we think that for KinderHawk for the year
we'll come out pretty much on plan for the year. In other words, we had a plan obviously when we owned half of it and
we think that's tracking pretty much to plan and then now we own 100% of it for the rest of the year and we have put in
the plan for the whole 100% to last six months and we expect that to come out on plan maybe do a little bit better but
right on plan, we think.
<Q - T. J. Schultz – RBC Capital Markets>: Okay. So, I think you said $45 million to $50 million above plan so
that's and everything else is kind of tracking towards plan, so that excess is from the transaction, is that the right way to
look at it?
<A - C. Shaper – President & Director>: Yeah, and in the segment the excess above budgeted forecast is from the
transaction and, just to be clear, you said the recent Hawk transaction, I mean the only transaction that had an impact in
the first half of '11 was the one that was closed in the second quarter of '10. The transaction that just closed this year
didn't close until July 1 and so it had no impact in the first half.
<Q - T. J. Schultz – RBC Capital Markets>: Okay got it. Just moving on to export coal opportunity. You've talked
before about 28 million to 30 million tons of export capacity, kind of at a cost of $175 million. I know you've talked
about getting into more advanced conversations; just curious if that 28 million to 30 million tons is still kind of the
potential for the capacity there?
<A - Richard Kinder – Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think just looking at the whole field, I think
if anything we're more bullish now than we were. As you know, we're already expanding IMT pursuant to a long-term
contract with one coal producer. We have already expanded and are continuing to expand some of our Houston Ship
Channel facilities to handle another export coal. We expect to have announcement on an additional customer at IMT
within the next few weeks and probably additional there and in Houston from two additional customers within the
quarter, we hope. So, a lot of activity here and that's just really on the Houston Ship Channel and south of New
Orleans. Then we have other opportunities at some of our other terminals that we're actively working on, but we're
further away from actually having signed deals yet.
So, we've met with a lot of management. We think that the appetite for coal in China and India is enormous. It's pulling
various supply sources from around the world, which gives opportunities for American producers, not just in the
developing world like China and India, but to make up for, in Europe, for example, for South African coal that's now
going to India. So, there is just, lot of it is a worldwide market and we're finding that major American coal companies
are very interested in tying up for long periods of time facilities that will allow them to move coal product either by rail

or barge and they like the optionality of both to facilities like we have on the coast and then be able to load them into
ships to go wherever they have long-term contracts.
<Q - T. J. Schultz – RBC Capital Markets>: Great. Thanks guys.

Next question comes from Cathleen King from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Cathleen King – Bank of America Merrill Lynch>: Good evening, everyone.
<A>: Hi. How are you doing?
<Q - Cathleen King – Bank of America Merrill Lynch>: Good. Just wondering if you guys can talk about the capital
plan around the Katz Field given the slower than expected ramp in production there, is there any plan to spend a bit
more CapEx there, if you get things going or can you just talk about that?
<A - Richard Bradley – President-CO2 & Vice President>: Yeah. The shorter answer is no. We're not spending
money to accelerate the project and the key reason for that is that the CO2 supply is so tight that even if we had the
wells and facilities ready to take more CO2, the CO2 just isn't there. Richard mentioned that we're prorating our
customers a bit, we are prorating ourselves a bit, so we're kind of boxed in at the present time. Now, once the CO2
supply situation relaxes a bit, then I think that's certainly an option that we would consider. But at the present time
we've activated twelve patterns which is close to our plan year-to-date, but we're probably going to go a little bit slower
because our CO2 supplies that are available for the rest of the year are a little bit less than what we had expected.
<Q - Cathleen King – Bank of America Merrill Lynch>: Got you. Okay, thanks, guys.
<A>: Okay.
