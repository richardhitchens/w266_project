Presentation
Operator
Welcome to the Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the end
of the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is
being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.
Now I will turn the meeting over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
All right. Thank you, Brandon, and welcome to our quarterly earnings call. As usual, we'll be making statements within
the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act 1934.
We'll be discussing the first quarter results at Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, which is one of the largest MLPs in
America and at Kinder Morgan Inc, which owns the general partner of KMP and significant limited partner interest;
98% of the distributions going up to KMI, come from KMP. The other 2% comes from our 20% ownership of Natural
Gas Pipeline of America.
Combined, the Kinder Morgan companies now have a combined enterprise value in excess of $55 billion.
Let me start with an overview of what happened in the first quarter and some strategic thoughts. Then I'll turn it over to
Park Shaper, our President, who will go through the financials in detail. And then we'll take any and all questions that
you may have.
Let me begin by discussing KMP, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners. Today we increased our quarterly cash distribution
per unit to $1.14 or 4.56 annualized. That's a 7% increase over the first quarter of 2010 and it's the 40th distribution

increase since we took over this company in February of 1997. And it's the fifth quarter in a row that we've raised the
distribution.
Our first quarter distributable cash flow before certain items was a little over $382 million. That was up 8% from the
first quarter a year ago. Our distributable cash flow per unit, which we think is the most effective way of judging and
comparing our earnings and operations was $1.21 this quarter compared to $1.18 in the first quarter last year.
All five of our businesses produced stronger first quarter results than in the comparable period last year. Our total
segment earnings before DD&A were about $880 million. That's up 6% from the first quarter of 2010.
Given our solid asset performance, along with the current oil prices and interest rates, we're now on pace to generate
excess cash flow of almost $100 million for 2011 versus our annual budget target of $37 million of excess cash flow.
Now we previously announced that we expected to declare cash distributions of $4.60 per unit for 2011, which would
be a 4.5% increase over 2010. We now expect to meet or exceed that target.
We'll continue to monitor, in light of these developments and our increased performance. And if we stay at this level,
we will look at increasing the distributions from KMP later this year.
Now let me turn to each of the segments. The Products Pipeline business had a strong performance in the first quarter.
About two-thirds of the growth was driven by good results from the Cochin pipeline system and our Pacific operations.
For the first quarter, our total refined products volumes increased 4.4% compared to the same period last year. Gasoline
volumes were up 2.3%, diesel volumes up 11.3%, and jet fuel volumes up 3.2%.
Before you get too excited about that, we published the details on these volumes on our volume page, that's an
attachment. And as you'll see, the strong growth here came from the Plantation Pipe Line volumes. So we would not
expect this size of growth in volumes to continue throughout the year.
On the NGL side, the volumes were up 12.4% versus the first quarter of 2010 due to the strong performance of our
Cochin NGL pipeline. Our Natural Gas Pipeline segment was also, had strong performance in the quarter. And the
growth there was driven by contributions from a recently completed Fayetteville Express Pipeline from the
KinderHawk joint venture in the Haynesville Shale from our Midcontinent Express Pipeline expansion and from good
results at our Casper-Douglas processing assets and the Texas intrastate pipeline system.
On the negative side in the Natural Gas Pipeline segment, we had lower volumes and transportation revenues at Kinder
Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission, and we had lower results at Rockies Express solely due to a contractual
agreement regarding fuel recoveries.
Looking ahead, we continue to see tremendous opportunities in the shale plays that will help drive future growth in this
segment. The overall segment transport volumes were up 9%, due largely to Fayetteville Express coming online and
the force majeure that impacted Rockies Express for a portion of the first quarter in 2010. At the Texas Intrastates, sales
volumes were up 1% in the first quarter.
Turing to our CO2 business. Growth in the first quarter was attributable was to higher oil prices and higher NGL prices
on our unhedged volumes. These higher oil prices more than offset the expected lower production in the first quarter, as
our average WTI crude oil price was about $8 per barrel higher for quarter one of 2011, than it was in the comparable
period a year ago.
Turing to oil production. Oil production was lower at the SACROC Unit for the first quarter of 2010, running about
28,900 barrels per day versus 30,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2010. But basically, flat to plan in this first
quarter of 2011.
At the Yates Field production was down, compared to the same period last year, but just slightly below plan, due
primarily to some weather issues in February that us about $5 million and several thousand barrels of production.
At the Katz Field, we are now getting results from our recently initiated enhanced oil recovery activities, but the
production response is slower than we anticipated, which I might say, actually could be positive for the project longer

term i.e., more uniform flow through the formation maybe what we're seeing now.
We now expect for 2011 to realize an incremental 600 barrels of additional oil production at Katz compared to 2010
down from a 1,000 incremental barrels that we targeted in our budget for 2011.
In the Terminals business, we produced very nice fourth quarter segment earnings up 13% year-to-year. About 80% of
that increase was driven by organic growth. That organic growth came from strong results at our liquids terminals on
the Houston Ship Channel, reflecting customer demand and higher rates on contract renewals.
And we had a significant increase in bulk tonnage.
For example, total bulk tonnage was up almost 11% for the quarter. We had record coal volumes at our Pier IX facility
in Virginia and we had a 21% increase in steel volumes across the segment, compared to the first quarter of 2010.
Acquisitions accounted for the other 20% of the strong growth in Terminals, due primarily to the Slay and Watco
transactions.
With regard to ethanol handling, this segment -- in this segment was basically flat with the first quarter of 2010 at 15.7
million barrels, combined the Terminals and Products Pipelines segments handled about 23 million barrels of ethanol in
the quarter, up slightly from the same period a year ago, and we continue to handle about 30% of all the ethanol used in
the United States.
At Kinder Morgan Canada, the growth for the quarter was driven by increased deliveries into Washington state on the
Trans Mountain pipeline system, and our mainline throughput on Trans Mountain was up about 12% comparing to the
first quarter of 2010.
Now let me discuss some of our other developments across KMP, which are really important to the future growth of
both KMP and KMI. I'll start with the Products Pipeline segment.
In this segment, our expansion at the Carson Terminal in California is running ahead of schedule. That's a $77 million
project and has 560,000 barrels of additional storage for refined products in Carson, California. Two of those tanks are
now expected to be in service of November -- in November of this year. That's about eight months sooner than plan.
The project is still running on budget, in so far as costs are concerned.
In our expansion project at Travis Air Force Base in Northern California, which is a $48 million project, we're also
running ahead of schedule and on budget. We now expect to have two of the three 150,000 barrel storage tanks in
service in December of this year, three months earlier than plan.
In our Natural Gas Pipeline segments, a lot of things going on there. We continue to take advantage of tremendous
opportunity for new infrastructure in the shale plays. For those of who attended or listened in on our Analyst
Conference earlier this year, we talked a lot about this. All those opportunities we talked about at that time still remain
in place now. In fact, I'd say, we're even a little more enthusiastic about our opportunities.
Starting with Eagle Ford Gathering, that's a joint venture between ourselves and Copano Energy. Since we last talked,
we've entered into a long-term agreement with Anadarko. And now, including funding, our 50% interest in this joint
venture, we've committed about $166 million to expansion projects in the Eagle Ford Shale play.
This system will result -- this investment will result in a system of about 400 miles of existing and newly constructed
pipelines, when they're fully powered with compression, these pipelines will have a capacity to gather over 700 million
cubic feet per today of natural gas. We expect all of that 700 million cubic feet per day of capacity to be fully
subscribed during calender year 2011.
And we're looking to pursue additional opportunities in the Eagle Ford Shale play in the coming weeks and months. As
I mentioned earlier, our Fayetteville Express Pipeline is now fully in service.
At KinderHawk Field Services, that's a natural gas gathering and treating joint venture between KMP and Petrohawk in
the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana. We continue to experience growth in volume.

We now have about 400 miles of pipeline with over 2 Bcf a day of capacity and our throughput is now approximately
940 million cubic feet a day. The throughput is expected to reach 1.2 Bcf a day by year-end 2011.
Also in the Natural Gas group, KMI reached a settlement in principle with FERC staff and our customers in the first
quarter on the Section 5 rate case. Pending approval, the settlement will have a full year impact on KMP of less than
$10 million. The 2011 impact will be even less than that because the settlement will only be effective for a portion of
2011.
Now turning to CO2 segment. The main development there is one we also discussed at the Analyst Conference. Mainly
that the fact that we are experiencing very nice growth in demand for CO2 in the Permian Basin and that's led us to
continue to see real opportunities to expand our production of CO2 in Southwest Colorado and to expand the pipeline
infrastructure that transports that CO2 to our customers in the Permian Basin. And in fact, today our Board authorized
expenditures for the preliminary engineering work on the expansion in Southwest Colorado. So we are beginning to
kick that project off.
On the terminal side as detailed in our recent conference, tremendous increase in demand for coal exports. And this will
be a driver of future growth for our Terminals segment. We've entered into two significant contracts with customers to
handle coal and we're actively pursuing a number of additional coal export opportunities.
Specifically, we now have a 15 year agreement with Massey to handle up to $6 million -- 6 million tons of coal
annually through our IMT Terminal in Myrtle Grove, Louisiana on the lower Mississippi River. We'll be investing
about $70 million to expand that terminal. We expect that expansion to be completed and the tons begin to move in
2012.
In addition, we've entered into an agreement with a large Western coal producer to handle upto 2.2 million tons of
Colorado coal annually at our Houston bulk terminal on the Houston Ship Channel. To accommodate this tonnage,
we'll invest about $18 million in expanding the facility. This will be the first time that Western coal has been exported
from the Port of Houston. And again, we see great opportunities to further expand our handling of export coal on both
the East Coast and the Gulf Coast.
On another matter in our Terminals group, KMP formed a crude oil joint venture with Deeprock Energy Resources and
Mercuria Energy Trading in Cushing, Oklahoma. We are investing about $25 million for a 50% stake in an existing
crude oil tank farm that has storage capacity of 1 million barrels. And for the construction of three new storage tanks,
we'll have an incremental storage capacity of 750,000 barrels. These new tanks are expected to be in service by the
third quarter of this year.
We also have an option to participate in additional expansion of Deeprock's remaining undeveloped land in the Cushing
area, which is extensive.
We've also completed construction on our Deer Park Rail Terminal in the Houston Ship Channel area and related
ethanol handling assets. That $19 million project include building a new ethanol unit-train facility. We now have space
for multiple unit-trains. And that project is supported by long-term customer contracts and the first trains have already
arrived this month.
Finally, on the Terminals group on our Watco Companies joint venture, we continue to pursue new opportunities with
the rail company. We anticipate making additional investments with and in Watco during 2011 to complement our
existing terminal network and provide customers additional transportation services, particularly with regard to moving
crude oil by unit-trains from shale plays, both in Texas and elsewhere.
Now turning to KMI. Again, today, we reported the first quarter cash available for dividends of $251 million in the
quarter. We are on target to meet or exceed our previously disclosed annual budget of $820 million in cash available to
pay dividends. We declared a dividend for the first quarter of $0.14 per share. The additional dividend is prorated to
February 16, 2011. That's the date that KMI closed its IPO.
Based on a full quarter, the dividend will be $0.29 per share or $1.16 annualized just as we promised in our S1 in our
road show for the KMI IPO.

If present trends continue, and we're able to increase the distribution at KMP, we will pass those increases onto the
KMI shoulders by increasing the dividend above the $1.16 target. In short, our strategy at Kinder Morgan is pretty
simple and it applies to both KMP and KMI.
We have a great set of stable assets. We have growing cash flow coming out of those assets. We're going to do our best
to grow that cash flow and then distribute it out, both in terms of distributions to our unit holders at KMP and KMR and
in dividends to our shareholders at KMI.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Park.
C. Park Shaper, President
All right. Thanks, Rich.
So, I'm going to go over the numbers. I'll start with KMP. And so that's first financial page that's distributed along with
the earnings release is the face of the income statement.
Now this does include the impact of certain items. We don't think it's overly meaningful. But you can see down towards
the bottom, the distribution per unit at a $1.14, up from a $1.07 a year ago, as Rich mentioned, that 7% growth
year-over-year.
But I'm going to turn onto the second page in the release and really start towards the bottom. You'll see the DCF per
unit $1.21, up from a $1.18 a year ago, and actually ahead of our budget of $1.16 for the quarter. So a very strong
performance in the quarter. Our excess coverage was $21 million. That's $1.21 compared to the distribution of $1.14.
Jumping up above that, you'll see the DCF before certain items or I guess, right above that is the net income. We think
DCF per unit is more meaningful and a better measure of the distributions that we're going to be able to pay. But net
income per unit before certain items is about...
DCF before certain items as Rich mentioned, $382 million. It's up almost $29 million from a year ago, up over 8%.
And actually above our budget for the quarter. One of the main reasons why it was above our budget is directly above
that the sustaining capital expenditures, $36 million for the quarter above last year, which was $33 million.
But it's actually below our budget for the quarter.
And so we had a pick up relative to budget on the sustaining CapEx side. That being said, our annual budget's about
$225 million and we do expect that we will come in right about that annual budget. So large part of this is just a shift
from the first quarter to later quarters.
Above that, you have the contributions from some joint ventures. Essentially this is backing out equity earnings and
adding in distributions. And you can see in the first quarter of '11 the distribution exceeded the equity earnings by about
$3 million.
Book cash taxes, again, there we're backing out book taxes, adding in cash taxes. But cash taxes were lower than book
taxes for the quarter and so that's a positive $10 million.
And then, above that, DD&A it's up a little bit from a year ago. And then, there is limited partners net income before
certain items, which is up about 8% also from a year ago.
To see what's driving the net income, I'll jump up to the top and talk about the segment earnings before DD&A.
Starting with Products Pipelines, it's up about 10% from a year ago, actually up nicely relative to its budget. Relative to
budget, the pickup was driven primarily by Cochin, and then also by Southeast terminals.
Now for the year on Products Pipelines, we expect them to come in right about their budget. On the Natural Gas
Pipeline side, up slightly from a year ago, a little bit under its budget. The reason why we were under budget was
largely related to KMI and Rockies Express, as Rich mentioned. When we look at Natural Gas Pipelines for the year,

we expect them to come in right around their budget.
One thing to point out on the Natural Gas Pipeline side is this does not -- the segment earning before DD&A does not
include all of the DD&A from our joint ventures. That gets added in down below and actually within the $267 million
that I pointed out. But if you wanted to see the real earning power of the Natural Gas Pipelines you would add that
DD&A back. And I'll talk about that number in total in a minute when I talk about our full year expectations.
On the CO2 side, up over $10 million from a year ago. Here under budget for the quarter, although almost all the
reduction from budget was a function of the extended cold weather that we had during February that really caused a
little bit of production loss at Yates, and a little bit of losses or reductions on some of our other assets.
Absent that effect actually, CO2 would have been on budget. And as Rich mentioned, CO2 is favorable due to the
price, and then volumes are pretty close to plan at SACROC, a little bit below at Yates and a little bit below at Katz.
And then, on budget to a little bit above on the natural gas liquids side.
When you look at CO2 for the full year, certainly with the forward curve, oil prices where it is right now, we expect
CO2 to come in well above its budget, actually by about $35 million. And so, again, very nice opportunity there in the
CO2 segment driven by high oil prices.
On the Terminals side on budget, up about $19 million or almost 13% for the quarter. Dead on budget for the quarter.
And we also expect it to be on budget for the year.
And then at Kinder Morgan Canada, nicely above last year, by about $3 million, a little bit above budget. We do expect
Kinder Morgan Canada to be above budget for the year. It takes you to a little under $880 million of segment earnings
before DD&A compared to 827 a year ago or an increase of over $50 million or about 6%.
And then I gave you kind of the highlights for the forecast relative to budget for the segment. But if we add them all
together, we expect the segments to be above budget by about $35 million. That would take us to about $3.67 billion of
segment earnings before DD&A or if you add it in, the DD&A associated with the joint ventures, it would take us to
right about $3.85 billion of segment earnings before DD&A. So again, expect the segments as we look at it right now,
to be above budget for the year.
G&A, starting to drop down to -- under the segment earnings contribution. You'll see about 101 million up from about
99 million a year ago. It was a little bit above our budget for the quarter, about $5 million above our budget. But most
of that is timing. As we look at the forecasts right now, we expect the G&A will come in right about budget for the
year.
Interest, a little under $132 million for the quarter, up from 116 a year ago. But actually favorable to budget by about
$7 million. The increase relative to a year ago is largely a result of an increase in balance, which is a function of the
investing that we've done in the last year, and then a little bit as a result of an increase in average rates.
If we look at it for the year, we actually expect a current rate of interest will come in under budget by about $23
million. That's a function of the current forward curve for interest rates of the refinancing that we did in the first
quarter. And so that's driving again that savings and interest.
Net income before certain items, little under $424 million, up over $40 million from the first quarter of 2010 or about
10.5% growth year-on-year.
Let me talk about the certain items and really one in particular. But starting with the first one, allocated non-cash
long-term compensation. This is the same item that has shown up here since 2007 when the MBO transaction closed.
And it is an accounting expense related to compensation that KMP will never have to pay for.
And in truth, the public shareholders that came on will never pay for this. But the accounting rules require that we
allocate this expense out. So it shows up there. And in truth, the big item, which is the line right beneath that is very
similar.

So that $83 million is related to $100 million special bonus that will be paid to non-senior management employees here
at Kinder Morgan in late May. That $100 million will be funded by a reduction in dividends to certain of the investor
shareholders or the non-public shareholders of KMI. And it's completely funded by that reduction in dividend.
KMP will never pay a penny of that. KMI will never pay a penny of that. But for accounting purposes, it has to be
represented here. And so, again, the expense has to be recognized on the income statement. And that's why it's showing
up here and part of it gets allocated down to KMP.
So this is KMP's portion, once again an expense that KMP will never be responsible for, will never have to pay a penny
for. The rest of the certain items are small and essentially cancel each other out. So essentially, almost all of the net
certain items before the quarter are that one large charge. Which again KMP is not responsible for.
So that's really the summary on the performance for the quarter. Just going back one page and looking at the income
statement, I said as I skipped over it that it was distorted by the certain items. And really the biggest item is that $100
million special bonus. So if you look at G&A on the first page, you'll see it's up by $88 million. Well that is all that
special bonus coming through.
So again, it's just not meaningful on that page. Similarly, income taxes are impacted by that special bonus. They're up
by about $6 million. Again that's being driven by that certain items. So I think it's much easier to understand what's
going on with the business when you look at the second page.
One other thing to point out, as Rich mentioned, and I'll jump back and just talk about the full year forecast. I talked
about the segments being up by about $35 million as we look at the current year. G&A essentially being flat. Interests
being favorable by about $23 million.
And when you drop all that down, it's about 57, $58 million, as we look at our improvement in terms of distributable
cash flow. That takes our expected excess coverage to 90 to $100 million. And as Rich said, we'll continue to monitor
that. And as we get later in the year, then we may increase the distribution, if that holds.
One of the thing to think about there, it actually takes, so if you look at our current forecast for distributable cash flow
per unit, it's almost $4.89, which is 28, $0.29 above our current distribution, our expected target distribution of $4.60.
It's also, if you look at that it's really 48 -- 4.88 and a half. If you look at that compared to the $4.43 that we generated
in distributable cash flow per unit in 2010, it's over 10% growth, which again, I think is just showing the strength of the
set of assets that we own.
Now one thing I do want to point out, well that distributable cash flow per unit. Again based on our current forecast is
up 10%. It doesn't mean that we can increase the distribution by 10%, because as you increase the distribution, the
distributable cash flow per unit actually comes down, as a result of what goes to the general partner or another way to
say it is, the distributable cash flow per unit is just per limited partner unit.
What it does mean though is, if we actually came in at that level, and we wanted to have no excess coverage, which I
don't believe is where we'll end up. But just so you understand where we are, it does mean that we can increase the
distribution by 7.5% from where we were a year ago.
Now again, and that's just walking through the current forecast so that you understand the significance of the numbers.
As Rich said and I said a few minutes ago, excess coverage, 90 to $100 million right now. We'll continue to monitor
that and later in the year, we'll figure out if we want to take the distribution up beyond our budgeted target of $4.60 per
unit.
And then, the third page is our -- the volume. And a couple of comments there. Rich mentioned that, and but it is new
on the volume page this quarter. We have broken out Plantation from some of the other Product Pipelines, so that you
can see by product the volumes at Pacific, CALNEV and Central Florida, and then you can see by product the volume
change at Plantation and then we give you a total.
So again, you can see here, that a lot of the growth this quarter came from Plantation, and again, driven by some

And one other thing to mention there, and this is in the text of the press release, but just to provide a little bit more
explanation. We present NGL sales volume in the CO2 section as our net amount. And our net amount actually
declined versus a year ago. Well the gross production at plant actually went up, and again that was in the press release.
The reason why our net share declined was a contractual relationship that really had increased our share through the
end of 2010.
And so this was expected and it was in our budget. But really we're happy with the plant performance. The plant is
performing very well. So operationally things are going very well, it is just a contractual reduction. And in truth that
contractual reduction is offset somewhat by some other contractual rights we have, to net profits interest in the plant.
And so, from a true dollar perspective, the impact isn't as significant as this reduction implies.
With that, I will go to the balance sheet. Should be the last financial page on the KMP release. Now, and walking down
this fairly quickly. Cash and cash equivalents again up a little bit. So this is comparing the end of the first quarter to the
beginning of the year. Other current assets are down about $100 million, restricted deposits and accounts receivable
really constitute that reduction.
PP&E is up and really that's a function of expansion CapEx less depreciation for the quarter. Now investments is, we
did -- the one acquisition we did in the quarter was of the Deeprock assets as Rich mentioned. That is a minority
interest and so we equity account for that. And so that shows up on this slide. And we also invested some more in our
Eagle Ford joint venture, so that took that out.
And the Watco investment really closed this quarter. And so that was another increase, offset by really a reduction here
in Rockies Express, which is just a function of distribution.
Our deferred charges and other assets is down a little bit. That's just a function of the mark-to-market of the hedges.
Total assets are $21.8 billion basically flat with where we were at the beginning of the year.
On the liability side, notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt. That's 1.3 billion, we actually did have a
maturity that we paid off in the first quarter of '10 and then we had a couple of future maturities that became current.
So the make up of the 1.3 billion, commercial paper at the end of the quarter was about $340 million. And then we have
a maturity in mid-March of 2012 for about $450 million. And then we have another $500 million, which can be put to
us at the beginning of February of 2012, and because it can be put to us, then it shows up in current maturity.
That being said, the coupon on this debt is 9%. It's a debt that we issued in December of 2008, when nobody could
access the capital markets. And we did it essentially to show that we could. We would love for that to be put to us. And
we would love to now pay 9% on that debt. I don't think it's going to happen. Although if any of you are holders and
you want to put it to us, then please do, we'll be happy to pay that down.
But what's likely to happen there is it will stay in current maturity until a year from now, until the first quarter of 2012,
when people are very unlikely to put it us. And then it will go back into long-term debt. And it's actually due in
February of '19.
Other current liabilities essentially unchanged. Long-term debt, I will talk about that, when I talk about total debt in a
minute. Value of interest rates swaps, that just fluctuates with the forward curve on interest rates.
And then other long-term liabilities, this is primarily changes in the mark-to-market of the hedges.
Partners capital accumulated on a comprehensive loss as to mark-to-market as the hedges, and then other partners
capital, that's net income, plus any equity issuance, less distributions.
And so really that takes us down to total debt, $11.6 billion, compared to $11.4 billion at the beginning of the year. So
total debt has gone up by $160 million and then I'll walk you through what caused that in a minute.
But first let's look at debt-to-EBITDA. EBITDA is about 3.2 billion for the last 12 months. It's up from about $3.1
billion for 2010. So our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is now just a hair over 3.6. When before it was actually about 3.66. It

did round to 3.7. But our debt-to-EBITDA has come down. That's consistent with our expectations. We think it shows a
very strong balance sheet. And we fully expect to maintain a very strong balance sheet.
So the change in debt for the quarter, $160 million. The uses of cash, CapEx was about $216 million, acquisitions were
about $16 million, again that was Deeprock. Contributions to joint venture is $22 million. And in the Chevron
settlement, which was a last big piece of the FERC settlement, was $63 million. And that did go out during the quarter.
Sources of cash. We issued equity through the ATM program, generating about $83 million. And in KMR, distributions
resulted in a retention of cash of about $104 million. And then for working capital and other items, they were a use of
cash of about $30 million.
And here is how that $30 million breaks down. The AR and AP were a source of cash of about $60 million. Accrued
interest with the use of cash of almost $150 million. And so, really all that is, is the first quarter and the third quarter or
the quarters when we had large interest payments.
We pay on our long-term debt. We pay semi-annually. And they are just heavily concentrated in the first quarter and
the third quarter. And so really, this reflects the payment that went out in the first quarter, a lot less cash will go out in
the second quarter and that accrual will go back up.
Other current assets and our current liabilities were a source of cash of about $14 million. We had excess coverage of
about $21 million. And then we had some other CapEx timing and distributions in excess of equity earnings plus
DD&A and some other items of about $22 million.
So those all totaled to use of cash of about $30 million. But it was really accrued interest was the primary use.
Everything else was offsetting that.
Now I mentioned CapEx, about $216 million, in contributions to joint venture at $22 million. I give you a little bit of
detail there. Products expansion CapEx was about 17 in the quarter, spread across a variety of smaller projects,
including the Travis Air Force Base and Carson project.
Natural gas was about $15 million, again spread across a number of smaller projects or finishing up other projects. CO2
was about $112 million. SACROC is clearly the biggest piece of that, although, Katz is a big piece of that as well.
On the Terminals side, about $56 million, tank expansion at Carteret, New Jersey. The completion of the Deer Park
Rail Terminal, continued expansion at Vancouver Wharves and a number of smaller projects. And then, Kinder
Morgan Canada was about $2 million.
And then the equity contribution again, $22 million, about 14 went to the Eagle Ford joint venture, and about 8 went to
Red Cedar. And that is it for KMP and so with that I will turn to the KMI financials.
Alright, I think the main thing to remember at KMI is, it is very simple and very straight forward, and it's all laid out
for you on the first page, the first financial page of KMI, and really what we're tracking is the cash available to pay
dividend.
You can see some $250 million that is up from $230 million year ago, that's about 9% growth, now, but the main thing
is we're on track to generate $820 million or a little bit more of cash available to pay dividend. There are some things
that impact some quarters and not others and I'm going to walk through that, so as you kind of understand seasonality is
probably the wrong term, but just how those things play out across the year. But again I think the main thing is, we're
on track to generate $820 million of cash available to pay dividends.
Primary source of that cash are distributions from KMP, so you can see from the general partner $285 million and then
24 on the KMP unit, 15 on the KMR shares and then NGPL about $4 million distribution in the quarter. And then G&A
was about $2 million and interest expense about $75 million. This is cash interest here.
And then cash available to pay dividend before cash taxes is the 251, and so cash taxes they are zero during the quarter.
And that's just because we typically have very small payments in the first quarter of the year.

Now what happens though is the second quarter gets doubled up on cash tax payments, because we make one in April
and one in June. And I'll talk about -- a little bit more about that later. But again I think this is really all you need to
know about KMI is getting tremendous distributions out of KMP, some minor additional distributions from NGPL plus
pay a little bit of G&A, have to pay some interest and the rest of the cash and has paid cash taxes, the rest of the cash is
available to pay dividend.
That being said, because this is the first time that we're going to talk about KMI, since its IPO, the next page is the page
of the KMI income statement. And so I'm going to walk through this page and the page that follows that reconciles the
cash available to pay dividend to the income statement.
And it's all going to sound very complicated. But the main thing to remember is, it is not the business, nor the
fundamentals that are complicated. It's the accounting that's complicated. And so I'm going to walk through this to help
you understand it, but really what's relevant is the first page, which is very simple.
So looking at the second page, again this is the page of the income statements. So the things that complicate this, KMP
is consolidated here. It also includes certain items both the KMP certain items and the KMI certain items. So we all
think this page is overly meaningful. Those certain items that KMP in this quarter includes the special bonus, the $83
million that went through and is $87 million on a pre-tax basis.
At KMI, you also have an impact from that special bonus. You also have with KMI a receipt from a settlement from the
insurance company related to shareholder litigation of $46 million of cash are on an after book tax basis $29 million,
that is impacting this number.
That receipt of cash, which we did receive in the first quarter is not in our $251 million nor it is in our $820 million,
because that's a one time item, that's not recurring. So we're not counting it towards our cash available to pay dividends.
What we are doing is paying down debt with it and when we get to the balance sheet, I am going to show you that.
But the other steps that's included in here are all of the purchase accounting items that KMI had to make all of those
entries it had to make at the time of the MBO in 2007.
Now and Ken through a little bit of this and actually much better than I can at the conference, but just to remind you,
high level what those items include; one KMI had to right up the carrying value of assets at KMP on KMI's book. What
that means is that KMI carries KMP's asset at a different valuation than where KMP carries its assets.
Now that's really a balance sheet item, and I'm going to show you those distortions on the balance sheet. But it does
impact depreciation, which does impact net income, another reason why net income -- isn't real meaningful.
So basically what you have here is depreciation at KMI for KMP's assets that's even greater than what KMP
recognizes. In addition to that at the time of MBO, KMI and again this is -- none of this is impacting KMP. KMI had to
take our existing hedges and mark them to the forward curve at that point in time and only recognizes differences, only
recognizes income, based upon the differences of the transactions and that mark-to-market forward curve at the time of
the close of the MBO.
Really what we're saying there is for any transaction that's been hedged, KMI realizes different income on its income
statement than KMP does, so again just another distortion. And then the third thing that's fairly significant on the first
accounting side is really escaping me right now; I can't remember what else I was going to mention.
Yeah, the debt at KMI also had to be mark-to-market in essence at that point in time, which means that KMP, KMI
booked interest expense doesn't really reflect what it's paying in interest. And so, the income statement there we'll
always show it to you, and so that you can see that, but we don't believe it's meaningful.
What we'll also show to you is the next page, which is basically going from income from continuing operations, which
you can see on the income statement $201 million to our cash available to pay dividends, which is $250 million. Now
again, I'm just going to walk through kind of how this reconciliation works at a high level to help you understand it.

Page 11 of 25
I don't believe that this is overly meaningful. In subsequent quarters, I don't expect to spend much time on it, but we
will present the information for you. So at the top, you start with income from continuing operations. And that in the
next three lines all come from the income statement, so from the prior page. And essentially, we add that to income
from continuing operations, DD&A and amortization of excess cost of investments. So that's just adding back non-cash
items as we're trying to get to a cash number.
And then what we do is we take out income from equity investments, because we're going to again try to go from
income to cash. And so that comes directly from the income statement. Right below that, we add back distributions
from equity investments.
And so we're taking out equity income, adding in distributions, because we're talking about a cash number here, we're
trying to convert from income to cash. The distributions from equity investments are split on the two lines, because
most of that comes from KMP. And then where you can find this on KMP's financial statements is in the cash flow
statement.
And in the cash flow statement, we have to split those between operating cash flows and investing cash flows. And so
we split it here to make it a little bit easier to track back to KMP, but realize that this includes KMI as well. And I
should have said that at the beginning, all of these line items to this point and almost all the way down includes both
KMI and KMP. And then we'll back out the portion of KMP that KMI does not own down below.
So really when you look at these distributions from equity investments, you're not going to be able to find those exact
numbers on KMP's cash flow statement. Then we take out the certain items, the KMP certain items, that's really the
pretax number, so 88 versus the 83.6 that we were looking at on KMP, but those are the same numbers.
And then the KMI purchase accounting, now again this is the pretax number and this doesn't include the purchase
accounting impact on DD&A, nor does it include the purchase accounting impact on interest. But it's just what remains.
The difference between cash and book taxes and again this is for both KMI and KMP.
And then the difference between cash and book interest expense for KMI is shown there. For KMP, when we do our
distributable cash flow calculation, we just use book interest expense and so that's why we're not including any change
for KMP.
Sustaining capital expenditures, now you'll see this number 36 is really all KMP. KMI has very little sustaining capital
expenditures. And so all of that again all the way down to the second to last line that includes impact for both KMI and
KMP, and so our number right now still includes both KMI and KMP. We have to back out the portion of KMP that
KMI does not own or really does not have access to.
And so the first thing that we do, it's really split between these two lines. But the first line is the declared distribution on
a limited partner units owned by the public or not owned by KMI. This includes both KMP units and KMR shares, now
some of you all -- if you all dig into this, you maybe digging and you may think well, wait, we're going for cash here
and the KMR shares, the distributions on those are paid in shares and not in cash and that cash is retained.
Well that's true, it is retained, but it's retained by KMP. And what we're showing forward here is the cash available to
KMI for dividends. KMI has no access to any cash that's retained by KMP. Even though KMI must consolidate KMP
for accounting purposes, KMI has no legal access to KMP's assets or to its cash. Again accounting is not the same as
the law. And KMP -- KMI has no legal access to that cash, that is KMP's cash.
So again, the cash that comes from KMR shares back at KMP, also when you get to the next line, any excess cash flow
that KMP generates is retained at KMP, KMI has no access to that. And so that's backed down on the other one.
The other thing that you get on the other line are any remaining KMI certain items and also some timing effects,
because the income statement is done on a declared basis and our cash available for dividends is done on a paid basis,
then there are some timing impact that flow through that line.
So again high level, those are the items that reconcile income from continuing operation to cash available for dividends.

Page 12 of 25
Now with that, I'll go to the balance sheet. And you'll see on the balance sheet, we've tried to split it between -- again
KMI and consolidated KMP. We've tried to split the line items between KMI and KMP.
One thing on the cash and cash equivalents for KMI, down significantly from the beginning of the year, but you may
remember that we had a debt issuance that was due early January that we refinanced with a debt issuance that went out
in December of 2010 that just meant we had excess cash on our balance sheet at the end of the year, it was used to pay
down to retire that debt in January. So that's why the debt balance went down so much.
Other current assets then again that's both KMI and KMP, and then you'll see PP&E split between KMI and KMP. Now
here and in a number of these lines, the KMI lines include the purchase accounting impact. So the KMP line it
misrepresent essentially the true carrying value for those assets at KMP. And in the KMI line, includes the purchased
accounting impact. Same thing goes for investments and for goodwill.
And so really, I don't think there's a whole lot of meaning in looking at those items on the balance sheet. I think the
main thing is down here in short-term debt and long-term debt will aggregate that down below. For KMI, the main
component of short-term debt is just KMI outstanding borrowings under its credit facility.
But really let's just drop all the way down to KMI's debt net of its cash and cash equivalents. You see at the end of the
quarter, about 3.17 billion, that's down about 25 million from really little under 3.2 billion at the beginning of the year.
And then if you look at a kind of comparable to debt-to-EBITDA ratio, and if you look at distributions received at
KMI, it's about 1.26 billion for the last 12 months, up from 1.24 billion. And so the ratio of debt to distribution received
is about 2.5 times, down from 2.6 times and again representing that KMI has a very strong balance sheet.
Now as we look forward at KMI's debt level, we expect that we'll end the year a little bit under $3.15 billion, and so it
will be down from the beginning of the year by call it $50 million. Now that is assuming that we actually sell KMR
shares during the year that our equivalents to the distribution that we receive during the year.
There is a decent chance that we won't sell any KMR this year and what that will mean is that this debt number will go
up by $45 million, and so in that case, we'll end up right around $3.2 billion, right around where we started the year.
Now one other thing I'll walk through as I said, debt went down by about $25 million. And this will give you a sense of
some of the things that happened in the first quarter that may not recur going forward or some of the things that will
happen in the second quarter.
Cash generated in the quarter, $250 million; now the dividends paid in the quarter, we paid a normal dividend for the
fourth quarter of 2010 that was $205 million. We also paid the dividend essentially kind of it separated, for the first half
of the first quarter of '11, during which we were not public.
Now that dividend would have been $105 million. But $64 million of it was not paid down in order to fund the $100
million special bonus that goes out in May of this year.
So again what happened is, it would have been 105, it was reduced by 64; 64 is the after tax impact of that $100 million
payment to again the non-senior management employees. And so the net amount is an incremental dividend of $41
million.
Now we also received in the quarter about $46 million from the insurance settlement. And then we had IPO expenses,
which are one-time items of about $14 million. And then we had working capital and other items that were our use of
cash of about $12 million.
And so those things gets you to the reduction in debt of about $25 million. Now the other things to think about is, we
paid a bigger dividend in the first quarter than we normally would, but we also got the insurance settlement in the first
quarter. So those kind of offset.
As we look at the second quarter, a few things to keep in mind. One, we will have two cash tax payments in the second
quarter, so one in April and one in June. So cash taxes in the second quarter will be unusually large just like in the first
quarter they were unusually small, they were zero.

The other thing that will happen is, we will pay a lower dividend than we normally would in the second quarter. It will
be $99 million and the normal quarterly dividend is $205 million. So we pay a lower dividend, but then we will also
pay out the $100 million. Now again remember we've essentially already retained the cash or held back the cash that
will fund that.
But that $100 million will go out in the second quarter. And so really, all I'm doing is preparing you for when I walk
through this reconciliation, three months from now, I'll be talking about those items.
But the main thing to keep in mind at KMI, strong performance, inline with our expectations maybe a little bit above.
We will generate $820 million of cash. We will pay out about $820 million of cash in dividend. And our debt will come
down by $50 million or if we don't sell the KMR shares, we'll essentially remain flat. And really that was a long
explanation of KMI, I expect in future quarters it will be much shorter, because KMI really is very simple.
With that I'll give it back to Rich.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from
Darren Horowitz with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Hi Darren. How are you doing?
Darren Horowitz
Hey, good. Thanks Rich, how are you?
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Fine.
Darren Horowitz
Couple of quick questions. First on Eagle Ford JV, beyond the capital you guys are spending to enhance your gathering
scale. How are you thinking about capturing the opportunities for condensate and crude oil takeaway capacity? You've
obviously got the asset leverage there, given your products pipes and interstate footprints, so I am just curious how you
are thinking longer term?

Yeah. We think that's a very good opportunity for us, and we think we will be capturing a lot of that volume, and but
we don't believe in making any announcements until the horses are in the crow.
And so when we get to that point, we will have -- we will make those announcements. But we're very bullish on the
opportunities for condensate down there, and it's not just our product's pipeline experience, it's also the fact that as we
said many times we have an awful lot of natural gas infrastructure down there and some of that can be converted and
used for condensate purposes. So we feel very good about the opportunities there.
C. Park Shaper, President
And one clarification I'll make just, Darren, because you kind of introduced watching around the Eagle Ford joint
venture. There are a lot of opportunities for us in Copano within the joint venture. There are also a lot of opportunities
for us outside of the joint venture, and we'll be pursuing both of those.
Darren Horowitz
Yeah, I'm sure.
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
And the condensate volume would be 100% Kinder Morgan venture.
Darren Horowitz
Right. Has there been any update on the ability to leverage that Cochin line for either Marcellus, NGL or Bakken
crude?
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The Cochin -- we are working on Bakken crude opportunities now with the major producer in the Bakken, and we'll
just have to see whether and if, the producer can make arrangements with end users all for the Cochin system. In other
words, interconnecting with either other pipes or with refineries that are near the Cochin system. So that's the update on
that.
We continue to look to Marcellus situation, but we will not move that project forward unless and until we have shipper
commitments to support it. And we don't have those at this point, so we'll just see what develops there.
We also, on the Cochin line, as we said before, we expect to have the contracts to move additional EP mix further east
on the Cochin line too. Cochin of course, as Park said, had a really very good first quarter, which was driven by lot of
cold weather up in that area, but also by more movements to the Eastern part of the system. So Cochin is off to a good
start this year, and we expect to be able to continue to grow the uses of that pipeline.
Darren Horowitz
Last question from me on the terminal side, I'm just trying to get my arms around the magnitude of that coal export
opportunity that you see. So if you were to include the tonnage related to the two contracts you spoke of, can you
roughly quantify how much of an opportunity this could be for you? And also is it too premature for you to put a price
tag out there as it could relate to incremental capital spend?

Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, first of all, if you add up the two project that we've disclosed at IMT and our Houston Ship Channel facility;
those total about $90 million of expenditure, 70 on one and 18 on the other and that will be moving upto 8.2 million
tons of coal, which is obviously a lot of coal; that's 6 million max at IMT and 2.2 on the Houston Ship Channel.
So that's kind of where we are today, but as we've said at the Analyst Conference, the encouraging thing is that this
demand for export coal capacity remains very large.
And we have other opportunities at other terminals on both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast to handle additional
volumes and that wouldn't require additional capital expenditures. We estimated that it could be as much as 28 to 30
million tons of additional coal export capacity on top of this 8.2 million that we've already locked in on.
And I don't know, Jeff is in the room. You have any idea on what the capital would be to...?
Jeffrey R. Armstrong, President, Terminals
75.
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
About 175 million of additional expenditures to handle that additional 28 to 30 million tons of coal. That would be at
several different terminals and we're certainty not saying we're there yet. We have strong interest on a number of
shippers. But again it's dependent on them locking in their long-term contracts, because obviously, we're not going to
do these deals unless like we have at IMT and the Houston, unless we have long-term contracts.
Now of course, we've already ramped up significantly our throughput and our capacity at our Newport News facility
Pier IX where we're now this year going to move about 12 million tons of export coal through that facility.

Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Good.
Stephen Maresca
Good. Three quick things if I could touch on. And the first thing is, you opened and talked about a little bit, the excess
cash flow being on a run rate basis 100 million. And it seem like you do -- you sort of hinted at the possibility of, say
this way. Raising above your expectation at KMP. And here is my question is, the production slide issues at Katz and
Yates. What's your thought on not just increasing coverage as opposed to paying it out?
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, as we said, we have not made a decision to pay it out, we'll just continue to watch for the rest of the year actually.
The numbers Park was sharing with you for upside were done a few days ago and we've actually had an additional run
up in WTI prices. So that number may go even higher.
But it's a balancing process and I think Park was very clearly in saying that we're certainly not talking about taking all
of this excess and taking it -- increased distribution. We want to preserve excess coverage disappointing -- we're off to
a very good start for the year and we will consider on a going forward basis whether and by how much to increase
distribution.
Stephen Maresca
Okay, fair enough. Thank you. And then on the oil hedges side. Is there any update on where you are? Were there any
changes, I guess from the investor conference based on the 82 and 56% that you look for '11 and '12?
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, we're right now, if you are talking about -- Kim, do you have that?
Kimberly Allen Dang, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think it's about 61% in 2000 and...
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
87% I believe...
Kimberly Allen Dang, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Okay, 61% at $88, that's 2012 and...
Stephen Maresca
Okay. And did you say 87% for this year?

87 for this year.
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
And that's including interest with NGL.
Stephen Maresca
Yeah.
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Without NGLs, we're 97% hedge or thereabouts.
Stephen Maresca
Okay.
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
So 87% hedged including NGLs, 61% next year at a price that is $88, about $17 above the hedged price for 2011.
Stephen Maresca
Okay. And then finally, I mean you mentioned obviously the abundance of shale opportunity out there and you've
spoken about the Eagle Ford. Are looking at other -- seeing a lot of other opportunities, similar to your KinderHawk
where joint ventures with producers and are producers are looking to do more joint ventures?
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, we are. We're seeing good interest in that and the important thing I think is for us again to only do it if we feel it
makes economic sense obviously. And if we can satisfy that producers needs and what I mean by that is that clearly
these producers on the one hand are very interested in raising cash from taking in a partner or selling outright their
systems in the shale plays.
But they want to make certain, that as they ramp up in those shale price, they have plenty of ability to connect the new
wells. And so it's a balancing process and it has to be very carefully done. But yeah, I think, I have said this every
quarter, we continue to look at those, I think they are very good opportunities. The whole shale play, very good
opportunities and the Eagle Ford is the top of the list certainly, but there are other opportunities also.

Our next question is from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Ted. How are you doing?
Ted Durbin
I am doing well. Thanks. Maybe could you give me just a little more detail on the caps yield and your comments that
the production response is slower than anticipated, but it's actually a positive for the long-term production, maybe just,
how does the production profile look differently now?
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. I've got the expert sitting right here. Tim?
R. Tim Bradley, President, CO2
When we put the budget together last fall, we had a production growth expectation beginning in first quarter, which
was an average of early response but what we saw in analog fields in the panhandles of Oklahoma and the other
reservoir studies that we have done. It looks as though it's going to be the later end of the window of what we had
forecasted at the budget time.
In fact, we've already started to see an initial production uptick in late March, early April. Three of our patterns, smaller
ones in fact are beginning to show an initial production response. Three wells are showing a little bit CO2 production.
So it's lagging a little bit, maybe right about three months or so from what we put the budget, but the early indications
that we're seeing now is that it's -- I want to start ramping up at this point in time for the balance of the year. Of course,
we're going to watch it very closely, and see how that actually behaves, but the comment that Rich made about a late
response as long as it's not too late, could be a positive in that an early response certainly a negative, because it's
usually an indicator that a small feed zone has flooded very quickly, thereby leaving it to rock CO2 from uniformly
sweeping for the rest of the reservoir for the remainder of its life.
So we're encouraged at this point in time that we haven't seen anything negative in that respect and hopefully the sweep
efficiency will continue to be uniform, much more uniform than SACROC. And therefore this will minimize operating
costs, recycle CO2 long-term.
So again, it's very early in the game. We don't see any reason to be concerned about it. And in fact, I think it's well
within the range of expectations that we had for this project going into it.

Ted Durbin
Very helpful. Thanks. And then if I could just...
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Sure.
Ted Durbin
Ask about the gas pipeline segment. You're sort of -- you're tracking below budget there. Is that just sort of KMI maybe
not coming in strong or KinderHawk coming in stronger. What's kind of driving that, and how do you see that shifting
as we go forward in the year?
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well I think, as Park said, for the year we expect the gas pipeline segment to be right at its plan for the year. What
happened in the first quarter was that we had a contractual, on the Rockies Express, this is a line where we pass through
our fuel cost to customers. But in one case, we had one of our shippers had a fuel cap on it, and we had to true that up.
The volumes or the costs for the latter part of 2010 and 2011. And that hit in the first quarter on Rockies Express.
On KMI, we are a little bit below the margin differential between or the basis differential between the Rockies and the
areas in the Midwest that KMI serves, have not been very good. And so KMI or some of its programs, like its PALS, its
Park and Loan program have not done as well as we expected.
Now KinderHawk is on target, and we're actually getting very good performance in that segment from our processing
assets up in Wyoming, they are not large. But they are performing very well. So overall, everything pretty well
balances out we think for the year.
C. Park Shaper, President
And here, I'll just give you a little bit more detail. But as Rich said, KMI forecast for the year a little bit under budget,
because of what we saw in the first quarter plus an impact from the rate case, REX a little bit under budget,
operationally performing fine, but just has this contractual issue on the fuel cap.

The Intrastate's righted out their budget. And then that is offset by TransColorado, Casper-Douglas, Red Cedar or
Fayetteville Express and KinderHawk are all projected to be above budget.
So again, as our TransColorado, Red Cedar, Casper-Douglas, Fayetteville Express and KinderHawk, all expected to be
above budget. And so, overall I think the segment's doing very well.
Ted Durbin
Okay. Great. And then, just if I can do one more, how does the sort of integration of or getting into the Watco, and the
rail business. Are you seeing more opportunities where you would like to expand into more real transactions or through
Watco or in other ways?
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
I just have Jeff Armstrong who runs our Terminals group is here and I'll just let him answer that directly.
Jeffrey R. Armstrong, President, Terminals
Absolutely one of the things that we've seen as a benefit is Watco was one of the early movers. But to improve on rail
out of the Bakken for some producers and what we're seeing is in addition to the equity investment we made in Watco
is forming another venture with them to provide third-party facilities to really unit-train opportunities and I think the
first one that we'll see.
Watco owns a short line very close to Cushing and looking at some opportunities that are around there that we'll
probably develop here in the very near future.
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
We're very positive on this. And we've talked about this on the call. If you look at it from 30,000 feet, what's happening
in some of these plays is two things. Number one, there is a lot of oil coming to market, coming faster than pipe lines
can be built to handle it.
And secondly, you have this tremendous price differential. Everybody looks at CNBC or whatever, and sees the
difference between WTI and Brent. But there is also, and if you look closely, there is a wave, almost as much
difference between WTI and St. James for example in Louisiana.
So there is a tremendous need, not just to get the crude out, some time before pipelines are built. But also a need to be
able to be selective about where are you going to move that crude. And that's where unit-train operations handling oil
with the trains is very important. And that's one of the big reasons why we did -- made our preferred -- our investment
in preferred stock in Watco, why we are now encouraging and working toward these join ventures. And I think you'll
see some announcements probably in this quarter on some specific projects there.
Ted Durbin
Okay. Thanks very much guys. I appreciate it.

Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Yves. How are you doing?
Yves Siegel
Good. Thank you. Just following up on the last statement. Rich, what are the contract terms on the unit-trains, in terms
of duration?
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Jeff?
Jeffrey R. Armstrong, President, Terminals
We're looking at, on a unit-train basis rather multiple stock of five years plus. As Rich said, and I think the key is
getting them up and operating on a quick basis, take advantage of these orbs that are out there. We're certainly making
sure. Any of our contracts that more than cover, the capital costs associated with these investments.
Yves Siegel
Okay. And then, when you're looking at the expansion on the coal export facilities. How quick a turnaround is there? I
guess, where I'm going with this is that you make $175 million investment, but I would think that you turn that
investment into cash flow pretty quickly?
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Very much so. Again, I think well, if I follow these, for example on the two projects we've talked about, on the Ship
Channel, because we already have the land there. We have to do some additional work. We expect to be operational in
July of this year. On the project in Louisiana, expect to be in operation mid-year 2012. So these things can be built out
pretty quickly. So I think you get a good return, you get it pretty quickly.
Yves Siegel
So are we talking about 12 months for a project then?
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Jeff?
Jeffrey R. Armstrong, President, Terminals
It really I guess is more market-specific, but I think 12 months is probably a good rule of thumb, that's out there with
regard to the expansion, some of the smaller, as Rich said, smaller incremental expansions will be on quicker than that.
And some of the larger, mega products maybe a little bit longer.

Corporate Participant
And that will be air permitting right Jeff, and so I mean that can be a variable thing, from where you are and what
permits you already have.
Yves Siegel
And if I could, just two quick ones. The first I characterize perhaps as being naïve, Rich you said that the Board
approved to go ahead with engineering on the CO2 pipeline?
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah.
Yves Siegel
Why do you need Board approval for the engineering and how big a project could we be talking about?
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, we just shared with the Board what we thought the outline of the overall project would be and got their approval
to spend around $10 million on two different parts of the project just to get the thing kicked off.
And there is no question that there's going to be additional demand there. And there is no question that we are going to
ramp up our production at, in Southwest Colorado. The question is how much? And the beauty of it is that we can do it
on an incremental basis. And that's what some of these engineering dollars are going to go for.
So we are just starting to crawl before you walk, walk before you run on that. But there's clearly a tremendous demand
for additional CO2 and we are very intent on meeting that demand.
Yves Siegel
Okay. And then finally, had you updated the CapEx budget for this year?
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
We update CapEx budget, yes on a regular basis, right.
Yves Siegel
Guess, that was a bad question. What is the latest and greatest for the CapEx budget for '11?
C. Park Shaper, President
It's pretty consistent with what I have talked about at the Analyst Conference, Yves.

Our next question comes from John Edwards with Morgan Keegan. Your line is now open.
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Hi John. How are you doing?
John Edwards
Pretty well. Just one question, Rich, just any update on, you had talked earlier quarters on proposed projects coming out
of Marcellus. I'm just -- what's the latest and greatest there? I think you mentioned there was some volumes coming out
of it at the analyst meeting.
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think we mentioned, I think we've said for sometime now that clearly, we're not going to build a project of that
size and capital cost unless we have long-term throughput commitments from shippers, either producers in the
Marcellus or aggregators in the Marcellus or users up in Sarnia.
And until and unless we get those commitments, we're not going to build anything. So that's where we stand right now.
And we still are looking at the situation. But unless and until we get contracted we're not doing anything.
As I said earlier, we are having better results on using Cochin to move, ethane or EP mix and propane from the west to
the east across the line. And those look pretty promising. And that's what we are earning in on that.
And then on the batch-line basis also, using it to move oil, as I indicated in response to previous question. So there's
really no -- nothing new on the Marcellus efforts at this point in time. But we continue to look at a lot of different ways
to use Cochin, it's really a great opportunity for us.
John Edwards
Okay, great. Thank you very much. That's all I had. Thank you.

Hi, Brian.
Brian Zarahn
Hi Rich. On the excess cash flow, I'll ask the same question in a different way. What would be a range of distribution
coverage, a ratio you'll be comfortable with or to be similar to your guidance or your budget of about 1.03 times or
what would be the upper end of that range you'll be comfortable with for 2011?
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, of course, we previously -- I think our budget speaks for itself. Our budget had $37 million of coverage, and now
we're saying that 37 has perhaps morphed into $100 million or so. But we haven't made any exact determination, and
we'll just make that as we go forward during the rest of the year.
C. Park Shaper, President
And I think I'd say Brian, in some -- circumstances based on what's generating the excess coverage, what's going on
with our assets. What's going on with the overall economy and environment. And I think we'll just make that decision
as we go.
Brian Zarahn
Okay.
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Put it this way, it's a nice problem to have. And we hope that that nice problem continues for the next quarter or two.
Brian Zarahn
Fair enough. And what's clearly a gas storage facility, any update on the contract renewal process?
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Tom Martin?
Tom Martin, President, Natural Gas Pipelines
Not really. I mean, it comes up for renewal first quarter next year. We're in discussions with them. And if we can get a
deal that's satisfactory for us and for them that's worth renewing, we'll do it. Otherwise, we certainly are looking at
other ways to get much better value out of that asset as we move into 2012.
Richard D. Kinder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Let us put it this way. That it will be -- for us, either we will get better terms with the present user or we will take it
over ourselves and we can do better with it, because this was contracted in a different time. So that's going to be a plus
