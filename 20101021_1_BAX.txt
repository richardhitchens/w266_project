Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.
Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President
Thanks, Mary Kay, good morning. Thanks for calling in this morning. I'm pleased to announce that our third quarter
results reported earlier this morning exceeded the guidance that we provided last quarter, with adjusted earnings per
share of $1.01 per diluted share. On a reported basis, worldwide sales increased 3%. And on an organic basis, sales
increased 4%, which compares favorably to our guidance range of 1% to 3%. While Bob will provide more details on
the third quarter financial results and outlook for the remainder of the year, as you saw, we are reconfirming our
earnings guidance at the high end of the range that we provided to all of you last quarter, which now includes adjusted
EPS of $3.96 to $3.98 per share.
During the quarter, we continued to make progress on numerous fronts despite a continuing challenging environment.
First, as we've discussed, Baxter and the market more broadly have been operating through a transition period in the
plasma proteins market. And beginning in the second quarter, as you know, we implemented some specific actions to
stabilize our share position.
I'm encouraged with the progress that we're making with our demand creation activities and commercial strategies, as
evidenced by improved global demand for GAMMAGARD LIQUID. And while we'll continue to face some difficult
comparisons related to healthcare reform and the termination of the WinRho agreement, our volume growth has
accelerated. Distributor inventory levels of GAMMAGARD remain balanced with underlying demand, and we
finalized agreements with the majority of our U.S. customers with terms that now extend through the end of 2011.
As I've mentioned in the past, we remain confident that the plasma business will be an attractive growth vehicle in the
coming years, due to an increase in end user demand resulting from deployment of additional sales resources for those
indications that remain underdiagnosed and undertreated, Baxter's introduction of new and proprietary administration
technologies, expansion of new indications such as MMN, and of course the significant opportunity of a potential
Alzheimer's indication.
Over the last several months, we continued to enhance our market leadership with a number of commercial
achievements, a few of which I'd like to highlight. First, a new five-year contract with Novation, a leading healthcare
supply contracting company of VHA Incorporated, the University HealthSystem Consortium, or UHC, and Provista.
This agreement provides Novation members access to Baxter's broad portfolio of products, including IV solutions, drug
delivery, and parenteral nutritional products, large volume infusion pumps, and IV administration sets and components.
We also announced in the quarter a manufacturing, supply, and distribution agreement with Kamada for GLASSIA, the
first and only liquid alpha1-proteinase inhibitor. Under this agreement, Baxter acquired commercial rights to GLASSIA
in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Under a separate license agreement, we've been granted the right to
process GLASSIA, and will seek necessary regulatory approvals to do so. GLASSIA was approved by the FDA in July
2010 and was recently launched in the U.S.
Also in the quarter, we announced a collaboration between Baxter and Takeda for the development, production, and
supply of cell culture-based influenza vaccines for the Japanese market. During the quarter, Takeda was selected as a
recipient of a subsidy from the Japanese government to support an investment associated with the development and
production of pandemic influenza vaccines. Takeda plans to apply for additional government funding under a second
supplementary budget and further expand its collaboration with our company.
And finally, we launched a number of new products during the quarter, including ADVATE in Brazil. the U.S. launch
of TachoSil, an absorbable fibrin sealant patch for use in cardiovascular surgery, and the launch in Europe and Canada
of the first and only 30-gram dose vial for GAMMAGARD LIQUID and KIOVIG. This new dosage form is the most
frequently prescribed dose for primary immune deficiency patients and will enhance user convenience.
Finally, I'd like to highlight that we continue to fund all of our key late-stage R&D programs, as evidenced by a number
milestones which occurred during the quarter. For example, we continue to extend our leadership position in

hemophilia in recombinant proteins with the initiation of a global Phase I-II clinical trial studying the safety and
tolerability of BAX-817, a recombinant Factor VIIa therapy for the treatment of hemophilia A or B patients with
inhibitors. And we've also dosed the first patient in our Phase I-III clinical trial for BAX 326, a recombinant Factor IX
treatment for patients with hemophilia B.
Also during the quarter, we completed our Phase I recombinant Von Willebrand clinical trial, and we expect interim
safety and tolerability data to be presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December of this year.
In addition, we expect to initiate a Phase III trial in 2011.
During the quarter, we announced the approval in Austria and the Czech Republic for PREFLUCEL, our seasonal
influenza vaccine manufactured using Baxter's proprietary Vero cell technology. Starting in the fourth quarter, we
expect to submit for approval in additional European countries through a mutual recognition procedure.
In the third quarter, we completed enrollment in a Phase III clinical trial of GAMMAGARD LIQUID and KIOVIG for
the treatment of multifocal motor neuropathy, or MMN. The trial includes approximately 40 participants and is being
conducted at clinical sites across the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Given the required 15-month follow-up period, we
expect to complete this trial in 2011.
Interim data from a Phase III clinical trial of HyQ was recently presented at the European Society for
Immunodeficiencies meeting in Istanbul, Turkey. HyQ is an immunoglobulin therapy facilitated subcutaneously by
recombinant human hyaluronidase. Interim analyses show that 28 out of 29 HyQ study participants with primary
immune deficiency were able to infuse immunoglobulin under the skin using a single injection site at infusion volumes,
intervals, and rates equivalent to their previous IV administration of immunoglobulin. As you know, we expect to
complete this trial by the end of the year and file for approval in 2011.
We continue to advance our Phase III GAMMAGARD LIQUID trial for Alzheimer's. To date, we've randomized over
220 patients, and are on target to complete enrollment in mid-2011. With an 18-month follow-up period, we currently
expect to complete the trial by the end of 2012.
And finally, we recently finalized our IDE [Investigational Device Exemption] application for our home hemodialysis
clinical trial and submitted it to the FDA. Upon acceptance of the IDE, we plan to start clinical trials in the U.S. later
this year or early 2011.
These achievements which I've just summarized depict just a handful of the programs in our pipeline that will present
great opportunities for Baxter in the years to come.
So with that, I'd like to ask Bob to review our third quarter financial results and guidance for the year in more detail.
And then I'll come back and provide some closing perspectives. Bob, if you would.
Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and
Treasurer
Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our financial performance in
the third quarter, with earnings per share of $1.01 per diluted share, which exceeded our guidance range of $0.96 to
$0.99 per share. This was largely the result of continued momentum in the Medication Delivery business, improvement
in antibody therapy and plasma protein dynamics, and our continued focus on expense management.
Let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to our financial outlook for the remainder of
2010. Starting with sales, worldwide sales totaled 3.2 billion in the third quarter and increased 3%. Excluding foreign
currency, sales increased 4%. Sales growth in the U.S. was 4%, led by double-digit revenue growth in Medication
Delivery. On a reported basis, international sales increased 1%. Excluding foreign currency, international sales
advanced 4%, as strong double-digit sales growth in antibody therapy, plasma proteins, and biosurgery products was
partially offset by soft sales in Europe across several product categories, most notably vaccine revenues.

In terms of individual business performance and beginning with BioScience, global sales in the third quarter totaled
approximately 1.4 billion, which was comparable to the prior-year period. Excluding foreign currency, BioScience
sales increased 3%. Within the product categories, recombinant sales of 526 million were flat to the prior year on a
reported basis. Excluding foreign currency, sales increased 2%, driven by robust sales of ADVATE, particularly in the
U.S. where revenues advanced in double digits. However, this performance was largely offset by lower sales in Europe
given the results of the UK tender and our decision to lower RECOMBINATE inventory levels in the U.S. channel as
we remained focused on driving conversion to ADVATE. Excluding these factors, recombinant growth was
approximately 8% on a constant currency basis.
Moving on to plasma proteins, sales in the quarter were 346 million and increased 5%. Excluding the impact of foreign
currency, sales increased 8%. As you know, approximately 50% of the plasma portfolio is comprised of a broad array
of proprietary products, including FEIBA, an inhibitor therapy; ARALAST, a treatment for hereditary emphysema; and
FLEXBUMIN, albumin provided in a flexible plastic container.
Contributing to the performance in this category was growth of ARALAST, double-digit growth of FEIBA, and strong
demand for albumin outside the U.S. This was partially offset by lower sales of plasma derived Factor VIII and U.S.
albumin sales. While we continue to see strong volume growth for albumin in emerging markets such as China, market
demand in U.S. continues to be below last year due to lower hospital admissions and surgical procedures.
In antibody therapy, sales of 336 million were flat to the prior year; and excluding foreign currency, sales increased
2%. U.S. sales were 230 million, reflecting a decline of 4% versus the prior year. Strong volume in the quarter was
more than offset by the impact of our commercial strategies to stabilize share and a seven percentage point impact to
growth related to healthcare reform and year-over-year comparison to WinRho. Outside the U.S., antibody therapy
sales of 106 million increased 9% as we continue to see strong growth in volume across the regions, which was
somewhat offset by lower prices, particularly in Europe.
Sales in Regenerative Medicine, which includes our biosurgery products, totaled 130 million and increased 19%. Sales
excluding foreign currency grew 22% and continue to reflect healthy growth across the core portfolio and
approximately 15 million in incremental sales related to the ApaTech acquisition completed earlier this year.
Finally, revenues in the other category within BioScience were down 40% to $49 million due primarily to a difficult
comparison related to advanced purchase agreement revenues recorded last year and lower sales of the NeisVac-C
vaccine.
In Medication Delivery, sales totaled 1.2 billion, an increase of 5% on a reported basis. And excluding foreign
currency, Medication Delivery sales grew 7%. In the U.S., sales were strong and advanced 12%, while international
sales excluding the impact of foreign currency increased 2%.
Turning to the product categories, IV therapy sales totaled 417 million in the quarter and grew 5%. Excluding foreign
currency, sales increased 7%. Strong U.S. sales, which increased 18%, resulted from increased demand, particularly for
nutritional products due to competitor supply issues as well as improved pricing.
Global injectable sales advanced 8% to 469 million. Excluding foreign currency, sales grew 9%. Contributing to this
performance was strong growth of select premixed drugs and multi-source generics, as well as significant growth in
certain enhanced packaging offerings such as our MINI-BAG and MINI-BAG Plus products.
Infusion system sales totaled 213 million and increased 2%. Excluding foreign currency, sales increased 2%. Strong
sales of Sigma SPECTRUM pumps more than offset lower COLLEAGUE and Access set revenues.
And finally, anesthesia sales totaled 127 million and increased 3%. Excluding foreign currency, sales increased 5%,
driven by growth of both SUPRANE and Sevoflurane globally despite declines in surgical procedures.
Moving on to Renal, third quarter sales totaled 594 million and increased 3% on both a reported basis and when
adjusting for foreign currency. U.S. sales increased 2% as improved PD growth offset lower HD revenues. International
sales increased 3%. And excluding foreign currency, international sales increased 4%.

Global PD sales totaled 487 million and increased 3% on both a reported basis and after adjusting for foreign currency.
This performance can be attributed to building momentum in PD patient gains in the U.S., resulting in 5% growth in
U.S. PD revenues. In markets outside the U.S., patient gains in Latin America and Asia partially offset slower growth
across Europe.
And lastly, hemodialysis sales of 107 million increased 4%. Excluding foreign currency, HD sales increased 5% as
CRRT [Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy] sales, the hemofiltration business that we acquired last year, offset
lower sales of dialyzers in the U.S.
Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin for the company was 51.5% in the third quarter, which improved
sequentially by 20 basis points. However, the third quarter gross margin is 130 basis points lower than last year's
margin of 52.8, which is largely a result of the healthcare reform impact and cost inefficiencies driven by lower volume
throughput in the plasma and vaccine businesses.
We successfully leveraged SG&A, which totaled 670 million in the quarter and was comparable to the prior-year
period. Excluding foreign currency, SG&A increased 1%. In addition, SG&A as a percent of sales was 20.8% in the
quarter, the lowest level in several years, reflecting sequential improvement of 90 basis points and improvement year
over year of 60 basis points. While we continue to aggressively manage general, administrative, and discretionary
spending across the company, we're selectively investing in several key promotional activities aimed at demand
creation, new product launches, and driving future growth of our higher margin products.
R&D spending of 207 million declined 9%, which can be attributed to the impact of foreign currency, completed
clinical work on several programs, and lower milestone payments to partners. It's important to note that we continued
to invest in all key R&D programs across the product pipeline. In fact, excluding the factors previously mentioned,
R&D spending on key programs increased in mid-single digits.
The operating margin in the third quarter was 24.3%. And despite our challenges in a difficult macro environment, this
is a new historic level for our company. The operating margin increased sequentially by 160 basis points and improved
20 basis points versus the prior year as a result of our disciplined focus on cost management.
Interest expense was 24 million compared to 23 million last year, while other expense was 5 million as miscellaneous
expenses more than offset foreign currency gains.
The tax rate was 21.1% in the quarter, 240 basis points above last year, primarily due to a change in earnings mix
between higher tax and lower tax jurisdictions.
And finally, as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 per diluted share, an increase of 3%.
Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations was strong in the quarter and exceeded $1 billion. On a year-to-date
basis, cash flow from operations totaled approximately 2.1 billion and includes the first quarter pension contribution of
$300 million. Excluding pension contributions from both years, on a year-to-date basis cash flow from operations
improved by more than 300 million versus the same period last year. This represents a 17% increase in cash flow.
DSO ended the quarter at 56.2 days, which was lower than last year by two days. This is largely due to improvements
in international DSOs as our DSO in the U.S. is less than 30 days.
Inventory turns of 2.4 reflect an improvement versus last year, primarily driven by better turns in both Medication
Delivery and BioScience.
And lastly, during the third quarter we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for 161 million. On a net basis,
this amounts to repurchases of 2.7 million shares or 128 million. Year to date, we've repurchased 26.3 million shares of
common stock for almost $1.3 billion; or on a net basis 20 million shares for over $1 billion, in line with our objective
for the full year 2010.
Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and
update you on our full-year 2010 guidance before turning the call back to Bob. First, for the full year 2010, as you saw

in the press release, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.96 to $3.98. By line item of the P&L and
starting with sales, we expect full-year sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency of 2% to 3%. Based on
current foreign exchange rates, we now expect reported sales growth for 2010 to be in the 3% to 4% range.
For the full year, we continue to expect gross margin to decline approximately 100 basis points from the 2009 gross
margin rate of 52.4%. Given current foreign exchange rates, we now expect SG&A to increase modestly year over
year, and R&D to decline in low single digits versus 2009. As we mentioned previously, we will continue to intensify
our focus on managing costs throughout the organization.
We continue to expect interest expense of approximately 100 million and other expenses to total approximately 25
million.
Given our mix of earnings, we now expect our tax rate to approximate 20%. And finally we continue to expect a
full-year average share count of approximately 595 million shares.
From a cash flow perspective, we now expect to generate cash flow from operations of approximately 2.8 billion.
Now to expand on the full-year sales assumptions for each of the businesses; first on a constant currency basis, we
continue to expect mid-single digit sales growth for Medication Delivery. For
Renal, we expect sales growth to be in low single digits on a constant currency basis. This is somewhat lower than
original guidance primarily due to lower than expected HD sales. As for BioScience, we now expect sales excluding
foreign currency to be approximately flat, which is an improvement from our guidance provided last quarter.
For the recombinant business, we now expect growth for the full year to be in low single digits, which includes the
impact of healthcare reform, results of the UK tender, and anticipated reductions in RECOMBINATE inventories.
Second, we now expect plasma protein sales to be flat, and antibody therapy sales to decline in mid-single digits,
reflecting stabilization in our share position, improving demand, as well as healthcare reform and the difficult
comparison related to the termination of the WinRho agreement. Third, we expect regenerative medicine sales growth
to exceed 20%, reflecting the ApaTech acquisition and double-digit growth in the base business. And finally, we expect
the other category within BioScience to decline approximately 20%, reflecting lower revenues associated with advance
purchase agreements and other vaccines.
For the fourth quarter, as we mentioned in our press release, we expect earnings per diluted share of $1.09 to $1.11, and
sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency of 1% to 2%. Based on current foreign exchange rates, we
expect reported sales to be approximately flat to the prior year.
I would point out that we expect sales growth to slow in the fourth quarter due to a number of factors, including the
difficult comparison related to H1N1 revenues, the anniversary of the SIGMA distribution agreement and CRRT
acquisition, as well as lower recombinant revenues resulting from the UK tender and reduction of RECOMBINATE
inventories.
As always, I'd be happy to take any questions on our financial performance and guidance during the Q&A, but now let
me turn the call back over to Bob for his closing comments.
Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President
Thanks, Bob. Before we open up this morning's call to Q&A, I'd like to briefly comment on some the organization
changes that were announced last week, both in terms of some of the structural changes as well as changes in
leadership.
First, as you know, we announced that our Renal business will be combined with Medication Delivery to form a new
business sector, Medical Products. While the go-to-market channels and the clinical differentiation will certainly
remain separate and distinct between these businesses, the back ends of the two businesses are actually remarkably
similar. As a result, this new structure I believe will enhance both our effectiveness and efficiency over time. Peritoneal

dialysis solutions and IV solutions are comprised of similar product development and manufacturing technologies, as
are the disposable set and electronic instruments utilized in their administration. There are a significant number of
similarities and synergies not only in product development and manufacturing but in supply chain and regulatory and
quality systems as well.
Rob Davis, whom you all know and who has been running the Renal business, has been named President of Medical
Products. Peter Arduini, who served as President of Medication Delivery over the past five-plus years, is leaving Baxter
to assume the position of President and COO of Integra Life Sciences. I'm convinced that this new integrated structure
for the Renal and Medication Delivery business units will pay significant dividends for our customers and the patients
that they serve, and also for our shareholders.
Ludwig Hantson was named as the new President of the BioScience business segment. Ludwig replaces Joy
Amundson, who served as President of BioScience over the last six years, a period which saw significant growth and
where BioScience was the major contributor to Baxter's overall success during that period of time. We're very fortunate
to have an executive with Ludwig's pharmaceutical experience. He spent the last 22 years of his career at Novartis and
J&J before joining Baxter earlier this year. Baxter's specialty pharmaceutical new product pipeline is the strongest that
it has ever been. And as we prepare for multiple new product launches in the coming years, Ludwig's capabilities and
expertise will make a tremendous difference. And I'd certainly be happy to expand on that if you'd like during the Q&A
this morning.
So with that, why don't we open up the call for the Q&A?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We have Bob Hopkins on the line with Bank of America.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Thanks, can you hear me okay?
Operator
We can hear you loud and clear.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Great.
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: Hi, Bob. Thank
you.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Good morning, so I just wanted to start out with some questions on BioSciences. First of all, on
the slight change in thoughts on the recombinant line, first of all from a macro perspective, should we read into what
you're saying that that line item should decelerate from the 2% growth that you put up here in the third quarter? And
then more specifically, could you just, if you would, try to quantify the impact of the UK tender and of the
RECOMBINATE inventory reduction and how long that might be a drag? Thanks.
<A - Robert Parkinson, Jr.>: Yes, Bob. Let me start and then Bob and Mary Kay can maybe add some additional
information to try to be helpful. If you adjust for, as we said in the comments, both the UK tender and the reduction in
RECOMBINATE inventories in the U.S., overall RECOMBINATE sales globally grew in say the 7% to 8% range in
Q3, which is pretty consistent to what it has been running. Our sales outside the U.S., again adjusted for the UK tender,
in all other OUS markets actually grew fairly strong double digits. So the momentum in the business continues. The
loss of the volume in the UK tender clearly is meaningful. I think we had annualized sales in the UK, Mary Kay,
correct me, of approximately $100 million.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: Approximately over...

<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: A little bit over that, a little bit.
So frankly, Bob, how much of that we ultimately lose is still being sorted out. That tender occurred in two different
waves, and not all the patients have converted. Obviously, we're watching that very closely over time in terms of things
like inhibitor formation and the like.
So relative to the dynamic in the U.S. then, this is really a continued effect of conversion from RECOMBINATE to
ADVATE. Actually, ADVATE in the U.S. in the third quarter, correct me if I'm wrong, I think grew double digits.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: And so it's evident that a
couple of our wholesalers are overstocked on RECOMBINATE and they have reduced their inventories during the
third quarter. I would tell you for the fourth quarter, we would expect that to continue, in answer to your question. So as
we move into the fourth quarter, that inventory reduction that I described will continue. We're going to continue to
incur the impact of the UK tender. But the rest of the dynamics globally of the RECOMBINATE business and the
hemophilia business I think continue to be pretty strong. Do you want to add to that?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes. Bob, this is Mary Kay. I'd add that
we have a difficult comp last year in the U.S., where I think we saw double-digit, 11% growth in the fourth quarter. So
you should expect Q4 sales in the RECOMBINATE category to actually be lower than the prior year. And that's a
result of the destocking opportunity that Bob is talking about as well as the UK tender.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Okay, and then just one follow-up also on BioSciences. I was wondering if you could quantify
the impact of the Octapharma situation on this quarter. Was there any benefit that you saw from that, and just some
thoughts on that and how that might impact the business going forward?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: There was really little to no
impact in our third quarter results, Bob, as a result of that. We've reflected modest impact in our fourth quarter
guidance that Bob took you through. I think it's still too early to project what the longer term impact of that will be as
various regulators are taking various positions on that and so on. So you're probably as close to that as we are; but in
terms of our own results, little to no impact in the third quarter, and modest projection in Q4.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Modest being like 5 to 10 million area?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Less than that.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Okay, thanks very much, guys.
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: I'd say slightly
higher than that globally.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Globally, yes.

<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Hi, thanks for taking the question.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Hi, Kristen.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: I was just wondering if you could just maybe give us a little bit more color on some of your
commentary on the end markets within IVIG. You had expressed a little bit of confidence in what you're seeing. And
then also, can you just give us an update on how much in terms of the percentage of outstanding contracts you have
secured up for 2011 as we look down the road, and just think about how 2011 may shake out for IVIG, specifically to
the U.S.?

<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Kristen, this is Bob Parkinson.
Let me kick that off, and we'll do a team response here because there are multiple aspects of your question. Let me start
with the second piece. I would say the majority of our hospital contract business, as I think I touched on in my prepared
comments, is actually secured now through year end 2011.
And in terms of market dynamics, I think we would characterize the underlying market growth to the best of our
abilities to quantify this in the U.S. probably mid-single digits in IVIG right now. Clearly, it's more robust OUS,
probably approaching high single digits. Bob and Mary Kay, do you want to add any facts to that?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: I think that's pretty accurate. We have seen
some good growth, Kristen, coming out of the PPTA [Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association] data that you all see,
as well as we've talked about this in past. We track our own redistribution data, which has shown an acceleration in
volume as well, which is sales of our product going from the distributors to the end user and into the hospital channel.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Perfect. And then can we just get an update on SIGMA? I know this quarter you guys had said
you had pretty good sales there. Where do you stand from a manufacturing standpoint of just ramping up production of
the pumps?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: We're not going to quantify
existing production capacity, Kristen. Suffice it to say that we have been and are continuing to ramp up production to
convert as many of the install base of the COLLEAGUEs as we possibly can over next two years. It's still too early to
tell I think in terms of what the share shifts may or may not be over time. But we're doing everything we can, putting
all the resources at ramping it up as significantly as we can. So I'll just leave it at that.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: And you also just commented on some of the impacts of healthcare reform and WinRho. Can
you just remind us what that was for the IVIG business again?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Bob or Mary Kay?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: It had a seven point impact overall on the
antibody therapy line, and that's the combination of WinRho and healthcare reform.

Bruce Nudell of UBS is on the line with a question. Please state your question.
<Q - Bruce Nudell>: Good morning, thank you so much.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Good morning.
<Q - Bruce Nudell>: Yes, hi. Could you remind us in aggregate how much in dollars of the healthcare reform accruals
that you've made so far this year? And I know you were very conservative in how you constructed that, assuming
almost entire conversion of hospitals and institutions that were eligible for 340B. And how much of that has actually
occurred, and is there a potential for a reversal of that accrual?
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: Bruce, this is Bob
Hombach. Yes, we continued to accrue just towards the number that we've been projecting up to this point. We're still
at a stage where the visibility to how many hospitals are actually going to avail themselves of the opportunity to sign up
for 340B is still not crystal clear. We project about 40% of those who could have applied have applied. But there still is
time for them to do that as we approach the end of the year. Unfortunately, this one is not going to become clear to us
towards the end of the year and maybe not even by the end of the year. So at this point, we continue to accrue towards
what we had originally projected.

<Q - Bruce Nudell>: I see. So the reversal, if it occurs, has to occur next year?
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: No, we'll take a
view. There is the aspect of the retroactive nature of this potentially back to January of 2010. But I believe if hospitals
don't sign up by the end of this year, that may not be available to them, and that's certainly something that we originally
factored into our accrual. So that we would certainly adjust for as we end this year.
<Q - Bruce Nudell>: But I guess of the 80 million or so healthcare reform, how much is 340B related and therefore
uncertain?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: I'd say a significant portion of
it is 340B related.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, the biggest impact, as you know,
Bruce, there was the Medicaid rebate impact.
<Q - Bruce Nudell>: Yes.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: And then there's the increase in the
discount to those 340B entities that were already a 340B entity. And then there are these new eligible entities that Bob
was talking about where we believe about 40% have already signed up, and that was the biggest piece of our healthcare
reform impact.
<Q - Bruce Nudell>: Okay, so about 40% of that has been exercised you know of?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: That is correct.
<Q - Bruce Nudell>: Okay, great. And my only other question is with regards to recombinant demand in the United
States, do you think PPTA data is a decent surrogate at this time for underlying volume demand in high single digits at
this instant?
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: Yes, I think our
view on that has been that looking more at the rolling 12-month data versus the month to month or quarter to quarter is
a better view. But yes, I think that mid to high single digit underlying growth is reasonably accurate.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, I think Bruce, too, if you go back to
our investor conference, we talked about recombinant sales growth in I think the 6% to 8% range, but that assumes
slower growth here in the U.S. in the mid-single digit, probably 4% to 5% range.
<Q - Bruce Nudell>: Right now, last year looks stronger than that from PPTA data on a rolling basis.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, that would be correct.
<Q - Bruce Nudell>: Okay, and is home dialysis a 510(k) or PMA [Pre-Market Approval]?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: I'm sorry, what was that?
<Q - Bruce Nudell>: Is the home dialysis IDE, is it a 510(k) or a PMA?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: Our assumption currently is a 510(k).

<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David Lewis>: Bob, just coming back to IVIG here for a second, obviously the number was much stronger than
we were expecting. So can we just first of all talk about rebate activity? You talked about it being targeted off the
second quarter. Did you see an expansion of rebate activity at the company, and should we expect a further expansion
heading into the fourth quarter?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: When you say rebate activity,
specifically what are you referring to?
<Q - David Lewis>: You talked about targeted pricing. Our sense is that you've used rebates as a method for engaging
in targeted pricing with customers. I think surgical strike pricing, something like that, was your commentary off the
second quarter. I'm just wondering if we've gone from surgical strike pricing with rebating and targeted price cuts to a
broader action in the third or fourth quarter.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: No, not really, I think that the
activities we've undertaken are very much in line with what we've been messaging from the start. And yes, there are
contracts that involve rebates, David. But no, I think what we've executed really over the last three to six months here
has been very much in line with what we described to all of you at the outset.
<Q - David Lewis>: Great, so just maybe two more quick questions and starting with one follow-up. So in this
particular quarter, Bob, if you had to describe the source of upside for your IVIG business both U.S. and worldwide, do
you think it was concerted expectations? Was it better share gains? Maybe give us more color on what you think drove
the relative upside.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: I think the actions we've taken
clearly were very effective, and they were effective very quickly. The price premium on GAMMAGARD, clearly we
closed that very significantly. And the market was very, very responsive to that, not only in terms of retaining volume
in the short term, but allowing us to secure contracts, as I mentioned in my comments, now for the majority of our U.S.
hospital business out through the end of the year 2011. So I think that's probably the primary aspect of the stronger
volume that we reported in the third quarter in the U.S. Clearly, volumes outside the United States continue to grow
very nicely.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: Dave, I would add, there was a lot of
assumptions that went into our original guidance reduction. And if you remember, we had said at that time that the
market growth was in low single digits. Clearly, we're seeing that market growth has accelerated, as Bob mentioned, to
mid-single digits, as well as we had assumed additional share loss, which obviously we're not seeing that.
<Q - David Lewis>: Perfect, and just one last financial question. Just to give two dynamics in the quarter that did the
opposite of what we were expecting, gross margins were better but tax rate was much higher. And maybe the question
is about the sustainability of those gross margins. And back in your LRP late last year, you talked about the expansion
of tax rate for your company in the next three to four years. Is this the first sign of that in your mind or is this more
about mix? And so net-net, what we can expect as it relates going forward in terms of gross margin and tax rate trends?
Thank you.
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: I'll start with the tax
rate. Clearly the mix of earnings this year has been quite a bit different than we originally projected. The
underperformance in Europe really across all three businesses in a place where we've got pretty efficient tax structures
has negatively impacted the rate; and on the other side of the equation, very strong performance in the U.S., particularly
by Medication Delivery in a high tax environment, so it's primarily a mix shift there. We did anticipate some of that as
we go forward here, but this has happened to a larger degree. So as we look into 2011, we'll have to evaluate the
Europe/U.S. mix of earnings as we think about the tax rate going forward.
In terms of gross margin, clearly the stronger performance in the quarter by the BioScience business and what I would
characterize as the faster recovery in the IVIG space in particular certainly helped margins. As we go forward here

though, we are going to be faced with starting to feel the impact of the slowdown in collections and slowdown in
throughput in the plasma business starting to roll out to our P&L given the long inventory hold periods as we started
taking those actions late last year and early this year. We're starting to feel the impacts of that as we go into fourth
quarter, and that will be a headwind as we go into 2011 on margin.

David Roman is on the line with a question from Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.
<Q - David Roman>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David Roman>: I wanted to see, Bob, if you could update us on your latest thoughts on the pharma tax for next
year. I think you provided some numbers earlier this year. And then any thoughts on how that might flow through just
from an accounting perspective. And then I have one follow-up on the plasma business?
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: Yes, so we've
estimated at this point the pharma tax is going to be 30 to 40 million, and at this point don't know for sure what the
geography is going to be on the P&L for that one. I think the med device one a couple years down the road is a little
clearer, that that's an excise tax that probably ends up in SG&A. But the pharma tax between revenue and SG&A is still
an open question.
<Q - David Roman>: Okay. And then from an operating expense perspective, you called out SG&A as one of the
lowest levels it has been in several years, R&D also as a percentage of revenue. I know currency has an impact there.
That also was fairly low as a percent of sales. Maybe going forward, could you just help us think about the sustainable
level of discretionary spending?
And one of the other things you talked about earlier this year was pulling back on some of the wild-card type
investments in that R&D line. Did that have any contribution this quarter? And is 6.5% a number in R&D to think
about, or is seven, where you had been running?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: I think it will stay in that range
going forward, David, the 6.5 to 7% range. As we commented, every one of our major programs remain fully funded. I
think Bob commented that in fact of our significant programs, actually our R&D in the quarter actually increased
mid-single digits versus last year. The reduction was largely associated with the culmination of a couple of key
programs, one of which is the flu program. So our level of spending on our flu vaccine programs is down significantly.
Also, some payments to partners and a couple of R&D collaborations and so on were the significant contributors to the
lower spending level in Q3.
But I don't think you should interpret the Q3 results as at all a change in strategic direction. I think it's important that
we maintain some level of, call it exploratory or early-stage funding. I think that's very important. We're committed to
continue to do that going forward. I don't know, Bob, if...
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: I would just add on
the R&D a couple things. One, from a foreign exchange standpoint, our R&D spend, almost 50% of it is outside the
U.S., primarily in Europe. So FX has a slightly bigger impact on the R&D line than it would have on SG&A and other.
The other thing I would say is the exploratory funding, which is modest generally, is really where we rationalized this
year initially. Plus we took a charge in the fourth quarter of 2009 to rationalize some of our R&D operations, primarily
on the device side, and so we're seeing the full benefits of that coming through as well. So I think those two factors
have driven that down.

On the SG&A side in terms of sustainability of the discretionary spend actions that we've taken, as we indicated, we're
really focused on the back office G&A lines to try to constrain spending, particularly around head count growth there.
But we continue to fund the promotional activities around demand creation and new product launches that we think are
going to be important to drive the top line going forward. So we don't think we've compromised that aspect of our
spend at all here, and still room to continue to drive some cost reductions

Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan is on the line with a question. Please state your question.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Thank you for taking the questions. First, maybe just turning to the Med Delivery business,
I was hoping you could just shed a little bit more light on the growth in the U.S. for IV therapies, which was up 18%.
And then infusion systems, which was up 8% despite obviously the issues with COLLEAGUE. Both very strong
numbers, and I think particularly infusion systems with what was going on with COLLEAGUE. So maybe you can help
us out there.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Yeah, let me kick this off,
Mike. This is Bob Parkinson. A number of different pieces. Obviously first of all, at a high level, we're very pleased
with the growth of our Med-Del business, particularly in the U.S. We were advantaged in the quarter to some degree by
some competitive supply issues, particularly in the area of nutritionals and some of our multi-source generics and so on.
I also commented in my prepared comments and I highlight the contract that we signed with Novation. And we've
probably picked up a little bit of business there as well, which certainly is sustainable going forward. So the nutritional
business continues to do very well, not just in the U.S., but on a global basis, which is helpful, as you know, in terms of
margin profile. And what are the other pieces that I'm missing? Those are really the biggest pieces.
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: We've definitely
seen some good pricing improvement in the base IV business. And as I mentioned in my comments, some competitor
issues on the nutritional front in the U.S. provided opportunity there as well.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: And I would just add, Mike, IV Solutions
year-to-date are up double digits in the U.S. That's driven by some of the market share gains I think Bob was discussing
as well as the improved pricing environment. And then Bob mentioned the nutritional competitive issues that we're
picking up some share there.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: And on the infusion systems
front, we have some competitive wins with the SPECTRUM pump, and that continues to do very well in the
marketplace. So while customers are currently evaluating their options as we provided them with the COLLEAGUE
transition guide only in September here, during the quarter, again, we did see some competitive wins and some nice
growth with the SPECTRUM pump.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Great. Before we get to January, I want to make sure we're thinking generally about 2011
correctly. It seems like on the call here you highlighted a few items that will impact the P&L. There's obviously impact
from healthcare reform next year. You talked about lower throughput for plasma proteins, and that's starting to show up
maybe in the fourth quarter and into next year. And then lower growth within recombinants, which is obviously a high
margin business for you, as well as a couple other items. Should we be thinking about 2011 after margin gains this
year, 2011 in which we'll probably not see operating leverage down the P&L, or is that still possible?

<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: I think it's too early to call that,
Mike, frankly. But yes, look, there are headwinds. And if you look at some of the dynamics that we continue to manage
through and we've incurred in 2010, they just don't all go away come December 31, as much as we might like that. So
while we continue to be optimistic about the future in many ways and for many reasons, there are a number of these
headwinds that are going to continue.
The other thing I would tell you that you didn't mention is just the underlying surgical procedure volume and so on.
One of the things that as you look in the detail of the quarter that was softer than we had anticipated was our biosurgery
business. When you adjust out for the ApaTech acquisition last year, the rest of our biosurgery business was about 9,
10% growth for the quarter, which is lower than what it has been, and frankly I think is an indication of the continued
softness in underlying surgical procedures.
So I'm not trying to paint too negative of an outlook here, but I think we have to be realistic as we go forward to say a
lot of positive things going, but there's going to be some headwinds that are going to be sustainable. And I guess maybe
to close where I started, it's too early to project what the net effect of those are, but I think just a lot of variables we all
need to continue to watch.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: I appreciate it; one last follow-up. With you locking in a lot of your 2011 contracts for
IVIG at this point, can you give us a sense of where those are coming out for pricing relative to 2010?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Well, without being too
specific for a lot of reasons, let me just give you some general direction, Mike, which hopefully will be helpful. We
had, going into all this let's say a year ago, probably I would say high single digit price premium on GAMMAGARD
versus the rest of the products in the market. That premium has closed significantly. We still are the premium product,
but that premium has closed fairly significantly. And I would tell you the contracts that I referenced that we've now
signed extending through the end of 2011 have really been at what I call the touch-up prices, so we didn't need to offer
additional price discounts to secure that volume. So hopefully that gives you enough input you can put your arms
around it.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: That's good. Thank you, Bob.

Rick Wise of Leerink Swann is on the line with a question. Please state your question.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Good morning, Bob. A couple things, one just a high level follow-up. Post the management changes
and the combination of the Med Delivery and Renal businesses, I'm just curious what you've charged Rob with doing in
combining those two businesses, and what you see the opportunities are. Do you think there are going to be incremental
sales opportunities because of bundling or customers? And maybe talk, if you could, about your thoughts about what
kind of margin, operating margin benefits you think we could see, if any.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Great question, Rick, and again
I'm not going to quantify the potential margin enhancement opportunity at this stage. Having said that, clearly I
wouldn't have made this change if I didn't think there weren't meaningful opportunities here. And I would start with by
saying I think the biggest opportunity is as much effectiveness, enhancing our effectiveness as it is in terms of taking
cost out. Both are opportunities. But let me give you some examples of that.
First of all, bundling, you mentioned that. I don't see any bundling opportunities. In terms of go-to-market, detailing PD
solutions to nephrologists will always remain a separate and distinct activity for detailing SUPRANE to an
anesthesiologist. Those will remain separate and distinct. But I think in the back end of the business, starting with
manufacturing, you don't go – and very few of our solution plants around the world manufacture both IV solutions and
PD solutions. Manufacturing was a separate organization that also reported to me and now that has reported into Rob as

part of the consolidation of Renal and Med Del.
So I think the integration of manufacturing and supply chain where there are, as I commented, significant overlap in
similarities between the Renal business and the IV business – and again, not just on the solutions but on the disposable
sets and the instrumentation, whether that's an infusion pump or a HOMECHOICE cycler, tremendous synergies there.
And the strategic objective of this is really to enhance effectiveness. And I'll just give you one example, and then I'll
stop and not belabor the point.
But in terms of R&D productivity, to focus our R&D efforts and integrate where historically we've had fragmented
R&D supporting the Renal business versus the Med Del business, given the fact that the core technologies are
oftentimes very similar, I believe by bringing those together, there are significant opportunities to enhance our new
product development, frankly. And so clearly that has an effect over time on accelerating the revenue line. Now having
said that, I think there also are structural synergies, cost synergies that over time we'll figure out how to take cost out as
well. And so this is really dual objectives. How do we enhance our effectiveness? There are many ways I think we can
enhance our top line growth while taking structural cost out of the business. And I think Rob, for a lot of reasons, is the
perfect guy to oversee those.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Yes. PD's results, Bob, also looked pretty encouraging. We've talked to a bunch of nephrologists
that are thinking that home dialysis PD and home HD are going to benefit from the new reimbursement rules, but it's
going to be a more gradual increase. Are we seeing something, some moves ahead of the new reimbursement? Maybe
give us some sense. Are you more optimistic about driving PD penetration from whatever it is, 7 to 8%, to 10, 15%?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Yes, well, a couple of
comments. Yes, we are seeing encouraging signs that there already is movement. If you look at our PD patient growth
in the U.S. through the first three quarters of the year, it's the strongest that it has been in years. And I think the primary
driver for that is the market getting ready for reimbursement change. And I do think you're right, Rick. It will be
gradual over time, but it will be sustained and it will be meaningful. And so yes, we're starting to see already
encouraging metrics that would indicate that that's coming about.
It's interesting as you just read articles, even in the lay press and so on, this theme of dialysis in the home. Frankly,
whether that's PD, which clearly plays to a Baxter strength, or home hemodialysis, which is our number one R&D
program in the Renal business, are clearly aligned with that trend that's underway. I think it's becoming increasingly
recognized. There was an article just a couple weeks ago I think in the personal section of The Wall Street Journal that
did a good job of describing some of the dynamics here. Whether it's patient convenience, whether it's cost of
delivering the therapy, or at the end of the day enhancement of clinical outcomes, there's a lot more people and both
patients and clearly nephrologists that are thinking about providing these treatments in the home environment. So this
macro trend, if you will, clearly is playing into the strategies that we've defined in the Renal business.
But back to the last part of your question, too early to quantify this, but I think it will over time continue to accelerate
the growth of Renal, which is frankly the bet that we've been placing over the last few years. The Renal business, as
you know, has been relatively flat over the last few years. But we felt that there was long-term change that existed here
and we're at the early stages of it, so we're encouraged by those developments.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Last quick one, I know most of your cash is OUS. I'm hearing talk about a tax holiday possibility. If
that would happen, what would your redeployment priorities be in the U.S., and maybe just any update on your
thoughts about the portfolio and acquisitions to leverage some of these changes you're talking about? Thank you.
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: Yes, I'll take the tax
holiday. I think that's a fairly recent piece of news that's being discussed more actively. I think it's too early to really
know whether there's a good chance that's going to happen. You're right; the majority of our cash is offshore. And
certainly any opportunity to bring it back in a tax-efficient manner would be attractive to us. But I think it's way too
early to be thinking about that concretely. In terms of...
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Look, Rick, nothing new on
the BD M&A from an acquisition front other than our intent, which continues to be what I've described before. I spend

a lot more of my time on this. Clearly, we have the financial latitude to do some things. And I'm hopeful going forward
that we will, but they're not the things you can become aware of until we finalize them and communicate them. But the
strategic intent remains there and the financial flexibility to support that clearly is there as well.

Larry Keusch of Morgan Keegan is on the line with a question. Please state your question.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Okay, thank you. Perhaps for either Bob, as you think about gross margin on a go-forward
basis, can you just review with us what are the puts and takes that we should be thinking about as we think for the
fourth quarter and on a go-forward basis?
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: Do you want to do a
Frick and Frack here, or Bob and Bob?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Go ahead, why don't you take
it? I've got a few things. There are lots of elements to this one.
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: Yes, I think the
underlying dynamic of higher margin products growing faster over time I think very much is still intact. There are some
nearer term things in the fourth quarter that we are going to have to deal with. I mentioned the inefficiencies in
manufacturing and collection of plasma beginning to impact the margin here. That will play out into 2011 as well.
Foreign exchange does have an impact as well. At times when currencies on the dollar is stronger against foreign
currencies, we do hedge. And so that tends to have lower sales but margin stays the same, so the margin gets a benefit.
As the euro and other currencies have appreciated against the dollar here, that will be a little bit of a drag in the fourth
quarter as well. So it's not a significant move, but it is enough to shift things one quarter to the next.
So as we go forward, I think the plasma dynamic and FX are two things that could be headwinds here in the near term,
but certainly the underlying dynamic of mix driving margin benefit I think is still very much intact.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: I really can't add anything to
that. The mix component, clearly the margin differences of our core businesses remain fairly significant with the higher
margin BioScience business. So clearly stabilizing the growth, particularly focused on plasma proteins, is critical there.
So we'll see how the business mix and the business unit mix play out going forward.
The business units in our Medical Products business, nutritionals, anesthesia, and so on, as you know, Larry, continue
to be a promotional priority. So to the degree of business units and businesses that are higher margin can grow faster,
that continues to be the area of focus.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: And is it safe to assume that just given very nice margin expansion we've seen in
Medication Delivery that we probably shouldn't be thinking about those magnitudes on a go-forward basis either?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Probably not to the same
degree, no.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Okay, and then just separately as I think about the overall portfolio of the company, I guess
I just want to understand, Bob. How strategic do you think the vaccine business really is to Baxter over a longer time
period?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: I think it continues to be of
significant strategic interest to us, and we've talked about this before. Clearly there have been fits and starts with last
year's H1N1 situation and so on and so forth. But even in the third quarter, and I commented on this, our collaboration
with Takeda. I believe that we are going to figure out ways to monetize our Vero cell technology, but in ways that

aren't necessarily conventional in terms of producing and selling directly to on the market our own vaccines, and I think
the collaboration with Takeda is a good example of that. We continue to have dialogue with other countries who are
and continue to be focused on preparedness and with not so much an H1N1 but still the concern about H5N1 where our
technology has some particular advantages.
I think the registration or the licensure in the third quarter in Europe of PREFLUCEL, our influenza vaccine, is also
very encouraging, and we're going to move forward to get that product registered throughout the world, including the
U.S., and participate in that market as well. Then there are some other vaccines which we commented on in our last
investor conference that are in our pipeline and so on.
So yes, I continue to be very interested, Larry, in the vaccines business. And so I know looking at the sales, the revenue
results every quarter and so on, it's a mixed bag based upon what is particularly happening at that point in time. But
don't interpret that as any less interest in terms of the strategic value of this business.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Okay, terrific. Thanks very much.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Okay.

We have Matt Miksic on the line with a question from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Hi, this is Matt Miksic, thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to discuss some odds and ends
here and follow up on a couple things that you've talked about, Bob. One was on the combination Med Delivery and
Renal. I don't know if you've talked about what some of the front end/back end opportunities are. Can you quantify any
of those? Have you quantified them? It sounded from Bob Hombach's comments that you've maybe already started to
see in this quarter some of the benefits of that. Some color on that would be helpful, and then I just have a couple quick
follow-ups.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Yes, look, we haven't really
incurred any benefit from that change. It was just recent and in terms of the Med-Del/Renal integration into Medical
Products, if that was your question, Matt. And we haven't quantified specifically what the opportunity there is long
term. But as I commented, I think it was in response to Rick's question earlier, you don't make structural changes
organizationally lightly because it impacts a lot of things. And we would not have done it if we didn't think there was
not material opportunity that was represented by this organization change.
And as I said before, it's going to manifest itself in a couple different ways: I think enhanced R&D productivity;
improved commercial focus and prioritization. It will help accelerate the growth of our revenue line over time. But
there also are structural cost advantages that will be incurred where we have overlap and redundancies in a lot of the
back-end components of getting product to market in both the Renal and the Medication Delivery business, both in the
U.S. and on a global basis. So that benefit will cascade out over time. It will be evolutionary. But again maybe to close
where I started here, we wouldn't have done it if we didn't think the opportunity was reasonably material over time, but
I think it's premature to quantify that.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Okay, is that something that you think you'll be able to put some numbers to or some more detail
to maybe when you talk about 2011?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Probably not.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Okay, so just something that just buried in there will be some flexibility that we'll see the general
benefit from I guess is the way to look at that.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Yes, I think that's right

<Q - Matt Miksic>: Okay, and then one follow-up on – you talked about volumes, procedure volumes, hospital
admissions having an impact, the general thing that's impacting everyone else having an impact on Regen Med
[Regenerative Medicine]. I'm wondering how to reconcile what has been a gradually improving U.S. say IVIG market
with that dynamic just because I remember when the IVIG market was slowing, I think we were scratching our heads
thinking is it admissions, is it patients going to see the doc less; any way to reconcile that?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: I think that's a tough one. I just
think there are so many variables in the IVIG market that make it much more elusive to track down with underlying
procedures unlike say Medical Devices, like our biosurgery products.
Whether it's adjustment of inventory in the channel, whether it's change in the channel from hospital versus pharmacies,
whether it's reimbursement pressure for very expensive therapy where there are various reactions but then over time
settling out, an array of competitive dynamics with suppliers that a year or so ago may have been out of the market but
get back in, there are a laundry list of variables. And I just think it's really difficult to associate underlying surgical
procedure or hospital admission volumes with what's going on in IVIG. That is really analytically a tough one to
connect the dots.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Okay. And then finally on pumps, just I don't know if you had talked about what to expect here in
the rest of the year. I guess we're getting to a point soon where you're going to start replacing COLLEAGUEs with
SIGMAs potentially or are going through that process. This was a pretty strong quarter. Should we see some
moderation in the fourth quarter? I guess how should we think about the rest of the year in pumps?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Look, we've been replacing
COLLEAGUE with SIGMAs now for the better part of the last year since we did the deal I think with SIGMA. Clearly,
that has accelerated to some degree as a result of the consent order that was finalized a couple of months ago. It's very
early on. We've seen very little, if any, share shift frankly; in other words, hospitals opting to go to a competitor versus
waiting for their SIGMA pumps and so on. But I would emphasize that's still early. So as we go into fourth quarter,
Mary Kay, help me out here. Are there some dynamics last year? I don't want to miss them.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes, sequentially, we expect it to be just
as strong, Matt. But remember, year over year we started selling SIGMA in the fourth quarter of last year, so we do
have a difficult comp to the fourth quarter.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Okay, so sequentially tough – I mean year-over-year tough, but no wobble here we should see all
of a sudden in terms of this FDA process.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: That is correct.
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer>: Yes, customers are
just now giving an indication, an early indication. The actual activity is going to be in 2011 before we really see any
actual swap-outs or refunds and so on, which will be something we have to factor into our guidance on 2011.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: And then last on Renal, you talked to I think one of the earlier questions on the opportunity there
for PD. Do you have a number where pump – PD penetration is currently in the U.S., Bob? Or I don't know if Rob is
on, but any update as to where you think it is, and maybe a number as to the next couple years? Where do you think it
could go?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: I don't want to give you a
number. I think actually over time, there will be a new metric. It won't be PD penetration. It will be home therapy
penetration, and that's an orientation that aligned with our strategic intent, with the development of home HD, very
much aligned with the change in reimbursement practice. So I think the historic metric of PD penetration will become
increasingly passé.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Fair enough, thanks again for taking the questions.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President>: Okay, Matt.

Our final question is Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ben Andrew>: Two quick questions. Mary Kay or Bob, maybe can you help us understand what's going on with
your pace of collections in plasma? Have you dialed that back up, or are you still working on your raw materials
inventory?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: I would say in the third quarter,
collections were still down year over year, so at this point we've made no change to collections.
<Q - Ben Andrew>: Okay. And then just finally on the home hemo side, Bob, you were talking a fair bit about that on
this call. Do you think that the first study coming out of the IDE is going to be an in-center study or an in-home first?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: It will be an in-center.
<Q - Ben Andrew>: In-center; and so how long do you think that will take to run and when can you start on the
in-home trial?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: That's what we're finalizing, Ben, with the
FDA. We just submitted to them the finalized IDE. And once that's accepted, we can provide with you the details on
that clinical trial design.
<Q - Ben Andrew>: Okay, so it will be at least a 510(k) Class IIb filing, but there's some uncertainty whether it will
turn into a PMA over time. Is that right?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: I don't believe that we believe that there's
any uncertainty at this point. We believe it's a 510(k) based on our discussions with the FDA.
<Q - Ben Andrew>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: Okay.
