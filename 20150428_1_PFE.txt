Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during the call will include forward-looking statements and
that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could
cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms
10-Q and 8-K.
Discussions on the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today.
We'll now make some prepared remarks and then we'll move to the question-and-answer session.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?
Ian C. Read
Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights
from the quarter, provide some thoughts about the pipeline, and close with a few comments about actions we've taken
to strengthen our core businesses.
Starting with the quarter, our performance in the quarter was solid, with good performance on both top and bottom line.
Overall revenues grew by 2% operationally, even with the negative impact from the loss of exclusivity [LOE] of
CELEBREX in the U.S. and the end of the SPIRIVA co-promotion agreement, also in the U.S. In addition, we saw
12% operational growth in emerging markets, driven by both our GEP [Global Established Pharma] and Innovative
businesses.
While the majority of the LOEs and co-promote expiries are behind us, we still face some LOEs this year and next,
making it difficult to generate revenue growth despite the strong performance of our newest products. That said, we
believe the impact from any remaining LOEs will diminish over time, as we continue to see a building revenue base
resulting from the investments we have made in key growth areas and recent product launches. I'll touch upon some
noteworthy areas.
PREVNAR 13 had a very strong quarter, particularly in the U.S. where revenues increased 80%. This was primarily
due to strong uptake amongst adults 65 years of age and older. Following the positive recommendation from the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP], as well as the
timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication compared to the year-ago quarter. Revenues for the adult
indication were approximately $300 million in the quarter.
Physicians' response to PREVNAR 13 continues to build steadily, and our strong Q1 sales suggest these physicians are
actively vaccinating adults who have never been vaccinated as well as those who were previously vaccinated with
PNEUMOVAX from Merck.
Each year, several million people in the U.S. turn 65 who are eligible to receive PREVNAR 13. And of those adults in
the U.S. who are already 65, there are many millions eligible that have never been vaccinated or were previously
vaccinated. We are increasing awareness amongst adults about the seriousness of pneumococcal pneumonia and the
importance of talking to their physicians or pharmacists about vaccination to protect them from its devastating effects.
We believe our efforts are increasing the sense of urgency to vaccinate and driving consumers to request the
PREVNAR vaccine. In December, CMS changed their guidance to cover both the pneumococcal vaccines, which
ensures coverage for seniors 65 years and older under Medicaid Part D, aligning with the positive ACIP
recommendations from August 2014.

ELIQUIS is gaining significant momentum worldwide as it continues to increase share amongst cardiologists, and
recently has become the number one oral anticoagulant – that's NOAC – prescribed by cardiologists for new-to-brand
patients in the United States and Japan. In addition, ELIQUIS is now the number one NOAC prescribed by
cardiologists for new-to-brand patients for the non-valvular atrial fibrillation indication in the UK and Spain, and we
are continuing to see increasing uptake in Germany.
We are pleased with the continued progress XELJANZ has made towards becoming a key product based on approvals
in 40 countries in rheumatoid arthritis, launches and the revenue growth of the RA indication, and the initiation of
filing for the potential second indication in plaque psoriasis. In the U.S., rheumatologist satisfaction with the product
continues to be positive. XELJANZ now ranks number three amongst rheumatologists in new-to-brand prescription
share of self-administrated rheumatoid arthritis therapies and is on track to become the third new-to-brand therapy
overall in the U.S.
We have put significant focus and resources behind building our oncology business. The portfolio was strengthened
with some recent advancements. In February we received accelerated approval from the FDA for IBRANCE, and have
quickly launched in the U.S. While it is still very early, I'm extremely pleased with its performance. Physicians have
been embracing the product. The number of new patient starts have been increasing since the FDA approval, and we
are seeing early success with reimbursement to date. The IBRANCE team has done a remarkable job in ensuring we
were able to get the product to patients as quickly as possible following approval.
We also announced this month that a Phase 3 IBRANCE trial for recurrent breast cancer had met its primary endpoint
for progression-free survival. We will be presenting detailed efficacy and safety results from PALOMA-3 at the
upcoming ASCO [American Society of Clinical Oncology]. In addition, we have several presentations at ASCO,
including oral data presentations for our immuno-oncology assets 4-1BB and avelumab, the PD-L1 being co-developed
through our alliance with Merck KGaA.
Also last week, we announced another encouraging development in our oncology pipeline. A Phase 3 trial for
inotuzumab met the primary endpoint of demonstrating a higher complete hematological remission rate in adults with
relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared to that achieved with standard-of-care
chemotherapy. We are discussing these data with the FDA and other regulatory agencies. The trial will continue to
evaluate overall survival, which is a separate primary endpoint. The data will be submitted for presentation at
upcoming medical meetings.
I believe our recent accomplishments and news flow in research and development demonstrate that we are in one of the
most productive times of our pipeline. We have strong presence in the areas where the science is quickly moving,
where there is market potential, where we believe we have clinical differentiation, and most importantly, where the
patients' needs are the greatest.
Today we published a comprehensive update of the pipeline. You will see that we have a rich modality mix across
small and large molecules and vaccines, novel mechanisms, and potential new indications. This includes the
development of bococizumab, the ongoing development of XELJANZ, our CDK4/6 platform with IBRANCE, a
comprehensive immuno-oncology program with our partner Merck KGaA for the first wave of potential single-agent
monotherapy treatment regimes for several tumor types, and assets to position us for the next wave of potential IL
combination therapies, including: 4-1BB, OX40, and ADCs; vaccines for staph aureus and C. difficile; our
next-generation ALK ROS-1 inhibitor; a world-leading kinase capability with unique JAK drugs in development; a
strong rare disease portfolio in the areas of hematology, neuroscience, inherited metabolic disorders, and pulmonology;
our novel neuroscience work in Parkinson's. And our development portfolio of monoclonal biosimilars continues to
progress well, with four products now in Phase 3 development.
In total, we have 88 programs in clinical development, with 30 programs in late-stage development for registration as
of today. Over the last several years, we have rebuilt the pipeline and transformed our approach to R&D, and we
believe we are well positioned to bring forth over the next several years therapies that will significantly improve
people's lives.

Now, for a few comments about how we continue to take steps to expand our sources of revenue and strengthen our
core businesses. As always, we continue to look for business development opportunities that will create value, with a
bias towards deals with the potential for creating value in the near term. M&A activity in the pharma space has been
very active recently and Pfizer regularly reviews potential opportunities but remains disciplined with our shareholders'
capital to ensure transactions we may pursue generate an appropriate return for our shareholders. That is why this
quarter you saw us announce two transactions, one to drive greater sustainability of the GEP business over the long
term and one to expand the vaccines portfolio.
Hospira is an excellent strategic fit in an attractive and growing market segment, including sterile injectables and
biosimilars, and we expect the acquisition to accelerate the growth trajectory of the GEP business. We remain on track
for a closing in the second half of this year. And our deal for Redvax expands our vaccine development portfolio by
giving us access to a promising vaccine in preclinical development for human cytomegalovirus, a virus that can lead to
serious disabilities in infants when passed from newly infected mothers to their newborns.
We now have a broader marketed vaccine portfolio for preventing serious illnesses, which includes: the most widely
used pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the world, PREVNAR 13, with more than 750 million doses distributed;
TRUMENBA, recently approved to prevent invasive disease caused by Group B meningitis in people aged 10 through
25; and vaccines to protect against disease caused by Group C meningitis and to help prevent tick-borne encephalitis
through acquiring Baxter International's marketed vaccines.
As you've heard us say on several occasions, business development is not a strategy. It is one lever of several we have
available for strengthening our two basic businesses, the Innovative Product business and the Established Products
business.
This year is off to a good start, with momentum in the pipeline growing, market penetration for our newest inline
products, and strategic additions to the portfolio. Our focus for the year will continue to be on supporting our recent
new product launches, in particular: IBRANCE and PREVNAR 13 in adult; accelerating and differentiating key
programs in the pipeline to deliver breakthrough products; continuing to look for attractive business development
opportunities that strengthen our businesses; and doing all these things while we deploy our capital in a way that yields
the greatest value to shareholders.
I will now turn it over to Frank.
Frank A. D'Amelio
Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast.
First quarter 2015 reported revenues were approximately $10.9 billion and reflect operational growth of $250 million
or 2% year over year, mainly driven by the strong performance of PREVNAR 13 and ELIQUIS in developed markets,
and LYRICA, NEXIUM 24-Hour, XELJANZ, and VIAGRA, primarily in the U.S.; the launch of IBRANCE in the
U.S. in February of this year; and 12% operational growth in emerging markets, which were more than offset by: the
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of approximately $739 million or 7%; the loss of exclusivity and immediate
multi-sourced generic competition for CELEBREX in the U.S. in December 2014; other product losses of exclusivity;
and the termination of the SPIRIVA co-promotion collaboration in certain countries.
Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.51 versus $0.57 in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a $0.04
negative impact due to foreign exchange and a $0.03 negative impact due to the $295 million upfront payment to
OPKO during first quarter 2015. Adjusted diluted EPS was favorably impacted by a lower effective tax rate and fewer
diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 148 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to
ongoing share repurchases, which includes the partial quarter impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase
agreement, effective February 2015. Reported diluted EPS was $0.38 compared with $0.36 in the year-ago quarter, due
to the previously mentioned factors and the favorable impact of lower legal charges, which were partially offset by a
higher effective tax rate.

Foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter reported revenues by $739 million, or $0.0,7 and positively
impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $462 million
or 7%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.04
compared with the year-ago quarter.
Now moving on to the financial highlights of our business segments, in the first quarter Global Innovative
Pharmaceutical revenues increased 7% operationally year-over-year due to the strong operational growth from
LYRICA, primarily in the U.S. and Japan, and the performance from recently launched products, including ELIQUIS
globally and XELJANZ primarily in the U.S.
Although operationally, revenues increased 7% and cost of sales decreased 1%, income before taxes declined 9%
operationally, mainly because of a 59% operational increase in R&D expenses, primarily due to the previously
mentioned upfront payment to OPKO Health; and to a lesser extent, an 11% operational increase in SI&A expenses due
to increased investment in new products and certain inline brands.
First quarter VOC [Global Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare] revenues increased 29% operationally due
to the 51% operational revenue growth from our Global Vaccines business as a result of PREVNAR 13, which grew
80% in the U.S. and 15% internationally, and the inclusion of Baxter's marketed vaccines in Europe; NEXIUM
24-Hour in the U.S.; the launch of IBRANCE in the U.S. in February; and XALKORI and INLYTA globally.
Income before taxes increased 41% operationally, mainly due to increased revenues with an associated improvement in
gross margin, partially offset by a 19% operational increase in SI&A expenses due to investment in PREVNAR 13
adult indication, NEXIUM 24-Hour, and the TRUMENBA and IBRANCE launches; and the 7% operational increase
in R&D expenses due to increased investment in the IBRANCE development program and the global
immuno-oncology alliance with Merck KGaA and other oncology products.
In the first quarter, Global Established Pharmaceutical revenues decreased 10% operationally, mainly due to the loss of
exclusivity and immediate multi-sourced generic competition for CELEBREX in the U.S. in December of 2014, and to
a lesser extent from the loss of exclusivity of LYRICA in certain developed markets in Europe during the first quarter
of 2015 and ZYVOX I.V. in the U.S. in January 2015; continued generic competition for LIPITOR in developed
markets; and the termination of this SPIRIVA co-promotion agreement in most countries, including the U.S., in April
of 2014. All of these were partially offset by strong operational growth of 10% in emerging markets, driven by
LIPITOR, VIAGRA, and NORVASC.
Income before taxes declined 14% operationally due to the decrease in revenues and a 1% operational increase or a 2.1
percentage point increase as a percentage of revenues in cost of sales due to an unfavorable change in product mix; flat
R&D expenses, primarily due to increased spending in our biosimilars development programs, offset by lower clinical
trial expenses, all of which were partially offset by a 9% operational decrease in SI&A expenses, driven by cost
reduction and productivity initiatives.
Now I'd like to walk you through the updated full-year 2015 guidance ranges for reported revenues, reported diluted
EPS, and adjusted diluted EPS relative to our 2014 actual results. I want to point out that there are no unfavorable
changes to our operational outlook. We are only updating the 2015 guidance ranges for these elements solely due to the
negative impact of recent changes in foreign exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar from mid-January to
mid-April, primarily driven by the weakening of the euro. This updated guidance assumes an FX rate for the euro of
approximately $1.06.
As a result, we are lowering our reported revenue range by $500 million, and now expect the range to be $44 billion to
$46 billion. It's important to note that the actual negative impact of foreign exchange in our full-year 2015 revenues is
actually greater than $500 million. However, the operational strength of our revenues is allowing us to absorb this.
In addition, we are lowering our reported and adjusted diluted EPS ranges by $0.05, and now expect reported diluted
EPS to be in the range of $1.32 to $1 47 and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.05.

Before moving on, I want to point out that actual rates in mid-April 2015 do not include the impact of a potential
devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. We are reaffirming the remaining elements of our 2015 financial guidance,
which we issued on January 27, 2015.
Moving on to key takeaways, we recorded solid financial performance in the first quarter. While we have no
unfavorable changes in our operational outlook for the remainder of 2015, we have updated our financial guidance
solely to reflect the negative impact of recent changes in foreign exchange rates. We entered into an agreement to
acquire Hospira for a total enterprise value of approximately $17 billion. Subject to the appropriate regulatory
approvals, we continue to expect to complete the transaction in the second half of 2015.
We achieved several key R&D milestones so far in 2015, including receiving accelerated approval from the FDA for
IBRANCE with letrozole for first-line advanced breast cancer. Our Phase 3 PALOMA-3 study for IBRANCE with
fulvestrant met its primary efficacy endpoint; the FDA lifting the partial clinical hold on our tanezumab development
program, and we're preparing to resume Phase 3 activities with our partner Eli Lilly; and the EC approving an
expanded indication for the use of PREVNAR 13 in adults aged 18 years and older.
We continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. In the first quarter of 2015 we returned $7.8
billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. It's important to note that after repurchasing $6 billion
of our common stock in the first quarter of 2015, including our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase, we have already
met our 2015 share repurchase target and do not currently expect to repurchase additional shares this year. We continue
to expect to return approximately $13 billion to shareholders in 2015 through a combination of dividends and share
repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2015 and beyond.
Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.
Charles E. Triano
Thank you, Ian and Frank. Operator, can we please poll for questions now?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys, thank you very much for taking my question. I appreciate it. I will use my
question, please, to ask about use of capital, if I may. I know it's something you discussed a lot but I think we're always
interested in even subtle changes in how you answer these questions. But, Ian, I was just wondering. When you think
about use of capital, are you at this point – I think in the past you've remarked that if the numbers make sense you
would be open to a large deal similar to the AstraZeneca proposal last year. I just wanted to take your temperature on
that.
And then also, would you in theory be interested in buying a company that – in adding small molecule and DA
capabilities to the Established Products business, or do you feel that the acquisition of Hospira filled the gaps, the main
gaps that that business may have had?
And then finally, as you look across the landscape in biotech, do you have general thoughts on biotech valuations and
opportunities there? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay, one question became three. So I think the organization is agnostic to the size of BD. It has
to be BD that will move the needle, and I'm not concerned about doing a large transaction if the value was there for
shareholders. Vis-à-vis between adding to Innovative or adding to GEP or adding to Consumer, we're driven by value.
Does it create value for shareholders? We have the capacity to add businesses in any one of those areas. The last part of

the question was I think...
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Valuation.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Valuation.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Valuation, I think I said last quarter I thought that the valuation of biotech was a little buoyant. I
still believe it remains there. So it means we are very careful as we evaluate deals. There's probably no deal that
actually occurs that we haven't looked at and evaluated. But we have a strong focus on creating shareholder value, and
that's what guides us. Thank you for the question.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Ian; next question please, operator?
Operator
Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you very much. Ian, in your prepared remarks you failed to mention tax inversions. I'm just
curious to know how much of a priority a tax inversion still is or unlocking the value of your overseas cash flows. And
if you were to abide by the current IRS laws today, doesn't that mean that there are fewer large targets available to you
than before? Can you confirm that and really just your appetite?
And then secondly, you said before that the earliest that you can break up the company is in 2017. I'm assuming that's
January 1, 2017 because we will at that point have three full years of financials. And if that's correct, are you targeting
a decision sometime next year? I would think that once you make the decision, it's going to take about a year or so
before you actually execute on the split or maybe it won't take quite that long. But are you targeting a decision next
year? And if so, what at this point are you waiting for to make that decision? Thanks very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Jami. Taking the last question first, I believe what we've said is that we would be in a
position to, if we so took the decision, to effectuate or start the split in 2017, which probably means we'd have to take a
decision in the latter part of 2016. We do need three years of financials. We will get those three years of financials by
the end of 2016.
And what are we waiting for? As we said before, Jami, I want to see how these two divisions operating inside Pfizer,
are they on their own sustainable businesses. So I'm waiting to see our pipeline develop. I'm waiting to add, as we have
done with SPIRIVA, more attractive assets into Established Products. And then I'm also looking to see how does the
Street value Pfizer as it is today, and we've given you a lot of information on our segments. So is the sum of the parts
different from the whole? And we will make that decision around the latter part of 2016. So I think that answers that
question. We are, as always, focused in our decision-making on creating shareholder value, and I think those three
elements I laid out to you would describe how we would judge whether any such action would create shareholder
value.
On the issue of lowering our tax rate or redomiciling, tax is one of our largest expenses. We, as any management
should be, are focused on trying to prudently manage our expenses. The new rules – or not the new rules, the new
proposed rule change does make it more difficult to immediately realize any benefits from being redomiciled. But it
really depends upon the target, very complex issues of where the assets and where the cash and the tax position of the
target. And so really it's very, very difficult to say what the universe of possible targets are. But rest assured that when
we look at those type of BD deals, we are looking at the creation of value. Thank you.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Ian. Can we move, please, to the next question, operator?

<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes, thanks very much. So with respect to the potential separation of the businesses, I'm
guessing that you're not willing to disclose the relative cash flow of the two segments. But my assumption is that the
cash flow of the Innovative business is an even smaller percentage of the total company cash flow than the earnings
that you disclose from the Innovative business would suggest. So anyway, Frank, I was just hoping that you could
speak to that and help us understand whether that's accurate, and whether the lack of cash flow in the Innovative
business is something that could potentially constrain your ability to separate or monetize that business.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So a couple of comments, Dave. Let me just start by saying and reminding everyone this
quarter, when we file our 10-Q, we'll be including balance sheet information for the segments, but we won't have debt
or cash, for example, by segment. We'll have on the asset side accounts receivable, inventory, tax assets, and other
assets. And then on the liability side, we'll have accounts payable, accrued compensation, and other liabilities. So we'll
start providing balance sheet information, but we won't be providing debt or cash by the various segments since those
are really enterprise assets and enterprise liabilities at this point.
What I would say is this; that I don't see capital structure. So I'm going to raise it up a little bit. You asked about cash
but I'll answer the question by saying I don't see capital structure as somehow impeding our decision-making relative to
whether or not to execute a split of the company. We believe – I believe we can clearly manage our way through capital
structure so that that's not in any way, shape, or form some sort of impeding factor relative to our decision-making.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thank you, Frank; next question, please, operator?

Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Thomas Schott>: Great, thanks for the question, just two here. First on IBRANCE, can you just
discuss a little bit more about the launch and commercial plans from here for the asset? And as part of that, can you just
give us as little bit of color on the importance of PALOMA-3 to the market opportunity and the ramp of the product?
I'm trying to think of the opportunity that this opens up for Pfizer.
My second question was coming back to GP. Do you have the capacity to pursue another large deal here, or are you
primarily focused on the Hospira integration at this point, not so much financial capacity but just do you have the
personnel in place? If another big deal were available, could you pursue it? Thanks very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: So let me just talk about the deal. We've done several large integrations. We're working well with
Hospira. We expect it to close in the second half of this year. Should the value be there, this organization has the
capability of undertaking other deals, independent of size, if it was important for our shareholders, so I'm not concerned
about that. I would pass it over to Albert to talk about IBRANCE.
<A - Albert Bourla>: Chris, thanks for the question. Overall, we are very pleased with the results, and so far
IBRANCE has been well received by oncologists. We have over 800 healthcare practitioners prescribing it. We have
over 2,000 new patients in one quarter. And we had approximately 3,000 total scripts written so far. First-line market
share is already approaching 10%. That's way ahead of previous analogs. And also we see stronger investment so far.
Now, the expectation is that IBRANCE will gradually grow to become a new standard of care in first-line treatment of
this group of patients. But over time, IBRANCE momentum in this country will build beyond first-line as other studies
read out positive. For example, you mentioned the results of PALOMA-3, which will be presented at ASCO, but we
plan to work with the FDA to expand the label to other lines of therapy based on these results. And also as a reminder,
there are several other breast cancer studies running in early and recurrent settings. And needless to say, that also we
have many non-breast tumor studies, including head and neck, lung, melanoma, et cetera, et cetera.
Now, for your particular importance of PALOMA-3, as I said, so far there is limited medical use in second and
third-line, given that the label is in first-line. So as I said, we will work with FDA to expand the label to other lines of
therapy. But beyond label amendments, I think we should see PALOMA-3 in the way that adds to the level of

Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein.
<Q - Timothy Minton Anderson>: Thank you, a couple of questions. ENBREL was down 8% operationally in
Europe. I'm wondering how much of this reflects the impact of biosimilar REMICADE. And if you can talk about
expectations for that product going forward in Europe, both in terms of volume growth and pricing.
And then going back to this topic of splitting up, looking to see if you could give us odds of the possibility that Pfizer
chooses not to split up. You consistently leave that open as a possibility for the last several years that we've talked
about this topic. And as I'm sure you're aware, most investors want you to do something beyond just buying more
targets and getting bigger. So it would be helpful to know if the odds of that [ph] HURP (34:30) not being delivered on
are – is it less than 10%, less than 20%, less than 50%, or what exactly?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay, so let me try to and deal with the split before we ask Geno to deal with ENBREL. What I
would say, Tim, is that I think this management team has established a reputation of focusing its actions on shareholder
value, so I really don't think it's useful to give odds. What I think is useful is to say, we will do what's best for
shareholders in creating value for them. And some of our transactions, when we were looking at previous ones last
year, at times we talked about getting bigger to get smaller because by getting bigger we could add and strengthen the
independent businesses and then get smaller if it made sense. So frankly, we are focused on creating value for
shareholders. And if a split or getting bigger and then splitting makes sense, we will execute that, because the prime
driver of this management team is to create shareholder value.
With that, I'll pass it over to Geno to talk about ENBREL in Europe.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Okay. So, Tim, the situation in Europe with ENBREL was that we implemented a new
distribution model in the UK. We started that at the end of last year, where we moved away from the retail channel into
just the hospital channel and direct-to-patients. So what we saw in the first quarter of this year, was some inventory
work-down in the first quarter and that affected our sales in the UK. We had good strong sales in Italy and France and
Spain, so we really didn't see anything more widespread than the distribution change.
In terms of effect of biosimilar REMICADE on the ENBREL business, we really haven't seen an impact there either.
So, we're expecting to see continued modest growth. It's a very large base of business. It's a very well accepted product
throughout Europe and the rest of the world, and we anticipate continuation of modest growth for the brand outside of
the U.S.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Geno. Next question, please.

<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thank you. First, Frank, just mechanistically, how would a very large transaction, if you did
one, affect the timing of a potential split? Clearly, the Hospira deal did not affect your timeline, but I imagine certain
deals could.
And secondly for John, it's good to see another strong quarter from Hospira. Is it fair to say that the addition of Hospira,
in your mind, takes GEP from flat to declining in sales in the out years to pretty squarely into growth territory? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. Please, Frank?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So, just to reiterate what I said before and then I'll answer the question specifically, we're
doing all the things we need to do, in particular the three years of prospective audited financials, so that we'd be in a
position to exercise our option in 2017 if we chose to do so. And as I've said before, the Hospira acquisition does not
impact that timeline.
But then, Gregg, specific to your question, if we were to do a large transaction, and as Ian said before, we're agnostic to
size. It's really all about do we believe we could create shareholder value for our shareholders, it could. It clearly could
impact our timeline. If we were to do a transaction and if it were to impact our timeline, please know we would
proactively tell you all that as soon as we knew.
<A - John Young>: So, Gregg, it's John here. Thanks for the question. So, first of all just to reiterate, as you know, we
obviously don't provide guidance by individual business. But obviously, we're very pleased to see the continued
positive strong momentum for the Hospira business. This quarter, the GEP business has been subject to some LOEs,
which I think Ian mentioned in his script. And as we flagged, we know that in the short term that will therefore impact
the revenue trajectory of the base GEP business over the next year or two.
But overall, the transaction certainly represents an immediate incremental source of revenue growth, with products that
can be expanded into traditional markets given Pfizer's global reach. And I think the excitement that I think we've seen
in the financial community that certainly we share really is around the transaction bringing together two excellent
businesses that will deliver not only near-term profitable revenue growth but also provide a platform for future growth
that can be enhanced through Pfizer's global reach and infrastructure. So we remain very positive about the
combination of the two businesses.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, John; next question, please?
Operator
Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the results. The first one just has to do with the
Hospira transaction. Can you give any clarity on when you might anticipate HSR clearance? Most notably, one thing
we noticed was that on medium and broad-spectrum antibiotics and beta-lactams that there's some overlap and then
certainly there would be overlap in the biosimilars. So any commentary on product divestitures would be helpful.
And then second question on your oncology business, if you look at XALKORI, you have the number one and number
two competitors in oncology launching ALK-positive compounds globally. In light of I-O data that potentially is
becoming available, can you maybe discuss the OS benefit and why it has potential to being able to compete with I-O?
And then on IBRANCE, just potentially competitive threats since competitors are indicating that they could have data
in 2016 to IBRANCE, just your thoughts on your competitive positioning of that franchise going forward here.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. John, thank you, some very optimistic questions there. Why don't we deal first of all with
Hospira? Doug, can you do that?
<A - Douglas M. Lankler>: Sure. So we're looking at all the aspects relative beyond obviously biosimilars as well.
We're working closely with regulators, and we're very pleased with the progress that we're making. We continue to

expect to close the transaction during the second half of 2015.
<A - Ian C. Read>: And on the oncology issues, would you like to comment upon what we expect the competition
launching, and then our second-generation or third-generation ALK ROS? And then perhaps Mikael may want to
comment on some of the competitive dynamics.
<A - Albert Bourla>: Absolutely and thanks, John, for the question. In IBRANCE, I spoke a little bit before. And right
now we are really the only company that has randomized data on this so we can make any comparisons. We have the
most advanced and the most broad program in CDK4/6. I say more advanced because we are the only ones that have
registration to start with, and we have already announced positive results of a second study in a different population.
And of course, we are having already initiated, right now we have in this year running already four Phase 3 studies on
breast cancer, and we are running beyond breast cancer over 30 studies in multiple tumor indications. So I have a lot of
respect for competitors, but I think in that one really we are way ahead.
<A - Ian C. Read>: I think one competitor just announced that they may be finishing their Phase 3 in 2017. Is that
right?
<A - Albert Bourla>: In 2016
<A - Ian C. Read>: In 2016.
<A - Albert Bourla>: In the second half of 2016, yes. We expect – we have already registration, and for the same type
we expect the confirmatory study to come to completion the last quarter of this year. And as Ian said before also, we
have discussed this with EU authorities, and we plan to file for IBRANCE in the second half of this year as well.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Mikael, any comments?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes, I wanted to just briefly comment on your discussion about our ALK franchise. I think we
should look up on it as an ALK franchise where XALKORI is the most experienced drug with a very much recognized
stable profile. We shared at recent conferences, including a presentation at AACR [American Association for Cancer
Research], our third-generation ALK inhibitor, with a 3922 number name. And it's a really unique compound that hits
all known ALK mutations, including the G1202R. And to the best of my knowledge, it's still the only compound so far
that had shown strong effect across all mutations, independent whether the patient has experienced several of the
currently available ALK inhibitors. Moreover, several responses also against brain metastases have been reported for
this drug. So I think the combined ALK franchise from Pfizer will over time be very strong.
INLYTA can nicely also be combined with immuno-oncology products as per our strategy, so we shouldn't see
INLYTA as alone facing other entrants. But we and Merck [ph] soon (44:03) are exploring immuno-oncology,
avelumab, INLYTA and other agents, so I think you will see us building a strong position in renal cell carcinoma.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. And, John, I sort of see the competition coming in and extending the survival time of
patients with the ALK mutation as very positive for our third generation when it comes to market, as you'll have of all
the patients that have gone through our first-line XALKORI, been treated second-line on products of competitors, and
creating a more substantial patient base for our third-generation ALK. So thanks for the questions.

questions?
On LIPITOR, a quick question on the real-world study there. I know it's completed. It's been completed for some time;
any update on when we might see the data there?
And then just on the last one on the expense side, if I read the release correctly, you still have quite a bit of expenses
allocated to other bucket as opposed to being allocated to one of the three specific business units. In other words, there
are five corners in the company operating as three separate units. How should we think about that in terms of your
ability to actually split into two entities if you want to without having a significant amount of dyssynergy just given that
there would still be a lot of overlap in how the expenses are being spent?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Geno, tanezumab?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: I think for tanezumab, look, we see this as a real innovation, one of the first real
breakthroughs in pain management in many, many years and significant unmet need, overuse of opioids being a big
problem and a substantial number of patients with the conditions that we're pursuing, osteoarthritis, chronic low back
pain, and cancer pain. So we see that this drug has significant potential. We know a lot about this medicine. We've
completed quite a number of studies. And we're anxious to see it advance through this next phase of development and
then to the market.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. Albert, real-world, real-life study LIPITOR?
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes, thank you. The actual use trial was completed in December, so the results are expected this
quarter. The results of the study will inform next steps and timelines for potential NDA filing. And we will continue to
update you as we have more news on that.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. And, Frank, on expenses?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Yes, so the major items in that other bucket are WRD, so Mikael's organization, and I'll
call it corporate. Think about corporate as what we call the enabling function, so it's IT, finance, legal, HR, facilities,
public relations. All those functions basically are what are in our corporate bucket there. Last year in the 10-Q, we gave
you all percentages on how to allocate those various items to the segments. The key there is in terms of the basis of
what's underpinning those percentages we give you, there are really three buckets of allocations. There's I'll call it
specific assignments, regional allocations, and general allocations. The specific assignments are about 40%. The
regional allocations are about 20%. The general allocations are about 40%. So we provide all that detail so that you can
basically drive it to segment. And what that tells you is much of it, the specific assignments and the regional allocation,
it's very specific to an individual segment.

Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Thanks very much, so just a few quick questions, a couple on the pipeline and then one

4-1BB and what combinations we may see. Interestingly, we'd love to hear your thoughts on AstraZeneca's deal with
Celgene and their comments on the challenges of getting into heme tumors.
The second question, just given the broad success of OPDIVO in second-line lung cancer, when and how do you see
your recently announced study recruiting in the U.S. or perhaps in Europe over the next 12 months as approvals are
likely received?
And then lastly for Ian, when you say that you're agnostic to the creation of shareholder value, I think everybody has
asked the question of the possibility that you go out and buy more assets. However, I do think that there certainly is the

possibility of lowering your tax rate with the willingness to perhaps merge with an overseas entity, with that entity
being the controlling entity. How agnostic are you truly to that kind of an outcome? Thanks so much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: So why don't I asked Mikael to comment on the 4-1BB? I don't really think it's appropriate for us
to comment on AZ's strategy and how they go about financing their pipeline. And then on the lung cancer, perhaps
Mikael or Albert can deal with that. Then I'll come back to you on how agnostic I feel.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes, thank you. As you know, we believe that the field of I-O combinations is going to
increasingly be prominent, and we have invested in a broad number of I-O combinations. We'll have up to five I-O
drugs in the clinic this year and expect every year probably two new entering.
Specifically for 4-1BB, we will share additional data at ASCO. We have growing experience with 4-1BB in lymphoma
on rituximab background that suggests stable activity and good tolerability profile, and I think suggests that this class
of combining checkpoint activators with checkpoint inhibitors may be the route to go, as we have learned combining
multiple checkpoint inhibitors, CTLA-4 and PD-1, may lead to a decreasing therapeutic window, while for 4-1BB, we
are very encouraged that the therapeutic window will be large, and the drug is an interesting part of this new I-O
combination.
I also wanted to make a pitch that we actually are now entering the clinic with our OX40 antibody. That also will be
planned to explore as monotherapy and later in combination with avelumab.
Briefly, just on second-line lung cancer, as we now start avelumab into several solid tumor indications, we expect over
the years of 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 to see multiple pivotal trials with that and opportunities for drug registrations
for several of the solid tumors, including lung cancer.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Mikael. Now, Seamus, I think you mentioned, I think you perhaps misquoted me
there. I'm not agnostic on value. I'm agnostic on size, and I'm totally focused on value. And I think you're alluding your
questions about whether you're 80:20 or 60:40 to maximize your benefits. And once again, I am open to any set of
combinations that, when we look at it, produces clear value for our shareholders. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. I have a couple. First for Frank, isn't the full-year share count guidance 6.2 billion
shares versus Q1's nearly 6.3 billion? That difference is $3.2 billion in share repurchase. And related to that, I'm
surprised the share count was not much lower in Q1 versus Q4, given the 150 million share repurchase. I guess the
answer might be that you weren't expecting the stock to be so strong, but maybe you can clarify.
And then secondly, how much of the $300 million in PREVNAR sales in adults in Q1 would you consider catch-up
versus the cohort of people that just turned 65 and are receptive to vaccination? Thank you.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So on the share repurchase, Steve, our projection for the end of the year is a little bit higher
than the number you quoted, and we obviously factored that into our guidance. And then in terms of the shares from Q4
to Q1, remember on that accelerated share repurchase we got a partial quarter benefit for that in the number, right,
because we didn't put that in place until February, so think about it as a mid-quarter impact. But if you go to the full
year, we're a little bit higher than the 6.2 billion shares. And what's really been driving that, and it's a good issue, is
stock price is higher than we thought it was going to be from a share repurchase assumption perspective. Only in terms
of what we assumed in our planning, it's higher than what we had planned for, but net-net it's all factored into our
guidance.

<A - Albert Bourla>: Thank you again. Thanks, Steve, for the question. I don't have specific data yet as to how much
is catch-up or not, but it's an indication of – the $300 million is an indication of the significant potential of this market.
Let me run some numbers for you. Every year, 4 million adults in the U.S. alone are turning 65. There are 27 million
adults that have been previously vaccinated with PPV23. And an additional 20 million adults have never been
vaccinated. That's a pool of 47 million adults in U.S. Both of these cohorts are now recommended and reimbursed to
receive PREVNAR 13.
And the same comes with Europe. In Europe, we have already received in the label the prevention of pneumonia for
adults 18 and older. We are working country by country to ensure recommendations and after that reimbursement,
which will take some time but typically it's happening.
And in general, we are very pleased with the first quarter results. They were driven, of course, by the broad
recommendation. We had a severe flu season; that also played a role. And also our commercial efforts were very
successful. Going forward, in the spring months, we expect revenues to moderate given the seasonality of the business,
but we expect strong revenue growth will resume in the fall. And overall, we expect very strong growth for the year.

Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.
<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: Good morning, a question on your immuno-oncology portfolio. Do you have any evidence to
date to conclude that the ADC-enabled properties of your PD-L1 are positively [ph] clinically (56:22) differentiated
versus the other non-refractor enabled PD-L1s that are in the clinic or approved?
Second, is it still the case that you haven't shown any solid tumor responses with your anti-CD-137, or has that
changed?
And then lastly, perhaps you could comment on the strategic outlook for your Consumer Health business, given it's
clearly a very active market out there with numerous potential buyers who I'm sure would be interested in your assets.
Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Andrew. Mikael, could you take us through the immuno-oncology questions?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes, I think you asked briefly about ADCs and then mainly around differentiation for our
immuno-oncology assets. Maybe I'll say a few words on ADCs. We have built up seven ADCs in the clinic. You heard
recently about our Calicheamicin ADC, inotuzumab, showing positive and good data for the first of two primary
endpoints, hematological remissions. We have a next wave in Phase 1/2 studies. I can, in particular, mention one if not
four that you think you should keep an eye on that we also believe will continue to establish ADCs as an important
modality. And we are indeed quite encouraged by the idea of combining the selectivity of ADCs with
immuno-oncology. So I think your question was really good by asking about those modalities.
Our PD-L1, as you know, our view is that data available to date suggests that it will have a similar profile to that of
other advanced PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies that are presented data in unselected patients. And as you continue to
explore enrichment of patients such as increased level of PD-L1, it's expected that response rate will further increase as
well as with the drug combination. There has been some suggestion from a report at AACR that avelumab may also on
the positive end pick up some ADCCs through NK cells. It remains to be proven in what tumor types this could
potentially be a differentiation. But so far, we have said that avelumab has a competitive profile similar to the other
PD-1/PD-L1. And we are very excited to advance the molecule, and we'll share an update at ASCO.

<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. And on the Consumer business, it actually had a very good quarter, very good growth.
And so it's a business we like to be in. I think it's a strategically important business for us. And we will continue to
develop it. And if we have opportunities to do acquisitions to grow, we'll also look at those. So it's a good business to
be in. Thank you.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Ian; next question, please, operator?

Your next question comes from Colin Bristow from Bank of America.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in, a couple of quick questions. On the biosimilar
AVASTIN, what's your view with regards to what agencies will require for approval? Do you think response rates will
be sufficient, or do you anticipate needing survival data? And also do you foresee any issues with recruitment in here
given there are questionable incentives to trial the biosimilar versus the innovator?
And then just last question on XELJANZ, I see you're filing both the 5-milligram and 10-milligram doses in plaque
psoriasis. Is there potential for this data set to assist in the approval of the 10-milligram dose in RA? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. Biosimilar AVASTIN, Mikael, comments on that.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes, I would say that for each of the biosimilars, we negotiate the endpoint with the regulatory
agencies. And we expect that data that indicate you have equivalence analytical on the drug pharmacokinetics and
clinical profile in the interim will lead to registration across multiple indications.
I can't specifically speculate on what would be required for AVASTIN, but I would in general be optimistic that read
outs such as response rates or PFS will be likely to confirm bioequivalence if you do have also strong robust data on the
other aspects of bioequivalence. We have now five antibodies working closely with GEP in the pipeline, and we are
very pleased so far with all of those. Four are in Phase 3 studies.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. Geno, on psoriasis.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Colin, on the 10-milligram data in psoriasis, as you know, the psoriasis patient population is
a much different patient population than RA. However, as we accumulate more and more data on the 10-milligram in
both in RA post-marketing surveillance studies and the additional indications, including psoriasis and ulcerative colitis
and other indications, the database continues to grow. And that will serve as our support for continuing to evaluate the
10-milligram across all of the indications as time goes by.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Geno. And, operator, if we could, take our last question, please.

Your final question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning, thank you for taking the question. A follow-up on biosimilars and your outlook.
Could you comment on some of the intellectual property barriers that you might face in bringing biosimilars to the
market? And specifically I'm wondering about the HUMIRA biosimilar that you have in development. What's your
expected timeline for that product given some the IP that AbbVie keeps referring to? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Alex. John, please?
<A - John Young>: So thanks for the question, Alex. I think what we would say is obviously we look at a full range of
considerations when we develop our portfolio of biosimilars. As Mikael just said in answer to the previous question, we
engage very strongly with the regulators to make sure that we have an appropriate clinical program. And clearly, we're
very mindful of the IP landscape, which frankly varies by asset. It is very complex, ranging from base patents to a

for all our biosimilars, and we take that into full consideration when we are constructing our development program and
making our forecasts for the long range.
