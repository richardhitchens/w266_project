Meg Cushing Whitman
Thank you, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.
With the final quarter of our fix and rebuild year now behind us, I'm pleased with our progress in fiscal 2013. As we
said when we laid out our five-year plan, we expected that our turnaround would not be linear, and we saw that during
the year. However, as I reflect on the key priorities we outlined at the beginning of 2013: driving innovation across HP,
improving operations, aligning our cost structure and rebuilding our balance sheet, we made great progress. We also
saw some positive momentum in our execution leading to pockets of revenue growth in key areas in Q4.
The fourth quarter capped a year of significant innovation at HP. We launched OneView, a revolutionary
consumer-inspired infrastructure management platform that allows customers to dramatically improve data center
operations while reducing costs. We introduced the new StoreVirtual storage appliance bundled with our industry
leading ProLiant servers underscoring our leadership in the software-defined storage market. We also launched Version
7 of the HP Vertica Analytics Platform, which dramatically simplifies analysis of semi-structured data. And just last
week we announced a partnership with Salesforce.com to create the HP Salesforce Superpod, a dedicated instance of
Salesforce running exclusively on HP's converged infrastructure.
In addition to the product innovation happening across HP we are driving significant business model innovation as
well. In Printing, we are seeing success with our Ink Advantage program and our newly launched Instant Ink offering.
In Software-Defined Networking, we launched a new app store that, coupled with our Network Developer Kit, will
create the industry's first enterprise class open ecosystem.
As you all know in fiscal 2013 we focused on improving our operations, driving better cash flow and rebuilding our
balance sheet. These foundational improvements were critical early steps in our turnaround and I'm extremely proud of
the results we've delivered in this area.
In Q4, we brought our cash conversion cycle down to 17 days and delivered free cash flow of $2 billion. For the full
year, we delivered more than $9 billion of free cash flow, well above our most recent outlook of about $8 billion. We
reduced operating company net debt by more than $1 billion for the seventh consecutive quarter and as a result we
achieved our operating company net debt goals ahead of plan.

We also ramped back up our share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter and returned a combined $763 million to
shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. More importantly, we once again achieved the non-GAAP
diluted earnings per share we said we would, delivering $1.01 in the fourth quarter and $3.56 for fiscal 2013, at the
high end of our most recently provided outlook.
Looking forward, we will stay committed to smart capital allocation and profitable growth. As we said at our Security
Analyst Meeting last month we believe we can grow both margin and share over the longer term. We'll continue to be
aggressive in targeted cases but we have more opportunity to improve our profitability.
Now let me turn to our business group performance in the quarter. Overall results in Q4 were driven by strong
performance in Printing, revenue growth in the Enterprise Group, improved revenue performance in Personal Systems
plus continued execution in Software and Enterprise Services.
Our Printing business delivered an excellent quarter with continued strong profitability. We outperformed the market
for the second successive quarter gaining four points of total unit market share over the prior year. Revenue for the
quarter was down 1% but we saw growth of 1% in constant currency. For the second consecutive quarter we grew unit
placement, which was up 6% over the prior year driven by strength in laser volumes and our SMB Home business. Our
managed print services business also had a good quarter with double-digit TCV [Total Contract Value] growth driven
by our partner program.
In Personal Systems we outperformed the market with particular strength in our commercial PC business. Revenue for
the quarter was down 2% over the prior year but flat in constant currency against the backdrop of a market declining
9.5% in units in the third calendar quarter. Overall, we gained 1.8 points of share over the prior year and 1.2 points
sequentially. As a result, we improved our share position in all three regions. In the fourth fiscal quarter HP saw its first
unit growth since the first calendar quarter of 2012 even as the market saw a continued decline in units.
Our commercial PC business grew revenue 4% over the prior year driven by commercial notebooks with our EliteBook
Folio doing particularly well. The Personal Systems team did a good job managing the DRAM challenges in the quarter
but we expect upward cost pressure will create a headwind in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. We continue to manage
the end-to-end cost structure of our Personal Systems business with profitability very much in mind.
In Enterprise Services, the business is now more predictable as we continue to execute well against our recovery plan.
ES revenue was down 9% for the quarter and down 8% for the full year, well within our previously provided outlook
range. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 4.4%, resulting in operating margin of 2.9% for fiscal 2013, at the
high end of the target range for the year. In Q4, bookings were up over 30% over the prior year driven by strong
renewals. At the end of fiscal 2013, trailing 12-month book-to-bill was approximately 1, in line with our guidance at
last year's Security Analyst Meeting.
Looking to fiscal 2014 we are focused on the sales force retooling program that we outlined at our Security Analyst
Meeting. We will continue our relentless attention to cost and productivity as the delayed revenue runoff puts further
pressure on our fiscal 2014 Services revenue.
In the Enterprise Group we saw revenue growth of 2%, the first time we've grown revenue in eight quarters. We saw
improved sales execution, a strong Hyperscale quarter and stabilization in blades, complemented by revenue growth in
networking and storage. Overall, margins were pressured by competitive price environment and an unfavorable mix.
Looking forward we are focused on improving our channel performance, driving cost savings to improve operating
margins and bringing new innovations to market in converged infrastructure.
As we discussed last quarter we made significant leadership changes in the Enterprise Group. Bill Veghte and his
leadership team have hit the ground running and the early signs are encouraging.
In addition, last week we announced that Martin Fink will assume responsibility for leading the HP cloud business as
its General Manager. This is in addition to his role as HP's CTO and Director of HP Labs. Martin is a true technology
visionary who brings tremendous understanding of the enterprise hardware and software space, extensive experience in
platform development, and he literally wrote the book on open source. We believe Martin will help significantly

accelerate our cloud business.
In servers, we saw very strong growth in Hyperscale over the prior-year driven by several key wins although this did
put pressure on our margins in the quarter. Our blade business recovered as the benefits of our targeted segmentation
and efforts to improve operational excellence paid off. We expect to gain over a point of share here and extend the
market leadership position we have already held for 27 quarters.
We saw improved sales in our mainstream server business but we need to improve our pricing discipline and
profitability. Although revenue continued to decline in Business Critical Systems, we expect to hold or gain share in
calendar Q3 and we have announced plans to bring a 100% fault-tolerant HP nonstop platform to the x86 architecture.
In Storage, I'm very pleased with our progress. Total Storage product revenue grew 1% year-over-year with good
sequential growth. We saw another record 3PAR quarter and are very encouraged by the strong customer acceptance
we're seeing. As a result, converged Storage product revenue grew 47% over the prior year. Revenue declines
moderated in traditional storage driven by higher storage networking attach and sales of our recently refreshed entry
products. With these results we expect to once again gain share in the combined high-end and midrange markets.
In HP networking we saw 3% growth driven by strong performance in China as well as growth in EMEA. We're also
encouraged by our growth momentum in Wireless LAN and we will continue to focus on driving innovation in
software-defined networking. In Technology Services, revenue was down driven by lower hardware sales in prior
quarters particularly in BCS. However, I'm encouraged by the positive traction in new portfolio offerings like flexible
capacity services and proactive care, new services that give customers cost-effective flexibility in their data center
while ensuring they can manage spikes in demand.
In Software, disciplined cost management resulted in operating profits of 30.8% for the quarter. Revenue decreased 9%
over the prior year, although we had a tough compare due to a large General Motors deal last year. However, the
Software team did grow in a number of areas including good growth in cloud and automation and SaaS bookings,
double-digit growth in security after normalizing for the impact of the General Motors deal, and in Autonomy we
continue to make progress and saw the second successive quarter of sequential license revenue growth.
Now let me turn to our future outlook. Overall I'm very pleased with the progress we have made but we still have a lot
of work to do to drive consistent execution and navigate a rapidly shifting marketplace. As we enter the third year of
our turnaround, we will continue to execute against the improvement areas we outlined at our Security Analyst Meeting
last month including increasing our commitment to research and development.
This work broadly falls into three buckets. The first is the shifting market forces. As an example in Personal Systems,
we are making progress on our mobility strategy but we still have not broken through. Similarly, we are still in the
early stages of building an ecosystem to capture a greater share of personal device accessories and services.
Second is the changing competitive landscape. We need to keep the customer at the center of what we do and deliver
comprehensive and innovative solutions as our competitors look to expand across the IT stack.
And finally, the third bucket is our own ability to execute. At our Security Analyst Meeting, we highlighted a number
of areas where we need to execute better. For example, we need to do more work to fix our go-to-market strategy in
Enterprise Group, particularly in channel engagement and pricing. On cost management, we are optimizing our service
delivery in Enterprise Services, and as we reinvigorate our core Software business, we must ensure we have the right
back-office systems and operational excellence to support this effort.
As a result of both the challenges and the progress we're making, we expect first-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share
will be $0.82 to $0.86 and our full-year outlook is $3.55 to $3.75.
Now let me turn it over to Cathie for a closer look at our performance in the quarter. Cathie?

Thanks, Meg. Good afternoon, everyone.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we generated revenue of $29.1 billion, down 3% year-over-year and down only 1%
in constant currency. Total FY 2013 revenue was $112.3 billion, down 7% year-over-year or down 5% in constant
currency.
We saw year-over-year revenue growth this quarter in Industry-Standard Servers, Networking, Storage and constant
currency revenue growth in Printing. Personal Systems performance was better than expected and sales outpaced the
market. Enterprise Services was broadly line and Software had a tough year-over-year compare but continued to drive
growth in key areas while expanding operating profit.
On a regional basis, Americas fourth-quarter revenue was $13.3 billion, down 2% year over year or down 1% in
constant currency. U.S. revenue was down slightly with declines also in Brazil and Canada, and Americas full-year
revenue declined 6%.
EMEA fourth-quarter revenue of $10.3 billion was down 4% year-over-year or down 5% in constant currency. The Q4
EMEA environment remained tough, although sales declined less year-over-year than in Q3 and we saw growth in
Germany and other pockets of Western Europe. Full-year EMEA revenue declined 9%.
APJ fourth quarter revenue was $5.6 billion, down 1% year-over-year, but up 4% in constant currency. In Q4 we saw
strong growth in India, mostly due to our recent educational PC win in the state of Uttar Pradesh. This offset weaker
China performance across many of our businesses, although Networking continued to perform well in China. APJ full
year revenue declined 5%.
Overall, we're pleased with our fourth quarter results. Revenue declines moderated, demonstrating the quality and the
competitiveness of our portfolio. At the same time, we recognize we have more work to do on continuing to align our
cost structure to support profitable long-term growth.
Our Q4-gross margin was 23%, down 1.2 points year-over-year and down 0.4 points sequentially. The year-over-year
decline was mostly driven by competitive pricing environment and an unfavorable mix across the Enterprise Group,
particularly in ISS. Sequentially, the competitive dynamics in the Enterprise Group and Personal Systems were mostly
offset by the seasonal uptick in Enterprise Services and an improvement in Printing. Our full year gross margin was
23.1%, down 0.2 points year-over-year as the competitive pricing pressures in EG and Personal Systems were partially
offset by margin improvement in Printing.
Savings from our restructuring program in Enterprise Services and Technology Services were offset by revenue
declines in those businesses. In the fourth quarter we had non-GAAP operating expenses of $4.1 billion, down 1.4%
year-over-year and up 0.2% sequentially. R&D is down due to streamlined operations across the Enterprise Group and
lower R&D expenses, specifically within BCS.
Long-term, we remain focused on investing in innovation across the organization and in fact, we've added head count
in engineering in FY 2013. SG&A is up around 3.8% year-over-year, although that largely reflects the impact of a real
estate gain in the prior-year quarter. We also made investments to improve operational efficiencies, which are already
driving significantly shorter quote turnaround times and improved win rates.
Total non-GAAP operating expenses in fiscal 2013 were $16.4 billion, down 2.9% year-over-year. This reduction was
mostly due to savings from our labor restructuring initiatives and our ongoing efforts to better align costs with revenue.
For the year across cost of sales and OpEx we saw labor savings of approximately $2 billion, slightly below the range
we estimated for you at the beginning of the year. But total savings, including non-labor, were in line with
expectations. We are continuing to look for further cost savings and while we're still in the early stages we believe there
may be incremental opportunity.
Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating profit was $2.6 billion, down 16% year-over-year but up sequentially 14%.
We recorded $103 million of expense on the other income and expense line, a decline from the prior year due in part to
currency gains in the quarter. With a 22% tax rate and a share count of 1.94 billion shares outstanding we delivered

fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.01. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings exclude pre-tax
charges of $371 million for restructuring and $317 million for amortization of intangible assets.
For the full-year, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.56, which is at the high end of the $3.40 to $3.60
outlook we provided at our Security Analyst Meeting in 2012. Full year non-GAAP earnings exclude pre-tax charges of
$1.4 billion for amortization of intangible assets, $1 billion for restructuring and $22 million of acquisition related
charges.
Turning to the business units, we're very pleased with the fourth quarter performance of Printing. The initiatives we've
begun executing to increase Printing relevance, drive high usage units and improve unit shares are paying off. Q4
revenue of $6 billion was down 1% year-over-year but up 1% in constant currency as hardware unit growth offset
declines in supplies. Total unit shipments grew 6% over last year and this was the second quarter in a row of
year-over-year unit growth and as Meg said, we continue to gain share. We're seeing great results with Ink in the
Office, which helped drive Q4 SMB hardware sales up double digits, and Ink Advantage had strong performance
across all regions.
In the laser market in calendar Q3 HP grew at over twice the rate of the rest of the market and graphics revenue grew to
a record level in Q4. Within graphics, digital press, which includes Indigo, saw double-digit growth. Printing operating
profit was $1.1 billion or 17.7% of revenue, up 0.2 points from the prior year period. A favorable yen impact and
operational improvements were mostly offset by lower supplies mix.
Commercial hardware revenue grew 5% year-over-year while units grew 9% driven by strength in transaction laser,
managed print services and graphics. Consumer hardware revenue grew 7% while units grew 4% year-over-year in Q4.
OfficeJet Pro X, a great example of our recent innovations is seeing strong customer traction. Supplies revenue
declined 4% from the prior year period and made up 63.9% of Printing revenue. Supplies declined only 0.5% on a
constant currency basis. The team executed well in the quarter and supplies channel inventory levels are back down
within our targeted range.
Personal Systems performed better than expected in the quarter driven by commercial sales and supported by the India
PC deal I mentioned earlier. Fourth quarter revenue was $8.6 billion, down just 2% over prior year and almost flat in
constant currency reflecting the good progress Dion is making. Total unit shipments grew 2% year-over-year in Q4
with growth in both consumer and commercial. Consumer sales declined 10% year-over-year but grew 19%
sequentially while commercial revenue grew 4% over prior year and 8% sequentially. Personal Systems operating
profit of $259 million or 3% of revenue was down 0.5 points over prior year.
As we discussed at our recent Analyst Meeting we remain focused on improving long-term profitability and returning
this business to growth. Our channel partners are key to helping us succeed and we continue to seek opportunities to
make it easier to promote and sell HP products. For example, we are expanding our receivable programs to support the
demands of our resellers and distributors.
Our fourth quarter Enterprise Group results prove that we can be competitive across our portfolio but we still have
work to do so that we can continue to win deals at the right margins. EG revenue grew 2% year-over-year to $7.6
billion in Q4 with growth in industry-standard servers, networking and storage. Operating profit was $1.1 billion or
14.5% of revenue, down 2 points from last year. We experienced competitive pricing, particularly in ISS and
networking, higher cost of service delivery in TS and an unfavorable margin mix from strong Hyperscale revenue. In
general, the pricing environment remained similar to Q3 with continued aggressive pricing, specifically in ISS and to a
lesser extent in networking.
By business, industry-standard server revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $3.5 billion, significantly outpacing the
market. We had strong sales in Hyperscale, which grew high double digits due in part to one large deal. Storage
revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $952 million with very strong growth in converged storage, which represented 43%
of total Storage revenue for the quarter, up 13.5 points year-over-year.
As Meg mentioned, we saw great traction with 3PAR, which grew 64% year-over-year. When you combine 3PAR, XP
and EVA, you have a metric that adjusts for the planned product transition and based on this, we outgrew the market

again this quarter.
Business Critical Systems revenue declined 17% year-over-year to $334 million due to a declining UNIX market.
Networking sales grew 3% year-over-year in the quarter to $656 million led by strong growth in China and more
moderate growth across the rest of APJ and EMEA. Revenue in the Americas was down year-over-year but we are
taking action to improve results by targeting areas where we can win and deliver disruptive solutions. Technology
Services revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $2.2 billion in Q4 or 4% in constant currency.
We are moving to reduce reliance on traditional hardware businesses and offering new services to address the new style
of IT. The Enterprise Services business performed broadly as expected in the quarter. Revenue of $5.8 billion was
down 9% year-over-year due to the account runoff we've discussed.
ES operating profit of $255 million or 4.4% of revenue was down 2.3 points year-over-year as the revenue runoff offset
continued improvements in productivity and under-performing contracts.
By business, IT Outsourcing revenue was $3.6 billion, down 9% year-over-year primarily due to runoff pressures and
we saw declines across all regions. Applications and Business Services revenue was $2.2 billion, down 10%
year-over-year primarily due to softness in the applications business. Overall we saw good momentum in signings and
had strong renewal rates in our expiring contracts. Strategic Enterprise Services, which includes cloud, big data,
application modernization and security, grew double digits. As discussed at our Analyst Meeting last month we are
pivoting to a more proactive sales approach and longer-term we are focused on building out our portfolio to push more
aggressively with strategic enterprise services.
Now turning to Software. Overall, Software also performed in line with expectations with good margin performance in
the quarter. Operating profit for the quarter was $328 million or 30.8% of revenue. This was up 3.6 points
year-over-year and 10.3 points sequentially driven by great cost management and our efforts to exit low-margin
professional service contracts while we continue to invest in innovation. Revenue declined 9% year-over-year to $1.1
billion on a tough year-over-year compare. You'll recall that last year in the fourth quarter fiscal 2012 we signed a
General Motors contract that is the largest customer deployment of HP Software on record. Excluding that deal,
revenue declined low single digits.
License revenue in the fourth quarter was down 24% year-over-year as the shift to SaaS continues to impact us and
given the large GM license deal last year.
Support revenue grew 4% over the prior year and Professional Services revenue declined 13%. SaaS revenue was up
15% over the prior year with higher bookings growth across all business units particularly in Autonomy, IT
Management and Fortify on Demand.
We have received great feedback from our customers and partners on HAVEn, our big data analytics platform and
going forward we are focused on delivering new innovative solutions. Additionally, as described at our Analyst
Meeting, we are focused on rejuvenating the IT Management business and expanding Autonomy.
HP Financial Services revenue in the quarter declined 6% year-over-year to $912 million. Financing volume was down
3% year-over-year with net portfolio assets of $12.2 billion. Operating profit for the business was $102 million or
11.2% of revenue. The return on equity in HP Financial Services continued to be strong at 18.9% for the fourth quarter
and 17.8% for the full year.
Turning now to cash flow and capital allocation, we generated operating cash flow of $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter
and $11.6 billion for the full year. This drove Q4 free cash flow of $2 billion and fiscal 2013 free cash flow of $9.1
billion, up 21% year-over-year. Our strong cash flow performance was driven by a disciplined focus on working capital
throughout the year.
In the fourth quarter we were able to get the cash conversion cycle to 17 days, down 4 days year-over-year through
improvements in days payable and lower inventory days. I'm pleased with the progress we've made this year and we
will continue to focus on working capital going forward. For example, we are making improvements to our payment
terms with key suppliers. As we said at our Analyst Meeting, we believe a cash conversion cycle in the low 20 days is

sustainable, although we continue to look for ways to drive a better result.
With this Q4 cash flow, we returned $479 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, buying 21.5 million
shares, and paid $284 million in dividends. We ended the year with gross cash of $12.5 billion and moved to an
operating company net cash position of $103 million. We reduced gross debt by over $5.5 billion in fiscal 2013 and
have improved our net debt position by over $12 billion since the beginning of fiscal 2012. We are extremely pleased
with the progress we've made on our goal of rebuilding our balance sheet. In fiscal 2014, we remain committed to the
capital allocation priorities that we outlined at our Analyst Meeting in October.
Looking forward to Q1, at a macro level, the environment remains challenging and somewhat choppy. EMEA
continues to be soft and China and other high-growth markets continue to face pressure. We expect currency to be
about a point headwind year-over-year to revenue in Q1.
By business, in Printing we will continue to invest in unit placements where the lifetime return on the units makes
economic sense, and we expect to drive continued momentum in key strategies across Ink, Laser and Graphics. For
Personal Systems, we expect a greater revenue decline in Q1 than Q4, as we will not have the same big deal benefits,
and expect commodity cost to pressure margins. As we focus on profitability, this cost pressure may limit revenue
upside.
In Enterprise Group, we expect revenue may decline from Q4 with a smaller impact from the large Hyperscale deal we
mentioned. However, we expect continued traction in Converged Storage, Networking and Converged Infrastructure.
In ES we expect a delayed revenue runoff from fiscal 2013 to negatively impact Q1 growth and put pressure on
first-half results overall. Finally, in Software, we will accelerate our shift to SaaS and our Professional Services
rationalization while investing in our disruptive growth opportunities, like HAVEn and Security.
With that context, we continue to expect full-year fiscal 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.55
to $3.75. For fiscal 2014 Q1, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.86. From a
GAAP perspective we continue to expect a full-year GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.85 to $3.05, and
GAAP earnings per share for fiscal Q1 is expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.64.
We don't guide quarterly cash flow, but note that we have several factors that will significantly temper cash flow
generation in the first quarter, including our annual bonus payments and accelerated restructuring payouts.
With that, I'll open it up for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Yeah, thanks. Good afternoon. What do you attribute the improved unit performance in PCs,
Printers and Servers, if you can just walk through those three segments? And more importantly, does the fiscal
fourth-quarter revenue performance give you any confidence that there is at least an opportunity to actually perform
better on the revenue line than you had originally planned for fiscal 2014?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Hi, Katy. It's Meg. Let me take that and I'll let Cathie chime in as well. So let me
answer your last question first.
I think the characterization of the business that we laid out at the Security Analyst Meeting just six weeks ago remains
the same. Obviously, there was real acceptance by our products and services in Q4 so we're encouraged by that, but
we've got macroeconomic headwinds, I think, almost across the board. And we still a lot of work to do in our go to
market. So I think it's prudent to characterize the business the exact same way we did at the Security Analyst Meeting.

In terms of units in our Printing business, you'll recall we have to look at the total lifetime value of a unit that we place
in the market and we, over the last couple of quarters, have been aggressive now at placing units that have a positive
lifetime value and we're going to continue to do that because that's an investment in the future of that business.
In the Server business, listen, we strengthened our go-to-market in just the last six weeks of the quarter. I think we were
more focused on market segmentation; we did a better job with the channel. Of course would have liked to have seen
more margin drop than we did in EG. But listen, I'm encouraged by the fact that we got more aggressive, we had good
quality and I think our products were very well accepted, and I know we can do better in terms of managing the margin.
We're capable of more and we recognize that we've got more work to do. And whether that's around customer
segmentation, optimizing our cost structure, more bundles to get a better blended margin, we know what to do and
actually are in progress with that as we head into Q1.
Cathie, do you want to add anything to that?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Yeah, I think the only thing that I would add is that in the PSG space it was heavily
skewed to commercial units, which is really where we're seeing more of the mix to shift and that's been going on now
for probably the last couple of years but certainly a pretty strong shift in fiscal 2013, and we expect that to continue into
2014. And then in IPG it's really Ink in the Office that helps really drive unit placements. Those are good quality units,
high usage units – multifunction printers, the fact that we've got a pretty almost entirely new product lineup is also
helping us there. And then graphics. We had a very strong quarter in graphics, especially when you look at Indigo. And
so I would say that in IPG from a unit placement perspective, we're really hitting on almost all cylinders here.
<A - Rob Binns>: Great. Super. Thanks, Katy, for the question. Next question, please?

Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you very much. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the margin
sustainability in Printing and how it foots to your guidance for next quarter and the year. There seems like there was
major yen benefit in the quarter, and while the operating margin year-over-year was only a little better, I think it was
much better than people expected. So I wanted to foot the margins in Printing to first quarter and the year and see if you
can keep up this level of outperformance and what you're going to do about pricing and hardware. Why not get more
aggressive? Thanks.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Thanks, Ben. Let me start with that. So as we shared at the Security Analyst Meeting, we
are expecting a positive year from an EPS contribution perspective from IPG. As we laid out there, we expect
somewhere between somewhere between $0.07 and $0.11 of incremental EPS before they get their share of the $0.12
of investment and our strategies in this segment are paying off. We're really focused on driving print relevance, we're
focused on driving high usage units, whether that's Ink in the Office, Ink Advantage for the emerging market, Ink
Subscription for the developed markets and then obviously the multifunction printers and Managed Print Services.
And so we feel really good about the progress that we're making under those initiatives and we think that, that
combined with a disciplined approach to profitability – really looking at opportunities across the portfolio where we
can simplify, unify our go-to market, really make sure that the contra dollars are as effective as they can be – ultimately
that, that allows us to then focus on the cost side as well. And ultimately allow us to contribute this incremental EPS of
$0.07 to $0.11 on a year-over-year basis.
<A - Rob Binns>: Great. Thanks for that question, Ben. Next question, please?

<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. I want to touch base here on margin as well but more from
an OpEx perspective at the consolidated level. SG&A seems to be a little higher than what I would've expected. Is there
some sort of accelerated comps that's being revived in the company model? And then R&D seemed a lot lighter than I
would've thought. Is that a one-off or is that a sign that maybe PCs and Printing are a lot less R&D intensive going
forward and so we could see that line item in terms of R&D – that run rate start to really continue to drift lower? Just
trying to get a sense of how we should think about those two line items as we go into fiscal 2014? Thank you.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So let me address the R&D question first. So as you look at the year-over-year declines in
R&D, that was really driven by two primary things. One is the rationalization of R&D, specifically in EG for Business
Critical Systems so that we really align the R&D investment in that space with the long-term business realities of the
UNIX market. And then also, we did get some, what we call the R&D value added tax subsidy credits that come
through, and those basically offset some of the R&D expense.
And when I step back and say okay, what should you take away from what we're doing in R&D, the first is innovation
is still at the core of Hewlett-Packard that ultimately, and I think I said this in my prepared remarks, our number of
engineers which are at the core of what's going to drive innovation are actually up year-over-year. And then finally if I
go back to the Security Analyst Meeting, we expect that R&D will be up across most of our segments major segments
next year and in total at the HP level, so we're still very much committed to driving on the right R&D at the right time
and the right place.
And then from an OpEx perspective, there's a little bit of volatility in the OpEx. Specifically if you look in SG&A, we
had, I guess you'd say, a tough compared to last year this quarter because we did have some gains from property sales
that obviously don't repeat themselves or didn't repeat themselves in Q4 of this year and then also we are making
investments for improving operational efficiencies and some of that shows up in SG&A as well and it's showing up a
little bit in obviously quicker turnaround times from a quote perspective and that's leading to better win rates. So we
believe that we're making the right set of investments in that space as well.
<A - Rob Binns>: Great. Thanks for the question, Mark. Next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you could provide us with an update on your cost
savings namely in terms of number of positions that have been reduced. Cathie, you mentioned that there are
opportunities possible in cost cutting as you look into 2014. Are those labor or non-labor and can you give us any sense
on how big they are?
And then finally on cash conversion you're at 17 days. You think sustainable is low 20s. If that's really the case, how
does cash flow equal or be better than net income next year?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So, Toni, let's start with the restructuring program. Our restructuring program is really on
track. At the end of fiscal 2013 on a program to date basis, roughly 24,600 people exited under the program so that's
just under 13,000 in fiscal 2013. As we talked about at Security Analyst Meeting our current plan is to and at the end of
2014 at the high end of our range, so 29,000 plus 15% so somewhere between 33,000 and 34,000 people. We expect
incremental labor savings in 2014 of $1.1 billion. That's on top of a little bit over $2 billion that we delivered in 2013
and as you mentioned and I mentioned is that we are continuing to aggressively look at whether or not there are
incremental opportunities, and we've got some work still to do to really vet that those but we do think that there may
well be some additional opportunities.
One of the things that is a lot more difficult now than it was a year ago is that we're looking at business process
reengineering and really going after cost that is what I would consider not low-hanging fruit, and so it takes a little
longer to really vet through exactly what that's going to look like over the course of the year but we will update you as
we finalize that.

Cash conversion cycle, 17 days, very pleased with that performance but we do still believe that the long-term
sustainable is in the low 20s, so 20 to 21 days and in terms of free cash flow I don't have a change to the outlook that I
provided for 2014 at the Security Analyst Meeting. We still expect it to be in the $6 billion to $6.5 billion range.

Our next question comes from Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thank you, and congratulations, Meg and Cathie, too and your team there at HP. A clarification item
is your outlook you reiterated which is fabulous next year for earnings and you mentioned since your Security Analyst
Meeting in October, which was six weeks ago, much of it's remained the same and challenging. But us as investors and
analyst take a look at it and it actually appears as if China has actually slowed a little bit more via the outlooks and
results of IBM and Cisco and many other companies. But again, you're reiterating. So the question is, is something kind
of causing you to outperform a little bit stronger and offset that more challenging environment in China? Or back in
October, six weeks ago, did you already foresee what Cisco and IBM were seeing? Or simply, does China just not
impact you quite as much? Thank you.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: So, Jim, we flagged weakness in China last quarter and China does remain soft across
many of our businesses, although we saw growth in Enterprise Group led by very strong performance in Networking in
China.
You also probably read that we recently appointed a new executive to run China for us, a fellow by the name of Robert
Mao, and he is in the newly created role of Chairman of the China region. We've actually created a fourth region, and
China now reports directly to me, and I think that is going to help energize our overall efforts in China and drive a
uniform strategy and a quite differentiated approach.
So listen, we have a big business in China, so if China is soft we're going to feel the effects, but we've been flagging
this for some time and I feel like we've got the right outlook on China for 2014.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thank you very much.
<A - Rob Binns>: Great, thanks. Next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Yeah, I was curious about your improvement in Storage. How much of that is related to
selling Storage as part of Converged Infrastructure? I'm assuming you still sell quite a bit of storage in sort of a
best-of-breed mode where it might be hooked up to somebody else's server or whatever, but I think Bill had said at the
Analyst Meeting that in general, Converged Infrastructure was something like 10% to 15% of your compute sales, if
you will. And I'm just wondering how much of the Storage success is because it's being sold in a single box, if you will.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Thanks for the question. So most of the success that we're seeing in Storage is in our
Converged Storage solution, but that's not – a heavy piece of it is not from selling Converged Infrastructure. It really is
a best-of-breed and it's really in the mid-range, the 3PAR mid-range solution. And this quarter we also saw really nice
growth in the 3PAR high-end solutions as well. And you might note that at some point soon, we're going to – our
Storage business, our Converged Storage Solutions are actually going to cross lines and they're going to become a
bigger piece of the Storage business. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, as of Q4 we are at 43%. Sometime in the
first half of fiscal 2014, we will – Converged Solutions will be more than 50% of Storage and that will allow us to
continue to accelerate growth in the Storage space.

<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: And, Steve, it's Meg. With regard to Converged Infrastructure, you will recall this was
our term, our definition and our vision for the market, and we are going to continue to aggressively pursue that. I think
Bill was right, it's probably 10% to 15% of the total components are sold in a converged infrastructure format. But I
think it's changing pretty fast because converged infrastructure is the backbone of the cloud.
So we're coming to market with HP OneView; I talked about that in my opening comments, which is a new
management plane that links our Server, Storage and Networking together in a very consumer-friendly way. It's almost
a consumer UI designed for the enterprise. And then of course, we're working very hard on improving our bundles and
our go-to-market around converged infrastructure. So I think that actually that move in the market is going to accelerate
it and we're going to actually try to drive that even harder than we have.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you.
<A - Rob Binns>: Thanks, Steve. Next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thanks. Could you give us a bit more color on how we should think about the
steady-state for profitability versus revenue growth in the Enterprise Group, particularly in Servers? Obviously, you
were able to gain quite a bit of share in Industry-Standard Servers this quarter, but you did have the fairly hefty margin
hit year-over-year. So can you walk through whether or not we should view this as a trend over the next few quarters?
Or is this more of a one-time issue given the Hyperscale performance discussed earlier?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: So, Bill, we've thought a lot about this and in my view, market share and profitability
are not mutually exclusive, as we believe we can grow both concurrently over the long term. And managed – margins
will be managed a lot more effectively, I think, by refining our customer and market segmentation to focus on those
segments that we can grow profitably. We still have work to optimize our end-to-end cost structure; that is all the way
from design to logistics, and obviously offering more bundled solutions.
So I think, listen, we have to be very careful about transaction-only business it's generally not sticky. So we don't want
to trade profit for market share that isn't sticky over time. So listen I think we've improved our ability to see what's
actually going on to manage it and now there's clear direction to the sales team about how we want to manage this. So
my belief is that this is not a trend, that we ought to be able to reverse this trend to some degree. That said obviously a
very competitive pricing environment but I feel good about our ability to do a better job in the future of managing
margin in ISS.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Let me just add that our view of margins and EPS contribution from EG has not changed
since our Security Analyst Meeting and at that time we talked about the fact that EG would be somewhere between
$0.01 dilutive to $0.02 accretive to EPS before their share of the $0.12 of incremental investment. And that's really
made up – if you look at the BU level you've got BCS is obviously continuing to come down, you've got both TS and
ISS that we think of as being relatively neutral and then HP networking and storage growth and the profit margins that
we see there then basically bring us up to basically this $0.01 dilutive to $0.02 accretive. And that has not changed
since the Security Analyst Meeting.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thank you.

<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. A question on free cash flow I think for both of you. Cathie, you mentioned that
your free cash flow targets remain the same so thus guidance for this year $6 billion to $6.5 billion should be down
about 28% even though income probably isn't going to be down anywhere near that. I understand the working capital
headwind potentially as the days there change but what are the other drivers? And that's my first question.
And the second kind of linked to that for both of you. If you have another year like you have had over the past 12
months where you are able to operate at these very good levels of cash conversion, where does that incremental cash
flow go? Does it still get split 50-50 between distribution and acquisitions or do you actually do more in terms of
buybacks? Many thanks.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Thanks. So let me start with the year-over-year -- what's going on with free cash flow.
And really the big impacts in free cash flow from a FY 2014 perspective is the working capital pressure, the fact that at
some level we actually pulled cash into fiscal 2013 by delivering a 17-day cash conversion cycle. And we will give
some of that back when we move back to the 20- to 21-day range. We also will see on a year-over-year basis CapEx
pressure. Part of that CapEx pressure is due to better volumes in HP Financial Services, and then the other broad
volume comment is there as well and finally restructuring.
The restructuring cash payouts are significantly higher in fiscal 2014 than in fiscal 2013 and they are also more
front-end loaded in 2014 than they were in 2013. So that leads me to something that I think is important to talk about
and that's Q1 cash flow. Q1 cash flow as you know – Q1 is typically our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter. It's
going to be impacted by the working capital backup a bit and the fact that we've got these restructuring charges or cash
outflows that are a bit more front-end loaded and then, as is typical, it's also impacted by our annual cash bonus.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: And so sorry, what would be cash restructuring this fiscal year then, cash restructuring?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So the cash outflow of this year was $1.4 billion in fiscal 2014.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Right.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And then in terms of your question – okay. Now that you've generated – you've gotten
back to a net debt position at the OpCo level that is actually a net cash position, does that fundamentally change your
capital allocation strategy I think is ultimately what your question is. And the short answer is it doesn't because at the
end of the day our strategy is a returns-based framework with a long-term goal of a mid-single A. That still remains the
same.
Now it does give us a bit more flexibility because we had anticipated needing to reduce our net debt position further in
the first half of fiscal 2014, and now we don't need to do that. But it still remains that we're returns-based and we'll look
at the opportunities whether they're share repurchase opportunities or M&A opportunities and determine what is the
best move for Hewlett-Packard and adding shareholder value.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you.
<A - Rob Binns>: Great. Thanks very much. We've got time probably for two or three more. So next question, please?

Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. Just had a question on the Enterprise group operating
margin. It was down about 70 basis points sequentially. Maybe just touch on, you know, how much of that was really
driven due to the mix headwinds that you guys have talked about versus the pricing dynamics that you have alluded to?
And on the pricing side, do you think that issue becomes less severe now that one of your largest competitors in the ISS
and PC side, Dell, is a private entity?

<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So the declines in margin year-over-year in EG were a combination of both a very
competitive pricing environment and the unfavorable mix, and that's really what drove a lot of the declines on a
year-over-year basis.
In terms of will the competitive environment continue to be competitive with Dell going private, our expectation and
the way we're planning and modeling is that this environment continues to be very competitive. We are not expecting
any change in any of our competitors' stance from a pricing perspective.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: And this is Meg. I mean, the way we have to win in our industry-standard server group
is obviously we have to be a competitive cost – we have to have a competitive cost structure but we have to win
through innovation and whether that's Moonshot or our next-generation of ProLiant servers or HP OneView or the way
we bundle together for the benefit of our channel partners, that's the way we're headed here. And so we're really
focused on go-to-market and innovation, at the same time making sure that we, from a server perspective, we look at
end-to-end costs, how we design, how we source, how we ship and how much of it is config to order versus build to
order is also an important driver of cost, and then of course focusing on SKUs. More SKUs means more inventory,
means more logistics, and we've done a good job of actually focusing as we head into 2014.
<A - Rob Binns>: Thanks for the question, Amit. Next question, please?

Our next question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. I actually had a question on the commercial PC market with your
revenue up 4% year-over-year. I was curious as to, I mean, that included the India units I believe, but what are you
seeing in terms of demand for a convertible tablet in the market? How much of this is sort of end-of-life for XP and
how much of this do you think is repeatable?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Well, I think – listen, we have focused a lot on the commercial business. We like our
product lineup for 2014. I think it's too early to tell how the demand for convertibles is going, whether it's in the
commercial space or the consumer space. The Christmas season, we've got a lot of convertibles in the market, so do our
competitors and we're advertising behind those because we think that's a really innovative form factor that is the best of
a tablet and the best of a PC. So I think we'll know more after we get through the Christmas season on the consumer
side.
And on the Enterprise side, I think this is all about price and lineup as what we see in the enterprise is CIOs are trying
to match the device to the worker group and what they need. So maybe a certain group of workers just needs VDI.
There are some who need workstations, some who need laptops and whether they're backwards compatible to Windows
or whether they are Chromebooks depends on what kind of work that team is doing. So that underscores our multi-OS,
multi-architecture, multi-form factor strategy that is frankly as relevant in the commercial space as it is in the consumer
space.
So we are cautiously optimistic, although we're not in the business of really forecasting the core PC business growth. I
mean we've been wrong over a couple of quarters on this and, you know, listen, IDC and others are forecasting 4% to
5% down next year and I think that's probably a good assumption going into next year.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And, Shannon, let me just clarify because it is a bit confusing. The PC win that we had in
the state of Uttar Pradesh in India in our numbers is in consumer. It is not what's driving our commercial revenue
increase. Now it's confusing because IDC puts it in commercial, so it's in the commercial share.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay. That's very helpful. Just really quickly on end-of-life of XP, how are you thinking of
that?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: So we're leading actually the migration off of XP, and we actually, I think Microsoft
would probably tell you we're among the leaders in terms of spearheading that migration. We've been on this for well

over a year and it's actually going pretty well.
<A - Rob Binns>: All right. Thanks. Next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Peter Misek from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Peter Misek, your line is now open.
<A - Rob Binns>: All right. Let's take an alternative question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Maynard Um from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi. Thanks. Meg, you talked about in terms of looking for a permanent Chairman of the Board
– you've talked about having a lot more interest given the recovery of HP. I'm just curious where HP is in terms of
finding a new permanent Chairman of the Board? And following that, any indication of whether or not Ralph
Whitworth would still continue to sit on the board? Thanks.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Yeah, so, Ralph, as you know, is Chairman of the Board on an interim basis and he
has stepped up to the plate beautifully and we really are very grateful to his service. He's done a great job and he said
the other day, he'll continue to serve until we find someone else. So you should assume he's in place for the foreseeable
future and we're just delighted with his working relationship with the management team, with the board. He's made an
outstanding contribution. So he'll be in place until we find someone else.
<A - Rob Binns>: Super. Thanks, Meg. Thanks for the question. One last question, please?
Operator
Our final question comes from Brian Alexander from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Okay. Thanks. I want to ask a question about the 3D Printing opportunity. Meg, you've
highlighted this as an opportunity and you seem genuinely interested in the market. So what are your aspirations in
terms of market position relative to your leading position in the traditional printing market and do you think you can
reach that organically or do you think you have to acquire an established player? Thanks.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: So we intend to play in the 3D printing market because it is an adjacency. It's
obviously different than paper printing but some of the technology is the same and at least as we sit here today we
anticipate entering this organically and what we're doing is focusing on what's value proposition by market segment,
whether that be consumer or industrial? What's the competitive differentiation? And we've got some very interesting
things coming so stay tuned in 2014.
But this is an acorn, right? You've heard me say we've got to plant acorns and they will eventually become oak trees,
but you should think in 2014 and 2015 this is an acorn that maybe has very good long potential but the market's at its
earliest stages and there's a lot of technology work that needs to be done to be able to print in the kind of timeframe that
most consumers and most industries would actually find acceptable.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Thank you.
Rob Binns
Great, super. Thanks for that. Thanks, everybody, and I think with that we'll conclude the questions. Thank you.
