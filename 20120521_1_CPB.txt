Before we go over the usual reminders, we'd like to invite all of our listeners to join our webcast next week on
Wednesday, May 30, at 8:00 AM, Eastern Time. We'll be webcasting Denise Morrison's presentation at the Sanford
Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in New York.
Today, as usual, we have created slides to accompany our quarterly earnings presentation. You will find the slides
posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. Please keep in mind that this call is open to
members of the media who are participating in listen-only mode.
As a reminder, our presentation today includes forward-looking statements, which reflect the company's current
expectations about future plans and performance. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions
and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to inherent risks. Please refer to slide 3 in our presentation or
to the company's most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings for a list of the factors that could cause our actual
results to vary materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements.
Because our presentation includes non-GAAP measures as noted by SEC rules, you'll see on slide 4, we've provided a
reconciliation of the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures as an appendix to the slides
accompanying the presentation. These slides as well as our earnings release and selected quarterly financial data also
can be found on our website.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Denise.
Denise M. Morrison
Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining Campbell's third quarter conference call. Nine months into our
transition, we remain confident and focused on executing our strategic plan and improving our performance across our
three broad categories; simple meals, baked snacks and healthy beverages. We are making significant investments in
our brands and developing a meaningful innovation pipeline to satisfy both our loyal core consumers and to capture the
taste buds of new ones.
Before I became CEO last August, the Campbell leadership team examined the fundamentals of our entire company.
We challenged the conventional thinking about our businesses and our strategies. The strategic framework we put in
place at the beginning of this year is the foundation on which we build our growth plans. This was not a simple course
correction. We are building a business for the long term.
This morning, I will provide my perspective on our execution as we continue to advance our three growth strategies. As
many of you know, those strategies are stabilize and then profitably grow North America Soup and Simple Meals,
expand our international presence and continue to drive growth in healthy beverages and baked snacks.
Under our new strategic framework, we have placed the consumer at the center of everything we do. In the quarter,
consumers continue to be pressured, particularly in developed markets. This is the new reality we face. The story is a
familiar one. Trips to stores are down and dollars per trip are down, impacting the performance of food sales across the
industry. In fact, many center store categories particularly in the grocery channel are facing significant growth
challenges. Consumers are making different choices including where they shop, what they purchase and how tightly
they manage their food budgets. Our overarching goal is to delight consumers with tasty, affordable, nourishing,
convenient food and do it their way. Our consumer insight and understanding of key trends around culinary, taste,
wellness, technology and globalization are having a profound impact on how we approach our business. These insights
are fueling our innovation pipeline for fiscal 2013 and beyond.
In terms of brand building, we recognize that optimizing all of the drivers of demand will look different for each of our
businesses, depending upon the consumer, customer and competitive situation. In our U.S. Soup business, this means
having the right combination of drivers, including advertising and consumer promotion, product quality, differentiated
positioning of our brands, the right price value, trade promotion and finally, distribution channels and placement on
shelf. Getting this right on our base business and executing with excellence is foundational to our growth. On top of the
stable base business, the innovation agenda that we have set in motion will accelerate our growth over time.

This quarter we significantly increased our long-term brand building efforts across most of our businesses, with
advertising and consumer promotion up 13%. As we announced in July, we targeted $100 million in new brand
building and innovation initiatives this year. This investment is critical for our future growth and we are on track to
spend that $100 million on new product launches, brand building, R&D, funding our innovation teams, and emerging
markets. At CAGNY, we shared some of the initial innovations resulting from this investment. We now have 52 new
products going to market that will start to ship in quarter four. Customers have responded favorably to the new products
that we have planned.
Although we have executed against our new initiative spending, our total advertising and consumer spending for the
year is not as high as we originally planned, due to our ongoing management of base spending in a tougher
environment. For example, we have shifted some marketing expense to trade promotion in our Global Baking and
Snacking businesses to address competitive issues.
Excluding currency, our total sales growth in the quarter was 1% compared to a year ago, which is also an
improvement versus the first half. U.S. Beverages led the way with a 5% increase, driven by market share gains and
new product introductions. Global Baking and Snacking sales increased 2%, led by "Pepperidge Farm". Organic sales
rose 2% in International Simple Meals and Beverages. And North America Foodservice sales were comparable with
last year. U.S. Simple Meals declined 2%.
As we anticipated, our pullback in trade spending and price realization in a competitive arena had an impact on our
sales of U.S. Soup. Having said that, I'm not happy with our U.S. Soup performance this quarter, I know we can do
better. We continue to review all aspects of the U.S. Soup business, and anticipate making further execution
adjustments based on new insights. The U.S. Simple Meals business is meeting our profit expectations but is not yet
delivering top line growth. In another part of the world, we continue to struggle in Australia with a difficult consumer
and customer environment.
We reiterated our guidance for F 2012 today. The guidance reflects the strategic transition we are making and our
investments in brand building and innovation to change our top line trajectory. It also reflects the headwinds we are
facing in the U.S. and Australia. We will be near the low end of our guidance range for sales and adjusted EBIT and
near the high end of the range for adjusted EPS. Bigger picture, we are establishing the foundation to drive long-term
growth at Campbell.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for his analysis of our financial results and expectations.
B. Craig Owens
Thanks, Denise, and good morning. I'll spend a few minutes to review our third quarter results and segment highlights
and I'll follow that with a recap of our year-to-date results and finish by briefly discussing our full year guidance.
For the quarter, we reported net sales of $1.8 billion, comparable to the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of
currency, organic net sales increased by 1%. We recognized some additional restructuring charges in connection with
the program that we announced last June. Excluding that impact, operating earnings decreased 13% this quarter to $268
million. This was primarily due to cost inflation, increased marketing investment and lower volume, partly offset by
higher selling prices and productivity improvements.
On a segment basis, sales gains in Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Beverages were offset by declines in U.S.
Simple Meals and International Simple Meals and Beverages. Operating earnings were down across all of our
segments. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.56 this quarter, a 2% decline as compared to the third quarter of 2011.
Earnings per share benefited from a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding, mostly offsetting the lower EBIT.
In the third quarter, our reported net sales were comparable to the prior year. Organic sales increased by 1%. You'll
note that the detail on Chart 15 does not add due to rounding. As you can see on the chart, the increase in pricing of
three points was offset by the negative impact of increased promotional spending of two points and a decrease in

volume and mix of one point. The majority of the pricing gains have from our list price actions in U.S. Soup and in our
Baking and Snacking segment taken to partly offset the impact of inflation. The promotional spending variance reflects
the higher rates of spending in our Baking and Snacking business.
Our gross margin declined from 40.4% in the third quarter of 2011 to 38.8% in the current quarter, a decrease of 160
basis points. The decline was primarily due to cost inflation, increased promotional spending and unfavorable mix,
partially offset by higher selling prices and productivity improvements. Overall, our inflation rate and cost of goods
sold was about 6% for the quarter. Our gross margin performance is below our own earlier expectations primarily due
to higher rates of promotional spending in our Baking and Snacking segment. The negative mix impact reflects our
lower margin segments outperforming our higher margin segments.
Our marketing and selling expenses increased by 5% to $256 million compared with $243 million in the prior year,
primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses, partially offset by lower selling expense. In the
third quarter, advertising and consumer promotion expense increased by 13%, reflecting brand-building investments
across most of our businesses. Most notably, we significantly increased advertising in our U.S. Simple Meals segment,
accounting for more than half of this increase.
Administrative expenses decreased $4 million to $144 million, primarily due to the benefit of cost savings from
restructuring initiatives.
As I noted earlier, adjusted EBIT declined 13% for the quarter. Below that line, net interest expense increased 13%, an
increase of $3 million, reflecting a higher proportion of fixed rate debt in the portfolio. The adjusted tax rate declined
by 8.2 points to 26.1% from 34.3% in the prior year due to lower taxes on foreign earnings associated with revised
dividend projections. Reflecting the lower tax rate, adjusted net earnings were down just 4%. Adjusted earnings per
share declined 2%, benefiting from a 2% decrease in diluted shares outstanding.
Third quarter segment sales results and the corresponding organic growth rates are shown on Slide 18. U.S. Simple
Meals sales declined 2% driven by declines in U.S. Soup. U.S. Soup sales fell 3% this quarter as lower volumes were
only partially offset by higher selling prices. Within U.S. Simple Meals, sales of U.S. Sauces were comparable to the
third quarter of 2011, with "Prego" pasta sauce achieving a 3% volume-driven sales gain benefiting from increased
advertising support and new items.
Sales of "Pace" Mexican sauce were comparable to prior year while other simple meal brands declined. Global Baking
and Snacking segment sales increased by 2% driven by growth in "Pepperidge Farm". "Pepperidge Farm" sales
increased primarily driven by double-digit growth in "Goldfish" snack crackers, partially offset by declines in bakery
and cookie products. Sales in Arnott's were comparable to prior year as strong growth in Indonesia was offset by
decline in Australia, driven by increased promotional spending.
Within the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment, organic sales increased 2% as higher sales in Canada,
Europe and Latin America were partly offset by lower sales in the Asia Pacific region. In Europe, sales increased due to
volume-driven gains in France, partially offset by lower sales in Germany. And in the Asia Pacific region, sales
decreased primarily due to declines in Australian soup, partially offset by growth in Japan and Malaysia. U.S. Beverage
sales, which continue to outpace the category, increased 5% versus prior year. Sales increase primarily driven by
double-digit growth in "V8 Splash" beverages and gains in "V8 V-Fusion" beverages. Sales in the quarter benefited
from a range of new products including "V8 V-Fusion" Smoothies, "V8 V-Fusion" Sparkling flavors and Energy
drinks. Sales of North America Foodservice were comparable to prior year as volume-driven gains in fresh chilled soup
sold at retail were offset by declines in frozen and canned soup.
Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals decreased by 14% to $120 million this quarter. This decline reflected lower
earnings in both U.S. Soup and U.S. Sauces. Within the segment, lower volumes, cost inflation and increased
advertising and consumer promotion expenses were partly offset by higher selling price and productivity
improvements. I mentioned higher selling prices in U.S. Simple Meals, recall that we took a 5% increase across U.S.
Soup in June 2011 due to significant inflation, we expect continued inflation, although at a more moderate level, and
soup input cost for this next year.

Consequently, we're taking another list price increase in June of 2012. The 5% list price increase applies only to
condensed soup.
Earnings within Global Baking and Snacking declined by 11% reflecting decreases in both Arnott's and Pepperidge
Farm. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to the decline in gross margin percentage driven by cost inflation and
promotional spending partly offset by higher selling prices.
Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages were down 17% primarily due to the impact of cost inflation, increased
promotional spending and higher advertising partly offset by volume gains.
Within the International Simple Meals and Beverages, earnings declined by 10% primarily due to lower earnings in the
Asia Pacific region. Operating earnings within North American foodservice decreased by $2 million or 9% versus the
prior year.
U.S. Soup sales for the quarter decreased 3%. Within Soup, sales of condensed soup decreased 5% with declines in
both cooking and eating varieties. RTS sales decreased by 1% reflecting declines in microwavable soup partly offset by
the sales from the launch of "Campbell's Slow Kettle" soups. Canned RTS soup sales were comparable to a year ago.
Broth sales declined 4% as a decline in canned products were partly offset by the introduction of "Swanson Flavor
Boost" concentrated broth.
The U.S. wet soup market share results from the latest 52 weeks based on IRI data and internal company estimates is
shown here on slide 22. Campbell's market share declined 2.3 points to 59.6%. The change was driven by
ready-to-serve soup and ready-to-serve other branded players and private label had market share gains. Our U.S. Soup
dollar sales declined 3.6% while overall category sales were unchanged in dollars over the past 52 weeks.
We underperformed the category as a result of our reduction in promotions and our list price increase among other
factors. Other branded players increased sales by 7.9% in the period while private label sales rose 1.8%.
For the first nine months, reported net sales were comparable to prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, organic
net sales decreased by 1%. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted EBIT of $1 billion was down 8% versus
a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to cost inflation, lower volumes and increased promotional spending partly
offset by higher selling prices and productivity gains. Adjusted EPS declined 4% less – by 4%, which was only about
half of the EBIT decline as we continue to benefit from our share repurchase program. Diluted shares outstanding fell
by 3%.
Below the operating profit line, net interest expense fell 5% or $4 million to $81 million. This decline was primarily
driven by lower rates on our long-term debt portfolio. The adjusted tax rate for the first nine months of the year
increased 10 basis points to 31.2%. We expect the full year tax rate to be between 31% and 32%, similar to last year.
For the first nine months, net earnings declined 7%, and benefiting from a 3% reduction in diluted shares outstanding,
EPS declined 4% to $2.03. Cash flow from operations was $838 million compared to $858 million in the prior period.
The decline reflected the impact of lower earnings, partly offset by lower cash payments associated with pension and
other benefit plans.
Capital expenditures $173 million were up from $133 million a year ago. For the year, we continue to forecast capital
spending of approximately $325 million. During the first nine months of the year, we utilized our positive cash flow to
repurchase 8.3 million shares at a cost of $272 million under our strategic share repurchase program announced in June
of 2011. And our practice of buying back shares to offset those issued under our equity-based compensation programs.
Net debt was $2.4 billion, a decrease of $282 million.
As noted this morning in the earnings release, we expect net sales growth of between 0% and 2%, a decline in adjusted
EBIT of between 9% and 7%, and a decline in adjusted EPS of between 7% and 5% putting the adjusted EPS in the
range of $2.35 to $2.42. We expect improved sales performance and increased investment in brand building and
innovation in the fourth quarter. Based on these estimates, we expect to achieve our guidance with sales in adjusted
EBIT near the lower end of the range and adjusted EPS benefiting from a favorable tax rate near the upper end of the
range. As previously mentioned, we expect a full year tax rate to be between 31% and 32%. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ed Aaron from RBC Capital. Please go ahead with
your question.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Great. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Good morning, Ed.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Maybe just to start on the soup business. I wanted to ask about the decision to take price on
condensed but not on ready-to-serve. Is it – is that maybe an indication that you feel like you've kind of gone too far
this past year to try to better separate the relative pricing between condensed and ready-to-serve?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes. We believe that the list price increase that we took on ready-to-serve, coupled with
the pullback on trade spending was enough this year, and that increasing the price on that particular line of soup next
year was not prudent. That said, our – we believe there is still pricing power on our condensed line.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Okay. And then maybe just as a kind of a general follow-up to the soup business, I mean,
Denise do you feel like looking at kind of where you are year-to-date that you have this plan to stabilize and then grow
the soup business. Do you think you've kind of hit the point of stabilization yet? Or do you think it's premature to kind
of claim victory on that?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We have just hit the point of stabilization. I wouldn't declare victory yet. But we are
largely where we expected to be year-to-date, despite the third quarter.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Thank you.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Thanks, Ed. Just a reminder, we would like you to focus on one question at a time. Next
question, please.

Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Morning, Bryan.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Just a follow up to Ed's question, just in terms of the price increase in condensed soup.
Denise, can you just talk about what the interaction between ready-to-serve and condensed soups has been, I guess,
through the course of this year? And then just how you feel or think about the price gap right now between condensed
and ready-to-soup (sic) [ready-to-serve]? But I guess my question is just simply, is there some risk that condensed
bleeds market share at ready-to-soup – ready-to-serve if you take a – taking another price increase?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Well, first of all, on the price increase, pricing and productivity improvements must offset
the inflation that we're going to experience next year so that we can invest in brand building and innovation. We think

that's very important. As we plan this, we're not crossing any key pricing thresholds, particularly on our icons, and we
anticipate to maintain the normal price gaps between ready-to-serve and condensed, which would minimize the
interaction between the two soup sub categories. And of course, we'll watch this very closely as it plays out in the
marketplace.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: So you feel like you're at a good point right now in terms of the way those two have
interacted with each other?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes. We feel that we have made significant improvements since we've pulled away from
the severe price discounting that we had last year.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Chris.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Morning, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: I just wanted to ask you in relation to some of the new products you have coming out,
they were more heavily focused on ready-to-serve, there'll be some more promotional spending behind those products
next year. Is that at all a factor in this decision on pricing between condensed and ready-to-serve? And I guess I'd also
like to understand, with those new products do you anticipate incremental shelf space for those products through the
launch in early fiscal 2013.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes, Chris. Let me take the last part of that question first. Obviously we are introducing
double the rate of new products that we had last year, and our sales team is working right now collaboratively with
retailers to make sure that we get the proper shelf space to accommodate those products. So that's in the works. And the
response has been very favorable by our customers. And we focus those new products largely on Millennials and their
preferences, and so that's why we have more in the RTS line of soup than in condensed. But that said, we are working
on introducing some new news to condensed soup as well and we will continue to do that.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: I think the price increase or the lack of a price increase on RTS doesn't have much to do with
the new products. For the most part, the new products will have independent pricing decisions against them. There will
be a few line extensions and new variety flavors in the existing RTS line, but it didn't play much into the decision about
price increase.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - David S. Palmer>: I had a feeling from your previous communications that you were going to be looking at the
second half of this fiscal year as more of a clear view about the momentum in your business. Do you feel like this
quarter is a pretty good judgment quarter for you as you look at your business and your brand momentum? Or do you
think there was still some noise in there that we should be thinking about?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I think that the momentum is better on our beverages and our baked snacks businesses and
our sauce businesses. I don't think the momentum is better on Australia. And – I think it's better than it was, but it's still
not all the way where we want it to be. And in our soup business we're about where we would – we expected to be on a
year-to-date basis, and we are optimistic that as we introduce the new innovation going forward, we'll start to pick up
accelerations in our growth.

Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Akshay.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Hi. My question is regarding the effectiveness of your marketing spend, especially in light
of some of the issues you discussed relating to the center of store category. So you talked about, I think something like
52 new products. I mean, what are you doing differently in terms of your innovation to increase the effectiveness of
your brand building efforts? Because clearly, the level of your brand building, it seems like you've taken it down on
your base business.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: The effect of our increased marketing support was mixed. We had, as I said, much better
performance in beverages, baked snacks and Canada. And I think it's fair to say that we're constantly looking at the
efficiency and effectiveness of our advertising and consumer promotion. And we also have an awareness that there are
multiple drivers of demand that need to be balanced and that balance could look different based on the business. So, in
our Soup business, we had increased advertising and consumer promotion. However, with the pull back on trade

Our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Craig, I think you said the adjusted tax rate declined in part because of lower taxes on foreign
earnings associated with revised dividend projections. Is that correct?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: That's correct.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: What does that mean exactly?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: It means that we have, through a combination of cash and tax planning, determined that we
can forego some of the dividend activity that we had previously planned from our foreign subsidiaries, which saves us

on the dividend tax rate, and we still feel like we'll be able to hit our cash flow targets.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Okay. So, dividends back to the parent, not dividends to shareholders, right?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: That's correct.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Okay. And then, Denise, I'm curious about your comment that the condensed soup business has
pricing power right now. Given the difficult volume environment, I must admit, I just don't understand quite the
commitment to high margins, when the business is shedding volume a little bit. I would've thought you needed to go
the other way that is take prices down to eat some margins, because you are earning, I don't know 30% margins, maybe
more when the food industry average is closer to 10%, 15%, and you're condensed volumes are heading the wrong
way. So, if you could just help us understand that a little bit more. I know repeating this a little bit down, but I'm just
curious to follow-up there.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Well, in looking at the categories in Simple Meals, most of those categories have had
substantial increases in prices over the past couple of years, predominantly due to increases in cost inflation and we've
had the same. And we believe that we need to at least cover cost inflation between productivity and pricing, so that we
are able to effectively spend back in brand building with the consumer and increasing our innovation. And we believe
that condensed soup could – is still very, very good value relative to other Simple Meals in the grocery store and as
long as we can maintain the balance of pricing and advertising and new product news, we believe that the consumer
will respond to that.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: You're welcome, Ken. Next question, please?

<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Morning.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. So, in the release you highlighted some improvement in soup sales during the
quarter in Canada, where I believe you're moving toward a similar strategic approach of lower promotional spend,
higher innovation, similar to what you're doing in the U.S. Is there a clear divergence in how your Soup business is
performing there, relative to the U.S. or how consumers are responding to the brand building efforts? And if so, what
do you think is driving that?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I think in Canada they have a different – they had a different balance of advertising to
consumer and merchandising and that worked very effectively for them this quarter.

<A - B. Craig Owens>: Eric.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: I guess, one question, one follow-up, kind of related to Ken's question. I mean, Denise, just
speaking more broadly for the industry, I mean, aren't we in this just kind of intractable problem of inflation and raised
prices, alienate the consumer to a certain extent and then try to advertise back, but it seems with volumes down across
the industry that the advertising isn't doing what it's intended to do.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I think that the advertising has worked better on condensed than it has on RTS this year.
The amazing campaign has driven condensed consumption to where we planned it to be. I think that the advertising on
RTS has not been as differentiating as we thought it would be, so we have to make our course corrections there. I
actually walked a store this weekend and looked at some of the different pricing on Simple Meals, all the way from
frozen entrees to cereal to perimeter offerings, et cetera. And it is astonishing how good a value our condensed soup is
relative to some of those other items. In fact, we're right up there with candy bars.
So, I do believe that we need to watch it in the marketplace, but I really believe that it's very important that we keep
advertising and promoting with the consumer and incenting them with new recipes and ideas for usage of this product
and that's going to take money. And so, we need to invest that money back in the brand building.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, thank you for that. Craig, did you – you talked about the
inflation in the quarter, you said you're going to have inflation next fiscal year which is again why you're raising prices
on condensed, what percent increase are you expecting for F 2013 and what are the drivers of that, because it seems as
if most inputs are at least on spot basis down year-over-year?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yeah, I think you're right, Eric, I think the inflation that we're anticipating for next year will be
lower than this year, if you'll remember we said this year would be something like 7% or 8% on input cost leading to a
total inflation number of around 6% and we would expect a lower number for next year, but probably still a number
that will be ahead of the 3% or so that we look at as kind of a long-term guideline as to what we can absorb through
productivity and enabler savings. So, we'll give a more precise inflation forecast as we get closer to the year, but that
kind of gets you in the ballpark of what our thinking is and why a price increase.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: And is there something specific that's driving the 3% to 6% range?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: It's a little bit across the board, we don't see any of the key inputs to the Soup business that we
think would be significantly down and I think we see a range of increases across both packaging and ingredient cost.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on.

<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Andrew.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Hi, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Denise, I found one of your comments interesting at the outset, where you said you were really
reviewing all aspects of the U.S. Soup business and you know to expect some further execution adjustments, and so I
don't know, that sounded a little bit more like, and I know you have obviously some change in leadership and such who
want to look at their own perspectives on this, but it sounds like there is still the potential for some significant shifts or
course corrections in the way you're at least executing in U.S. Soup. And I guess, I just want to follow up on that and
see, maybe I'm reading too much into that or if I'm not, if we could dig down a little bit on maybe some of the key
buckets maybe of where those execution adjustments need to be or whatever you can kind of share with us at this
point?

<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah, I think Andrew suffice it to say that we've been working on two paths. One is really
jump-starting our innovation pipeline, which in Soup and Simple Meals was woefully under the average, and we've
been very encouraged by the progress that we're making there.
The second is really to make sure that we are leaving no stone unturned as we look at the fundamentals of our base
businesses, and so when I talk about the drivers of demand, that's not only trade promotion and advertising and
consumer promotion, but it gets to all the way into product, it gets into offerings, it gets into shelves, it gets into
distribution channels, and so we are and we'll be working on our operating plans as we speak. Like I said, looking at
our base business with a lot of detail to make sure that we get the right balance of all these drivers of demands to drive
growth.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Got it, okay. That's helpful. I think it's a matter of I guess, a question was asked earlier also
about, what did you learn so far from this Soup season that either makes you think you are on track for sort of next
fiscal year or whether there still needs to be a lot done. And obviously, it sounds like you're more encouraged on the
new products side, early days, but some things obviously on the core that still need to be sort of figured out?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We – well, I wouldn't say that it has to be figured out. I think we've got a good line of
sight to get better results on the base business.

Our next question comes from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi. Thank you. A question on beverages; I think this year was supposed to be an investment
year to fend off competition. And, as a result, operating margins are down from 24% last year to maybe around 18% or
19% this year. Do you think that you've achieved what you set out to do? And, do you think that in fiscal 2013 we
could look for margins going higher or is this, like, where you think margins need to be to keep growing the business?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: In the beverage business, we still see week-shelf stable juice category trends. However,
our beverages have been performing and gaining share. And so, the beverage business has responded, particularly our
"V8 V-Fusion" and "V8 Splash" beverages, to the investment that we've made in this business. That said, we recognize
that that has come at a cost and going forward we will strike a balance to get back to profitable growth in beverages
with the momentum of new products and continued brand-building which is now in our base.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Just to follow up; how do you think your competition has reacted to the aggressive activities
you've put into the marketplace? Has it cooled off a little bit?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I wouldn't say that the grocery store in general has cooled off and particularly in the
beverage aisle it has not cooled off. So, we expect that the industry is going remain very competitive but we believe
that we have the brand proposition to deal with that.

<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hello, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: So, at the beginning of the presentation, you mentioned that consumers are shopping in
new channels. We've had some other packaged food companies say that up to maybe 5% of U.S. sales are now coming
from the dollar store channel. Obviously, other companies are a lot, lot lower than that. We've also got companies like
Heinz really trying to target those dollar as price points to get in there with a lot of new SKUs. Could you just speak to
what your strategy is with regard to that very fast growing channel right now?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: There is no question that there has been more growth in some of the value channels this
year relative to grocery. That said, we are underdeveloped in a number of those channels. And, part of our innovation
pipeline is to make sure that we're developing our business across all channels so that, as consumers shop different
places, they will find the availability of our products.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: So, we'd actually hear about you putting SKUs into those stores as part of a new product
lineup sometime soon?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We offer products to all channels. So – but like I said, our business tends to be more
skewed towards the mainstream channels at this point.

Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jason English>: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for the question.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: You're welcome, Jason.
<Q - Jason English>: Quickly on the spend level this year, the $100 million, I think you mentioned a couple of times
that you're still on track to spend there. You just had to make some tactical adjustments in terms of how you spent it
and where you spent it. You've got a lot of innovation coming to market next year. Do you – as we look at the
marketing and selling expense line here at the P&L, are you happy with where it is as a percentage of sales or do you
think it needs to move up materially higher to support all the new launches?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I think that what we're seeing on a year-to-date basis is that we were down on our
marketing expense in first quarter as we pulled back on non-productive marketing expense that we had in our base, and
our A&C in quarter two was up 6%. Our A&C in quarter three was up 13%. We have readied many new products to go
to market. We've shifted a lot of resources inside Campbell's to form these breakthrough innovation teams and fully
staffed them so that there is a pipeline even beyond F 2013 being built. So, I think we've made, in a short period of time
– remember this has been nine months. In a short period of time, we've made significant progress and kept the integrity
of investing that $100 million in the new initiatives that we talked about last July.
<Q - Jason English>: What don't we see in the P&L then? Because if we look at the P&L, year-to-date marketing and
selling expense up $3 million, R&D down $4 million. We don't see any of it there. Are there offsets that we just don't
have visibility to?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes, there have been offsets in the Global Baking and Snacking businesses, both in
Pepperidge Farm and in Arnott's to meet competitive situations. There has been some reallocating of marketing
expense which moved to above the line and that's part of the reason why our gross margins were down.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: The other thing you see on the P&L within the selling and marketing line, if you'll
recall, in the fourth quarter of last year we announced a pretty significant restructuring program and the benefits of that
are hitting both the administrative expense line and also selling expense which sits within selling and marketing is

Our next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Thank you very much. My question is just – again a little bit more focused on the balance
sheet. And, if we look at results today, what's happened overall obviously in the soup business for the past few years;
I'm just trying to gauge as we look at Q4, should we be – should we expect potentially a little bit more aggressive
stance on buyback activity going into Q4 next year? And, I just ask the question because if I look year over year, look
at a trend in your buyback activity relative to your balance sheet strength, it just doesn't seem like you're buying back
that much stock and I thought you would be.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yeah, we – Rob, we've typically – we've said and we have typically acted against the notion
that the buyback program would be the last piece – or the lowest priority in terms of reinvestment to the extent that we
can reinvest in our business – our existing business, that's first, and to the extent that we can find attractive external
development projects that would be second. And, then we have a philosophy of maintaining a pretty steady approach to
payout ratio on our dividend, and then to the extent that we have excess cash, we tend to use that in our buyback
program. And that's – it's a little up and down by quarter but broadly across time I think that's what you would expect to
see. We are not looking to significantly change the leverage in our balance sheet one way or the other with our share
repurchase program.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: And, would that be the same for any type of potential acquisition, like, you again aren't looking
to significantly change your leverage?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Well, I think that would then depend on the size of the acquisition, the opportunity that we saw
available. So, no, it wouldn't necessarily be the same answer on acquisition.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay, perfect. I'll pass it on.

<Q - Erin Lash>: I had a – Hi. I had a follow-up on the breakdown of marketing versus promotional spending. And, I
know that you've been focusing on marketing spending, specifically within the soup business. But, obviously, you
talked in this quarter about the increased promotional spending behind the Global Baking and Snacking segment. And,
I was wondering if you – what your expectations were of that spending going forward and just overall the breakdown
between marketing versus promotional spending from a consolidated perspective.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah, there isn't a single answer on the breakdown of marketing versus promotional
spending. Again each business, depending upon its situation, will have to strike the right balance of what that looks like
going forward. That said, in our baking and snacking businesses, as they faced more competition in the marketplace,
they made choices to – we still spent advertising and consumer but they made choices to reallocate some of those funds
to more competitive promotion in the marketplace.

<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Great. Thanks for the follow-up, everyone.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Hi. I know you won't give your fiscal 2013, obviously, earnings guidance until the fourth
quarter. But, Craig, thanks for the little bit of additional color on ranges around cost expectations and things. I'm just
wondering if there are any other, let's say, discrete puts and takes that we should think about, not quantifying, but just
buckets that we ought to at least think about from an expectations standpoint that affect things or you think will affect
things next year one way or the other, whether it's pension or obviously costs as you talked about from an inflation
standpoint, but other things that might be harder for us to see at this stage, that we just want to take into consideration.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yeah, Andrew, there are a lot of moving parts as you know. And, I hesitate to pull out one or
two of those and get people focused on those moving parts and not on others. On pension, the biggest driver for
everybody that has a pension plan will be the fact that discount rates are falling. And so, we'll have to watch that. But, I
really don't want to get into shining a light on particular pieces of the puzzle this early in the game. And, we'll continue
the dialogue around F 2013 at our Analyst Day in July.

Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi Investments.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, David.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Hi. Good morning. I was not sure if I was going to get in here. So, I appreciate you taking
the questions. Two quick follow-ups; the first one is on the advertising. Craig, when you laid out at CAGNY and
Denise when you laid this out at CAGNY, you put the pie chart up and you showed something like 25% of that $100
million to go into A&C spending for the year, so about $25 million. Do you still expect to hit that? And, then on
slotting fees for all the new products, do any of those fee expenses show up in the fourth quarter? Or, will all the
slotting fees really show up in F 2013?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: To answer the second question first, there's almost always some of the slotting activity that
shows up in the prior year. So, you should expect some of the slotting expense to be in the – that would show up in this
quarter. I think that as we think about the $100 million, probably of that $100 million, more than 25% of it would be in
marketing by the time we get to the end of the year. Either marketing support of new product introduction, or new
product initiatives, or marketing support against the brand building initiatives in some of the key areas that we have
focused on this year.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: So above and beyond just A&C you're saying? So, – I thought the chart had said $25 million
to A&C?

Our final question comes from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi. Thanks for the follow-up. Did you, Craig, give an update on gross margin guidance for the
year? Is it still down 100 basis points? And then as you look to fiscal 2013, I know you don't want to talk about it
much, but to what degree does condensed volumes, probably being down from the price increase, impact
manufacturing efficiencies?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: So with respect to gross margin, you're right. We have sort of pulled our gross margin
expectation down as we've gone through the year. Obviously we're able to – against our guidance, to pretty well offset
that. We're still looking at being, as we said in the – both the release and in the script, we're looking to be within our
guidance. But I suppose that for the quarter, we were down about 160 basis points and as we look forward for the full
year, we would expect to be down probably a little bit more than that 100 basis points at gross profit for the full year.
With respect to F 2013, again, I – we're just – we're not at the point of giving guidance for F 2013 yet. So we'll hold
that one.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: So you think maybe down 120 for fiscal 2012?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: That's probably closer. Yeah.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. Thank you.
Denise M. Morrison
Yeah. Thanks for the questions and thanks to all of you for your attention. In closing, we've made solid progress
towards reinvigorating our innovation pipeline. We remain committed to our long-term growth strategies and we
recognize the need to continually refine our execution to drive improved performance. We firmly believe that
meaningful consumer focused innovation, excellence in brand building, and expansion into high-growth segments and
