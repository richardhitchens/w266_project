Well, thank you very much, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be part of the call on this historic
moment for our company. We've had a full week with many exciting developments. Greg will take you through the
quarter results in just a moment, but first let me start with an update on our major acquisitions and on our business

transformation strategy. Late last month, we closed on the IAE transaction and this morning, we received the final
regulatory approvals for the Goodrich acquisition. We anticipate closing later today or early tomorrow morning.
These are transformational deals for UTC, setting the stage for strong earnings momentum. IAE brings tremendous
after market runway with the V2500 which now represents Pratt & Whitney's largest install fleet. There are over 4,500
V2500 engines in service with an average age of only seven years and we expect to deliver another 3,000 engines in the
future. The IAE transaction further validates our game-changing GTF technology and strengthens our relationship with
nearly 200 airline customers around the world, ensuring a seamless transition from the V2500 to the GTF-fired
A320neo.
Turning to Goodrich, I'm very pleased we will close such a large transaction in just ten months with limited required
divestitures. Goodrich adds a very strong portfolio of complementary products and is a great fit with Hamilton
Sundstrand. Bringing these two companies together will significantly strengthen our position in the growing aerospace
segment and will allow us to develop more integrated systems for our customers and win greater content on
next-generation aircraft.
Since announcing the agreement, we have done significant integration planning, so we are ready to begin integrating
Goodrich into our propulsion and aerospace systems organization. A team of more than 50 employees has worked
relentlessly on integration planning, with hundreds of employees lending additional support. The leadership team is in
place and our extensive planning activities will make for a smooth transition for our customers, suppliers and
employees.
On large transactions, culture and people are key to success, and I'm very happy with everything I see at this point. We
have already identified all of the $400 million of run rate synergies that we expect to achieve by year five and
leadership is looking at more. I am confident that Alain and the team will identify additional synergies as they work
through the integration process.
We've completed the financing for Goodrich with a structure that was much better than originally expected. We issued
the largest U.S. corporate bond offering since 2009, $9.8 billion at an average interest rate of less than 3%. We listened
to our shareholders and reduced our original need for equity issuance from 4 billion down to 1.1 billion of mandatory
convertible units. We expect to pay down about one-third of the total purchase price by the end of 2012, using that
proceeds from previously announced divestitures and cash from operations.
We have made great progress on the divestitures. We reached agreement to sell both the Hamilton Sundstrand
Industrials business and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne this week. These are strong, profitable businesses, but we are
streamlining the UTC portfolio to focus on our core of commercial building systems and aerospace. In the second
quarter, we classified another non-core asset, our fuel cell business as held up for sale, and we continue to expect to
complete the divestiture of Clipper imminently.
As expected, during the regulatory process for Goodrich, we agreed to divest businesses totaling about $250 million of
annual sales, including Goodrich's Electric Power Systems business, Pumps & Engine Control business. These are
attractive businesses with great employees, so we expect a robust auction process. We also agreed to sell Goodrich
interest into the aero engine control original equipment joint venture to Rolls-Royce.
Let me sum up by saying great progress on transformational changes that will generate real long-term value for our
share owners. This team is executing in a superb way. Before I turn it over to Greg to take you through the second
quarter results, just a few comments on the year. It is certainly a challenging environment out there, with a slowing
global economy, the euro trading near 1.2 and the late July close for Goodrich. Therefore, we are re-baselining our
expectations for the year. We now expect sales of $58 billion to $59 billion, $3 billion lower than our prior expectation,
and earnings per share of $5.25 to $5.35 versus our prior expectation of $5.30 to $5.50, with FX and the late July close
of Goodrich accounting for about $0.15 of additional headwind.
Now, we know how to operate in a tough macroeconomic environment at UTC. And we are increasing our investment
in restructuring this year to $500 million, up from $450 million. As always, we'll remain focused on what we control in
the back half of the year: cost reduction, strong execution, investment in game-changing technology and the seamless

integration of Goodrich and IAE into the UTC portfolio.
With that, let me turn it over to Greg.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. Thanks, Louis. We're now on slide 2 on the webcast. As you saw in the press release this morning, second
quarter earnings per share was up 15% year-over-year to $1.62, and that included a benefit from a lower tax rate. Our
tax rate in the quarter came in at 22.5%, primarily due to the timing of some legal entity reorganizations. Before
one-timers, the tax rate contributed a $0.13 benefit versus our full-year expected tax rate of 29.5%.
In the quarter, we also faced $0.11 per share of headwind from higher pension costs, E&D investment and FX. But
despite these headwinds, segment operating margin expanded 80 basis points with Climate Controls & Security leading
the way with 230 basis points of margin expansion, evidence that we continue to focus on execution and cost control in
this difficult economic environment. UTC's organic sales growth of 1% reflects slowing sales in Europe China, and the
commercial aerospace aftermarket. There's clearly uncertainty out there. Europe continues to struggle with the debt
crisis with no clear solution in place. Most indicators now point to a very modest growth in the U.S. this year with a
looming fiscal cliff at the end of this year which could further dampen growth prospects for next year.
As we all know, China and India are also faced with slowing growth. China's recorded second quarter GDP slowed to
7.6%. That's still, of course, pretty strong, but the lowest level we've seen since early 2009. We do know the Chinese
government is taking steps to stimulate the economy, including a second interest rate cut. But the government remains
concerned about high property prices.
And despite this near-term slowdown, the urbanization trends and long-term fundamentals are still in place in the
emerging markets and especially in China and in the central and western provinces. We have confidence in the
long-term growth prospects of all these emerging markets. Against this economic backdrop, though, we are lowering
our second half growth expectations for Otis, CCS and Pratt & Whitney.
We're also lowering our expectations for the euro to a new U.S. dollar to euro rate of $1.20. This represents an
additional $135 million of earnings headwind to our original guidance where we pegged the euro at $1.35 to the dollar.
As Louis said, we continue to focus on what we control in the face of these challenges. So in the first half of the year,
we invested $204 million in restructuring with $93 million in the second quarter. The businesses continue to find a way
to reduce structural costs and we're once again taking up our estimate for restructuring for the year to $500 million
which will include Goodrich related actions. That's up $50 million from our previous guidance.
As a result of the headwinds and changes we've discussed, we now expect sales of $58 billion to $59 billion as Louis
said, with organic growth of 0% to 2% versus our prior expectation of organic growth of 2% to 4%. We expect
earnings per share of $5.25 to $5.35 and, of course, that's down from our previous guidance of $5.30 to $5.50.
This guidance includes $3.6 billion of sales and a net $0.30 EPS dilution from the Goodrich acquisition. That's lower
than our previous guidance of $4.5 billion of sales and $0.25 of net dilution respectively. These changes are simply due
to the late July close which is a month later than we originally built into our plan. So, still a lot of moving parts such as
accounting conformity and amortization around the Goodrich deal and we'll be back to update you if necessary later in
the quarter but we don't anticipate any big changes at this point.
On slide 3 now, a few more points on the quarter. Total sales were down 5% due to the impact of FX and net
divestitures. Of note, Hamilton Sundstrand delivered another strong quarter with
9% organic growth on strength in both commercial and military aerospace. Earnings per share of $1.62 included $0.10
of net one-time gains. That's from the ongoing transformation at CCS. That was more than offset $0.06 of restructuring.
Excluding restructuring and net one-time items in both years, EPS increased 13%. FX had a negative impact on the
quarter of $0.05. As you know, we completed most of the financing for the Goodrich acquisition in early June. Interest
expense and transaction costs related to the acquisition were $0.04 in the quarter. And free cash flow was 99% of net

income. UTC continues to deliver strong, consistent cash flow and we're confident we'll deliver free cash flow equal to
or in excess of net income for the year.
Now, order trends; I'm now on slide 4. As you can see, on this chart, CCS's North American residential HVAC were up
4% in the quarter which is in line with our full year expectations. At Otis, new equipment orders were down 4% at
constant currency including China which contracted 13%. But we did see improving trends late in the quarter as the
initiatives the Otis team implemented have started to gain traction. Pratt &Whitney's large commercial engine spare
orders were down 15% for the quarter and Hamilton Sundstrand's commercial spares were down 10%. Although RPMs
or revenue passenger miles are increasing and load factors remain high, airlines continue to conserve cash and limit
their spending on spares. Average sales per shop visit versus the prior year have dropped about $300,000 to $400,000
and we now expect Pratt & Whitney's commercial spares to be down about 10% organically this year versus our prior
expectation of 5% growth.
So a solid second quarter with good execution in the business and a tough macroeconomic environment. I'll come back
and talk a little bit more about the full year at the end, but let me turn it over to [ph] Jay (13:16) to take you through the
business unit results.
Unverified Participant
Thanks, Greg. Turning to page five. At Otis, operating profit was down 8% in the quarter on a 5% decline in sales with
foreign currency translation reducing both sales and profit growth by five percentage points. Operating margin was
22.7%, 70 basis points lower than prior year. At constant currency, new equipment sales were down low single-digit
with high single-digit sales growth in North America, more than offset by declines in Europe and China. Although
China new equipment sales were down low single-digit in the quarter, the rate of decline improved from the previous
quarter.
Overall service sales were up, led by growth in modernization and contractual maintenance. Aggressive cost reduction
actions partially offset the impact from higher commodity costs and continued pricing pressure, mostly in Europe. At
constant currency, new equipment orders were down 4% with North America up double-digits, Europe flattish and
China down 13%. Thanks to enhanced communication and brand awareness efforts in China, Otis is beginning to stem
the decline in new equipment orders and saw solid growth in June. A much weaker euro, combined with the continued
economic slowdown in Europe and soft new equipment volumes in China are putting pressure on Otis's profit growth.
For the year, we now expect Otis' sales to be down mid single-digit from up mid single-digit and profits to be down
$175 million to $225 million compared to the previous guidance of up $50 million to $75 million. This guidance
includes $175 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation versus $75 million previously, assuming a euro
average of $1.20 for the balance of year. Otis increased its restructuring efforts to reduce cost and continue making
structural changes to position the business for future profit growth.
On slide 6, UTC Climate, Controls and Security margins were up sharply to 15.7%, an increase of 230 basis points
from prior year, as profit increased 4% in the quarter on 11% lower sales. Organic sales were flat, following 9% growth
in the second quarter of last year. Organic growth was up mid single-digit in each of the Americas' residential and
commercial HVAC businesses and flattish in Europe, Asia and the automation and controls businesses. Transicold was
down double-digits organically.
Profit growth was driven by restructuring and productivity, including savings from the consolidation of Carrier and fire
and security. Global commercial HVAC orders were up mid single-digit overall, but down low double-digits in Europe.
Transicold orders were down around 25% and global fire and security products were down low single-digit.
While CCS first half earnings were in line with expectations, full-year guidance is being revised to growth of about
$150 million from up $225 million to reflect increased FX headwind and weaker organic growth of around 2% due to
softer end markets. When combined with the impact of divestitures and FX headwind, we expect reported sales to be
down about 7%. Margin expansion will be strong, up about 180 basis points from productivity, cost reduction, and the

benefit from portfolio transformation.
Turning to aerospace, on Slide 7; at Pratt & Whitney sales were up 5% in the second quarter, including one point of
unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada. Higher sales were driven by growth in the military and Pratt Canada businesses,
partially offset by lower commercial aftermarket and lower industrial shipments at power systems. Large commercial
spares were down 13% year-over-year, including the benefit from sales to third-party aftermarket parts companies.
Operating profit in the quarter was down 1%. Higher E&D, pension costs and lower commercial spares were partially
offset by the benefit of higher military and Pratt Canada sales, restructuring savings and a gain from the sale of equity
position in a commercial aftermarket venture of about $0.02 per share.
Commercial spares book-to-bill for the quarter was slightly below one. As Greg stated, Pratt's conversation at airlines
has impacted order rates and we now expect commercial spares to be down 10% organically versus up mid single-digits
previously. As a result of a lower commercial spares outlook, Pratt's operating profit is now likely to be down $100
million to $125 million for the year as compared with down $25 million to $50 million previously. We now expect
sales to be up mid single-digit versus prior expectations of up high single-digit.
Hamilton Sundstrand delivered a solid quarter with profit growth of 14% on 7% higher sales. OEM sales were up mid
teens while aftermarket was flattish. Profit growth in the quarter was driven by strong conversion on OEM growth and
favorable mix. Operating margin was up 110 basis points year-over-year to 17.1%. Overall, commercial spare sales
orders were down 10% year-over-year with declines in both parts and provisioning. Book-to-bill was below one.
For the full year, we continue to expect operating profit for the base business to be up $75 million to $100 million and
sales up high single-digit. We will provide an update later in the year on total UTC aerospace systems guidance.
Turning to Sikorsky on slide 9. Operating profit grew 5%, on 9% lower sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a
total of 51 aircraft; 44 aircraft were based on military platforms and seven commercial. Lower sales were driven by 19
fewer aircraft deliveries, primarily lower U.S. government and international military deliveries.
Mid teens growth in aftermarket sales, partially offset the impact of lower aircraft volumes. On profit, strong
performance in aftermarket, favorable mix of commercial aircraft deliveries, including the absence of one Canadian
maritime helicopter, offset the impact of the lower military aircraft deliveries. Productivity and restructuring benefits
across the enterprise also contributed towards a second quarter operating profit growth. For the full year, we continue to
expect profit growth of $50 million to $75 million on a mid-single-digit sales decline.
With that, let me turn it back to Greg.
Gregory J. Hayes
Thanks, Jay. As I said earlier, these are really solid results in a very, very tough economic environment. Let me just talk
about a few highlights in the quarter, just to add to some of the other things we've already talked about. Pratt &Whitney
secured an additional 410 orders for our GTF engine family at the Farnborough Airshow, including a SkyWest order
for 20 Mitsubishi regional jet engines. And we now have over 2,900 firm and options engine orders across the four
GTF platforms. We've also completed over 3,000 hours of testing and concluded the flight test program for both the
Cseries and MRJ engine. We continue to expect the Cseries engine will achieve certification in the fourth quarter of
this year.
Sikorsky signed the multiyear eight contract in early July with the U.S. government. The contract calls for the
production of approximately 650 BLACK HAWK and SEAHAWK helicopters, including foreign military sales, and is
valued at about $8.5 billion through 2017. On the commercial side of the business, Geraud and the team are progressing
well with the integration of our new CCS organization. The combined impact of portfolio and operational
transformation, along with the synergies from the integration, contributed to a record operating margin of 15.7% in the
second quarter.

As far as the 2012 outlook, as we mentioned before, we're going to see earnings this year somewhere between $5.25
and $5.35 on sales of $58 billion to $59 billion. As for other elements of the guidance, while the timing of certain
transactions reduced the effective tax rate in the first half of the year, we continue to expect an operational tax rate of
29.5%, for the base business for the full year 2012. And what that means is in the third and fourth quarter we'll see an
effective tax rate of about 32%. As I mentioned, we expect to invest about $500 million in restructuring, including
Goodrich and that will be more than offset by about $600 million of gains and other one-time items.
We'll come back and update you once very have more access to Goodrich including our expectations for the new
United Technologies Aerospace Systems segment. And with that, let's stop and open up the call for questions.
Stephanie?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Greg, could you just – going up to 30,000 feet here, take us maybe on a – from a walk from
your old EPS guidance to your new? Middle of the range you've gone from $5.40 to $5.30, but the operational things
you're laying out there, it looks like around $400 million of pressure in the segments, and then the higher restructuring
looks like a bigger impact. So could you give us a bridge and then where you are in terms of a contingency at your new
number?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. Okay, Joe, it's – there are a lot of moving pieces here so I'll try and go through this as
succinctly as possible. So you think about, we had a prior guidance at $5.40 and that included a contingency of about
$200 million or $0.15. As we look what have happened in the businesses, we've taken about $0.20 of operating
segment operating profit away. About half of that's at Otis as we've reduced new equipment and service sales down
about $600 million in sales. The other half of the operational down – downward pressure is at Pratt and CCS.
Pratt's down about $0.06 and CCS down about $0.04. This is just the operational piece. The next piece, of course, is FX
which is another $0.10 of the – of the takedown. On top of that, now, you add in Goodrich, about a $0.05 impact from
the one-month delay in closing, about $0.04 from additional reinstruction. We also picked up about $0.04 as we moved
UT power to discontinued ops.
We pick up another $0.10 with eliminations in other and some minority interest changes down below the line. So we've
used up the contingency. And at the midpoint of the new guidance I would say we don't have any contingency. That's
why we really have the lower end at $5.25. Now, we think again, we've properly calibrated each of the businesses with
these new – these new guides, but there still is risk out there in the back half of the year. Yeah, and again, I think – I
think we've also been conservative on the euro at $1.20. I know it's at $1.22, $1.23 today, hopefully we'll get some lift
out of that which might add some contingency but it's a little early to tell.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Could you walk through what the pluses are, the $0.04 and the $0.10 because that's where I
was really getting at was, what's kind of offsetting all this other pressure?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. So if you think about CCS, we're taking sales down about $400 million operationally
and earnings down about $100 million. You've got a benefit, though, offsetting that of about $50 million related to
commodities and, really, that's just a takedown in sales of in Asia where we used to think we'd see about high-single
digit growth, now it's mid-single digit [indiscernible] (25:23) because of the orders rates we've seen in the second
quarter has gone from down high-single digits to probably down near 10% and the F&S product lines are going to be
up low single from mid single.

So add all that, you get about $400 million of takedown in sales and $100 million of EBIT and then there's $50 million
of offset for net commodities. On the Pratt side, it's a little bit more complicated but really it's about – spares are going
to be down about $350 million from what we previously estimated. There's a couple – and on top of that, service will
be down a little bit so Pratt's sales will actually be down about $500 million and there's about $200 million of earnings
associated with that. Offsetting that, you've got restructuring savings of about $25 million; IAE will add about $50
million. It's better than what we had expected, just because of some of the timings, and also E&D will be down about
$50 million as some of these programs have moved to the right; so, net-net about $75 million of takedown at Pratt and
about $50 million of takedown at CCS.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. That's helpful. Just second question, just digging into Otis, the margins improved a bit
and some of the trends improved a bit sequentially from Q1 to Q2. What's – as we look towards the rest of the year and
you know, the margin pressure we really saw in Q1, do you feel like you've really gotten your arms around the pricing
pressure you were facing in Europe? I don't know if it was labor inflation played a role in the service business. What
can we expect there going forward?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: So, yeah. On top of just the overall weakness that we've seen in sales, we have – we are
seeing some continued pricing pressure. If you think about the margin, it was down 70 basis points in the second
quarter after being down 100 basis points in the first quarter. About 30 basis points of that takedown was related to
pricing, another 40 was – basis points was related to commodities, mostly rare earth.
Going forward in the back half of the year, we've got about $75 million of additional headwind from pricing in the
current guidance. So on top of sales being down about $500 million, you've got another $75 million of bad news from
pricing. And commodities give you a little bit of a benefit, restructuring gives you a little bit of benefit, but overall,
you're going to be down somewhere around $260 million or so for previous guidance with FX of $100 million.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck. You're busy.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: We're busy. Thanks, Joe.
Operator
Our next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. Your Carrier and old fire and security business delivered terrific
numbers in the quarter, Greg. Could you for a moment sort of talk about some of the successes that Geraud has been
able to accomplish? It looks like some of them are coming through a little quicker than I would have anticipated.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think the integration of the CCS – I'm sorry, of CCS between Carrier and fire security is
going probably better than what we had originally anticipated. It's really just attributed to Geraud and the team. They've
been able to take out a lot more cost a lot more quickly than what we'd anticipated. But I think more importantly
they've been able to stabilize some of the other businesses at F&S where we saw issues last year, especially in Europe.
We're not getting much traction on the top line with the F&S businesses but the bottom line is getting better as there's
more discipline around pricing, more discipline around the contracts that we're taking. So a lot of the bad news that we
saw last year, bad news surprises coming out of the UK for instance; again, sales aren't up in the UK but profits are
now in the legacy – F&S business just because of the discipline I think that Geraud and the management team has
brought to the pricing process there.
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: Maybe, Howard, if I could add, I think we're seeing the benefits of a very seasoned team
that did profound transformation at Carrier before that's exercising their leadership skills with the F&S business and,
you know, like the backlog in the UK is getting much better, I mean, much better margin on that backlog as we go
forward, so Geraud is doing a superb job at leveraging all the best practices and implementing quickly across the board
and he knows how to do transformation and he's executing very well.

<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then just one follow-up on – I can't resist, on Sikorsky a little bit and talk a little bit
about the Canadian maritime helicopter. Sorry to do that, but it does look like it slipped again to the right, and how are
you sort of accommodating, or coming up with a solution that will maybe help out your numbers?
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: Well, let me take that, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you.
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: First of all, the CMH program, I have to say, is the best maritime helicopter in the world,
and it's basically ready to fly and we've made incredible progress. We're also working very closely with the customer to
make sure that they get the product they're looking for, that it's a win-win. And I would say Mick Maurer and the team
at Sikorsky are aggressively working on making sure we deliver these helicopters and minimizing the impact on the
business.
Now, what's very encouraging, just a heads up, as we saw some high interest at the Farnborough Airshow this year, this
is the second air show – Paris was the same last year – we saw outside customers show interest in the platform as is and
we saw this interest renewed again this year by a couple countries, and in my view, while it's been a painful experience
to this point, as we move forward and deliver these 28 helicopters, in my view there's potential to deliver basically
many, many new helicopters of the same configuration that we've now developed, we have.
And it's all with working with the Canadian government now to make sure that we close on all the issues. So you need
both parties, basically, to agree on tackling the issues and I would say we're making substantial progress. Obviously
there's been some key deadlines that we had hoped to meet and basically, at this point in time, both sides are working to
make sure they ultimately get the he helicopter that they badly need to replace their aging fleet.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Just as a follow-up to Louie's comments, we are still – we have in the forecast this year for
Sikorsky to submit five CMH. Right now, as Louis said, we're still negotiating with the Canadians around the final
configuration of what those aircraft are going to be and we still plan to ship those five this year but obviously if those
slip into next year, it gives us a little more headwind.
I think there's nothing to do in terms of next year's issue around delivering the 19 helicopters financially until we
resolve the contractual and configuration issues but we clearly have an eye towards that, Howard, to see what we can to
help offset some of that – what will be a pretty big headwind at Sikorsky next year.
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: Just to close on this, Howard, we have, I think, a path to success that's developing and in
the upcoming webcast in the month of September we should be able to give better color and update as to the progress
we are making there.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you. Thank you both, gentlemen, and I hope you get a little sleep.

facilities consolidation? What actions are taking place there?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: We talk a lot about CCS and the carrier portfolio rationalization or reorganization that
Geraud and team have been undertaking in the last few years, and some of that same magic, I think you see that
happening with the F&S portfolio. We did divest a couple of F&S businesses in the quarter which helped margin a little
bit. But I think more importantly at Carrier, CCS has been the operational transformation, what they've been able to do
in the factories, continuing to implement the ACE operating systems, taking overhead out. We've talked about what –
the great work they've done in Collierville, Tennessee with the lines there to reduce overhead, the breakeven point in
the factory.
But also, think about all the restructuring that's been done. We've moved a lot of work down to Monterey, and that's
been very, very successful transforming the commercial product lines. We've investing a lot in R&D. Again I think
we've got better products today, much more energy efficient and we're getting good pricing in the market for these new
products. So, I say it's a combination of portfolio, cost discipline, factory performance and product investment.
All those things together have really contributed to this margin expansion that we're seeing. And again, for the full
year, I think [ph] Jay (35:00) mentioned it earlier, we're probably going to get 180 points of margin expansion, and then
you're going to be talking about close to 14% margins this year which was Geraud's goal for a year from now. So again,
I think they're making great progress and doing it a lot faster than any of us anticipated.
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: And remember, the skill set was much more advanced at Carrier on the ACE disciplined
supply chain development and by creating CCS, they've been able to leverage that skill set into what's the old fire and
security that was really the last one to make progress on ACE and supply chain, so we've kind of jump started these
initiative and we're seeing the good impact of the leadership being focused but also having done it before.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Well, if I think back a few years ago, George David often talked about a goal of 15%
margins at Carrier, and that seemed far off. I mean, are you – is that a possibility here in the reasonable future?
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: Well, as you know, it's my job always to stretch with big goals and impose on the BUs,
basically stretch targets and then they happily go deliver. And that culture is untouched at UTC. That's the way I run
the business. And I think we're well on track with proving basically that we're going to deliver on these big goals.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think what you maybe – might think of, Doug, is from a top line standpoint, Geraud and
team are going to deliver what are going to be close to 14% margins on organic growth of only about 2% this year. I
think once we start to see some traction in the end markets, I think obviously there's got to be upside. And Carrier
demonstrated that back in 2010 when the markets came back and we got great operating leverage. So again, I think
there is runway here at the end of the day.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay, great. Thank you.

<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Wondering on a couple things on Goodrich. How much of the incremental restructuring is at
Goodrich, and does the timing change or business trends that you're seeing in aero aftermarket kind of change your
view on what the accretion outlook is for 2013?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No. I think, again, as we look at the combined Hamilton Goodrich businesses, we're really
pretty much on track to what we had expected for the full year this year and nothing really out there that would tell us
that there's going to be any big impact or longer term impact on the commercial aftermarket. I think Goodrich second

quarter, their aftermarket was up a little bit which is better than what we even saw at Hamilton. So financially I don't
see an issue there.
The restructuring, it's about $150 million roughly of restructuring we'll do this year and that's some at the legacy
Goodrich and some at the legacy Hamilton businesses. So, as we combine the headquarters down in Charlotte, there'll
be some costs we'll be incurring up here in Connecticut. We're also, of course, looking at some rationalization. We'll
take out the public company costs and all that. But I think Alain and the team have a clear line of sight to the $150
million this year and there will be more next year as we get into this.
But I think the accretion number that we laid out which is $0.50 to $0.55 next year from the Goodrich acquisition is
still right about what we expected it. And, again, if you think about interest costs are a little bit better. Obviously you
don't have an issue – a lot less equity makes that number a little bit better as well. So we're really on track, I think,
financially on the Goodrich transaction as we enter day one year.
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: And maybe to add to everything I thought this deal was, when I announced it last
September, I would say is all of that or better today. I mean, the talent that's in there, the opportunities, the synergies,
the customer response, the partner response, all good. So I'm very, very happy with closing such a large transaction in
such a short period, and everything we mapped out up front got better.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And I was wondering – just changing gears in the second question, you know, the comment on
Otis, June, China looked better, maybe not trying to overanalyze a month, but do you, in fact, kind of see and feel a real
inflection in just the tone of business there, whether it's what's going on competitively or how the government relations
and like are playing out, and what do you think about the back half? Obviously you gave your guidance but just the
commercial success of Otis looking into the back half.
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: Well, first of all, Otis is a very strong franchise, as you know, with great brand recognition
and I would say the profound changes we've done in China as far as leadership structure, reporting line, have had a
good impact with the customer base and with the results, certainly as we went through the second quarter. We made a
change with the President of Otis China now reporting to the President of Otis Pedro Baranda.
We also created a business development office that's now located in Shanghai. And, remember, about a year ago we'd
announced also the high-rise Center of Excellence was now in Shanghai, so there's a great team now in China that's
complete that is driving momentum with the dealers, driving momentum with – we adjusted the price, as we declared
earlier, to reflect the realities of the competitive landscape. That's after the rare earth increase we did last year. And,
obviously, as the months have gone by, we're starting to see that the penalty that was in front of us with government
opportunities has disappeared. And basically we are now bidding on the opportunities like the [ph] next tranche Beijing
metro (41:03), et cetera.
So, I would say Pedro and the team – Pedro's been to China twice in the last six weeks. I'm going to be with him at the
September Chongqing's mayor's conference. We're going to be opening the new factory in Chongqing that is going to
be serving the central and west region. As you know, there's also been a big shift in mix from the basically traditional
mix to more low-cost housing where perhaps Otis had a bit of weakness but now with the new factory, with the new
product line and everything we've put in place, basically we feel very good that we have a guidance that Pedro can
achieve going forward, and, more importantly, has resumed our share position in that market.
I think it's all coming together. And, as a matter of fact, as we said, it's one month, but I would say we continued to see
similar momentum. June was a record month of sales for Otis and China following a couple of very difficult months.
July is off to a reasonable start. So, I mean, it's early in Q3 and I'm not going to give details. But I would say everything
we've done as we monitor, and I'll be there personally later on in September, I would say it's coming together and Otis
is a strong franchise and will deliver on its promises to its customers and shareholders.

Our next question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Carter.
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: Good morning.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a quick question on the aftermarket. Greg, I wondered if you might speak to differences
in trends you might be seeing in wide body versus narrow body or even in spares versus MRO at Pratt.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I think it's very platform-specific, as we look at the Pratt issues in the aftermarket. I
think what we have seen is actually shop visits are now look to be coming down in the back half of the year from what
we expected. And that's really primarily related to some of the actions that Delta and some of the others are taking on
the legacy 757 fleet, where we're seeing planes parked and then engines parted out. So, again, I think as airlines are
very focused on cost containment, the 757 fleet, obviously, it's Pratt-powered primarily, we're seeing a bigger impact
from that.
The other piece that I guess catches us a little by surprise but probably shouldn't have, is on the V2500. Again, to Louis'
point, we've got 4,500 engines out there in service today. About five years ago, we put in an upgrade called the Select
Program, and that's actually extended the time on wing about 2,000 to 3,000 hours. So, some of the V2500 overhauls
that we had expected this year are getting pushed into next year. So, it's not just one thing.
I think you've got a few retirements of 757s, you've got better on-wing performance on the Vs and then you've got the
4000, which, again, we did a lot of work a couple of years ago and they are also staying on-wing longer. So cash
conservation by the airlines, better on-wing performance and some retirements. All that kind of added up to what we
see for the aftermarket this year at Pratt now.
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: And, Carter, a little other comment, which is showing the signs of the airline are cautious
is the shop content per visit perhaps reflects some of that. They don't put the full content that we would expect them to
put, which means there's going to be a shop visit sooner in the future because of that. And, overall, I'm very pleased, as
you know, with the IAE transaction. Why it doesn't get the spotlight, I think, as much as it should; it's a huge
transformational deal. It's a large install base for Pratt with a big backlog. And those planes are flying. It's a young fleet,
it's going to be around for a long time. And I think that has a very positive impact on Pratt aftermarket business for a
long time to come.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Great. And just as a second question, like Jeff, I don't want to get too hung up on single
months, but you called out that the residential HVAC orders were up 4%. How did that trend over the quarter? And can
you speak to what you're seeing in June?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: June or July?
<Q - Carter Copeland>: July, excuse me.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Because June is easier to speak to.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Maybe I need some sleep, too.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. No, I think as you think about it, this has been a very lumpy year on the resi side here
in the U.S. We started out and had a very slow first two months of the year and then a very, very strong March. We
ended March with great momentum, we saw orders up. And then it slowed down again in April, slowed down in May.
And then with all of the heat across the U.S., we had a very, very strong June, and that continued into the first part of
July here; not surprising when you look at the temperatures across the U.S. We've had a very, very good cooling season

from that respect.
So, again, I think we're still expecting kind of 4% to 5% growth in the res for the year. Could it be better? I think it'll
depend really upon the weather and the restocking. Right now, channel inventories look to be about normal for this
time of year. We're seeing good sell-through from distribution. So I think there might be upside, but it's really too early
to call. And I think we're properly calibrated on that.
And the other thing, of course, you've got to remember we still have a heating season in front of us. Like last year at the
legacy Carrier business, there really was no heating business because of the very, very warm weather we had
throughout the fall and early winter last year. So too early to call, but I'd say right now we're cautiously optimistic on
the market for the year.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Great. Thank you for the color, guys.

Our next question comes from Terry Darling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Thanks. Just probably a couple follow-ups here. First on the aftermarket, wondering from a
timing perspective, a number of the items that you've called out here sort of seem transient in nature but could continue
for a couple of quarters, obviously, reflected in your guidance. Thinking about 2013, do you see a bounceback there? Is
it just purely contingent on where the demand in the market is? Or how do you think about aftermarket growth as you
move into 2013?
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: Hey, Terry. I guess it's way too early to give guidance on 2013, but let me just give you
maybe a bit of color. Our goal is to grow earnings double-digit year-after-year, and you know the formula. It's probably
a third organic growth, it's a third margin expansion, and I think the track record of this team on margin expansion
speaks for itself, and then the other third is how we deploy capital. So, there's no doubt that with the changes we've
done, with the transformation I positioned, we have some good momentum and we will expect solid accretion from the
Goodrich and IAE transaction next year.
And I think the game plan is in place. We're working to mitigate some of the headwinds, like CMH. But at the same
time, we have a great backlog. For example, on S-92, the backlog is at a record of $1.4 billion. So there's a lot of
moving parts. This team is enthused, energized. And stay tuned and I think we'll deliver UTC-style results as we go
forward.
<Q - Terry Darling>: I guess – go ahead, Greg.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I was just going to say I'd just add in terms of the aftermarket, one of the things that
obviously drives airline behavior is oil prices. We have seen oil prices come down about 20% in the last three months.
That takes about six months to find its way through in terms of ordering patterns at the airlines. The shop business,
which we're light, we saw this back in 2010. Louis has always talked about the wall of spares, and spares over time are
going to be there. I think it's just a question of timing.
So, I can't tell you whether that's third or fourth quarter this year. Obviously, we think it's not going to happen. We'll
see it at some point, but it is, to Louis' point, way too early to think about what spares outlook is going to look like. The
world's pretty dynamic given everything that's going on. But, again, I think airlines are flying, flying the planes full,
we've got a big fleet of V2500s out there, we've got a good fleet of legacy Pratt products. So, spares will come back. I
think it's just a matter of timing, to your first point.
<Q - Terry Darling>: And I appreciate we are a long way away from 2013 guidance but, Louis, it doesn't sound like
you see anything out there with regards to the ability to grow double-digit at this point that you'd want to highlight for
us. I guess the question is, in that context, one-third from capital allocation, are you thinking that Goodrich accretion in

that mix, in other words, do you think that organically double-digit growth is possible?
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: Well, you heard what I said before and it's way too early to give guidance. But this is the
culture of this company to drive double-digit earnings growth and that's what we're focused on. I think we have the
pieces coming together. Stay tuned.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Okay. And then maybe just lastly, non-res construction in the U.S. doesn't sound like you've
really changed your outlook there; a bunch of data points on both the positive and the negative side from other players.
How are you seeing that market at this point in and around that mid-single digit longer-term outlook?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It's surprisingly strong. And I think, again, to some of the earlier discussion, it's really –
we're still seeing the benefit from new product introduction and this push towards energy efficiency. So while there
isn't much new construction going on, there remains a very robust retrofit market. And I think with the line of products
that Carrier has in terms of the very, very energy-efficient chillers, they're gaining traction in that market, and that's
really what I would attribute the results this quarter and our outlook for the year to.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Morning, Myles.
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: Morning.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: First one, just clarification on net proceeds from the divestitures now that you've
kind of come to consummation on the major ones, is it still net about $3 billion, or plus or minus?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, it'll probably be $3 billion plus. Again, I think we've still got a couple of pieces to go
here yet. I think Louis mentioned we're very, very close on the Clipper divestiture. I think you'll see that in the next
couple days, couple weeks. But net, net, I think that $3 billion plus is still a very good number. That's, of course, after
tax. There is a little bit of tax leakage on the industrials.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: And then the real question is on cash flow for the year. Just looking at the generation
you had in the first half which was great, and looking at the second half, which should have an absence of pension
contributions that have been there in prior years, I'm just at a loss as to why cash won't be as good if not better than –
significantly better than the last couple of years' back halves because of the absence of that pension contribution.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: We're not going to change the guidance on cash flow, but let me tell you, I...
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: I thought you said better or equal.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, cash flow is going to be very strong in the back half and, to your point, there's no cash
pension contributions. You also have the benefit in the back half of the year of the Goodrich amortization as we write
up some of their inventory and other assets and take some charges or – some amortization charges.
So cash will be very strong in the back half of the year and I think once we get the Goodrich deal consummated later
today, we'll come back in September, whether Louis or one of us, will probably update you on cash flow and I would
expect it to be better than what we're currently guiding to.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: You mentioned the one-third of the deal price would be paid for from the assets or
the divestitures plus cash from the cash flow. What's the pro forma cash position at the consummation?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: We've got about $6 billion of cash on the balance sheet today and I think there's -we've got
another $16 billion of restricted cash out there which will go to pay off the owners. What we're really going to do is
we've got – you'll close most of these deals at the end of the year.
I think debt-to-cap at the end of the year will go down to about 48% and will continue to pay down even into next year.
But I think, again, there's plenty of cash both from Goodrich operations as well as the UTC operations this year. We've
got some cash on the balance sheet. I think paying down a third of this this year is not going to be an issue, even with
Rocketdyne closing probably early next year as opposed to late this year.

<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Just wanted to just get a quick update on how it's going with the GTF, where we are in the
development program and – because you've got multiple engines, right, for multiple platforms, and maybe Louis could
talk about that. What's going on with the GTF?
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: Well, first of all, we're very happy with the traction of GTF in the market. And at this
point in time, what we have seen is that the engine development is coming together nicely. All the advanced
engineering we did and the technology readiness is paying off with I would say better than expected first-time tests for
all the engines. We've got about – I think it's 3,000 hours. We have even more cycles.
We just did two very important tests. We did the flocking bird test on the GTF which is the five one and a half pound
bird and one two and a half pound bird, and we passed that with flying colors, maintained the performance required.
We also did the large bird test. Those are all the new FAA-required testing and that is basically passed very well, the
large bird test. So there's only one test left, which is the blade-out test.
All our modeling suggests we're on track. We're geared up to deliver this engine at the end of the year for the
Bombardier application and every program behind. I would say, I always challenge the team because this program has
gone remarkably well. And all the expertise we have in Pratt has come together to deliver what's been so far a very
flawless program execution. So we're buttoned up, lined up on all the different platforms. Everything is on track, and
you see it through the R&D investment. Obviously, it's a very intense period for R&D. And my commitment earlier
was that 2012 was going to be the peak on R&D, and I would say that Dave and the team are holding to that
commitment that 2012 will be the peak on R&D.
So everything is on track. And I would say the customers as we've won the different competition, the customers truly
value the technology advantage of GTF and, not only fuel burn, but noise reduction, emissions reduction. And they feel
very comfortable that our engine is coming together and we'll deliver on the promises. And every transaction I would
say that Dave and the team have done, I have reviewed them with Greg and we're proud of the wins we got. We won on
the merits of our technology of the platform and it's going very well.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Now, maybe just one follow-on onto that. So far, everything's narrow body. How should we
think about the potential investment in whatever, a 90,000 pound thrust-class engine for a wide body? Is this
technology that can be moved up to this level? Is the company thinking about that?
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: Well, I think what we have found out with the GTF architecture now is that it's also
scalable. And I think there's no doubt that the Pratt team has had discussions with some of the key players in the market

that see the value of the technology, but you can expect that obviously the operating discipline and the UTC discipline
on program will apply. All of this has to come together where it makes sense for the customers and the shareholders.
And obviously, even the GTF, we have big partner content.
The partners have been superb, by the way, whether it's the Japanese or MTU. And there's big appetite. As people see
the success of our platform, there's big appetite to take on basically the portion of the program as a partner. And then
that's something that's a big change over the last couple years as people recognize we have a superior technology
advantage in the market.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Your line is open.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes, good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Morning, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Louis, a kind of a long-term question. If I go back and look at Otis' history, you had one
year of downturn, the last time being in 1997 and the time before that in 1990, and then following that a sharp snap
back to record profits. My question is the difference is you only made 10% margins, and you're making over 20%
today. So what is the risk to any steady margin degradation at Otis that would make this time kind of look different
than the two downturns we saw before?
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: I've said that before as far as Otis' margin, there's no doubt Otis has a 20% plus return
business. And I think nothing has changed. Obviously we had a soft patch in China over the last couple months. I
explained earlier on the queue that I think we have taken the right measures from a leadership structure, from action
with the dealers, and it's starting to recover. I have high confidence in Otis' future results.
I also remind you that a big portion of the results always come from the aftermarket piece which is paramount to Otis'
base success, and that – the install base has grown, by the way. It continues to be a huge opportunity, and Pedro's hired
recently, 600 new mechanics that we are training to deliver the highest value service to our customers. The unexplored
territory is still the China aftermarket and I would say we're all over it at this point in time with the change of
leadership we've done. Those guys are in the same time zone. They're there every day. They know the market.
The nice thing about Otis is we're 95% localized. We're in China. We're also local leadership that understands the
dynamic of our market, and I think the changes we did allow them to make decision on the spot. And I think that's
going to start to create lot of good momentum for aftermarket. So I think there's always plus and minuses. But nothing
has changed as far as the fundamental of Otis being the leader in its segment. As you said before, there's been glitches
before. We had another one. But I think Pedro's leadership is making a huge difference.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: I guess the thing I'm concerned about is the aftermarket, I'm sure, has been a big part of
why the margins have gotten so high, and now you're talking about the pricing pressure. I mean, is that – it would seem
to be self limiting, but can you provide some more color on how much down that might take the margins?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, look, I – George, I think the issue here is the aftermarket is very profitable, but we also
make money on the OE side through all the factory cost reductions. And it's really been the balance between OE and
the aftermarket that's been the success story of Otis over the last seven or eight years, as they've driven these margins
up. So we've got this huge installed aftermarket – or installed base of about 1.8 million elevators that we service around
the world.
But we also make money on the OE side, because we've been able to leverage the global scale of Otis. And even with
sales, which really haven't gone anywhere in three years, the margins have remained very strong, north of 20%. And I
think if we get a little bit of growth, you're going to see the margins even improve further at Otis. So I'm not worried

about a big long-term downturn in Otis margins. I think they have a focus on cost in everything that they do. They
leverage global scale better than any other business that I'm aware of, and they've got their eye squarely on the goal of
maintaining this industry leading margin.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. Thanks. History would certainly support that but I just figured I'd ask you the
question.
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: Thank you, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Thanks.

Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning. First question was just in CCS. Was that $112 million of favorable
adjustments expected when you gave your original year-over-year changes?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, it was.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. And then, secondly, related to George's question just on Otis, you've highlighted I
guess three different things in terms of the pricing issue, the brand issue, and then the actual high end residential pieces
in China, and then I guess some of the pricing pressure in services in Europe. Can you just talk about what your
assumptions are as you go through the remainder of the year in those different buckets? And really is there any reason
to think those trends continue into next year as well? Just trying to think about how much we can see Otis growing into
the future periods.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I think if you think about new equipment, we now think on a constant currency basis,
sales will probably be flat for the year and service is only going to be up about two points. I think there is opportunity,
obviously, beyond that. And I think one of the focus that Pedro and team have is re-igniting top line growth. Flat sales
with China down is still pretty good I think, and as China recovers, as the property market there recovers, there is
upside in those markets.
There's still long-term growth prospects in all these emerging markets. We talk about the 600 cities that are out there by
2025 that will have more than three million people in. Those are big opportunities for Otis in the next 15 years and I
think we're well positioned to capitalize on that. So – look, it's a tough year this year. It's really a tough year because of
the situation in Europe and some of the missteps we've had in China.
To Louis' point, we've I think corrected those missteps in China. We're getting traction there, we'll recover our share,
and Europe will get better eventually, whether that happens this year, next year, who knows, but I think we've got high
confidence in Pedro and the team in terms of driving top line growth, which we really haven't seen in three years.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: And just a final question, just on Goodrich, once it closes, really when will you be in a better
position to talk about how we should think about the accretion into next year, the restructuring opportunities once you
can get your hands on the books? Is that something September, October or is it going to wait until the December typical
guidance?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No, I think we'll have a pretty good handle on September. We've got a couple of webcasts.
Louis' got one, I've got one and then we're going to have a – host a half-day session up in Montreal at the end of
September with all of the business units, and at that point, I think Alain and team will be prepared to talk about next
year, but I think we still feel good about that $0.50 to $0.55 that we've laid out for Goodrich accretion next year and I
don't think we've seen anything that would indicate that that's going to be off by any order of magnitude. But again by –
I think by the end of September, we'll have our arms clearly around that.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Thank you.

Our final question comes from Deane Dray from Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Deane.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Hey, just want to make sure I've calibrated it correctly on the guidance change, and so it's
$500 million of restructuring and $600 million in gains. Does that mean $100 million will be falling through to EPS?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, we've really got $100 million out there that could fall through to EPS. Obviously if we
decide to spend that on restructuring, that would take you from that mid-point down to the lower end of the guidance
range, but right now we're keeping that $100 million as kind of our back-pocket contingency.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Do you have a backlog of restructuring that you could implement and what would trigger
you to add – because we're seeing a number of companies this quarter increasing restructuring pretty aggressively
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, we've done – by the end of this year we'll have done $2.5 billion of restructuring in the
last 3.5 years so it always amazes me that the units come up with new and good payback ideas. So right now that $500
million that we have is fully subscribed, and as we get closer towards 2013 and we kind of understand where the
markets are going, there may be further call for additional restructuring.
But, again, I think the guys have been pretty aggressive in taking out structural cost to deal with the markets and that's
why the margins are up this quarter, just continued cost takeout and that's the formula. Until markets recover, we're
going to focus on costs and restructuring and do what we do best.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: And anything else on the divestiture side? We know Clipper's soon to have an
announcement, fuel cell and then these required Goodrich divestitures. Anything else that you're contemplating?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, we're always looking at the portfolio, Deane, but I would think these are probably the
biggest pieces. But as the year goes on, I think we'd like to get a lot of the – any of the clean-up of the portfolio behind
us. So I'd say we're never done but we're certainly getting close to done.
<A - Louis R. Chênevert>: But the big elements of transformation will wrap up this year. It's that simple, that's why
we leave it.
Louis R. Chênevert
Well, thanks, everyone. The UTC strategy is delivering top line growth through innovative products. Global market
REITs are solidly in place. We'll keep investing in our game-changing technologies in emerging markets and we
always maintain our focus on cost reduction and productivity through the ACE operating system. As end markets
recover, we'll capitalize on our operating leverage and deliver solid earnings growth. We'll continue to generate strong
sustainable cash flow and effectively deploy that cash through dividend, share repurchase and M&A.
Goodrich and IAE transactions are historic transformational changes to the UTC portfolio that I am proud of and
confident will generate superior shareholder value for years to come. Thank you for listening, and we look forward to
updating you on even more progress at the upcoming webcast through September. Thank you very much.
Gregory J. Hayes
Thanks, everyone.
