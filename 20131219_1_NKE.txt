MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NIKE's Fiscal 2014 Second Quarter Conference Call. For those who need
to reference today's press release you'll find it at http://investors.nikeinc.com. Leading today's call is Kelley Hall, Vice
President-Treasury and Investor Relations.
Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking
statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC
including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q.
Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues
for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations,
discounts and returns which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.
In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including
equipment; NIKE Golf, Converse, and Hurley are not included in these future numbers.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures including references to wholesale equivalent sales.
References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market
footprint at the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results.
Participants may also make references to other non-public financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial
measures. Discussion of non-public financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP
measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at NIKE's website, http://investors.nikeinc.com.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations.

Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2014 second quarter
results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find
the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website:
investors.nikeinc.com.
Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards,
President of the NIKE Brand; and finally you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who'll give you an
in-depth review of our financial results.
Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions
as possible in our allotted time. So we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event you
have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come
back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.
I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker.
Mark G. Parker
Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone, and happy holidays. It's always good to finish strong. And as we reach the
close of the second quarter, that's exactly what we've done.
Looking at our results, you'll clearly see that the NIKE, Inc. portfolio is a powerful engine for growth. Here are the
highlights. NIKE, Inc. revenues increased 8% to $6.4 billion. Gross margins came in better than anticipated, up 140
basis points. SG&A increased 14%, in line with expectations and reflecting strategic investments in our brands and
operations. And diluted EPS rose 4% to $0.59.
As we discussed at our recent Investor Meeting, at no time in our history have the growth opportunities been greater for
NIKE. Our ability to surgically focus our resources and align our efforts across multiple areas of our business, allows
us to successfully invest in our biggest opportunities for profitable, sustainable growth. This approach ensures we are in
a strong position to manage the macroeconomic challenges when they arise, and seize new opportunities when
conditions improve, like now, as we see initial signs of stabilization in select national economies.
Regardless of the macroeconomic conditions, we know we have to earn our leadership position with consumers every
single day. And our management team has the experience to focus NIKE's resources on what matters most to our
consumers. With this focus, we continue to increase our potential and ultimately reward our shareholders with
long-term sustainable and profitable growth.
As I've said before, innovation is at the heart of everything we do. I continue to see expanding opportunities for NIKE
to reach new heights of product and performance innovation. We're a successful innovator because of our unique
partnerships, and first and foremost, with the world's greatest athletes whose insights inform our amazing products and
services, but also with other partners who help us advance in areas like digital and manufacturing. Our innovation
pipeline has never been deeper or stronger than it is today.
Let me highlight three areas of innovation from the quarter. First, the next steps we're taking with our digital initiatives.
Second, our new advances in apparel. And third, our continuing efforts to revolutionize manufacturing.
At NIKE, digital is a powerful innovation engine. As we've discussed, our digital ecosystem has three components:
consumer connections, e-commerce, and digital products and services. Together these components form our integrated
digital strategy, and I continue to be incredibly bullish on digital's potential to drive both innovation and strong growth
for years to come.
Looking at our e-commerce business, we delivered another strong quarter with 33% revenue growth. And at less than
15% of our DTC revenues today, our e-commerce business clearly has opportunity to grow. We also expanded our
nike.com footprint in the quarter, launching sites in Japan, the world's third largest e-commerce market; and in Brazil,
further extending our commercial reach for consumers in this key growth market.

In digital products and services, we launched the next-generation of the Nike+ FuelBand, the FuelBand SE. With
enhanced features and services for our consumer, it reinforces NikeFuel as the global currency of movement.
Given digital's tremendous potential, we will continue to invest in innovation and infrastructure to accelerate our digital
strategy and capture significant growth for NIKE.
Turning to apparel, we delivered some major apparel innovations in the last six months, most notably with Tech Fleece,
Aeroloft and Dri-FIT Knit. And having just come back from Brazil, where World Cup fever by the way is already
running quite high, I'll touch on a World Cup-related advance in apparel, and that's our new Brazilian and French
football kits.
Working closely with the athletes and the National Federations, we designed these kits to reflect each country's rich
football heritage. Insights from our athletes are reflected in the sharp attention to detail and beautiful craftsmanship.
Each kit integrates technical performance innovation with team-specific design elements. The kits feature Dri-FIT Knit
technology, engineered mesh, and laser-cut ventilation for better cooling, and our lightest NIKE Pro Baselayer ever. In
fact, the uniforms are actually 16% lighter than our 2012 Euro Champ uniforms. And they're made of recycled
polyester, using the equivalent of 18 recycled water bottles in every kit.
In the weeks ahead, we'll launch 8 more National Team Kits as all 10 NIKE teams, by the way, a NIKE record – get
ready for the World Cup. These new kits are just one example of the unprecedented level of product innovation we
have planned for the World Cup. It's an exciting time, as we look forward to being a part of the biggest sports event in
the world.
NIKE's commitment to innovation extends beyond the products we design to how they're manufactured. As we shared
at our Investor Meeting, our manufacturing revolution initiatives continue to challenge traditional manufacturing
assumptions, so we can maximize our potential to serve athletes and further extend our competitive position. Take two
examples; ColorDry and Flyknit.
ColorDry is a revolutionary new fabric dyeing process that replaces water with recyclable carbon dioxide. Beyond the
breakthrough in sustainability, this impressive technology delivers superior results with brighter and more consistent
colors in the fabric.
And with Flyknit, we have continued to leverage its game-changing potential. We've extended Flyknit across all of our
Running footwear platforms; that's Zoom, Lunar, Free and the Air Max and now with the Kobe 9 Masterpiece,
Basketball is part of Flyknit's new frontier.
Kobe's new shoe includes the best of NIKE's technologies, not only Flyknit, but also Flywire and Lunarlon. The
technologies behind these visually striking shoes provide support and mobility at the same time.
And we're not done with Flyknit, not even close. We will continue to expand Flyknit across categories, pushing past the
boundaries of what people think is possible to deliver incredible products for our consumers. And by the way, we've
just learned of Kobe's injury and we want to wish him a full and fast recovery.
We're also able to deliver strong results by remaining focused on the consumer and delivering innovative products into
a differentiated marketplace. The strength of our portfolio allows us to leverage a focused group of high-energy brands
across a globally diverse set of markets and broad range of categories.
Trevor and Don will provide more specifics, but I want to highlight a few examples that reinforce the competitive
advantages of our portfolio.
First is Converse. With Q2 revenue growth of 14%, Converse continues to deliver great results. Converse is a global
brand with a rich history. And we continue to leverage this legacy to drive growth by making Converse relevant to each
new generation of consumers around the world.
Next, Western Europe, where revenues grew 18% in the quarter. In early 2012, we decided to reset our strategy in
Western Europe. As our second quarter results demonstrate, with the right strategy and the right execution, we can

deliver tremendous results. And our futures orders of 26% demonstrate the clear momentum we have in the market,
reflecting strong growth across multiple categories.
As we did in Western Europe, we're also executing a reset strategy in China, to reposition this critical market for
sustainable, profitable growth. It's still early, but we are very encouraged by what we're seeing, with China delivering
8% revenue growth and continued improvement in our key performance metrics.
We've applied the insights gained from executing the category offense in North America first to Western Europe and
now in China. This demonstrates our ability to translate key strategies into locally-relevant executions to unlock
NIKE's growth potential.
In 2014, we look forward to some of the most compelling moments in sports: the Super Bowl; the Winter Olympics in
Sochi; and, of course, the World Cup, just to name a few. At NIKE, events like these are inspiration points for us.
These are the moments when we share the stage with the world's greatest athletes and showcase our most innovative
products – the products that will go on to transcend these individual events and catalyze new momentum in the
marketplace around the world.
And with that, here is Trevor to discuss the NIKE Brand.
Trevor A. Edwards
Thank you, Mark and happy holidays everyone.
At NIKE, we're crossing this quarter's finish line exactly where we always aim to be – out in front. We feel great about
where we are halfway through the fiscal year. And at our Investor Meeting, I spoke about the vast opportunity ahead
for the NIKE Brand and our focused strategy to realize that opportunity. And our Q2 results reflect those efforts – the
NIKE Brand delivered strong results, even as we continue to make strategic investments for the future.
So, on a constant dollar basis, the NIKE Brand was up 9% for the quarter, with growth across all key categories,
product types and geographies. The NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 19%, driven by 10% comp store growth, new
stores and a strong increase in online sales. And, importantly, global futures are up a robust 13%.
Our strategies are working and our investments are paying off. And the reason behind this success is clear: a
razor-sharp focus on the consumer through the category offense. When you combine our full pipeline of innovative
products, our strong connection with consumers and our ability to create compelling retail presentations that elevate the
marketplace, it's a winning formula for growth.
Now let's look at how that growth formula is playing out for the NIKE Brand, starting with two of our key categories:
Basketball and Football. Let me start with Basketball. This quarter is Basketball's largest revenue quarter in our long
history with the game. For years, we've built deep and meaningful relationships with consumers through two of the
most powerful brands in the world – NIKE and the Jordan Brand. Today, with basketball truly a global sport, these
relationships now span the entire world. This fueled double-digit growth for the category, with combined NIKE and
Jordan Q2 revenues growing in every single geography.
We succeed in Basketball for a simple reason. Our relationship with the world's best players gives us unrivaled insight
that leads to amazing product innovations, which fuel our ability to inspire consumers all over the globe. It's that
constant innovation that strengthens NIKE's position as the world's leader in basketball. We've had strong sell-through
of the KD 6, the LeBron 11 and the CP3.VII, Chris Paul's signature shoe. And anticipation is approaching a fever-pitch
for the Kobe 9 Masterpiece, the first basketball shoe to use Flyknit technology, as Mark discussed. It becomes available
in February.
You can also see that passion coming to life in the marketplace. Retail destinations, like our own DTC stores or our
House of Hoops with Foot Locker, continued to be the go-to-places for consumers who live and breathe basketball, in
the U.S. and increasingly, in Europe. These category-focused shopping experiences are a great example of our growth
strategy, a focus on the consumer, an elevation of the marketplace and the delivery of a superior brand experience.

Now let's talk about the world's largest game. Global Football, our business in this category continues to accelerate.
And with the World Cup just six months away, we will strengthen our position as the world's leading football brand. I
feel very confident about our position heading into the World Cup. With 10 teams and the best line-up of product that I
have ever seen, I can tell you it will be an incredible time for Football and for NIKE.
Above all else, the World Cup lets NIKE showcase our game-changing product innovations on the global stage. We
have already launched an incredible number of products over the last six months alone, starting with the Hypervenom,
our most successful boot launch ever. We followed that up with the Hi-Vis 4 Silo, which has a beautiful performance
aesthetics that enhance the player's ability to see teammates quickly and make critical plays when seconds count.
We also launched the new National Team kits for France and the five-star champion Brazil. And there's still so much
more to come. This unmatched pace of innovation and brand energy will continue to drive our growth in this category
in the years ahead.
Last month, I was in Rio when we launched the new Brazilian team kit and I can tell you the excitement was amazing.
The full day of celebration was a tangible expression of Brazil's love affair with the sport. It was a true privilege to
witness this shared moment of national pride as we unveiled the team kit. The electric atmosphere also included the
Run Rio 10K and a concert on the beach with tens of thousands of people all there. It was an unbelievable experience
that only NIKE could deliver.
After all, NIKE is in the business of making big moments, bigger. These are the meaningful experiences that make the
connection to the NIKE Brand personal for consumers and expand our business potential in key growth markets around
the world.
So now, let's focus on our key geographies, starting with the emerging markets. Our Q2 revenue in the emerging
markets increased by 3%, well below what we would have expected for this key growth geography. While we had
strong growth in nearly every territory, these results are largely offset by a specific significant logistical challenge in
Mexico.
In June, we transitioned to a third-party logistic provider in Mexico; the transition did not go as smoothly as planned.
As a result, shipments from our distribution center to our wholesale partners were delayed, leading to a build-up of
inventory in the distribution center and a shortage of NIKE product in the market. We are working with our third-party
logistic provider to resolve the issue and expect to be shipping to demand by the end of Q3.
As we continue to manage through this logistical issue, we're actively engaging our wholesale partners to ensure the
appropriate flow of goods into the marketplace. However, we believe it will take a few quarters for us to fully regain
our business at retail and address residual inventory issues.
Despite these short-term challenges, the NIKE Brand continues to lead in Mexico and the emerging markets overall.
Future orders are strong and we remain confident in the long-term potential of this key growth geography.
Now let's turn to North America, which continues to be a great example of what the NIKE Brand offense can
accomplish worldwide. In Q2, revenues grew 9% and reported EBIT grew a double-digit for the six quarter in a row.
The category offense remains a powerful strategy for driving growth and profitability in North America. By offering an
unparalleled consumer experience across wholesale, retail and online, we expand both the market and our share. This
approach drives consistent expansion in our largest categories, like Running and Basketball, and allows us to
aggressively attack our biggest growth opportunities, like our Young Athletes and our Women's businesses.
Let me take a second to discuss the last two. In our Young Athletes business, we are seeing tremendous momentum
with double-digit growth in Q2, which we expect to accelerate through new retail concepts with our wholesale partners,
like the NIKE Fly Zone at Kids Foot Locker.
And in Women's business, as we discussed at our recent Investor Meeting, the NIKE Training Club has helped us build
meaningful relationships with women. We've used this knowledge to create a unique consumer experience in our own

retail locations. And I'm pleased to report that our results continue to be very strong. Our Women's business in the
NIKE Training Clubs outpaces our other retail doors strong double-digits. And because of this response, we are
expanding beyond the 20 doors we launched in August, and plan to have over 40 NIKE NTC doors by the end of this
fiscal year.
Overall, we continue to see clear opportunity for growth in North America, as we focus on the needs of our consumers
and deliver innovative product and compelling retail experiences.
Now let's look to China. For Q2, revenues increased 5%, driven by strong growth in Basketball and Running. We are
confident of our strategy will set the foundation for sustainable, profitable growth in China over the long-term. And
we're making good progress.
First, we are segmenting and differentiating our points of distribution to create more focused consumer experiences and
to increase the market capacity. Our leadership position with the consumer lets us offer innovative performance-led
through more compelling retail experiences.
Second, we are sharpening our merchandising strategies. We've recently tested four new concepts in our DTC stores
and with our wholesale partners, including new fixtures and a more refined merchandising.
And third, we continue to work with our wholesale partners to create a more seamless operating platform, ensuring we
get the right product, to the right door, at the right time.
While we're still relatively early in the reset process, the results are very encouraging. Comp store sales in our DTC
stores were up over 20% in Q2. And our wholesale partners are seeing improvement in those doors that have been
re-profiled. In these stores, revenue and sell-through rates are above fleet averages. And, inventory levels are improving
throughout the marketplace. By focusing on increasing retail productivity, we will continue to grow the profit pool and
put ourselves in a position for renewed, sustainable growth in China.
Finally, in Western Europe, we delivered a great quarter, with 15% revenue growth. About 2 years ago, we made the
decision to put a new, more centralized organizational structure in place to better manage key partner relationships and
accelerate the implementation of the category offense in Western Europe. That decision is delivering tremendous
results.
Key territories such as the UK, Northern Europe and AGS, which comprises Austria, Germany and Switzerland, are
showing incredible growth in both revenues and futures. And, as the case elsewhere for the NIKE Brand, we are
leading with performance, showing strength in Running, Basketball, Football and Women's Training. We have seen
double-digit DTC growth and strong growth with our wholesale partners, driven by new category experiences that
bring the power of the NIKE Brand to life in the marketplace.
Examples include the House of Hoops with Foot Locker in the UK or the shop-in-shop executions with Karstadt in
Germany or Futbolmania in Spain. As our results demonstrate, the category offense is having a significant impact on
our business in Western Europe and there are still considerable opportunities ahead.
Our results this quarter are proof that by focusing on the consumer, we will continue to build our business throughout
the many growth opportunities worldwide. The strategies and investments we create that are critical for the strong
foundation, and we will make the most of those opportunities now, and in the years to come.
Thanks. And here's Don.
Donald W. Blair
Thanks, Trevor, and happy holidays, everyone.
I'd like to begin by highlighting three competitive strengths that underpin our Q2 results and give us confidence in our
ability to deliver profitable growth and consistent returns to shareholders.

Current Year: 27523.500
Page 7 of 15
Let's start with our focus on the consumer. As Trevor discussed, in Q2, the NIKE Brand delivered growth across each
of our geographies, product types and global categories. The key driver of that success is our category offense. We first
saw the power of the category offense in North America, which delivered mid-teens revenue and EBIT growth over the
last three fiscal years.
More recently, the work we've done to implement the strategy globally is accelerating growth in other markets, most
recently in Western Europe. These results underscore our confidence that the category offense will drive profitable
growth in other key markets, such as China and Brazil. By focusing more sharply on the consumer, we've improved our
ability to deliver relevant product innovations, deeper brand connections and compelling retail experiences. The result
is incredible top-line momentum as well as the product and brand separation that enables premium prices and gross
margin expansion.
The second strength is the NIKE, Inc. portfolio. For a global business spanning 190 countries, there will always be
unforeseen macroeconomic and operational factors that affect our business. The breadth of our portfolio, the
capabilities of our operating platform and the strength of our balance sheet, give us the tools to manage the impact of
these factors on our consolidated results. And the depth of our management team gives us the ability to use those tools
to deliver sustainable growth in profits and cash flows.
That brings me to the third strength, which is our ongoing commitment to investing for the future and delivering
near-term profitability. So far this year, we've delivered strong EPS growth and return on invested capital reached a
new high, increasing nearly 6 points to over 26%. And in the first six months of the year, we've returned over $1 billion
to shareholders, through share repurchases and dividends.
We're able to deliver these returns because we've invested in growth strategies such as product innovation, digital
infrastructure and marketplace development, both wholesale and DTC. And we'll continue to invest in those strategies,
allocating resources to the highest potential opportunities to maximize returns.
With that introduction, let's recap our Q2 results. Second quarter reported revenues for NIKE, Inc. increased 8%. On a
currency-neutral basis, both NIKE, Inc. and NIKE Brand revenues increased 9%, while Converse increased 11%.
Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders increased 13%, driven by a 10% increase in units and a
3% increase in average selling price. Futures for most of our geographies increased at a double-digit pace, driven by
strong demand across multiple categories including Global Football, Sportswear, Running, Basketball and Women's
Training. On a reported basis, futures grew 12%, reflecting weaker international currencies.
Second quarter diluted EPS increased 4% to $0.59, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower tax
rate, partially offset by higher year-over-year SG&A investments and stiffer FX headwinds. We've discussed the
phasing of SG&A spending on previous calls. As a result of the timing of investments in FY 2013 and FY 2014, we
expected FY 2014 EPS growth to be significantly front-loaded in Q1, with lower growth over the balance of the year.
We've also discussed the significant impact of weaker international currencies, which reduce our gross margin and
erode the U.S. dollar values of local currency profits. We estimate changes in currency exchange rates reduced our EPS
growth by about 10 percentage points for both the second quarter and year-to-date. As we've noted on previous calls,
we expect FX headwinds to continue to pressure balance of year earnings growth.
Gross margin for the second quarter increased 140 basis points. The favorability was driven by a mix shift to higher
margin products and businesses, higher average prices and lower raw material costs, as well as the continued strength
of our DTC business. These positive factors were partially offset by higher labor costs and continued FX headwinds,
due largely to weaker developing market currencies.
As expected, Q2 SG&A spending rose at a mid-teens rate, with demand creation increasing 13% and operating
overhead up 14%. Second quarter demand creation spending was higher to support new product launches, including the
World Cup kits and FuelBand SE, that Mark mentioned, as well as global Running events and the ramp up to the
Winter Olympics. The increase in operating overhead reflects targeted investments in long-term infrastructure and
capabilities, growth in our higher gross margin, higher cost DTC business, as well as continued investments in digital.

Other expense, net was $13 million for the quarter, driven primarily by a charge related to an adverse legal judgment in
Western Europe.
The Q2 effective tax rate was 25.1%, a 170 basis point improvement versus the prior year, due primarily to an increase
in earnings from our operations outside of the U.S., which are generally subject to lower tax rates.
Q2 inventories grew 11%, below the rate of futures growth. Inventories are generally in good shape, though we're
continuing to work through pockets of excess inventory created by distribution center issues in Mexico and some slow
moving footwear styles in North America, most notably a line of retro training footwear. With our well-developed
liquidation channels, we're confident we have the appropriate plans in place to address these situations.
Now let's take a look at some performance highlights by segment. In North America, Q2 revenue increased 9% on both
a reported and constant currency basis, driven by growth across all key categories including double-digit growth in
Basketball and Women's Training. For the quarter, footwear revenue increased 10%, while apparel rose 9%. DTC
revenues grew 12% in the quarter, driven by 7% comp store sales growth. On a reported basis, Q2 EBIT for North
America grew 15%, due to strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion.
In Western Europe, Q2 revenues increased 15% on a currency-neutral basis. As Trevor discussed, we continue to be
very pleased with the growth of our business in Western Europe, following our strategic reset in 2012. Growth
continues to accelerate at an impressive rate, led by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Running, Basketball and
Women's Training, as well as in our Young Athletes' business. Territory performance was led by the UK and AGS,
with revenues increasing over 20% in each territory.
On a reported basis, Q2 revenue for Western Europe increased 18% and EBIT increased 12%, driven by revenue
growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by the legal charge I mentioned earlier.
In Greater China, currency-neutral revenue grew 5%, led by growth in Basketball, Running, Sportswear and Global
Football. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue in Greater China increased 8%, and EBIT increased 5% as revenue growth
was partially offset by investments in our DTC business.
As both Mark and Trevor indicated in their earlier remarks, we've seen encouraging results in partner stores we've reset
with more focused assortments. And NIKE DTC stores continue to perform well, with comp store growth over 20% for
the third consecutive quarter. These results are an indication that our strategies are the right ones, and we're now
working with our retail partners to refine and scale them.
As we've said previously, our futures and revenue growth for China won't necessarily show sequential improvement
every quarter as we move through this transition. While we work with our retailers to manage the marketplace with
greater discipline, year-on-year changes in cancellations, returns and discounts will create volatility in revenue growth
and disparities between futures growth and revenue growth.
At this point, we continue to expect overall FY 2014 revenue to be roughly in line with the prior year, with single-digit
revenue growth in Q3 and flat to down revenue in Q4.
Revenue in the emerging markets geography grew 3% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by higher revenues in nearly
every territory and double-digit growth in the largest territory, Brazil. Although, revenues for the geography were
above the prior year, the rate of growth was significantly below the rate we'd expect, driven primarily by the impact of
ongoing supply chain challenges in Mexico.
On a reported basis, revenue in the emerging markets declined 4% and EBIT decreased 18%, due to the adverse impact
of FX headwinds on gross margin and translation. The decline in EBIT also reflected increased demand creation
investments in advance of the World Cup and higher operating overhead for new retail stores and the launch of
nike.com in Brazil.
Converse revenue grew 11% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by continued strength in our largest owned markets;
North America, the UK and China.

On a reported basis, revenue increased 14%, while EBIT grew 10%, as revenue growth was partially offset by
investments in demand creation, infrastructure and DTC.
We're pleased by the underlying strength of our business and expect that momentum to continue over the balance of the
fiscal year. That said, FX headwinds have had a significant impact on our EPS growth for the first half and we expect
to face ongoing pressure from weaker developing market currencies over the balance of the fiscal year.
Our updated full year guidance reflects both the year-to-date and forecasted balance of the year impact of this FX
pressure. Specifically, we expect revenue for Q3 to grow at a high single-digit to low double-digit rate, and Q4 to grow
at a low double-digit rate, reflecting the weighting of futures orders to the back half of the futures window. For the full
year, we expect revenue to grow at a high single to low double-digit rate.
Gross margin for the first half of the fiscal year exceeded our expectations, as we saw a mix shift to higher margin
products, higher average selling prices, and continued strength in our DTC business. While we expect these factors will
continue to drive margin expansion in the second half of the fiscal year, we will be facing new pressures as raw
material costs shift from tailwinds to headwinds and we increase discounts to clear pockets of excess inventory. We
also expect to face continued pressure from labor costs and foreign exchange.
As a result, we expect gross margin to expand by about 25 basis points in each of Q3 and Q4. For full year, FY 2014,
we now expect gross margin expansion of approximately 75 basis points.
For Q3, we expect total SG&A to grow at a high-teens rate, driven by demand creation growth of over 20%, reflecting
phasing of spending in support of key sporting events, as well as comparisons to a relatively lower level of spending in
the third quarter of FY 2013.
We expect operating overhead to grow at a high-teens rate in Q3, reflecting ongoing investments in strategic initiatives.
For the full year, we now expect SG&A will grow at a low-teens rate.
For FY 2014, we continue to expect the effective tax rate will be about 25%.
As Mark said at the top of the call, we feel great about the strong results we've delivered in the first half of the year. As
we look ahead to the second half of FY 2014, we will continue to make strategic investments to drive long-term
growth, even as we capitalize on those investments we've already made, to deliver appropriate returns for our
shareholders in the near-term.
We're now ready to take your questions.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group. Your line is now open.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Thanks, guys. I appreciate all the information, very helpful. I was wondering, if you could
elaborate – you talked a lot about the gross margin dynamics. I was wondering if you could elaborate on the – it sounds
like there's a mix shift to more premium products, higher price points and how do you think about the gross margin
dynamics long-term, especially as you layer in some of these manufacturing revolution initiatives? Thanks.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Well, first I'd start with the quarter. As I indicated in the prepared remarks, we did see a lot of
things go right in Q2. We're continuing to see higher average selling prices and that's driven by both, price increases
we've taken as well as some very strong growth in the premium end of both, the footwear and the apparel product lines.
And the revenue mix, as I said, has definitely shifted to higher margin pieces of business. For example, the growth in
Western Europe, as well as growth in performance basketball and DTC are all positive mix shifts for us.
And we also had some lower discounts in Q2, as we were clearing a lot of inventory in China in this quarter last year,
so all very positive things and we also had a bit of a tailwind from raw material costs. So, all of those were upsides in

the quarter and that offset some of the FX headwinds and the higher labor costs.
As we talked about on the prepared remarks, I do think that most of those pluses are going to be positive factors over
the balance of the year and certainly the strategies around looking at our pricing each season and making sure that we're
taking the benefits from the differentiation of our products and the improved retail presentation, that's clearly part of the
strategy and certainly long-term.
We are very focused on the premium aspects of our brand and our product lines, and as we bring new innovations to
the market, we're definitely trying to use those to help move margins higher. So, as we think about a lot of the
long-term things that we do control, we're really focused on long-term expansion in gross margin.
Obviously, there's a lot of factors out there that we don't control. And so, on the long-term, we obviously aim to offset
things like currencies and increased labor costs. And we're confident that the strength of our brand and our products lets
us do that over the long-term.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Let's take a quarter-to-quarter look, obviously, at pricing opportunities that'll continue to be
an important lever here. We'll look at, as you asked about the manufacturing innovations, very committed to that. We're
actually accelerating our innovation agenda there and confident that we can take some bigger steps, particularly as we
scale some of these innovations to help offset some of those input cost headwind, so it's a balancing act as always.
But, frankly, I think we're in a great position, innovation pipeline is incredibly strong, new product coming in at some
premium price points that I think are incredibly compelling, so all that bodes well, I think, to help us on that margin
line.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.

And your next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Thanks, guys. Great quarter.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Thanks, Robby.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Thanks, Robby.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Just two questions. Just first to follow-up on – a little bit of follow-up on Omar's question.
Your futures orders, I think you said 10% unit growth to get to the 13%. And can you tell us what that would look like,
the split for North America, ASP versus unit growth? And then maybe with the unit growth so high, I don't think the
industry is growing that high globally in units, and can you talk about and I don't think I'm seeing same-store sales
growth like that for some of your largest customers, can you maybe help us understand where the new distribution is
coming from the fastest?
And then the second question was just on China. I'm hearing a 20% comp in your own DTC and some of the comments
on the partner stores that you've done some work on and then the total revenues, you're being cautious on. Maybe just a
little more help in understanding when you could return to a more stable, secular, double-digit growth in China?
Thanks.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Okay. So, let's just start with the first question about futures. You are correct that the 13%
futures growth is 10% on units and 3% on average selling price. And we are seeing that trend pretty consistently around
the world where we've got expansion in average selling price, which as we said earlier, and Mark reiterated, is driven
by pricing opportunities as well as shifting of mix to premium products. So, we are seeing that pattern around the
world. I'd rather not get into trying to reconcile individual geography numbers at this point, but it is a pretty consistent
pattern.

As far as the relative growth rates, I mean, in our futures numbers are, first of all, embedded the DTC demand as well.
So that DTC growth that we're seeing, both online as well as comp store numbers, is driving some of that growth. And
then similarly, if you look at our wholesale customers, a lot of them have online businesses as well, which are driving
accelerated growth. So, we feel really good about the momentum we've got in the marketplace. We are certainly
outpacing the growth of our key accounts, because we're taking share in those accounts. So, as we look at the growth
trends, we feel really good about how the category offense is driving that sustainable growth around the world. So, with
respect to China, let me hand it off to Trevor.
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Yeah, on China, as we said in the prepared remarks, we feel really like we're making great
progress around our reset strategy. We're obviously very encouraged by the results of Q2 and we're seeing continued
improvement in our key performance metrics. And we kind of pointed out a couple of things. Obviously, we talked
about the fact that DTC is – the comp store is actually 20% and we're seeing sort of revenue and sell-through in our
re-profiled doors outpacing the fleet averages.
And then also, we're seeing an improvement in the inventory level that are in the marketplace. So, all those things are
really pointing in the right direction. However, one thing that we have said, I think pretty consistently, is that we won't
expect it to be a linear path to growth. So, when we talk about futures being 1%, we feel good about that, because
again, we're continuing to get all the elements of the business back together.
Now, in terms of a specific time, we can't really say a specific time. What we can say is that we feel great about the
long-term potential of the marketplace. We feel that we have a really strong brand and we're continuing to position the
brand in the right way and we're segmenting the market in the right way and the merchandising strategies we're doing
are all working. So, it's more a matter of time, but I can't put out an exact moment and say it's then, but again, we feel
very confident about the future.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: So, it's fair to say that it's still a situation that I think you commented on the past that your
partners are maybe ordering more from you than you are currently willing to ship to them in China?
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: I'm not sure I'd want to address relative conversations we might have with our consumers,
Robby, but I think the key aspect of what we're doing in China here is we are really focused on sustainable productive
retail spaces. And nothing succeeds like success. When these new concepts and these new merchandising assortments
are selling the way they are, then our partners are very, very eager to get on that path.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: We're taking a very disciplined approach here and maintaining that as we scale.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks very much, guys.

And your next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is now open.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Thanks. Good afternoon.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Hi, Kate.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: My first question is around the higher ASPs, and specifically in apparel, can you talk a
little bit about if you're raising prices on existing apparel platforms or is it more on the new technology you spoke about
earlier in the call today?
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Yeah. It's actually a combination of both. What we're continuing to do in our apparel business,
and certainly, we've done it recently with the new Tech Pack launch that we did for Sportswear. It's a great example of

bringing innovation to what can somewhat been seen as a dormant category, so we were able to bring some great
innovation there. And obviously, as we talk about here, getting paid for that work is a really important piece, so we're
actually driving, obviously, higher prices as well as making sure that it's delivering.
The Aeroloft is another example as well as Dri-FIT Knit, so you're seeing across the board, we're bringing innovation
into the marketplace and using that as an opportunity to make sure the consumer is getting the right value, because we
bring great innovation into it.
And our focus certainly has been around our Sportswear business, making sure that we have the premium segment
which we call the Red Label, which is actually growing at a really rapid rate right now, really around the world, we're
seeing that consistently.
So, all those things are pointing to our ability to take premium price based on the strength of our brand as well as the
strength of the technology that we put in place, and clearly the consumer is seeing great value from that.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Okay. Great. Thank you. And if I may, just with the – so, my second question with
regards to Flyknit and the supply chain, I know it's a multiyear strategy to build this out, but can you walk us through
how you're progressing with your investment in getting the Flyknit supply chain more robust and what still needs to be
done?
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Yeah. Actually, we've been very aggressive in our investment in scaling Flyknit production
capacity, namely, with a couple of major partners here. And actually feel quite good about the pace that we're moving.
We're actually moving it to more technical executions of Flyknit 2, which take actually more time from a production
and a design engineering standpoint, very aggressive in terms of how we're innovating using this technology, so that
creates more challenges, if you will, all the way through the manufacturing process, but really feel good about where
we are.
As I said earlier, we have it scaled across many of the Running, actually all of the Running platforms. We have it in
Sportswear, in Training, just introduced in Basketball and I think you'll see Flyknit continue to be a really important
technology for us as we scale and leverage across even more categories going forward.
Operator
And your next question comes from Chris Svezia with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.
<Q - Christopher Svezia>: Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for taking my call. Firstly, I just want to touch on
Western Europe. You've shown very nice improvement there and I guess more specifically on the footwear side than on
apparel, so I was just curious maybe just talk about your progress in Europe on the apparel segment of the business.
How we should think about that?
And, also unless I might have missed it, I don't know if you mentioned global Running, if it was up and – I assume, it
was up and by how much? And the last question I just had for, Don, for you, just maybe, if you could rank between
when you think about gross margin in the second half of the year, 25 basis points in the back half, maybe rank between
FX, some of the inventory you need to cleanup, input costs, in terms of where the bigger heavyweights or where the
biggest deltas are occurring? Thanks.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Okay. On Western Europe, again, we saw great results for Western Europe as we've talked
about, 15% revenue growth. We're actually seeing that both, across footwear and apparel, so both of those are actually
growing with strong double-digits.
The futures growth, it was also at 23%, which has shown continued momentum across multiple categories. One of the
keys around Europe and it really goes back to what Mark spoke about earlier, which is, we went in and did a strategic
reset in Europe, where we really focused on key accounts as well as centralizing our approach to those key accounts, as
well as accelerating the category offense.

And so what we're seeing is, we're seeing really great growth around performance. We're seeing growth in both
footwear and apparel. We're seeing growth in our Sportswear and our performance businesses, with actually
performance leading the way. So, we're seeing great growth in Running, Basketball, Football, and Women's Training.
And we've talked before about the success we've been having actually in Football. So, across the board, we would say
that we're gaining strength in the marketplace and delivering even greater separation in our footwear position in
Europe.
We truly believe, it's part of the total offense that we've got in place in Western Europe. So, we're very confident about
where we are there. And we'd say the category offense is actually paying great dividends.
Now around Running, we're actually seeing, again, we didn't talk about Running this time and we see again – we feel
great about the results where we're seeing a continued strong growth in both revenues and futures and it's really a case
of the total offense, so they're playing in, which is both footwear and apparel across multiple geographies.
Obviously, it's been a key driver for North America for the period, but we're actually seeing growth really across all the
geographies going forward. And we feel very confident about the innovation pipeline that we have coming in Running.
So all those things said, again, we continue to feel really good about our position in Running and we see further
opportunity to continue to grow in the marketplace, as we work specifically with our customers on giving new
expressions to the Running business.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: And quickly, your question on gross margin. The largest swing between where we were in the
second quarter and what we're now seeing for the third and the fourth quarters is that move from tailwind to headwind
on materials and that is something that obviously relates to the spike we saw several years back in materials, which has
been ebbed. We've now gotten back essentially to stabilization and we see at the second half of the year that's starting
to move into a headwind situation. Next would be the swing in discounts from favorable year-on-year to a little bit
higher as we clear some pockets of inventory and then FX would be the third.

<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Yeah, obviously, thanks for that question. And I personally like the words about we make
big moments even bigger. What we mean by that, it is our job as a brand and we've always seen at this way to continue
to bring excitement to the marketplace to give consumers new opportunity to connect with our brand to bring
innovative products into the marketplace and also to elevate how they connect at retail. And so, we're very excited
about the Winter Olympics as we're preparing for the games.

We are still the sports brand of choice in Russia and in Eastern Europe and it's a great opportunity for us to continue to
bring inspiration and innovation to the athletes as well as to broader consumers. So at this moment, a lot of our focus is
on just making sure we have the right products in the pipeline and we're pretty much lined up for that and we feel really
good about lining up for Sochi.
Interestingly, as we mentioned too, we also have the World Cup coming up, which is a very big opportunity for us to
bring even more greater innovation into the marketplace.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: So just to hit a couple of high points here. We do sponsor the Ice Hockey Federations, and so
you'll see certainly NIKE on the ice. We've certainly got some connections into the Action Sports piece.
And as Trevor said, we've got some great connection points with our business in Russia, which has been a fantastic
success story for us this year. Our business there is really growing very rapidly and the Olympics are a great ignition
point for that marketplace.
<Q - Jay Sole>: Great. And thanks. Don, if I can ask you one more question. Just on the guidance, very clear that FX,
input costs, labor costs or headwinds, but it looks like the full-year guidance is up a little bit from where we were last
quarter. Can you talk about how much the guidance has just like flowed through from what we saw this quarter and
how much is based on an outlook that's maybe a little bit higher for the second half of the year than you had before?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, the guidance that we gave is actually line-by-line, you have to look at all the lines. So,
revenue we've seen fantastic momentum and so there is maybe a touch more optimism on the revenue line for the full
year. We've also seen more optimism on the gross margin side.
Spending has re-phased over the course of the year, so when you look at the year holistically, we've got a lot of puts
and takes on the lines, but the underlying change really is that currency headwinds. The impact in the first half was
about 10 points of EPS growth. You didn't see all of that because of the way our SG&A phasing played out, but that is
definitely what's really driving changes in the full year outlook, is really the carryover of that from the first half.
<Q - Jay Sole>: Got it. All right. Thanks so much. Terrific results. Good luck.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Yep. Thank you.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Operator, we'll take one more question.

And your final question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jim V. Duffy>: Thanks. Happy holidays, everyone.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Hey, Jim.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Hey, Jim.
<Q - Jim V. Duffy>: Don, I'm looking for, if you will, a little more clarification on the change in the SG&A guidance.
Given that currency is a bigger headwind on the top line, one would think there'd be a give back there at the SG&A
line. Am I thinking about that incorrectly?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: It all depends on where it is around the world. So, the major changes in currency are
developing market currencies, which would be markets like Russia, Brazil, Mexico, some of the businesses where we
have fairly significant businesses and those currencies have been hit pretty hard. That's not where a lot of our
investment dollars go. Quite a bit of the investments we're making around DTC are in developed markets and a lot of
the investments that we make in innovation are actually right here in the U.S.
<Q - Jim V. Duffy>: Got you. Okay. And then growth in the Converse brand continues to impress. Can you speak to
some of the efforts to diversify the business and the contribution to growth from franchises other than Chuck Taylor's?

<A - Mark G. Parker>: Yes. Actually, I'll jump in. This is Mark. We've introduced this last quarter and it's just
beginning of a huge commitment to diversify the footwear business beyond the Chuck Taylor All Star and that's the
cons footwear part of the line, feel good about the initial start there. That'll ramp up as a bigger priority and a bigger
scale play over the next fiscal year or two.
Apparel, we're just in the infancy stages there, really focused on specific segments of the market, specifically tees and
fleece to start. And feel really good about, where we are on the upside opportunity there as well. And then we see some
investments in DTC, e-commerce also, yielding some growth for us as well.
