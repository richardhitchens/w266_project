MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to the Verizon First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants
have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator
Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor
Relations.
Michael T. Stefanski
Thanks, Eunice. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and
I'm here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on the
Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.
Before I get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Information in this
presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject
to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the
SEC, which are available on our website.
This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the
most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website.

The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year
basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.
Before Matt goes through the results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the first quarter of 2017, we reported
earnings of $0.84 per share on a GAAP basis, which included about $0.02 of earnings pressure primarily related to
recent business acquisitions. These reported results include a few non-operational items that I would like to highlight.
Our reported first quarter earnings include a pre-tax early debt redemption charge of about $850 million and a non-cash
pre-tax gain on a spectrum license transaction of roughly $125 million. The net impact of these items after tax was
approximately $435 million or $0.11 per share. Excluding the effect of these non-operational items, adjusted earnings
per share was $0.95 in the first quarter compared to $1.06 a year ago.
Recall that our first quarter 2016 adjusted EPS included $0.10 of earnings related to the three wireline properties that
we sold to Frontier. During the first quarter, we reorganized the customer groups within the wireline segment. On April
11, we released unaudited historical results recast for the four customer groups including Verizon Business Markets, a
new group that consists of U.S.-based small and medium-size businesses, state and local governments, and educational
institutions.
This new group was formed to increase the focus on these markets. The historical total segment revenues remain
unchanged from previously reported results. As a reminder, we are still subject to the FCC anti-collusion rules related
to the spectrum auction. So we will not be able to answer spectrum-related questions.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.
Matthew D. Ellis
Thanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today. As outlined in our earnings
call in January, our priorities for 2017 are to leverage our network leadership, retain and grow our high quality
customer base while balancing profitability, enhance ecosystems in media and telematics, and drive monetization of
these networks and solutions. We are executing against these priorities while positioning the business for the long term
as we progress through 2017.
The first quarter of 2017 proved to be a very active quarter for us. First, we extended our network leadership as
recognized by third-party testing results. Second, we launched an introductory unlimited wireless data plan to address
evolving customer demand in a highly competitive environment. Third, we realigned our operating teams to enable
business agility to deliver new products and next generation services.
Verizon's core strength and the foundation of our future success in a connected world starts with the network, and we
have enhanced our track record of U.S. industry leadership. We have consistently invested in our network to extend our
leadership in both 4G and 5G. We also closed the acquisition of XO Communications fiber assets in the quarter.
Our uncompromising commitment to our customers led to the launch of an introductory unlimited offering in the
quarter. This measured approach in a competitive and highly penetrated wireless phone environment was positively
received by both the consumer market and, more importantly, our existing customer base. Our competitive unlimited
offer, coupled with network strength and reliability, allows us to attract, retain and grow high value customer
relationships across our entire business.
At the end of the first quarter, we announced the realignment of our operating teams to facilitate organizational agility
in wireless and fiber markets, to scale and expand our media and telematics businesses, and to maintain leadership in
network reliability and new technology. These changes do not affect our segment reporting.
We are confident in our strategy and priorities to provide the best network experience in the U.S., create long-lasting
customer relationships and identify growth opportunities in new businesses. Executing these strategies will enable us to
continue to deliver returns on our investments and drive long-term value for shareholders.

Let's review the first quarter operating performance at a consolidated level, followed by wireless and wireline results,
media and telematics progress, and a network technology update.
Now onto slide 6. On a comparable basis, excluding divestitures and acquisitions in the period, consolidated revenue
declined approximately 4.5%. The primary driver was a decrease in wireless service revenue resulting from the
migration to the new pricing structures introduced over the past nine months and the ongoing transition of the base to
unsubsidized pricing. These pricing moves have been positively received in the marketplace. On a consolidated basis,
excluding non-operational items, first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.3%, which was slightly higher
year-over-year due to steady improvement in operating efficiencies and cost management.
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide 7. We are generating substantial cash flows from our
operating segments. Cash flow from operations is $1.7 billion, which included discretionary pension contributions of
$3.4 billion. Additionally, our ongoing asset-backed securitization program provided $1.3 billion in the quarter, which
flows through the financing section of the cash flow statement. The discretionary pension contributions are net present
value positive on an after-tax basis, given the reduction in our variable rate PBGC premiums and the expected net
return on plan assets.
As a result of these contributions, our mandatory pension funding through 2020 is expected to be minimal, which will
benefit future cash flows and improve the funded status of our qualified pension plans. Also, the rating agencies view
debt funded pension contributions as neutral to credit rating metrics. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities,
we are investing in our networks. Our capital expenditures were $3.1 billion in the quarter, and we expect capital
spending for the year to be within our 2017 guided range.
Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with
$116.5 billion of total debt, which was comprised of $110.2 billion of unsecured debt and $6.3 billion of on balance
sheet securitizations. During the quarter, we completed multiple capital market transactions, including new debt
issuances, discretionary pension contributions, the acquisition of XO, and to pre-fund the acquisition of Yahoo!. These
transactions included a $3.1 billion tender offer and a $9.0 billion debt exchange, which reduced future cash interest
costs and extended maturities. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to
2019 timeframe.
Now, let's move into reviews of the operating segments, starting with Wireless and the impact of unlimited on slide 8.
In our Wireless business, we have extended our network leadership position while balancing operational performance
in a competitive environment. Verizon is the U.S. market leader across high-value postpaid phone customers, and we
have consistently stated that our top priority is protecting our base to build on our customer relationships into the
future.
During the first quarter, we made a disciplined decision to launch an unlimited offering, so let's spend a few minutes on
the factors leading to our decision. As discussed on the last earnings call, we launched wireless plans in mid-2016 that
offered safety mode and carryover data, reducing overage charges. Since the launch, the U.S. wireless phone market
experienced greater competition with unlimited plans from other carriers. We chose to compete using equipment
promotions during that time while we evaluated different service pricing options, including unlimited.
At the start of 2017, competitive intensity escalated, resulted in loss of gross add share and an uptick in churn pressure.
So we determined that the timing was right for the introduction of an unlimited option at the high end of our existing
plans. We are confident in our network capability to efficiently manage the expected usage growth from unlimited
because we have invested in technology, architecture and densification. Our early network performance is consistent
with our high quality of service expectations and within the current network plan.
The customer response to the launch was favorable, as evidenced by an immediate improvement in subscriber activity
in the second half of the quarter. In the quarter, in which we added 49,000 smartphones, our phone net adds had two
distinct trajectories. Prior to an unlimited launch, we had retail postpaid phone net losses of 398,000 customers. After
the launch, we added 109,000 retail postpaid phone customers, which gives us momentum entering the second quarter.

Overall in the first quarter, we lost 307,000 postpaid customers, consisting of phone losses of 289,000 and tablet losses
of 255,000, offset by other connected devices. We introduced the unlimited offering primarily to protect our high
quality base. And we achieved the desired impact, as retail phone churn improved after the launch and was less than
0.9% for the eighth consecutive quarter, despite heightened competition in the marketplace.
Total retail postpaid churn of 1.15% increased year-over-year due to higher tablet share, which is expected to remain
elevated throughout the year as customers roll off of free tablet promotions from prior years. Total postpaid device
activations were down almost 9% over the prior year, of which about 82% were phones. In a seasonally soft quarter, we
had 5.2% of our retail postpaid base upgrade to a new device, down from 5.8% last year.
During the quarter, 5.7 million phones were activated on device payment plans. While we made progress in the prepaid
market, this remains an area of opportunity for us, as prepaid devices declined by 17,000 in the quarter as compared to
a decline of 177,000 in the prior year.
Let's turn to slide 9 and take a closer look at wireless revenue and profitability. Total wireless operating revenue
declined 5.1% in the first quarter. We experienced a change in the service revenue trend, which had been improving
sequentially. Service revenue declined 6.1% year-over-year compared to the 4.9% decrease in the previous quarter.
The service revenue pressure was a result of decreased overage revenue, lower postpaid customers in the quarter and
promotional activity. Overage pressure was primarily related to the ongoing migration to the pricing plans implemented
last year and the introduction of unlimited offerings. As expected, optimizers who benefit the most from stepping down
in price, primarily single-line users, were the early adopters of these plans.
We believe this revenue trend will persist through the first half of the year, but remain confident that these plans will be
ARPA neutral over time, as more users step up in price, which is already taking place. New customer accounts added
after the unlimited launch on average had higher account access fees. While we absorb overages in the near term, we
expect that the increase in account access fees will replace overages over time.
Equipment revenue decreased 4.8% in the first quarter. Sequentially, the percentage of phone activations on device
payment plans remain steady at approximately 76% in the first quarter compared with about 77% in the fourth quarter.
We expect the second quarter device payment plan take rate to remain consistent. At the end of the quarter,
approximately 48% of our postpaid phone customers had a device payment plan, while about 71% were on
unsubsidized pricing.
Our wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 45.1%, which was down due to the service revenue
trend and the increased advertising activity associated with the unlimited plan launch.
Let's move next to our wireline segment on slide 10. At the beginning of February, we completed the acquisition of XO
Communications, which contributed revenue to enterprise solutions, partner solutions and business markets for about
half of the quarter. Excluding XO, wireline segment revenues maintained recent trends, declining 3.2%. Consumer
markets revenue increased 0.7%, which was driven by favorable pricing, partially offset by lower customer demand. In
Fios Internet, we added 35,000 customers for the quarter. Over 22% of our broadband customers are on plans with
speeds of 100 megabits per second or more.
Fios Video losses of 13,000 in the quarter were indicative of softer demand for linear video due to the increase in
over-the-top offerings, mobile video consumption and competitive promotional offers, particularly in the New York
market. On an organic basis, enterprise solutions revenue declined 4.3% in the quarter as a result of pricing pressure in
the market. On a constant currency basis, this decline was 3.7%.
The customer migration from legacy services, such as voice, to advanced communications products is generating a
revenue headwind in the near term, while increasing customer satisfaction and decreasing serving costs over the long
term.
Wireline segment EBITDA margin increased to 22.7% for the quarter, up from 19.0% last year. Tight cost controls plus
the impact of last year's renegotiated labor contracts improved profitability. We expect full-year improvements in
margins with seasonal fluctuations throughout the year.

Let's move next to slide 11 to discuss our progress in new businesses. In our media business, AOL continues to deliver
solid seasonal performance with growth in gross revenue. Revenue, net of traffic acquisition costs, decreased about 4%,
driven by a higher percentage of programmatic advertising.
Along with our content assets, AOL's ad-tech capabilities have enabled us to provide unique content across multiple
platforms. We have assembled video platforms to leverage the growing customer demand for digital media. Our
targeted content pillars focusing on news, sports, finance and lifestyle are already increasing our viewership. To
provide the necessary scale to effectively leverage these assets, we are looking forward to combining AOL and Yahoo!
and operating the combined businesses under the Oath brand. We are actively working on integration streams with
Yahoo! to ensure a smooth consolidation when the transaction closes, which is expected during the second quarter.
Consistent with past quarters, digital video consumption on the go90 app maintained an average daily usage of about
30 minutes per viewer, with less than 20% of the app traffic served on the Verizon wireless network. During the
quarter, the app was updated to improve the user interface, increase content discovery, and enhance the programming
and advertizing capabilities.
In the telematics business, we are quickly integrating the Fleetmatics and Telogis acquisitions. With these assets, we
are the global market share leader and are looking to expand our offerings in the space. Total telematics revenue was
$214 million in the first quarter. Organically, IoT revenue including telematics was up approximately 17% in the first
quarter.
Let's move next to slide 12 to discuss network and technology. We consistently invest in our networks to ensure that
overall quality and capacity remains ahead of demand. Capital spending of $3.1 billion in the quarter was largely
network related to maintain leadership in our markets. Fiber is a critical component of our network strategy and next
generation deployments as demonstrated by the success of our densification initiative. Earlier this week, we announced
a strategic agreement with Corning with whom we have a long relationship to supply optical fiber and hardware
solutions of at least $1.05 billion from 2018 to 2020. This investment ensures that we have adequate supply of fiber.
In the first quarter, LTE data traffic increased 57% over the prior year. While still early in the cycle, the increased data
traffic resulting from unlimited is in line with our expectations and network management tools have been effective. We
are committed to remain in the largest and most reliable 4G network through technological developments in LTE,
deploying small cells and re-farming mid-band spectrum. As part of the densification, we are deepening our fiber assets
enhanced by the XO transaction. As previously announced, we are launching 11 pre-commercial 5G fixed wireless
pilots during the second quarter and we look forward to sharing the results later in the year.
Let's move next to slide 13 to review our strategy for future growth. Our long-term growth model is to lead in network,
expand our customer relationships, and develop new businesses in media and telematics. While executing on our
strategy and positioning for future growth, in the quarter, we listened to our customers, evaluated the marketplace, and
launched an unlimited offering in order to retain and grow our high quality customer relationships. We realigned our
operating teams to increase business agility to deliver new products and next generation services and develop new
ecosystems in media and telematics in order to monetize the rising data traffic on our network. Overall, we are
confident in our strategy and ability to execute and deliver long-term value to our customers, partners and shareholders.
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes
from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brett Feldman>: Thanks. You guys hear me?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yes, we can.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Yes, we can.
<Q - Brett Feldman>: Great. So, Matt, you were talking of fiber, and during his media appearances this week, Lowell
noted that the company does in fact have a pretty strong interest in adding more fiber to the network and even indicated
that this could potentially be achieved through M&A. And when noting that, he said, yeah, there's never really a perfect
fit in terms of architecture. And so my question is, what type of architecture are you looking to add to the network that
you have today? And is it reasonable to assume that the choice you have to make is to either do this organically through
higher levels of capital investment or to do it inorganically through acquisitions, which could potentially result in the
company operating at higher leverage for longer than we had expected? Thank you.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Thanks, Brett, and good morning. Yeah, so I think if you look at what Lowell said earlier in
the week, as we look at the network and is consistent with what we've been saying over a year ago since we announced
the fiber initiative in Boston, that as we look at the networks of the future, they're going to be built with a lot of fiber
deep into the network and that network's going to be built for multi-use cases, not for a single use case. So it's going to
deliver consumer to the home applications, it's going to deliver small business applications, it's going to light up
enterprise buildings, and it's also going to deliver smart cities and IoT solutions too. So as we think about how you
build that network out, you're going to need fiber that's not out there today, which is one of the reasons we had the
announcement earlier this week to make sure that we have access to the physical fiber as we started to deploy it more in
places like Boston around the country.
And as you say, the architecture doesn't exist today in terms of what we could acquire. So there's options here. We can
go out and we could build that fiber as we're doing in Boston and we also look at every way that we get access to that
fiber. That's what it's critically about is getting access to the fiber we need to deliver the solutions that we're looking to
do and there's multiple ways we can get there. So depending on the location, that may mean us building the fiber
network. If there's great assets already in place and as the opportunity to acquire them at a good price, then we would
certainly look to do that. And then there's also other ways to work with partners through leasing and other arrangements
where we don't have to build or outright buy.
So we will look at all those opportunities as how we get access to that fiber that we need to build the network of the
future and provide the solutions that our customers are going to want as we go forward. So as you say, we could do that
organically and inorganically. We're very comfortable and confident in the assets we have and adding onto them
ourselves, but if the right opportunity came along, we would look at that. And I think we've been fairly consistent about
doing that, and we've also been consistent about the impact on the balance sheet.
We believe in a strong balance sheet, but if the right acquisition comes along that allows us to add shareholder value in
the long run and is the right thing for shareholders and all stakeholders in our business, we'd look at doing that. But
we'd do it in a way that certainly reflected the need to have a strong balance sheet.
<Q - Brett Feldman>: And just as quick follow-up, is it fair to assume that if the choice was to do it organically, it
does require higher levels of capital investment? Because if the answer is no, then I guess the follow-up to that one
would be what would ultimately make an acquisition attractive? Is it really just speed to market?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah, there's a number of different aspects to it that would make it attractive, speed to
market, the quality of the asset that's there. And we look at all those things. But ultimately, if we have to build it
ourselves, we're comfortable doing so and we think we can do that relatively within our investment plans.
<Q - Brett Feldman>: Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Operator, Eunice, if you can please bring the next question in?

Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Hi. Thanks and good morning. Two if I could; one, on the net add disclosure, around the
over 100,000 net adds since the launch of unlimited, given the seasonality that exists in the first quarter, can you
compare that to a year-ago period and give us a sense of how net adds performed since unlimited relative to what it was
last year over the same timeframe? And then secondly, as you look at building small cells, I was wondering if you
could put the fiber deal into context in terms of how many small cells that could give Verizon and then how long does
it take to build that. I know it's a three-year deal that got announced, but what's the pace that investors should be
thinking about in terms of how many small cells Verizon can deploy in a 12-month period? Thanks.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. So, good morning, Mike. Thank you for the question. So I'll start with your first one.
We really don't break out the quarter, typically, in terms of the net add numbers, but when you look at year-over-year,
what you're really looking at here is the impact of going to the unlimited and really giving our customers the
functionality that they're looking for. And that was a decision we made and you saw an immediate impact in our
business. And we certainly do look at the month-by-month, and I can tell you that this isn't a seasonality in the first
quarter. The change we saw in the first quarter between the 398,000 negative number through the first half and then the
positive 109,000 in the second half was all about the response to unlimited as opposed to any significant seasonality in
the quarter.
And then in terms of your second question on small cells, so the fiber deal isn't just about building small cells.
Obviously, we will build small cells with this, but there will be other use cases as we go out. So we're not in a position
today to say the number of small cells that we will light up with this fiber agreement with Corning. I can tell you we
will continue to build the best-performing wireless network across the country, and we'll use small cells. We'll use the
new technologies in LTE and moving into 5G to do that, and this fiber will help us do that.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thank you.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Okay. Eunice, next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your questions.
<Q - John Christopher Hodulik>: Okay. Thanks. Matt, just a couple of questions on sort of the financials; first on the
wireless side, the postpaid ARPA was down 5.8%. Definitely a change in trend, as you mentioned. Could you talk
about the impact unlimited had? And the fact that it being that move happening mid-quarter, should we expect that
trend to worsen from here or do you think you've gotten most of the spin-downs out of the way?
And then secondly, in terms of the guidance, you kept the guidance for the year that you had, despite revenues being
down sort of 4.5% and earnings being down about 10%. Could you talk a little bit about some of the sort of drivers to
getting back to sort of flat on both of those metrics for the year? Thanks.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. Thanks of the questions, John. So I'll start with your first one around wireless revenues
and the ARPA decline. So as I look through the quarter and see what happened in the wireless revenues, we have the
continuation of the migration of the base to unsubsidized pricing, but, in addition to that, what we also saw was a
reduction in overage revenues. And this really was as much about the continuation of people migrating to the plans we
launched last summer with safety mode and rollover data as it was about unlimited. We've seen a good amount of our
base already roll over to those plans where the overage starts to decline.
And as we go forward, we should expect to see that continue in the second quarter, and then we expect we'll see the
trend in wireless service revenues start to improve in the second half of the year. So we do think you'll see another

quarter of some pressure in wireless ARPA before we see it head up again. And, look, the other piece that's in the
wireless number is when we were down close to 400,000 net adds in the first part of the quarter. Those were revenues
that we didn't bill in the second half of the quarter, but we saw the reversal in those trends and look forward to that
piece continuing.
So on the guide, if I go back to the guide real quick here, what we said is on an organic basis, we'd be fairly consistent.
But when you look at the first quarter a year ago, it was $1.06, and that included about $0.10 from the assets we sold to
Frontier. This year, we had $0.95, and as Mike mentioned, there was about $0.02 of pressure in there from the
acquisition. So I think we're in line there.
From a revenue standpoint, they're down 4.4% on an organic basis year-over-year. As I said, the service revenue we
expect to improve, the trajectory in the second half of the year. The big thing around the revenue for the year is going
to be equipment revenue. As we've gone to the unsubsidized pricing, we recognize that equipment revenue at the time
of the activation of the handset. We'll see what happens in the back of the year. We'll see the new devices that come to
market. We'll see how the holiday season goes, and that will be a key driver of getting to that revenue target.
<Q - John Christopher Hodulik>: Okay. Thanks, Matt.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Eunice, next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thanks very much. Good morning. I wonder, Matt, if you could just talk a little bit more
about capital spending for the year. You've obviously talked a lot about densification and so forth. The range is quite
wide. You reiterated that today. Wireless was quite light this quarter. So how should we think about mid-range, low
end, high end, and the trajectory through the year? And we were certainly getting a lot of questions about your Corning
deal. $1 billion dollars is a big contract, but I think Lowell was making the point that that's consistent with your overall
capital spending needs. So is this something where it's consistent with the kind of spending you're expecting or have
been doing and continue to do or is this a real step-up in your fiber spending? Thank you.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Thanks, Simon. So on the last question, the Corning deal, so as you say $1 billion over three
years, it's certainly not a small number. When you look within the overall context of our capital spend, it certainly fits
in there. So as we go and build out fiber assets, I think you'll see us do that within our total capital spend. Yes, you see
us spend more on fiber as we go forward, but historically you've seen moves within our capital spend between different
components. So this increase in the fiber spend will be offset by reductions in other areas, and that's the trend you've
seen consistently for us.
In terms of capital spend for the year, the first quarter was certainly a low quarter than we sometimes see, but the first
quarter is often a low capital spend quarter for us. So, that's about where we expected it to come in. In terms of the
guide for the year, it's too early in the year to say exactly, but we'll be in that range. I'm confident we will be in that
range, and as we go through the year, we'll provide more insights into where we think we'll end up.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Great. Thank you.

terms to the wireline businesses for the two months that it did in the quarter? And then also, Matt, it looks like taxes
were actually a source of cash this quarter, but we are expecting cash tax outflows for the year. Could you kind of
elaborate a little bit on that? And then, I guess, just lastly just a housekeeping question. I guess based on the comments
you made about the kind of exit rate for subscriber additions in 1Q, should we be extrapolating that kind of run rate
performance into 2Q and the rest of the year? Thanks.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. So on XO Communications, I would say you'd see nominal impact at the earnings
level from that transaction in the course of the quarter. Your question around cash taxes, what you're seeing there is, as
you say, first quarter is typically light from a cash taxes standpoint just because of the timing of when payments are
due. As you go through the year, previously we had said the cash taxes would converge closer with the ETR rate.
Because of some of the activity we had in the quarter with the discretionary pension contribution and the liability
management activity, cash taxes were now actually coming in a lower rate than the ETR for the year. So, that's an
improvement to the cash expectation for the year.
From an exit rate of the first quarter, it's too soon to, say, just purely extrapolate that number out, but certainly we are
very confident that the offering has resonated very strongly with the base both in terms of improvements in churn and
also an uptick in gross adds. We continue to see that. The rest of the quarter will play out based off of new devices that
hit the market and then also the competitive response especially as we head into Mother's Day and then the Dads and
Grads period in June. But we do look forward to a better trajectory from the business with an offer out there that's
certainly resonating with customers.
<Q - David William Barden>: Thanks.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Hey, guys. Thanks. One sort of short one and maybe one longer. First, churn in handsets
remains below 0.9%, but it looks like it was up a lot year-over-year or was the problem in the first six weeks of the year
much more gross add driven and not really a churn problem? And then second and it sounds like Lowell is not on, but I
thought the CNBC interview went really well and explained the fiber densification and 5G plan. But were his
Bloomberg comments really – they were confusing. I think they confused a lot of investors. Were they misconstrued or
did he really open the door on deals like Disney, CBS and Comcast? And if so, what's changed since he clearly shot
down speculation of interest in CBS in December? Thanks.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Thanks, Phil. So on the churn question, I think it's – as you say, the first half of the quarter,
we did see an uptick in churn and then we saw it come back down in the second half with the response to unlimited.
Look, we had a lot of customers in the base who loved being on the Verizon network and the performance they get, but
certainly managing their data was a pain point. It was another thing to deal with in their lives and so there was some
interest from the unlimited functionality, and as other people are offering that, we saw some people choose to make that
trade-off between quality of network, but not having to manage their data.
And so as soon as we went to the unlimited offering and we gave people the option of not having to make a trade-off,
they could have unlimited data and be on the best network, we saw an immediate improvement in the churn number
where our base is saying this is where we want to be, and we've certainly seen that continue as we head into the second
quarter.
Now your second question. So, okay, there's obviously been a lot over the past 24 hours around this. But let's break this
down. Lowell was asked the question in an interview about if a certain company called and wanted to talk, would he
take that meeting? And he responded, sure, we'd take that meeting. And then for emphasis, he added on just like if a
couple of other companies called, we'd take the same meeting. What this really comes down to and is consistent with
what he said on the CNBC interview was, we're looking at how we execute our strategy. We're confident in executing

our strategy organically, but if there's the right opportunity out there to accelerate the strategy inorganically in a way
that adds shareholder value, we're always looking at those opportunities.
But I think the story was a little taken out of context. He was answering the question about if somebody called, would
we take the call and would we have a conversation with them. Of course we would. But we're also very confident with
the assets we have and the plans we have of developing the business in an organic fashion as well and generating
shareholder value.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: That's helpful. Thanks, Matt.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Eunice, next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Hi. Thank you. So I know you are going to get tired of trying to be asked all these same
questions the same way, but if I take the answer that you just gave describing the situation with respect to M&A, is that
to say that the status quo of your network densification strategy, do you view that as a sufficient solution then? And do
you have confidence that that sort of re-leads Verizon to a network superiority position?
And then lastly, if you could just comment on – you talked about the momentum into the second quarter. Could you
comment on whether you think the dynamics, as we enter the second quarter, are actually a bit better? Sprint has moved
off of some of its most aggressive promotions. Do you think that the competitive intensity has moderated even a little
bit or are we still in that same bad cycle that we were in in Q1?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yes, I'll take your first question there. Look, you made a comment there, Craig, about re-lead
in network superiority. That would imply that at some point we've given up the lead in network superiority and that
clearly hasn't happened. You can look at any of the third-party results of the testing they do over the past year, and you
can see, if anything, we've widened the lead. So network superiority will continue to be at the forefront of what we do.
We're very confident that the customers value that and we're very confident that we will lead as we move into 5G, we'll
have that network out there first, have customer offerings around that technology out there first, and that will give us an
opportunity to work to continue to expand the business just like we have with previous generations of technology.
In terms of your dynamics in the second quarter and the marketplace, look, we'll have to wait and see. Right now, we're
very happy with how the customer base is responding to the offers that we have out there. We'll have to see what the
competition does and we will continue to be competitive in the marketplace, but we will do that in a disciplined fashion
and we'll see how the quarter plays out.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jennifer M. Fritzsche>: Great. Thank you very much. Just on the follow-up question about network superiority,
that's true, every third-party report seems to have Verizon by a wide lead ahead, which leads to the question about
spectrum. I realize you can't comment on the most recent auction, but can you just talk, Matt, in general how
comfortable you are with your spectrum position as you see it now? And then for the 11 markets, can you comment on
what spectrum you'll be using for that last mile of the 5G?

<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. Good morning, Jennifer. So for the 5G trials that we're doing, we're using the 28
gigahertz spectrum that we have the right to use as part of the arrangement we have with XO.
In terms of your broader question about our spectrum position, we're very confident in it. Approximately 50% of our
current spectrum holdings are delivering our 4G usage today. We have significant opportunities to continue to grow
within the spectrum holdings that we currently have. We're re-farming spectrum, as we've talked about for a while. We
still have the AWS-3 spectrum and then on-license will come into the portfolio as we go forward, too.
In addition to using spectrum, though, the way the spectrum is used continues to get more efficient based off of the
network architecture and advancements in the technology. LTE Advanced, we've talked a lot about. There continues to
be additions to that. And so as we look forward, we're very confident that we have the spectrum we need to continue to
deliver the best-in-class 4G experience.
<Q - Jennifer M. Fritzsche>: And, Matt, if I may, just one quick follow-up, so nothing you've seen since late
February with the usage that's come from unlimited, it seems that nothing has changed in terms of the need for more
spectrum. It just would be consistent with what your prior comments were.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah, we obviously saw an uptick in usage, but it was as expected. One of the reasons we
waited until February to launch unlimited was, we said to ourselves if we're ever going to do unlimited, we are not
going to do it at the expense of the core brand promise, which is the network performance. And so we spent a lot of
time in the back half of last year asking ourselves is the network ready for unlimited. We did a lot of testing around the
network. And so we concluded that the network was ready for that. What we've seen since we launched from a usage
standpoint and it's been in line with our expectations. The other important thing, of course, is when we launched it, we
gave ourselves the opportunity to network manage when a user goes past 22 gigs. And so, that's an important point in
managing the network in an unlimited world. And so we're very comfortable with the experience we've seen so far.
<Q - Jennifer M. Fritzsche>: Thank you very much.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Eunice, next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Hey, guys. Thanks. Matt, just maybe a comment on the margin trade-off of the ARPA
changes that we've seen. Lot of promotional activity, and you guys have done some yourself there. That sort of versus
the lower volumes that we're seeing out there and I guess just trying to get a sense for whether or not wireless margins
have sort of seen their peak, if you will. And then with respect to the sub losses, unlimited obviously had a positive
impact, but it just seems like network quality is no longer resonating with consumers. I'm just trying to get a sense for
how you guys think about differentiating against the peers going forward, other than just the simple rate card?
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. So on your last comment around network quality resonating, I would say that
completely disagree with that statement. We know from talking with our customers that network quality matters, that
they value the quality of our network. The fact that they have the reliability to get on the network and stay on the
network, no matter what they're doing or where they are, is tremendously important to them. And that shows up in the
churn rate that we have coming in below 0.9% for eight quarters in a row and certainly the improvement we saw there
post-launch. So this narrative that network no longer matters, I think we completely disagree with, and I think that
shows up in the numbers and the results that we show.
In terms of the margin trade-off, I think, look, when you look in there into the ARPA decline, this is a continuation of
the decline because we're breaking apart the service revenue and the handset revenue. When you look at the [ph]
IARPA (46:36) number, which is really the billings we give the customer every month that includes the handset billing,
that's still up year-over-year. So we continue to feel good about that trajectory.

And as you think about our move to unlimited, we did it in a way where we added the functionality, but it wasn't a
price reduction. We think that this offer will be ARPA neutral over time. We'll initially see the impact of optimizers,
and we'll also see the impact of reduced overage, but we also have the ability for customers to come on the network on
a metered plan and then step up over time and even our base is stepping up from some of the lower data buckets to get
on unlimited. So there's some offsets there that we think means that unlimited is not going to be a reduction in ARPA.
And this is why we say when we introduced it, we did so in a disciplined fashion, which is something you should
expect to see from us as we go forward and respond to the marketplace.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Great. Thanks.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Eunice, next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thanks very much, and good morning, folks.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Good morning, Amir.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Building upon that last question, when you folks originally introduced your outlook for
2017, there was an expectation for a push-out in terms of the recovery or the growth of service revenues. Given where
we are today, how should we think about the potential drivers for service revenue growth in future periods? You
originally called the unlimited plan introductory, and I'm just trying to think about the different moving factors and
where we could see that potential opportunity to drive service revenue growth in the future. And then, I've just got one
follow-up from here.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Okay. So on the trajectory, we still feel confident that we'll see an improvement in the
wireless trajectory as we go through the year and a stronger overall result from a year-over-year number versus last
year. Now, what we will see is in the second quarter, we'll see a continuation of the impact of the optimizations, both to
the customers that came onto the Verizon plan last summer and also on unlimited. But then the back half of the year,
we'll see the trends start to improve and we continue to be confident that we'll see wireless service revenue get back to
positive on a year-over-year basis during 2018.
So I think the big thing as you look there is we continue to keep pricing at the right levels, we have the opportunity to
step customers up. And as we are more successful in adding customers in the marketplace, as we showed in the back
half of the quarter, that gives us the opportunity to move those trends in the right direction.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Great. And then one follow-up to some of the prior commentary you made. You discussed
this idea of longer term shareholder value in the event if some sort of opportune inorganic asset comes to market. What
parameters do you sort of gauge that shareholder value by? I know you have remained committed to de-levering the
balance sheet to those pre-Vodafone levels during the 2018 and 2019 period. I was wondering is there flexibility
around that if the right asset was to present itself or any color you can provide around that would be most helpful.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. Absolutely. So I think there's been a little surprise by some comments we've made over
the past few months around this and really internally there was no change in how we view this. We certainly have the
target to get back to that leverage ratios and credit metrics as we discussed, but we've always believed and maybe it's
just because we have said it more explicitly over the past few months, but, look, if you give me two options, option A is
an opportunity comes up and I say no, I can't do it because it means I couldn't hit that leverage target or option B is I do
a transaction that allows me to accelerate the strategy of the company, improve my competitiveness in the marketplace
and do it in a fashion that allows me to improve shareholder value versus the first option, but it means that I have to
push out when I get back to those leverage targets, it's the right thing to do to do the second option. If it means we push
out when we get to those targets because we have a great opportunity, we're going to do that. There's no change there,
but I will say that we continue to be committed to a strong balance sheet whether or not we have any inorganic activity.

<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Great. Thank you very much for the incremental color.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Eunice, we'll take one more question.
Operator
And your last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Timothy Horan>: Thanks a lot, guys. Matt, it seems like some of your competitors have really been aggressive
on slashing OpEx and CapEx, and I note now we've had a little bit more time to look at Verizon, what your competitors
have done. I guess do you have the ability to do the same thing and maybe a little color around this reorganization,
what that kind of means in terms of expense reductions over time? Thanks.
<A - Matthew D. Ellis>: Yeah. So I'd say they've been talking about these reductions in OpEx over the past year or
two. I think you've heard us talk about it for more years on that now. We continue to look at and manage the cost of the
business down, and I think you see that in the results. You certainly can see it clearly in the results in the wireline
segment, for example. So we look at managing OpEx and reducing it not as a program for a year or two, but something
we do every year. Every year, we have cost reduction targets for each of the business units, and they diligently work on
those and have a great track record of delivering them.
As I think about CapEx, one of the great things about our business is we produce a significant amount of cash flow that
allows us to continue to invest in the business. And we do that so that we position the business to be able to deliver
products and offer our customers just for today, but as we head into the future because of the nature of the business
we're in, we're always looking at least one to two years out in terms of what we need. So we continue to do that and
make sure that we're providing the connectivity solutions that our customers need as we go forward.
However, saying that, we look at how we continue to get more efficient in that and you'll see us continually do that.
The cost to add capacity in the network continues to come down and it comes down because of the things our network
team has done for many years and how we work with the vendors in the space. So we don't make as much of a big deal
about what we do to manage OpEx and CapEx efficiencies, but I can absolutely guarantee you it's a key focus within
the business and we have a great track record of doing that.
In terms of the reorganization, I think, look, this is just an opportunity to make sure we stay focused on the key things
to us which is the network and continuing to build the network, not just a network of today but the networks we need
going forward, the focus on managing the customer base and growing the base, retaining the base and generating
loyalty, and then generating those new businesses, whether that be in the media co, telematics or the broad IoT space.
So it was really to make sure the organization is aligned with those strategic goals of the company.
<Q - Timothy Horan>: Thank you.

Thank you for your questions. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn the call back to Matt for some closing comments.
Matthew D. Ellis
Thanks, Mike. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. The first quarter showed our ability to compete
effectively in a financially disciplined manner. We remain confident in our strategy and priorities, led by investing in
our networks, creating platforms to further monetize data usage, maintaining a disciplined capital allocation model, and
creating value for our customers and shareholders.
We are positioning the company for long-term growth. A key foundational element of our vision of the future is our
strong network assets. Our strong networks will enable us to be at the center of this new connected world of people and
