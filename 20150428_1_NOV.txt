Clay C. Williams
Thank you, Loren. And welcome, everyone, to Version 2.0 of National Oilwell Varco's first quarter 2015 earnings
conference call. This morning, we announced that the company earned $0.76 per fully diluted share in its first quarter
ending March 31, 2015. Excluding charges related to a voluntary retirement program, the writedown of Venezuela
assets and a discrete nonrecurring foreign tax exposure, fully diluted earnings per share were $1.14, down 33%
sequentially, down 12% year-over-year excluding other items from all quarters.
Revenues were $4.8 billion in the first quarter of 2015, down 16% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year.
Consolidated operating profit, excluding other items, was $692 million, or 14.4% of sales in the first quarter.
Decremental operating leverage was 37% sequentially.
First quarter EBITDA, excluding charges, was $837 million, or 17.4% of sales. This compares to $1.2 billion in the
prior quarter and $1 billion in the first quarter of last year, excluding other items from all periods.
Business in the first quarter of 2015 declined significantly in response to lower oil prices. We entered 2015 with oil
prices half of what they were just a few short months ago.
Now, all commodity prices signal producers to add or diminish supply, and oil is no exception. So in the first quarter,
with global supplies outpacing global demand by 1.5 million barrels per day, the oil price signal rolled through our
industry like thunder, and thunderstruck participants responded vigorously.
Spending is falling in almost all regions, driving the worldwide rig count down by a third since September. The rate of
decline of active rigs, most acute across North America, is breathtaking and unequaled in prior downturns.
NOV saw activities and orders slow in just about all areas of our business, and all of our units are experiencing pricing
pressure. Most of us in the oil and gas industry have been through downturns many times before and have honed our
skills at rapidly adjusting spending through the cycles. So following record results for National Oilwell Varco in the
fourth quarter of 2014, our revenue declined 16% in Q1 and is expected to decline further for at least the next few
quarters.
There's been much debate as to the shape and timing of the eventual oil price recovery. We don't know if we are in for a
V-shaped or a U-shaped or a W-shaped recovery, but we will all know soon because the industry is conducting its first
grand global empirical test of price elasticity of the supply of oil. What we do know is that North American oil shales
are emerging as the new swing source of oil.
Since 2011, in a $100 per barrel price environment, North American oil shales grew about 4.5 million barrels per day
while the rest of the world posted a 0.5 million barrel per day production decline.
We know individual shale wells decline exceedingly quickly, eight times to 10 times the rate of conventional resources.
We know that the sharp, rapid decline in the addition of fresh and new producing wells of all kinds will result in
diminished global oil production over time. We also know that excess productive capacity around the world, the
oversupply, is, thankfully, just a few percent, far less than my first downturn of the 1980s.
We also know that global economic activity, which drives oil demand, is not strong and that lower oil prices will act as
an economic stimulus to many economies.
The facts, as we know them, point to a pretty good foundation for an eventual recovery.
All wells, all fields and all basins left wanting for investment inevitably decline. And economies need more energy to
grow, so demand for oil will grow driven by the engine of people desiring a better standard of living. Eventually supply
and demand curves will cross. And we will see oil prices signaling producers to get back to production growth. We just
don't know when and, frankly, we can't wait for the eventual recovery.
Therefore, 2015 will be a year for restructuring at NOV. Given our short-term lack of visibility into the timing of the
recovery, our approach will be to focus on costs without sacrificing our long-term opportunities. We are managing our

infrastructure to the market, reducing costs as utilization levels permit. This began in earnest in the first quarter when
we reduced SG&A 8% coming off exceedingly high levels of utilization last year.
We started with a voluntary early retirement program for our long-serving employees and this is being followed by
reductions in facilities and work force as utilization dictates. We are working to insource more of our production needs
as utilization declines across our manufacturing plants with a goal of preserving as much work as possible for our
plants and our teams. We expect to pull in about 650,000 machining hours from our vendors this year and another
600,000 machining hours next year in our Rig Systems segment, for example. And comparable efforts are underway in
Wellbore Technologies and the other segments as well.
While reductions in contract, labor, overtime, and shifts help mitigate decrementals, we will face under-absorption
overall. We are also under pricing pressure and requests to cancel work, which we are vigorously opposing. We are
seeking to structure discounts around volume-related rebates, tied to payments, and expanded product purchases, in
effect picking our points to try and win greater share, defend volumes and improve absorption in our plants. We don't
want our customers to get out of the habit of buying from us, to maximize our market position when the inevitable
recovery comes.
This downturn is an opportunity to become better. We have long focused on operational excellence, continually
evolving to utilize modern techniques to be the best manufacturer. This downturn will drive us to improve efficiency in
a supply chain straining through the last decade to accommodate extraordinarily high demands from our customers.
Through the last decade, NOV responded with an exceptional level of effectiveness to a macro cycle upgrade to the
fleet of equipment the industry relies on. The next challenge for us is to retrench and transform, to pivot to new
opportunities that are emerging and to continue to lead the industry. To that end, we will continue to invest in numerous
long-term growth opportunities to execute our long-term strategic plan.
Technology and equipment have transformed our industry to enable accessing new frontiers like deepwater and to
access new sources of hydrocarbons from poor quality reservoir rocks like shales. NOV's DNA is to continue to apply
purposeful innovation to continually expand the opportunity set of attractive investments for our customers.
This is a tough market with tough challenges but they are not new to us.
Given the difficult oil price backdrop, our first quarter orders were weak for our Rig Systems segment. We booked
orders of $236 million, half of what we booked in the fourth quarter of 2014. We also booked a $99 million adjustment
to our backlog related to FX related to contracts denominated in foreign currencies. Since the costs associated with
these are also denominated in those same foreign currencies, there is no margin impact – percentage impact, only a
revenue impact.
Shipments out of backlog totaled $2.25 billion, yielding an ending backlog of $10.4 billion, down 17% sequentially.
The quarter included two jack-up packages and a handful of land rigs mostly targeting Middle East and Latin America
markets.
Our outlook for orders for the second quarter is marginally better but will remain slow as customers who need
equipment are taking their time ordering. Areas of comparative strength are seen in platform rigs, fleet spares,
components and software upgrades to improve [ph] trippings (09:01) efficiency offshore – think iron roughnecks and
handling tools, and BOPs, land rigs and well service rigs for Latin America and the Middle East.
We continue to see growth in SPS projects despite some being postponed, some rigs being stacked or retired which had
planned SPSs and others seeing their scope reduced. We believe contractors are seeking to differentiate the efficiency
of their offshore rigs in a crowded marketplace and this will shape our near-term offshore rig orders, and that a desire
for Tier 1 AC land rigs in international markets will characterize the next few quarters for land demand.
We also expect many more offshore rig retirements in addition to the 30 plus already announced, which will speed the
inevitable fleet high-grading process and bring offshore rig supply/demand into better balance.

Many of our North American land customers indicate they want to pursue upgrading their fleets to Tier 1 in advance of
a potential 2016 recovery. In the short run, though, we expect continued soft orders as contractors struggle with lower
day rates, cannibalize components off of stacked rigs in lieu of placing new orders with NOV.
Installation and commissioning activity around our existing offshore newbuild backlog remains very high. However, in
several instances, we and the shipyards are working with the drilling contractors to delay rig deliveries. This helps the
drilling contractors postpone stacking cost on un-contracted newbuild deliveries, and it will help us manage supply
chain, freight and installation and commissioning costs more effectively and level load across our operations.
We are also curtailing activity related to our Brazilian rigs, which I'll speak to more in just a moment. As a
consequence, we are, in effect, shifting offshore revenue out of backlog into subsequent quarters. This will impact our
near-term Rig Systems segment revenue forecast.
Near-term total revenues for the Rig Systems segment will decline significantly in the second quarter due to this effect,
as well as the expectation of lower revenues associated with land rig shipments in the second quarter. We expect
second quarter revenues for this segment to be in the range of about $1.8 billion, down about 30% sequentially.
Within our backlog at March 31 are orders for 22 drilling equipment packages for floating rigs for Brazil totaling $3.3
billion. At the time of our last call, the ultimate customer for these rigs, a financing vehicle 10% owned by Petrobras
called Sete, was within a day or two of securing long-term financing to get current on payments to the Brazilian
shipyards building these rigs, which are NOV's contractual customers.
Unfortunately, the corruption scandal in Brazil was linked to Sete just prior to signing, which resulted in the banks
backing away from the proposed financing package then on the table. Since then, our Brazilian shipyard customers
have come under significant financial stress due to a lack of payments from Sete. Currently, we understand that the
banks and the shareholders have granted Sete a 90-day window to seek a solution to its financing struggles, and we
know that there is an intense level of activity around securing permanent financing solution involving several banks.
The origin of the rig-building program in Brazil arises from public policy goals set forth by the government to foster a
local oilfield services and shipyard industry, to employ more Brazilians, and, thus far, Petrobras remains contractually
committed to employing these locally built rigs once they are completed. There are specific requirements within the
lease concessions for pre-salt blocks granted to Petrobras by the Brazilian government which require local content
ranging from 37% to 55%. According to the Brazilian press, these local content requirements have created over
120,000 jobs in the country. We therefore continue to believe that there is considerable political pressure in Brazil to
ultimately get these rigs built. We believe these rigs will eventually get built.
We are engaged with our shipyard customers in Brazil, however, to adjust manufacturing schedules for the now
delayed programs and are slowing activity pending payment. Our contracts are still in place and the downpayments and
progress billings we have achieved thus far exceed our investment as per our contracts. One of the four shipyards we
are working for has continued to pay us due to their Asian partner stepping in to finance operations there.
During the first quarter, we recognized $172 million in revenues associated with the program, about 7% of total
segment revenues, but this will slow substantially for at least the next couple of quarters, contributing to our lower
guidance for Rig Systems' Q2 revenues. And apart from the derricks on these rigs, the components we have built in
WIP are marketable in the event of ultimate default, which we still consider unlikely.
Overall, we remain confident in the eventual monetization of our existing contractual Rig Systems backlog, both in
Brazil and elsewhere, and are working with customers to modify schedules to accommodate the challenges they are
facing and to ease the stress on our supply chain.
Turning to our other segments, revenues from Rig Aftermarket fell 15% sequentially, more than we expected as drilling
contractors curtailed expenditures sharply, much more than we'd anticipated. We typically see the first several weeks of
the year slow seasonally as contractors set budgets and then see spare parts orders and repair services pick up in March
as contractors begin work under their new annual budgets.

However, this year, the March pickup never came and April has remained soft. We expect flattish sequential revenues
in the second quarter with rising SPS work and relatively strong demand in the Middle East, offset by mounting price
pressure on repair, services and drilling expendables, which will drive margins lower by a couple of hundred basis
points. Our strategy within Rig Aftermarket is unchanged, to capitalize on our leading and growing installed base of
NOV equipment to provide OEM support close to our customers' rigs.
The Wellbore Technologies segment declined 23% sequentially with all major business units posting declines and
significant price pressure tied to drilling activity. Drill pipe sales declined the most, coming off an exceptional fourth
quarter which was near a record, and orders for drill pipe slowed to a trickle in the first quarter as most operators are
cannibalizing pipe from idled rigs in lieu of buying new pipe.
Looking into the second quarter, we expect Wellbore Technologies to decline in the double-digit percentage range at a
high decremental margins as discounting continues to outpace the speed of our cost reductions.
One bright spot within Wellbore Technologies is our IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe unit and new closed-loop drilling
automation services through our Dynamic Drilling Solutions business unit that continue to attract operator interest
through demonstrated reductions in drilling times. We are very excited about the potential of this technology to
transform drilling efficiency and materially improve E&P drilling economics in shales in the deepwater and in other
basins around the globe.
Completion & Production Solutions segment revenues declined 28% sequentially at 28% decremental margins as most
products within this group saw sliding demand. Our backlog for Completion & Production Solutions segment declined
18% during the first quarter as net new orders of $327 million were offset by revenues out of backlog of $563 million
and an FX adjustment of $81 million.
Demand for composite pipe and process and flow products saw book-to-bill levels close to 1 in the first quarter but we
saw sharp declines in pressure pumping equipment demand. Orders for flexibles and FPSO products also fell short of
revenues out of backlog. Ending backlog for the first quarter was $1.46 billion.
We are pleased that our FPSO turret business achieved record revenue levels in the first quarter with great progress on
existing projects. Interest by IOCs and NOCs in our FPSO strategy has risen considerably through the past few quarters
as operators are actively seeking to pioneer new ways of constructing these complex vessels to achieve on time, on
budget deliveries and ultimately improved development economics.
The industry appears to be latching on to our standardization and modular construction thesis recognizing that we must
do things differently to develop the billions of barrels that have been discovered in the deepwater. Design one, build
two is a great idea.
We are engaged on a dozen or so projects. But project awards are going slowly as most are conducting extended feed
studies to reengineer and recalibrate costs and waiting for deflation in the supply chains.
We continue to believe that NOV's extensive experience in managing complex equipment, vessel integration projects
and shipyards positions us well to pioneer a better way in FPSO construction.
As we expected, our pressure pumping product sales fell sharply during the first quarter as customers delayed picking
up their orders and pressed hard for pricing concessions. We closed three facilities within the unit during the first
quarter and continue to reduce costs within our supply chain. North America was hit hardest but the Middle East and
other international markets are more stable, a recurring theme through many of our businesses.
Looking to the second quarter, we expect revenues to decline a few percentage points, but margins to fall further as the
full force of discounting kicks in. Obviously, our second quarter outlook across all our segments is very guarded and
our situation is fluid. While we face a difficult market near-term, we will be looking for revenues to stabilize across Rig
Aftermarket, Wellbore Technologies, and Completion & Production Solutions in the second half of the year, and we
will manage Rig Systems to the backlog and work available in the marketplace.

The significant drilling cost deflation underway will benefit producers, a modest oil price rebound coupled with lower
drilling costs may bring about some green shoots of activity in the second half, and we'll be watching closely. But as I
said, we plan to manage to whatever size the market is across all of our businesses quarter-by-quarter. Prior downturns
in our industry have provided great opportunity for those with capital and foresight to look through near-term adversity.
NOV is a remarkable franchise. We are also at the forefront of several transformative trends in the oil business.
Closed-loop drilling automation and FPSO supply chain management are two I mentioned earlier. Add to the list the
key global supplier of pressure pumping and coil tubing technologies, which have enabled hydraulic fracture
stimulation and the shale revolution; gas tight conductor connections, thermal desorption technologies to clean up drill
cuttings for safe disposal; RFID technologies to track the myriad of assets used by this industry; flexible pipe systems
for subsea developments, water desalination, de-oiling and sand separation technologies; real composite pipe for flow
lines, bits, drill pipe and top-drive used to set a world record on an extended-reach well exceeding 8 miles a few weeks
ago; permanent magnet advancements for rotating equipment.
Although the industry is still in the early innings of upgrading to AC electronic-controlled rigs, we are at work
designing the next generation of drilling rigs, and we will be there with new and better technology for the inevitable
upturn.
We continue to invest in technology and new products to grow organically, and we will continue to pursue interesting
acquisitions in this environment, making sure that we are very disciplined about valuations in view of the current
market challenges. We closed two transactions, so far, in 2015 and have several more negotiations underway.
We have also retired 10% of our shares outstanding through the past several months given our stock-price downturn
because we view it as an extraordinary opportunity to reduce our cost of capital in a historically low-interest-rate
environment. Our debt increased $1.1 billion as a result, but with our $3 billion cash balance, net debt is still only $1.2
billion, about 6% of capitalization. I will note, too, that we are currently slowing our share repurchases in view of some
potential acquisition candidates coming into sharper focus.
I am proud of the leadership NOV employees provide in this endeavor. While the current market is very tough, we are
well positioned with strong financial and operating resources and an industry-leading installed base of complex
equipment in need of continuing close OEM Aftermarket support. I am grateful to all of the great NOV employees who
are remaining focused on taking care of our customers through this difficult time.
We announced last week that our CFO, Jeremy Thigpen, has left us to become CEO at one of our important offshore
drilling customers, Transocean Limited. We appreciate Jeremy's leadership through 18 years of service here in both
finance and operations, and we wish him and Transocean the very best.
Our very talented Chief Accounting Officer, Scott Duff, has agreed to serve as Interim CFO, as we conduct a search
process for our next CFO. And our long-serving Vice President of Investor and Industry Relations, Loren Singletary,
here with me today, will pinch hit on today's call to step us through the detailed financial results by each segment.
So with that, let me turn it over to Loren.
Loren Singletary
Thank you, Clay. National Oilwell Varco Rig Systems generated revenues of $2.5 billion, down 1% sequentially, but
up 12% compared to the first quarter of 2014, as we continued to execute on our backlog, completing 14 offshore
drilling equipment packages in the quarter.
Operating profit for the segment was $488 million, yielding an operating margins of 19.3%, down 70 basis points both
sequentially and year-over-year. EBITDA was $511 million or 20.3% of sales. Q4 to Q1, offshore revenues, which
represent 75% of the segment total, declined slightly and land revenues, which represent 25% of the segment total,
remained flat. Segment margins fell slightly as bad debt accruals more than offset cost reduction efforts in the quarter.

Now let's discuss capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for National Oilwell Varco's Rig Systems. In the first
quarter, we received $263 million in new orders and recognized $2.25 billion of revenue out of backlog, and an FX
adjustment of $99 million, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.11 times and a quarter ending backlog of $10.4 billion, down
17% sequentially.
As Clay mentioned earlier, orders were half of what they were in Q4, and Q1 was one of the first quarters in recent
history where land bookings outweighed offshore bookings. Of the total $10.4 billion in backlog, approximately 91% is
offshore and 92% is destined for international markets.
As we move into the second quarter of 2015, Clay noted that the NOV Rig Systems revenues will decline as much as
30%. We expect revenue out of backlog to slow to the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion from Q1's $2.25 billion as
we ship fewer land rigs and see the impact of accommodating certain customers' requested delivery modifications for
offshore newbuilds.
We believe margins will decline into the mid-teens percentage from 19.3% in the first quarter. Our goal is working
with our customers on these scheduling modifications to maximize the margins on contracts we have in hand and to
maintain our core team capable of exceptional performance. This is the right thing to do for our franchise and for our
shareholders.
As we have noted many times before, NOV and our shipyard partners have been extremely busy scaling to large
numbers of offshore floating newbuild projects through the past few years, most with build schedules of less than three
years, which is a considerably faster pace than the four-year-plus delivery schedules that characterized orders from
2005 through 2008.
This shift has resulted in higher costs from a supply chain and NOV infrastructure straining to accommodate these
more aggressive delivery schedules. Our record results of 2014 to meet these demanding deliveries drove up over time
and air freight and extended our supply chain past optimal cost.
Spreading the work out now to later quarters gives us time to manage our supply-chain cost down, to achieve lower
pricing from our vendors, to avoid excess overtime cost, and to tackle these projects with our core team in a more
efficient, more measured way. And as Clay noted, it helps our customers cope with their stacking cost on certain
un-contracted rigs.
Our revenue recognition out of backlog will likely be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for the next few
quarters. And we expect total segment revenues for the second quarter to be in the range of $1.8 billion.
Our outlook for further offshore newbuilds remains subdued for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, we do expect to
see some orders for offshore capital equipment as our customers seek efficiency driven upgrades and spare parts to
support their existing rig fleets and SPS activities that will occur.
On land, we expect to see continued demand for Tier 1 AC driven land rigs in international markets, particularly the
Middle East and Latin America. Given our outlook, we are aggressively managing costs down on all fronts.
National Oilwell Varco Aftermarket generated revenues of $719 million in the first quarter of 2015, down 15%
sequentially and down 4% compared to the first quarter of 2014.
Revenues fell harder than anticipated as a precipitous decline in land rig activity and stacking of relatively younger rigs
negatively impacted demand across the Aftermarket business. Operating profit for the segment was $199 million,
resulting in operating margins of 27.7%, down 110 basis points sequentially, but up 220 basis points year-over-year.
Decremental margins were 35% and EBITDA was $206 million, or 28.7% of sales.
While there is some seasonality in the first quarter revenues for Aftermarket, the sequential decline was driven
primarily by depressed activity levels. Uncertainty in the marketplace led to our customers' reduced spending and
consuming existing inventories, cannibalizing existing idle rigs, postponed repair and upgrade work while they watched
and waited, like us, for signs of market normalization. Margins contracted on a reduced volume and the discounts made
in selected areas to maintain existing customer relationships.

Land represented an increased percentage of total segment revenues, up 20% in the fourth quarter to 25% in the first,
driven by higher activity in Asia and the Middle East. Additionally, we recently expanded our service and repair
facilities to align more closely with our customers' operation, including two new facilities in the United States to
support activity in the Permian and the Marcellus.
As we move into the second quarter, we believe National Oilwell Varco Aftermarket revenues are stable and will
remain flattish with a slight increase in spare parts and rising SPS work, offset by rising discounting pressures.
Revenues from SPS activities, which occur on a five-year basis, have become much harder to time as some likely
candidates for survey work are stacked or retired amidst the challenging offshore market conditions. But nevertheless,
our SPS project count is set to grow in the second quarter.
Operating margins will remain under pressure and may decline slightly from Q1's 27.7% for several reasons. In the
second quarter, we will see the full effect of discounts we made for key customers in the first quarter, mostly in repair
and services and competitive drilling expendables, and we anticipate our customers to choose lower-margin repair work
over refurbishment programs, preferring to do the minimum required for maintenance versus large SPSs.
Our longer-term outlook for this group remains very bright owing to the significant upgrade and rig technology at work
in newer, more modern fleets with higher mix of NOV equipment and much larger installed base which carries a
pressing need for greater OEM aftermarket support.
For the first quarter of 2015, National Oilwell Varco Wellbore Technologies generated revenues of $1.2 billion, down
23% sequentially and 8% compared to first quarter of 2014, reflecting drilling activity declines. Operating profit for the
segment was $124 million, resulting in operating margins of 10.6%, down 750 basis points sequentially and 690 basis
points from the first quarter of 2014.
Sequential decrementals were 42.5%, which were slightly better than anticipated owing to swift cost reduction efforts
across the board. EBITDA for the segment was $229 million, or 19.6% of revenue.
NOV Wellbore Technologies carries a disproportionately large amount of the company's total $190 million D&A load
due to intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions, manufacturing and service facility infrastructure, and a
sizeable rental fleet, and two of the segment's larger business units.
Drilling activity drives NOV Wellbore Technologies. Though drilling activity has not completely abated, average
global rig count fell 25% from the fourth quarter average. National Oilwell Varco Wellbore Technologies may be a
global business but it has a significant exposure to North America where rig count declines were the most severe. In the
first quarter, U.S. rig count activity fell by nearly 800 rigs, declining 66 rigs per week on average. In 2008 and 2009,
during the financial crisis, the pace of rig count declines averaged 55 rigs per week at its deepest point.
In Canada, unseasonably early breakup meant rig count was down 40% below the previous year. Our largest businesses
were some of the most affected by the depressed activity levels, namely downhole tools, bits, motors, drill pipe, and
solids control and waste management equipment.
In the current environment, our customers are pressing hard for discounts and are committed to preserving our
market-leading – and we are committed to preserving our market-leading positions during the downturn.
We are currently experiencing the fastest land rig count – U.S. land rig count decline in 20 years and the outlook
remains tenuous. Looking into the second quarter of 2015, we believe Wellbore Technologies will be down mid-teens
percentage from $1.2 billion on lower activity levels, and margins could decline to mid-single digits from 10.6% with
mid-40% decrementals, similar to the first quarter sequential leverage.
Fewer rigs drilling fewer wells imply less demand for Wellbore Technologies' tools and services.
Where there is demand, competition will be high and pricing pressure will be very fierce. We are actively reducing cost
across the segment to reflect reduced activity levels, but cost reductions lag revenue declines as we right-size service
and manufacturing infrastructure. Nevertheless, the cost reduction measures we are taking will better position us when

the market does turn.
In today's lower commodity price environment, our customers remain focused on improving economic and drilling
efficiencies. At NOV, we are developing new technologies that will help them achieve their goals such as tectonic drill
bits, which we are introducing at next week's OTC, new proprietary threads on drill pipe, and closed-loop drilling
automation systems.
We continue to believe that new products are the lifeblood of any technology company, and we are proud to say that
even in today's down market our new technologies are gaining traction. And we will continue to innovate on
next-generation technologies.
National Oilwell Varco Completion & Production Solutions generated revenues of $948 million for the first quarter of
2015, down 28% sequentially and 5% compared to the first quarter of 2014. Operating profit for the segment was $108
million, resulting in an operating margins of 11.4%, down 480 basis points sequentially and 290 basis points
year-over-year. Sequential decrementals were 28%. And first quarter EBITDA for the segment was $163 million, or
17.2% of sales.
Q4 to Q1 demand declined almost equally for both shorter cycle, activity-driven revenues and revenues from backlog.
Declines were primarily driven by nearly 40% reduction in revenues for higher-margin offshore completion equipment,
and strong fourth quarter deliveries did not repeat in the first quarter, and North American completion activities slowed.
Segment revenues related to production, both on land and offshore were also negatively impacted by the reduced E&P
spending.
Now let's discuss our capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for National Oilwell Varco Completion &
Production Solutions. In the first quarter, we received $327 million in new orders, and recognized $563 million of
revenue out of backlog, along with an $81 million FX adjustment, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.58 times, and a
quarter ending backlog of $1.5 billion, down 18% sequentially.
Orders were down 30% from the $469 million won in Q4, although orders for composite pipe, processing technologies
showed relative strength in the quarter. Of the total $1.5 billion backlog, approximately 69% is offshore and 82% is
international.
As we move into the second quarter, we believe revenues will tick down slightly from $948 million recognized in the
first quarter. We expect revenue out of backlog to be in the range of plus or minus $500 million.
Given the current market uncertainty, we anticipate reduced demand and increased pricing pressure for equipment and
technologies across the segment, which will reduce margins into the high single-digits, which implies low 20%
decremental margin.
As in other segments, we are actively reducing costs in the NOV Completion & Production Solutions to reflect lower
levels of activities. Our order outlook for onshore completion equipment remains soft, particularly for the North
American pressure pumping market as customers struggle with lower utilization of existing equipment – as customers
struggle with low utilization of existing equipment. We see customers cannibalizing spare parts and using existing
stock whenever possible, but expect demand for repair and maintenance to return well in advance of orders for full frac
spreads and coil-tubing units.
By nature, the FPSO-related bookings are uneven quarter-to-quarter. In today's lower commodity price environment we
expect orders to slow as customers recalibrate cost for offshore production projects although feed-related activities and
interest in pre-salt work continues.
Now, let's discuss our financial statements. Working down the consolidated statement of income for the first quarter of
2015, you will see across, the gross margin declined 270 basis points sequentially and 200 basis points year-over-year
to 24.4%.
SG&A decreased 8% or $42 million sequentially, as we continued to make efforts to reduce cost across all business
segments. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was up 90 basis points sequentially, and 40 basis points year-over-year to

10.1%.
Other items were $122 million in the quarter due to charges related to our early retirement plans. Interest expense and
interest income were flat sequentially at $26 million and $5 million respectively. As compared to 2014, interest
expense remained $26 million and interest income increased $1 million from $4 million.
Equity income in our Voestalpine JV decreased $7 million sequentially to $9 million, as demand for casing and drill
pipe, and therefore green tube, moderated. Compared to the first quarter of 2014, equity income slightly decreased by
$1 million. For the second quarter and full year 2015, we believe year-over-year, equity income will continue to fall as
demand for casing and drill pipe decreases.
Other expenses for the quarter was $56 million, which represented a $36 million delta sequentially primarily due to
fluctuations in foreign currencies and write-offs. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.6%, which was an
additional 9.5% over the 28.1% rate that we posted in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding discrete items in the
quarter, the company's effective tax rate would have been 28.9%. We believe that a 30% to 31% effective tax rate for
NOV continues to be a realistic estimate for the remainder of 2015.
If you'd now quickly turn to the first supplemental schedule, you will see that eliminations were $541 million for the
quarter, down slightly from $556 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $227
million in the quarter, down $2 million sequentially on lower volume of intersegment revenues.
And finally, if you turn to the last supplemental schedule, you'll see that depreciation and amortization expense in the
quarter was $190 million, down $9 million from the fourth quarter of 2014, and $1 million from the prior year.
EBITDA for the first quarter, excluding other items, was $837 million or 17.4% of sales.
Turning to the balance sheet, our March 31, 2015 balance sheet employed working capital, excluding cash and debt of
$5.8 billion, up $355 million or 6.6% sequentially. Several factors contributed to the increase, and we expect working
capital to convert to cash and begin to fall later in the year.
The largest impact stems from our net of cost and excess of billings and billings in excess of cost and customer
prepayments, which, together, make up the level of customer financing of our working capital and are tied to
prepayments and progress billings.
As orders have declined, downpayments have declined, and our progress on projects is outpacing our progress
payments, which we saw in the previous downturn of 2009, and which will continue for the next few quarters.
Working capital impact of this was $425 million in the first quarter. Offsetting items include our accounts receivable,
which decreased $392 million, or 9% sequentially, due to lower revenues. Inventory increased $97 million or 1.8%
sequentially, mostly due to the transfer of certain short lived – mostly due to the transfer of certain short lived
downhole rail tools from PP&E into inventory.
While inventory is declining across most businesses, others still received – are still receiving components ordered into
construction schedules, so we expect inventory to begin to decline later in the year as we adjust our supply chain. We
also had some customers postponing receipt of orders due to market conditions which should turn around in this
quarter. Also, leading to a sequential increase in working capital, accounts payable, accrued compensation, and accrued
liabilities decreased $419 million, which they do every year in the first quarter.
For the quarter, the company generated $114 million in cash flow from operation. Capital spending for the first quarter
was $130 million, down 44% sequentially. In the quarter, we also made dividend payments of $85 million, and we
spent $1.33 billion to repurchase 24.5 million shares, for a total of $2.1 billion in share repurchases under our $3 billion
authorization.
To fund share repurchases, we – in the quarter, we borrowed $1.1 billion using our commercial paper program, which
increased total debt to $4.2 billion. And our net debt to capitalization to a very manageable 6.4%.

As a result, we ended the first quarter of 2015 with a cash balance of $3 billion, down $512 million sequentially. Of
that $3 billion in cash, almost 7% of the balance was in the U.S. at March 31, 2015.
In summary, we saw spending and orders slow in all areas of the business as lower commodity price drove down E&P,
capital spending, and drilling activity. And we have a challenging quarter ahead as we see the full impact of reduced
activity levels and pricing pressures on our business.
As an industry, we are actively reducing costs throughout the supply chain as we seek new levels of efficiency. While it
is early and uncertain, we are encouraged as rig count declines begin to slow, and we get closer to trough levels.
Deflationary cost may entice improved levels of activity. And as our industry improves from a contraction mode to an
expansion mode, NOV will start to see the full effect of the cost reduction efforts we are making today. Our continued
investment in technologies, capacity, and aftermarket support have made us the oil fields' preferred equipment and
technology provider, and as we pivot to new opportunities, we expect National Oilwell to emerge a stronger, a more
resilient, and more dependable partner for our customers.
With that, we'd like to open up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
And from Raymond James, we have Marshall Adkins on line. Please go ahead.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Good morning, guys. As usual, a very, very thorough overview. We appreciate that. I don't
have a lot of real specific ones. I want to ask just kind of a bigger picture, broader question, Clay. The industry
obviously has changed dramatically...
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: ...in the last few years. We're starting to see dollars flow more into the U.S. versus
offshore, given the improving economics here.
How do you see NOV evolving over the next five years? I know that's kind of a big picture question but I just want to
get a sense of how you adjust to the changing environment from one where you've dominated offshore rigs and were
improving your offshore completion stuff, to one where maybe more dollars are spent in the U.S.?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah. Yeah. Great question, Marshall, and something we're obviously continuing to think
about here.
We've benefited greatly from a lot of offshore rig building through the last decade and have been a big participant in
that. And we've also done a lot – we've been very transactional, we've invested a lot of M&A capital through the last
decade.
When we look back through the past 10 years, 97% of our M&A capital have gone into our other three segments,
really, away from the rig-building space, building out really interesting positions, trying to position us for option value
across multiple trends underway. So when we look at, for instance, a shale well drilling operation, what you see out
there is a tier-1 rig, premium drill pipe, downhole tools, mud motors. You see on the completion side coil tubing units
and coil tubing, frac spreads, sanders, mixing units, basically all of the picks and shovels, all of the hardware that go
into the unconventional shale trend, NOV is a global-leading provider of.
We look across the oilfield and we see opportunities in waste management, and so things like thermal desorption
technology to clean up drill cuttings, water management opportunities. We've got some great technologies around
osmosis cleanup and desalinization of water, de-oiling of water with our WaterWolf products. So, we're doing more on
the production side.

So this has been – we've had a steady application of capital into other trends recognizing that this industry always
changes. And over the past few years, of course, the big change are the shales have emerged as a much lower marginal
cost source of oil, and the deepwater had some challenges, but I also know from cycle to cycle marginal costs sort of
rearrange themselves. There's a lot of smart people in this industry focused on their particular resource base.
And with regards to the deepwater, I think certainly the marginal costs out there are coming down, and NOV plans on
being a part of that. So when it comes to building FPSO vessels, the industry has been challenged. We think we've got
some great ideas to apply there to bring costs down. The owners of the deepwater reservoirs are experiencing much
lower drilling cost with the deflation that's gone on in the drilling space.
And these joint ventures that you've heard about that are really focused on subsea processes, I think are going to have a
great benefit, too. There's a lot of hay to be made here with reducing back pressures on reservoirs, subsea liftings,
subsea separation. And I think you kind of add all that up, and marginal costs for deepwater reserves are going to come
down.
What we try to do at NOV is to position ourselves across these various trends, and really sort of maximize option value
in the participation of all these trends. So looking forward, we see great opportunity as all participants try to reduce
their marginal cost. We also see a lot more NOV equipment out there that's going to need a lot more aftermarket
support. And we've been investing in that footprint globally, and are going to be there to take care of those rigs.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: So, obviously, you've had this great transformation, you have an incredibly strong balance
sheet, and over the historical cycles, you always end up being better. Does that mean we transform this balance sheet
into more M&A, particularly in those three other parts of the business you've built up the last five years?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah. We are looking hard at what's next for NOV. And I think we're very, very good at
deploying capital into acquisition opportunities and then integrating those and maximizing returns on those
opportunities. And so, we are engaged in lots of conversations out there. There's a big merger you may have heard
about. We're really interested in seeing what comes out of that. So all these downturns provide pretty extraordinary
opportunities to deploy capital, to kind of reposition ourselves for the next upturn. And so that's what we're looking to
do. And I'm actually pretty excited about that.
We're doing the painful things, reducing costs as required, but the more fun aspects to think about through the
downturn are what do we look like when we come out. And our plan is to be stronger and better and to maximize
opportunities in the downturn.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Great work, guys. Thanks.

<Q - Kurt Hallead>: So you guys, again, I echo Marshall's comments about providing excellent information.
Appreciate all that info. At your Analyst Day back in November, you guys outlined very long-term outlook, kind of
predicated some of it, or at least based some of it on the Exxon's 40-year outlook or so on, so forth. I don't imagine in
six months' time that really changes a 40-year outlook. But given the dynamics in the offshore drilling business, how do

you assess the prospective structural decline in this cycle versus any other offshore drilling cycle that you may have
been a part of, Clay or Loren, however you may address that?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yes. We talked very explicitly at our Analyst Day about basing our strategic plans on a
generational look at oil and gas supply, which the ExxonMobil outlook 2040 is. And certainly – but the other thing we
highlighted at that conference, if you remember, Kurt, is the fact that we go through cyclical downturns. And so, this is
not – where we are today is not a surprise to us. I think the challenge for management is to make sure we're looking
through this and continuing to work on our long-term strategic plans and execute our long-term vision, which is still
very, very exciting.
With regards to the offshore, like I mentioned earlier, all sources of crude are continually working on reducing their
marginal cost to slide down that marginal cost curve and not be the last barrel produced in terms of economic
efficiency, and the offshore is absolutely no exception.
And so what's encouraging about what we see today is that – you know, at $100 a barrel, there's not as much incentive
to do things differently. When the oil price drops to $50 a barrel and the IOCs have found, for instance, 5 billion barrels
in the Lower Tertiary in the Gulf of Mexico, there's a strong incentive to figure out. They know the resource base is
there. How do we figure out how to produce that at lower cost, and they've got the extra tailwind of drilling process
deflation. Pricing is dropping for services on drilling those wells, on the rigs required, the day rates around the rigs
required to drill those wells. And so it's a pretty good backdrop to do things differently, and there's a lot of active and
constructive participation from our customers around that. We will bring the marginal cost down on subsea barrels.
<A - Loren Singletary>: Yeah. And I might add, Kurt, that even in the darkest days of the 1980s, we never went a
year when we didn't sell an offshore rig, whether it was a jack-up or a floating rig of some sort. And I think that with
the retirements and the scrapping of offshore rigs today at new high levels, I think that we'll get a balance of offshore
floating rigs sooner than later.
And so we're probably in a new paradigm, really, for the offshore market. But the next couple of quarters, maybe the
next year or so, are going to be pretty skinny. But we will still be selling a few rigs in each year.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: That's a great point. And the rigs that are working out there are going to need components for
replacement and they're going to need components for upgrade and that's kind of the base business we survived on in
the 1980s and 1990s.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. Great. And then maybe a quick follow-up here is, when you talk about a number of
different M&A transactions and prospective businesses that may have to be sold, or at least the ones that Halliburton
already put on the market, do you see this as a potential transformative opportunity for NOV? I know you guys have
typically not wanted to be involved in the services element of things. Or you guys pretty much going to remain the
equipment provider of choice? How are you assessing the outlook here?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: You know, we're all about deploying capital into interesting situations to enhance
competitive advantage and enhance our franchise. And so, we tend to look at all opportunities continuously and
reassess what we are, where we're going continuously. So, I'll leave it that way. But this – we're always looking for
opportunities to deploy capital for the benefit of our shareholders.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: All right. Hey, thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: You bet. Thank you, Kurt.

<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Good morning.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Actually, a question along the same lines, and I'm going to widen it a little bit here. So, a
couple of recurring queries and sort of a subtext of this call is the prospects for transformation. And so I guess my
question is similar to what was just expressed. The circumference of plausible industrial fit, has it widened? And same
question with regard to scale, in terms of a size of the deal that you're willing to do and the price that you're willing to
pay for it.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Not much of which I can answer – or will answer very quantitatively. We maximize returns
by trying to minimize capital going into these opportunities. We're a veteran of many, many, many transactions. We've
done this many times before, and built up global leading franchises around the world across pretty much all that we do.
We're number one in just about everything that we do, and that's very central to our strategy. And so in terms of what
comes available, not just out of the big red/blue merger we've all been talking about, but more broadly, what's out there,
what's possible, we're always looking at opportunities.
But the cornerstone of that effort really resides in market leadership. We've been very clear we think market leadership
carries a demonstrable competitive advantage in this space. We think we reduce risks for our customers by being
market leader. We think scale gets us up learning curves faster. It supports broader global networks to deliver products
and services and equipment, lets us leverage R&D efforts and introduce new products more quickly. For lots of reasons
market leadership carries lower risk and higher returns. And so that's pretty central to what we do when we evaluate
opportunities to deploy capital, Bill.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: And a question with regard to theory versus practice. I mean, clearly, right deal, right
scale, right size, you'll do it. I'm just curious as to practically speaking, given the catharsis of the last six months, has
the plausible opportunity set ex-Halliburton increased or do we need additional duration to this downturn in order to
increase the number of possibilities and also narrow the bid/ask spread?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah, the longer – yeah, that's a key thing what you said last. We need sellers to reset
expectations. And so we're helping them do that.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. Thanks very much, guys.

Clay, perhaps you could give us an update on how the current pipeline of prospects compares in North America versus
internationally, and certain focal technologies or niches within the divisions were you ideally would make a move?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: I'm going to be a little cryptic around that because I don't really want to tell my competitors
my playbook. But what I would say is, again, we're focused on big picture trends in the industry, market leadership and
competitive advantage, and looking to deploy capital into those areas more broadly.
I will tell you specifically where we've been deploying capital the last couple of years has really enhanced our
Aftermarket business, in particular around rig. The rising installed base of NOV equipment and technology out there is

pretty transparent to you and everybody. And so, what we see are a lot more NOV rigs running, and a lot more
customers in need of close OEM support.
And what we find is these great little businesses that we can acquire. In fact, two weeks ago, I was touring one that we
bought in West Africa for instance, South Africa, that's been a great addition and great reputation. And what we've
been able to bring to that business is kind of the NOV global reach and scale. And so that's been a great help for our
customers in that region.
But around the world, all of our customers want us to be closer to the coal face, closer to their rigs for aftermarket
support. So that's an interesting area, and that's part of the reason at our Analyst Day, we said, hey, growth prospects
for rig aftermarket long-term are terrific, and we're putting capital behind that.
In other businesses, again, we've got opportunities to grow those, expand their footprint, and so, kind of a similar
pattern.
<Q - Thomas Curran>: And should we think of you adhering to the same reluctance you've exhibited thus far within
Wellbore Technologies about pushing any further into new services that would lead you to compete directly with some
of your oilfield service customers?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: We're always kind of reevaluating our business model and does it make sense? And you
know, frankly, there's already some level of competition within that business, and that's very common across oilfield
services. It's not uncommon for competitors to sell to each other in one product line and compete on another.
And so – but we think about that very closely. We don't want to unnecessarily end up in a competitive conflict situation
that really takes a toll on our P&L. So, I'll leave it there.
<Q - Thomas Curran>: Thanks. I'll turn it back.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: You bet. Thanks, Tom.

Thank you. We will now turn it back to Clay Williams for closing remarks.
Clay C. Williams
Thanks, Brandon. Appreciate everyone's patience this morning, and apologies for the technical difficulties that we
started off with.
I really also want to thank our terrific employees for the hard work that they all put in here every day. And although we
have a pretty challenging road ahead, we're adapting quickly, we have lots of opportunities emerging to launch new
products and to acquire some pretty interesting businesses and really position ourselves for the upturn.
So we're doing what we got to do in the short-term, looking through that for opportunities in the long-term. And I know
we will emerge better and stronger. And again, thank you, all, for joining us. We look forward to updating you in July.
