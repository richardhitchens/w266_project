MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Second Quarter 2014 ConocoPhillips Earnings Conference Call. My name is Christine and I will be
your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct a
question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, Vice President Investor Relations and Communications. You may
begin.
Ellen R. DeSanctis
Thanks, Christine, and thanks to our participants for your interest. We know it's a very busy day. On today's call Ryan
Lance, our CEO and Chairman, will provide a very brief overview of our strong operational performance for the
quarter. Jeff Sheets, our EVP of Finance and our Chief Financial Officer, will then address the financial results for the
quarter. And finally, Matt Fox, our EVP of E&P, will cover the operational highlights and our production outlook for
the rest of the year. Finally, we'll turn call over to you for Q&A. We would ask respectfully that you try to limit your
questions to one plus a follow-up and then hop back in the queue if you have additional questions.
We will make some forward-looking statements this morning and obviously the risks and uncertainties in our future
performance are described in the Safe Harbor statement shown on Slide Two of today's presentation materials as well
as in our periodic filings with the SEC. That's also available from our website along with our GAAP and non-GAAP

reconciliations and supplemental data.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Ryan.
Ryan M. Lance
Thank you, Ellen, and let me extend my thanks to all of you who have also joined the call today and for your interest in
the company. We're at the halfway mark in 2014, and I'm pleased to say that our company's performance is progressing
consistent with our plans this year. Top line growth and margin expansion are showing up in our performance, and
we're delivering on our commitments.
The second quarter was certainly a volatile one geopolitically and there was a lot of sector activity on the domestic
front, all of which we of course watch closely. But we continue to take what we believe is a sound, long-term approach
to the business, so we're staying the course and sticking to our plans. And our goal as we've mentioned numerous times
is to deliver predictable, consistent performance, and I think we achieved that again this second quarter.
Operationally the business ran very well. We produced 1.556 million BOE per day from continuing operations
excluding Libya, which represented growth of 6.5% year-over-year. Now adjusted for down time in Libya, we grew
underlying volumes 4% this quarter compared to one year ago. And this performance exceeded our prior guidance,
which Matt will cover in a bit more detail in his comments. But our growth came from several places, notably the Eagle
Ford and the Bakken, but as well as recent start-ups in Europe, Asia Pacific and in the oil sands. And the work
continues to bring additional [ph] major (3:00) projects online later this year and into 2015 and 2016.
Now if I switch financially, the quarter was also very strong. Adjusted earnings were $2 billion or $1.61 per share.
That's up 14% year-over-year. Our cash flow from operations including the equity
affiliate distributions funded our capital and dividend for the first half of the year. That leaves our cash position
relatively unchanged from year-end 2013. And we're also seeing the visible margin growth, and that should accelerate
later in the year and into 2015 as our volumes continue to increase in high margin areas.
Now strategically while we're focused our high value asset base that has a lot of running room, we're also looking to
add organic options and choices through exploration. Today in addition to our unconventional and Gulf of Mexico
exploration activities we're drilling in Senegal and Angola. Now these two areas have higher risk, but also higher
reward if successful. And we recently took a position in a large exploration concession: offshore Nova Scotia. And
yesterday we announced the completion of our sale of our Nigerian business, and that's a big milestone that completes
the strategic divestiture program we announced two years ago. That program has generated nearly $14 billion of
proceeds for our company. But with these divestitures behind us, we're now fully focused on executing our growth
plans.
And finally, earlier this month we approved a dividend increase of 5.8%. Giving back capital to our shareholders
remains a top priority and we believe an attractive dividend is a key part of our investment offering.
So that's kind of a quick recap of the quarter. But let me just recap the key messages. The business is on track. We're
delivering on our commitments and are building a strong momentum for the second half of the year and beyond.
So with those brief opening comments, now let me turn it over to Jeff for a financial review of the company.
Jeff W. Sheets
Thanks, Ryan. I'll begin by reviewing the second quarter's results which are found on slide six. As you will see, it was a
straightforward quarter overall. Production volumes exceeded guidance and the balance sheet remains strong. Looking
at earnings: second quarter 2014 adjusted earnings were $2 billion or $1.61 per diluted share, 14% above last year's
second quarter. Second quarter earnings are shown on the chart in the lower right – segment earnings are shown on the
chart on the lower right. The financial details of each segment can be found in the supplemental data that accompanied

this morning's release but I'll highlight a few items for you.
The Lower 48 earnings this morning reflected ongoing volume increases led by Eagle Ford and Bakken, which
contributed to a 22% increase in Lower 48 liquids production year-over-year. This benefit was partially offset by wider
differentials and $85 million of higher exploration expenses as a result of the Coronado Miocene appraisal well and the
Deep Nansen wildcat well being deemed non-commercial. Canada continues to have a very solid year. This quarter's
earnings reflected strong bitumen prices and steady production growth. Alaska performed in line with expectations.
Europe production benefited this quarter from continued major project ramp and better-than-planned turnaround
activity. Sequentially, earnings in Europe were negatively impacted by lift timing, increased maintenance cost, and
lower natural gas prices. Our Asia Pacific and Middle East segment continues to perform well. Earnings this quarter
benefited from some favorable lift timing versus the first quarter.
One quick note on our Other International segment: effective this quarter we moved our Latin American and Poland
operations into this Other International segment. And our corporate segment results were also in line with guidance.
Lastly you'll see from our earnings release this morning that we have reaffirmed our prior guidance for capital, DD&A,
and our Corporate segment. Exploration expense guidance of $1.5 billion is also unchanged and includes risks/dry hole
expense. The outlook for production and SG&A cost is up modestly from our prior guidance to a range of $8.7 billion
to $8.9 billion from the original guidance of $8.5 billion.
If you turn to the slide seven I'll cover our production results for the quarter. As you know our convention for
production is continuing operations excluding Libya. On this basis, our second quarter averaged 1.556 million BOE per
day, which compares to 1.461 million BOE per day in the second quarter of 2013. This is a headline increase of 95,000
BOE per day or 6.5%. 2.5% of this growth was due to lower down time and 4%, or 60,000 BOE per day represents
organic growth. This 60,000 BOE per day of growth was essentially all from increased liquids production with the
largest source of growth being the Lower 48 unconventionals. Declines in North America gas production were offset by
increases in international gas production.
I'll review margin growth next on slide eight. This slide shows changes in cash margins from second quarter 2013 to
second quarter 2014 and also on a sequential basis. On the left side of the chart are the margins on an as-reported basis,
which were up 11% year-over-year and on the right are margins on a price normalized basis. So on a price normalized
basis, margins improved 2.4% year-over-year. Among the factors influencing margins in the second quarter were
positive impacts from lower production in Libya and a positive impact from increased liquids production in the Lower
48 and adverse impacts from increased cost levels and wider differentials.
As we have said previously, this metric will tend to be volatile on a quarter-by-quarter basis but we expect margins to
improve as we continue to shift production to higher-value products and to places with more favorable fiscal terms.
Once the heavy maintenance is completed in the third quarter, we expect to see stronger underlying margin growth in
the fourth quarter as higher margin volumes grow. And this sets us up well to achieve full-year 3% to 5% margin
growth in 2014.
Finally, I'll review our cash flow waterfall for the first half of the year on the next slide. As Ryan mentioned, we
remained cash neutral over the first half of the year. We began with $6.5 billion of cash and short-term investments.
We generated $8.6 billion from operating activities and also added $1.3 billion from the FCCL distribution earlier in
the year. With this we funded our capital program and dividend and ended the first half of the year with $6.4 billion in
cash and short-term investments.
The recent Nigeria closing will add net proceeds of approximately $900 million in third quarter. Recall approximately
$550 million of the $1.4 billion of sales proceeds were already collected and included in our cash balance.
I'll wrap up the review of our financial performance by noting that we continue to have a strong balance sheet, which
gives us significant flexibility to execute on our investment plans.
Now I'll turn the call over to Matt for an update on our operations.

Matthew J. Fox
Thanks, Jeff. As Ryan and Jeff already mentioned, the business is running well and we're delivering on our organic
growth goals. We exceeded our production guidance in the second quarter across several of our business segments but
particularly in the Lower 48. Now, some of this out-performance is probably not repeatable and I'll explain that in a
minute or so. More importantly, once we are through our annual turnaround activity in the third quarter, we expect to
accelerate our growth in the latter part of the year, and that's going to position us for a strong 2015 and beyond. So it's
an exciting time for the business.
So please turn to slide 11 for an update on our Lower 48 and Canada segments. In the Lower 48, second quarter
production averaged 540,000 BOE per day. That's a 10% overall increase from the second quarter of last year and
represents a 30% increase in crude oil production over the same period. Sequentially, volumes grew 33,000 BOE per
day or 7%. And the biggest contributors to growth in the quarter were the Eagle Ford and Bakken. The Eagle Ford
grew at 12% sequentially from an average of 140,000 BOE per day to 157,000 BOE per day. We experienced a strong
second quarter as we brought on a higher-than-average number of wells in March, commissioned a number of
compressor projects, and experienced flush production coming from the recovery of first quarter weather impacts.
The remainder of 2014 will see a flatter production profile, as we continue to move to multi-well pad drilling and the
medium term slows down the number of new wells coming on production. But production from those wells will start to
show up late this year and into next year. The Bakken was up 19% from last quarter, averaging 51,000 BOE per day
compared to 43,000 BOE per day in the first quarter. This growth was helped by flush production and backlog
reduction. We expect to have multi-pad drilling effects and we're anticipating winter weather impacts in the fourth
quarter, so the rate of growth will slow in the second half of the year.
The net effect of this is we're still on track to achieve our 2014 volume targets for both the Eagle Ford and Bakken, but
we do expect rates to flatten in the third and fourth quarters and then begin to ramp up as we head into 2015.
Unconventional appraisal also continues in the Permian and the Niobrara and we remain optimistic about these
emerging plays. In addition to our unconventional activities appraisal continues this year in the deep water Gulf of
Mexico on all four of our significant discoveries, Shenandoah, Tiber, Gila and Coronado.
Our Canada business also performed very well operationally during the second quarter. We produced 284,000 BOE per
day, which includes a 19% increase in liquids production year-over-year. In the oil sands, Foster Creek phase F is
expected to start producing in the fourth quarter of this year, and Surmont Phase 2 remains on schedule for first steam
in mid-2015. Our Western Canada program continues to deliver good returns with a large identified drilling inventory
and we continue to explore and appraise our unconventional plays in the Duvurney and Montney. On the exploration
front, we acquired a 30% working interest and approximately 5 million gross acres off the coast of Nova Scotia, and
drilling is expected to begin there in late 2015.
Next I'll cover our Alaska and Europe segments on Slide 12. Alaska average production was 193,000 BOE per day in
line with expectations. At CD5, the Alpine Central facility's tie-in project has begun and oil fabrication is now under
way. This project remains on track for start-up in late 2015. In the second quarter, we resumed export from our Kenai
LNG plant in April and we've already sold two cargos. We're also making good progress at our drill site 2S, Greater
Mooses Tooth 1 and 1H New NEWS projects. 1H NEWS is the third new project we have initiated since the passage of
the More Alaska Production Act last spring.
On June 30, the AK LNG parties executed a joint venture agreement. In addition, we have jointly applied for an export
license from the Department of Energy, so we're making progress on the technical work to assess the feasibility of this
project as a way to monetize the significant north slope gas resource base. Finally, we recently executed a contract for a
new build rig to begin drilling in 2016. One last point on Alaska, as you probably know, Alaskans will vote in August
on whether to uphold the More Alaska Production Act commonly known as SB21. And we certainly hope the
legislation prevails. We believe it's important for continued oil and gas development in Alaska. We have identified and
are actively developing opportunities for growth.

Moving on to Europe, second quarter production averaged 213,000 barrels a day, up 23% year-over-year, reflecting
major project start-ups at Ekofisk South, Jasmine, and EIS, as well as lower down time than the second quarter of last
year. During the second quarter of this year, we completed our J area turnaround work ahead of schedule and brought
on line the Jade J12 exploration well. The Britannia long-term compression project is on track to start up later this
quarter. Sail away and installation of the topsides was completed at Eldfisk II and the project remains on schedule for
early 2015 start-up. We have significant turnarounds under way in the U.K. this quarter. This will impact third quarter
volumes as expected but overall the Europe segment is operating well and remains on schedule to deliver on its growth
commitments.
Now let's review our Asia Pacific and Middle East segment and our Other International segment on Slide 13. In APME,
we produced 322,000 BOE per day in the second quarter, roughly flat with last year. But the segment remains
positioned for high margin growth in the second half of the year and into 2015. Our partner-operated Gumusut project
is progressing towards first oil late in the third quarter. In June, the topside sailed away for our Kebabangan project and
was successfully installed, and we remain on track for first production there in the fourth quarter.
At AP LNG, the first Condabri gas processing facility started up this quarter, and that was an important milestone for
the upstream project. On a combined downstream and upstream basis, this project is now about 75% complete and
remains on schedule for a mid-2015 start-up. Finally, we continued evaluating opportunities with ongoing appraisal,
offshore, in Australia at Poseidon and Barossa.
In our Other International segment, the key 2014 activities are exploration related. Currently we're drilling the
Khamosh well in Block 36 in Angola and the FAN well in Senegal. We expect to have some initial drilling results in
these wells later in the year. In Poland, we recently safely completed a 25-stage 7.5 million pound hydraulic stimulation
of the Lablabo well, and we'll shortly put the well on an extended flow test. And in Colombia, we expect to begin
exploration drilling in the La Luna shale later this year.
Our volume outlook is shown on slide 14. So this is our typical chart of quarterly volume guidance for continuing
operations excluding Libya. The first and second quarters represent actuals, and the third and fourth quarters show our
expected ranges which are unchanged from prior guidance. However, our full-year range has narrowed and the
midpoint has increased to reflect our strong operational performance year to date. As expected, third quarter production
drops primarily due to customary planned down time. And this year the key areas for scheduled turnarounds include
Alaska, Canada, the U.K., and Bayu-Undan. Importantly the Bayu-Undan's shutdown which will take about 36 days
will include brownfield activity for the tie-in of two new sub-sea wells that should come on in 2015.
We expect to achieve a strong finish to the year with an exit rate of over 1.6 million BOE per day. By the fourth quarter
our turnaround should be complete and several additional incremental projects should come on line in the U.K.,
Malaysia, and the oil sands. In addition to these, we should have ramped gas sales to QC LNG in Australia which are
scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter. The bottom line is we expect to deliver 3% to 5% production growth this
year with strong momentum going into 2015.
So this concludes my comments, and I'll turn back to Ryan for closing remarks
Ryan M. Lance
Thank you, Matt. So our story this quarter is really no different than our previous several quarters. We're focused on
delivering our stated goals of 3% to 5% volume and margin growth while returning capital to our shareholders through
an attractive dividend. Our capital plans are on track. Cash flow neutrality is getting closer, and we continue to create
options and choices to sustain our long-term success. So we're following the plan and the path that we laid out over two
years ago, and it's working.
So with those comments, I'll turn it over back to the operator, and we'll take your questions.

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great. Thanks, everybody. If I could start with one on the U.S. onshore. I appreciate the clarity on
the trajectory over the second half of the year. But I guess if we look at the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, I know you're
quite active in both, on both spacing pilots and then in the Eagle Ford as well with the upper Eagle Ford there. Any
comments on what you have seen so far and what the trends are in that direction?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So we're still executing all of those pilot tests. We announced earlier this year that we had
enough evidence accumulated to go to what we call an 80-acre high-low development plan in the lower part of the
Eagle Ford. So we're implementing that now. And we're continuing the pilot test looking at the upper Eagle Ford and
looking at tighter spacing there. And the same comments really apply in the Bakken. We're still looking at the
opportunities to tighten up well space and other layers. But there's nothing really new to report there, Ryan this quarter.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then if I could, maybe one follow-up on the cash margin trends. I mean,
there was a slight downtick there, and I realize this is on a quarter-to-quarter basis, it's pretty dangerous, but slight
downtick in 2Q. Were there mix-shift issues? Can we think about I guess how mix shift affected this? Was it a result of
some of the cost increases that we saw in the quarter and looking forward over the rest of the year with the heavy
turnaround schedule in 3Q, how would you expect trends to go?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, yeah, I think you have the correct observations there, Ryan. Mix shift continues to be a
pretty substantial positive for cash margins. What we saw this quarter is that was offset somewhat by wider
differentials that we saw across our portfolio. When we look at cash margins, we do a price normalization based on
how much marker prices have moved. And when we don't see the same kind of movement in realized prices that we
saw in marker prices, that has adverse impacts on cash margins, and that was the case this quarter when we saw some
wider differentials across the portfolio. And we did see some level of higher costs as well, but mix shift is still
long-term what's driving higher cash margins, and we're going to continue to see that trend develop.
I think your observation at the very beginning, this is going to be volatile from quarter to quarter is something that
we're going to continue to emphasize. But if you look over the whole year, as we mentioned earlier, we are on track to
be in the 3% to 5% margin growth range on a price normalized basis.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: That's great. Ryan, your comments on the cost increase side, on the cost, was some of that driven
just by the fact that you guys have raised production guidance a little bit, with the higher production that has brought a
little bit of higher cost, or was it all inflation?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: There's a bit of that – both of those in there. If you think about kind of what we have done with
cost guidance overall, if we started the year with cost guidance of $8.5 billion; that compares to a number that was
more like about $8.25 billion or so last year. So we increased our cost about equivalent to what we were projecting
production growth. And what we're finding is a little bit higher production growth and just a little bit higher cost than
what we have seen before. There's not any one particular item that we can point to on costs. But costs are generally a
couple percent higher than what we thought at the beginning of the year.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great. I appreciate that. I'll leave it there.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Thank you.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks Ryan.

<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Folks, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was curious: some of your peers
in the Eagle Ford have applied and received permits for exporting condensate. And I'm curious if you can comment as
to whether, for one you have applied for a similar permit and if not do you think that would be something that could
benefit your realizations in the basin?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, thanks, Blake. We're aware of what a lot of people are doing on the export. We've been
out pretty publicly as a company supporting and advocating on behalf of not only the common state exports but the
crude oil exports as well which we think the condensate solves a very, very small problem. The larger issue we're
having in North America, as you're aware, is the growing light oil production and the inability or the capacity being
used up in the refining sector to really absorb that, creating some of the differential issues that Jeff talked about and
even facing back. But we follow it pretty closely. Right now we're getting most of our condensate to the Gulf Coast,
putting it on ships and getting it around. We don't see the net back. But certainly we watch it pretty closely, and if we
think there's an advantage to doing that, we'd be in talking with the Department of Commerce as well.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Okay. Great. The second question, this is probably a long shot, but in the past, you had
used proceeds from asset divestitures to buy back stock. I fully appreciate that you're kind of past that program. But at
least looking first half of the year, you're technically cash flow neutral and I'm just curious if there would be any
consideration to maybe use those proceeds to buy back some additional stock?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, no. Thanks, Blake. I appreciate it. I think, as I said before, we're kind of executing the
plan we laid out, and that plan from a couple years ago, we knew we were being a little bit short of cash flow neutrality,
but we grow into that by 2016. So we're really using the cash on the balance sheet to fund the programs that we've got.
We made those assumptions at modest commodity prices. As commodity prices have maybe been a little bit higher
than our expectation, it's freed up a little bit of cash. But it's really going to our investment program and to the extent
we can fully fund all of our high quality investment programs, we'd consider share buyback at that point in time. But
right now it's being used to fund our dividend and our capital program.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Thank you, Ryan.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Thanks, Blake.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: Hi everyone.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: Hey guys. Your CapEx is high relative to the $16 billion that you've guided to on an annual run
rate. Could you talk about whether you're tempted to spend a little more given things are going so well for you, and I
particularly – I noticed that the exploration expenses are up, so whether or not that – you may be spending a bit more
on exploration given as I said things are going so well? Thanks.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: CapEx for the year is running pretty much right on track with our guidance. We guided to $16.7
billion for the year and I think we're $8.1 billion through half of the year, so a little bit less than the CapEx base. We
still think we're on pace for about $16.7 billion for the year on capital.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: And are you going to keep that flat going forward? I mean, I'm still working I guess back on the
old number of $16 billion as the run rate that we were working towards when you started.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yes. As we talked about at our analyst presentation in April, I think we see capital in kind of in
the $16.5 billion, $17 billion range for the next few years.

<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: Yeah, I think what I'm trying to drive at is really the exploration program and whether or not
you're happy with how much is being spent there and whether or not you'd consider spending more.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, I would say, Paul, we're taking advantage of some opportunities. We talked about Nova
Scotia. We're drilling now in Angola and Senegal both. I kind of view sort of the capital, the $16 billion that we talked
about is kind of running this year at about $16.7 billion as we said earlier at the analyst meeting. But that's looking at
opportunities that we have in the portfolio and some of the extra cash we're getting from the higher commodity prices
and deploying that into places we think are adding value both in a little bit faster pace in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and
some of the exploration that we're doing around the world.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: And deepwater Gulf of Mexico?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes, so we have an appraisal program going there, Paul, and all of our existing discoveries,
and that's what dominates our exploration capital for this year in the Gulf of Mexico.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: Okay. I get it. I'm just trying to really focus on the idea that we want to keep the capital down,
but I understand that particularly in the GOM, there was potential to spend more on outright exploration. You can
successfully close the – keeping it on the cash theme, you successfully closed the Nigeria deal, which I think was pretty
much the last one if I'm not wrong off the previous program. Is there potential for you to further improve the cash
balances by more, another round of major disposals? Thanks. And I'll leave it there. Thank you.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Thanks, Paul. Yeah, no, I think in terms of the announced sort of large disposition plans,
Nigeria really completes that out of what we talked about when we spun the company a couple years ago. As I tell
people, we continue to look at the portfolio and try to high grade it as opportunities present themselves, and we'll
continue to look at that. But I don't see another major capital disposition program or announcement that you'll see
coming from us. But we'll be constantly looking at trying to high grade the portfolio and clean up the bottom end and
focus all of our investments in the top end of the portfolio that really is driving the growth and the higher margins and
the returns.

Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Good morning, Doug.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: In Australia, it appears that exploration or maybe appraisal success has continued recently
near the Poseidon discovery which I think Matt might have alluded to, and on this point I wanted to see if there were
any updates there and also whether one type of development is more likely than another. Meaning is this hopefully
going to eventually feed the LNG facility nearby? So just a general update on that situation is what we're after.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Okay. Thanks, Doug. We're getting close to completing our appraisal program in the Poseidon
complex, and we designed that program to get us the information we needed to do exactly what you were asking, Doug,
to make sure that we are optimizing the development plan for Poseidon. We've got the same goal in mind and the
exploration that we have just commenced in the Barossa area. So basically this appraisal activity is designed to
establish what's the best backfill opportunity for the Darwin LNG plant, for example.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Doug.

Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Hey. Good morning. Actually, good afternoon. Just actually a quick follow-up on
Australia. I mean how much gas do you think you'd be able to get over above AP LNG from sort of sales to other
projects in the area? I think you mentioned QC LNG gas. Any sort of rough order of magnitude?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Well, it depends very much on when these projects start. We do intend to take the opportunity
to sell ramp gas to those projects, but the exact magnitude of that will be dependent upon the timing of those start-ups
relative to our start-up. So it's hard to put a number on that just now. But we have the capacity available to provide
those ramp gas sales when the opportunity arises.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: All right. I'm going to get to something more closer to home, but any progress on
Venezuela? Or timing around that?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah Ed, on Venezuela, we're in discussions with the tribunal both sides, ourselves, and the
Venezuelans are now putting in their damages assessments and putting forward their – our positions with respect to the
damages that were created from the tribunal's earlier award indicating that we were unlawfully expropriated by the
Venezuelans. So that award has held. We're in the process now of damage assessments on both sides and we're saying
that that probably takes about a year to go through that process. It started a few months ago. But that's kind of the
timeline that we're operating under.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Okay. And then moving back into the U.S., I mean, let's just talk briefly about the
Permian. I think in your Analyst Day slides, you were testing an area over in the Delaware and then the sort of
Southern Midland. And I think you gave some numbers. I think it was 150 million acres in the Delaware and I think
just under 100 million acres in the Midland. So first question, are those the total acreages that you have in those two
shale basins? Or is it just those two sort of areas that you're testing. And maybe give us some color about the recent
well results and your rig plans for those two basins as we go forward. And then I have a quick follow on.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Okay. So those numbers that you quoted, 150,000 acres and 90,000 acres respectively for the
Delaware and the Permian, those really represent the acreage where we're looking at unconventional development.
We've got over 1 million acres in the Permian as a whole, but those are really representative of the areas where we're
focusing on the unconventional exploration and appraisal. Right now we have four rigs running. They're all focused
just now in the Delaware basin. We have well tests underway from wells that were previously drilled in the Midland
basin but we don't have drilling activity there right now. So that's really – but what we're doing is basically testing the
whole section. As we described at the Analyst Day, there's about 4,500 feet of prospective section within the Permian
Basin, and certainly in the Delaware. And we are going through the process of making sure that we explore and
appraise those different horizons so that we've got clear understanding of what the development plans should be for that
going forward.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: And they are mainly – is that mainly lease acreage with royalties? Or is there some fee
acreage mixed in there from legacy production in terms of royalty position?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: The areas that we're focused on for unconventionals are predominantly leased acreage.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Right. Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Thanks Ed.

<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Hi, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: On Venezuela, there's a market movement there, Citgo may be selling their refinery. I'm
wondering have you checked with your legal advice whether you guys can, in the event that they go forward, can you
put an injunction on that to sort of force Venezuela then to speed up the settlement?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: It's probably not appropriate for us to comment on tactics that we might take in that regard,
Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. Or maybe as a curve ball for Ryan, the North American crude [ph] defensive (37:37)
market looks like it's continued extremely volatile. And still not 100% clear that when or if the government is going to
allow the export of crude oil. I know that is only two years ago that you spin-off the refining. Have you ever thought
about to recreate a integrated operation? Or that this is totally behind and you guys not consider? Given that it looks
like that's a pretty large refining system maybe available in the market now?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, yeah, that's a bit of a curve ball, Paul. I'll give you that. No. We're pretty much focused
on our plans as an independent E&P company, so we're pretty much focused on trying to grow, grow our production,
grow our margins as we've outlined and be one of the best E&P companies in the space today. And part of that does we
have a large North American position certainly with the Eagle Ford and Bakken, and the unconventionals, and our
legacy position in North America. So the export issue is something that's pretty important to us, and we're spending
quite a bit of time advocating on behalf of that back in – both on the Hill and with the administration.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: And two final questions: First, can you share with us any preliminary CapEx and production
estimates for 2015?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, I think we're in the middle of putting our plans together, but what I'd say goes back to the
analyst presentation that we did back in April. Our plans really are unchanged from what we described to you guys
back then. Both capital and production.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. And maybe this is for Matt. Matt, if I'm looking out, you indicate that the third quarter
with the down time from planned maintenance and all that and maybe some of the third party operation that the start-up
may be a little bit delayed. If you look at from your standpoint, what is the biggest risk for you to achieve your
production target, or that you're planned target for the next six to eighteen months? Is there any major project that you
think is a little bit more concern or any particular area on the supply chain or anything?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: I think that the range that we have given for both the third quarter and the fourth quarter
captures the uncertainty that we see in the overall portfolio. In the third quarter there's some uncertainty on the duration
of some of our down time. And the fourth quarter is dominated more by the timing of new projects coming on. But one
of the advantages that we have as a diversified company is that no individual, no single project, is going to make a big
difference in the overall scheme of things. And that diversification in the portfolio helps us to limit the exposure to
individual project surprises. So I think the range that we've given for the third and fourth quarters captures all of that.

Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Société Général. Please go ahead
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yeah, three unrelated questions, hopefully not stream of consciousness. With AK LNG. If you
got approval, how long would it take to really develop it? I know it's beyond the scope of an investor call, but I'm just
curious.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So, I mean, we've made a lot of progress in AK LNG this year. I mentioned that we've signed a
joint venture agreement and applied for export to FTE and non-FTE countries. So we're starting pre-feed now. That
will take 12 to 18 months or so. Feed would then take two or three years. So the final investment decision would be in
the 2017 – 2016, 2017 timeframe. And first production would be out in the 2022 to 2025. So that is the sort of timeline

that we're looking at, John.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Thanks, Matt. With respect to Poland, Matt, did you run a core on the well you're now
testing, and if so, how do the rocks compare to, say, gas shales in the U.S.?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So we didn't core the horizontal section, but we do have core information from the vertical
wells that we've drilled there. It's difficult to tell. There's a good looking section that we've drilled a horizontal well in,
but as you know, until you actually frac and produce these unconventional reservoirs, it's difficult to know what you're
going to get. So we do have core data. We have all the usual data we would collect in the U.S., and the frac that we
have just done on this well is basically an Eagle Ford style frac, and so we're giving it our best shot, and we'll get a
sense of whether or not – what sort of rates we can achieve by the time we get to the end of the year this year.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Great. Last one from me is regarding your deepwater exploration in Angola and
Senegal. Are you going to be releasing well results individually or just on the quarterly call?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: I suspect that certainly in Senegal we have some smaller companies involved. They'll be
releasing information about Senegal on a regular basis. On the Angola well, I don't know, we'll wait and see where
things go, but we may give some information in advance of the quarterly call. We'll just see how it goes.

Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks for getting me on, guys. I wanted to follow up on Paul's question earlier about the front
loaded CapEx or what seems to be front loaded CapEx this year. In the Eagle Ford specifically, Matt. You talked about
more completions in the second quarter. Can you just give us an idea of what the pace has been relative to, I think it
was like 190 wells you were planning for the year originally. Are you running ahead of that or is that still a good
number? And how much of that are we through so far? I've got a follow up, please.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: That's a good number. It's about 50 wells a quarter that we're working through, and that pace
has been pretty consistent in terms of getting the wells drilled. As you know, as we move to pad drilling, that tends to
be more batch-like as the production comes on. But in terms of executing the number of wells that we're drilling, we're
on pace for around 190 or so that we thought we would be for this year.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So the second quarter I thought from your prepared remarks, you had a few more wells come on.
So is it less in Q1 and more in Q2 or? I'm just trying to understand the pace that you see running.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: We had a sort of a batch of wells that come on right at the beginning of the quarter, which
meant that those wells were in production all the way through the quarter. So that's one of the reasons that the quarter
was higher production than we expected. But overall from a pace perspective, it's much the same from a drilling pace.
From a completion and bringing on production perspective, that of course is influenced by the batch drilling associated
with the pads. And that's what I was trying to indicate in the prepared remarks that we – that's going to be a bit more
lumpy than it has been in the past because of the pad drilling.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Got it. Thanks for that. My follow up is a bit more conceptual. I think it straddles a number of
issues, asset monetization amongst them. But mindful of Ryan's comments earlier, but when you look at some of your
peers, Devon Energy, for example, with their EnLink situation and Hess has announced that they're doing a – now
they're going to do a midstream MLP, how do you guys think about your midstream infrastructure spending because
obviously it's a big enabler. As you guys know, I've been trying to reconcile the level of spending in the Eagle Ford

relative to the activity, and I'm guessing midstream is a big part of that. So how do you think about how you might be
able to perhaps more efficiently monetize your midstream given the high level of CapEx? And I'll leave it there.
Thanks.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: So when you look at our midstream position overall, Doug going back in history, most of that
midstream position went into the DCP joint venture which has then since gone of course with Philips 66. So there's not
a lot of midstream assets that are out there that could form the core of an MLP for us. As we look – as we go forward,
we are having some midstream investments in the Eagle Ford and in the Permian, but those are really not of a size that
we feel like we have the critical mass to be thinking about an MLP. But that's something that we'll just continue to
evaluate as we go through time.

Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Hi. Good morning. Or nearly afternoon, anyway. I guess a quick question for you getting back
a little bit to the lower 48. We've seen – I guess a two-pronged question. One is your gas production only down slightly
here on a year-over-year basis after declining fairly aggressively for the last several quarters or years. Is that something
now that we see the size of your shale play associated gas enough that gas production itself is done going down? I think
that is consistent with what we've seen across the broader industry, but I was hoping for some clarity on that.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, our gas production in a broad sense is going to remain relatively flat in the lower 48.
We're not drilling any wells dedicated to dry gas, but we have associated gas production with the Eagle Ford and the
Bakken, for example, such that on a broad basis, we're going to be relatively flat in overall gas production probably for
the next several years.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: And the follow up to that, we've seen one company, a very large one in this space do a swap of
one type of likely very gassy assets for stuff in the Permian. Is that something within an overall – I don't want to call
your CapEx constrained, but let's say at least a capped level of CapEx that you would be interested in pursuing? The
big asset sales are essentially done with Nigeria, but I was wondering if that's maybe something a little more on the
imaginative side that you'd be willing to pursue here.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, really that goes along with what Ryan was saying earlier about the – I mean, on an
opportunistic basis, things like swaps of underlying assets might make sense to us. So we're always open to consider
those sort of things. But it's not a big part of our ongoing plans.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: And if you were to look at more acreage in either the Permian or the Niobrara given your
efforts that are ongoing right now, is that how we should think of the funding, or that's a future unallocated CapEx in
2015, 2016, or 2017?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: In the plans that we've laid out for around $16 billion of capital, we're including in there the
fact that we intend to be developing our overall unconventional resource base including the Permian and the Niobrara.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: And that includes, Roger, some lease acquisition monies as well. So we're in the market every
day, every week in these areas trying to build our positions and core up what we think are good deals.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Sullivan>: Hi, folks. Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to look ahead a little bit. As you guys are
absorbing the results of the non-op U.S. Gulf of Mexico program that you guys have been participating in the last
couple years, can you speak just a little bit about what looks interesting to you as you contemplate launching the
operated program next year?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, our primary focus in the Gulf of Mexico has been and will continue to be the Paleogene.
We do have some interesting Miocene prospects that we'll drill when we get our operated rig slots available. But I
would say that the primary focus going forward will be the in the Paleogene, and we've had a lot of success there as
you've seen with the four significant discoveries. And we've got over 2 million acres of deepwater position there. And I
think it's about 70% or 80% Paleogene focused, but we do have some interesting Miocene opportunities as well.
<Q - James Sullivan>: Okay. Great. Great. The other thing I want to talk about quickly on the onshore. Obviously you
guys have commented generally about the programs in the Permian and the Niobrara. But just looking at the Niobrara
and I know that you probably don't have much you can say about the anti-fracking measures on the ballot and so on in
terms of handicapping that, but has that affected your activity levels there? Are you guys thinking about ratcheting back
whatever your plan was in the second half of 2014 as you think about risking the likelihood of some type of negative
outcome over there?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: No, that hasn't affected our execution on our plans, James. We'll just have to see if those
ballots actually make it to the electorate or not and then we'll adjust the plans if we need to based on what the results
are.
<Q - James Sullivan>: Okay. But no kind of proactive stuff? I'll just if I could sneak one more in. I know you guys are
doing a stratigraphic well on the on the La Luna in Colombia onshore this year. I wonder if you guys – a couple other
operators have picked up bigger offshore pieces in the license rounds that they've run out there. They're also – they've
talked about targeting the La Luna offshore. Have you guys looked at that or would you consider that?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Right now we're focused on the onshore position that we've built. We've got a good position,
we believe, in the La Luna, and you're absolutely right. The first well out there later this year will be a stratigraphic test
to calibrate the geology, the thermal maturity and so on. So at least as far as I'm aware, we're not looking at offshore for
the unconventionals around Colombia

Thank you. Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Thanks for taking the question. I realize this is less than 1% of your portfolio, but I can't
help asking about the Polar Lights with Rosneft in the context of the new sanctions. Any color on how that might affect
the business?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, Pavel, as you know, we've pretty much exited Russia with some of the moves that we've
made as a company over the last two to three years, and right now we're in a process where we're actually marketing
our Polar Lights interest, so that's hopefully coming to some sense of conclusion over the course of this year.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Okay. Fair enough. Do you think the sanctions will influence the marketing process or any
sign of that?

<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, it hasn't to date, but we watch it. I mean, we obviously watch it pretty closely as the
latest round of sanctions got ratcheted up a little bit more significantly both on the European and the U.S. side. To date
it hasn't impacted it, but again we're watching it closely, but as you indicated, it's a pretty small portion of the portfolio.
It's not a lot of proceeds, what I put in kind of the portfolio cleanup category right now that's not leveraging but
something we just need to clean up in our portfolio.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Understood. And then on AP LNG I realize it's still about a year before start-up, but do
you have a sense of how long it's likely to take before it reaches full mobilization, full nameplate?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, as you know, we have two trains there, Pavel. The first one will come up in around the
middle of next year. The second train will be six or nine months later than that. And we should get to full throughput
capacity relatively quickly. We have the resource base that we need; we have the wells and facilities being developed
that we need to do that. So we should get to full capacity hopefully by the middle of 2016..

Thank you. And our last question is from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Hi. Thanks. Just a couple quick ones here. You obviously discussed a little bit about the
midstream monetization opportunity. Can you discuss a little bit on like mineral interest ownership you all may have? I
mean, Anadarko obviously came out and discussed some stuff that they have that looked like there was potentially
some value here. Do you guys have something similar?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Well, we've got a big lower 48, Western Canadian gas portfolio, so we do have assets where we
have royalty interest and overriding royalty positions. These are positions which provide us with revenue and really
high margin production without any kind of corresponding operating expense or capital requirements. And we think of
these like we really think of other assets in our portfolios. We're always thinking about what we could sell them for and
get on an after-tax basis is more or less in our hold value. One of the things you've got to think about in interests like
this is we have pretty low tax basis in these types of assets, and that's going to be a real consideration. So we'll just
continue to monitor the asset market for something like this and evaluate it and see if it's got any applicability for us in
the future.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. Could you give us a sense of how big that ownership is and what the revenues are roughly
on an annual basis?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: We really think it's probably more appropriate that we do something like that if we get serious
about doing a transaction like this.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. Understood. And my second question is on Jasmine, I guess one of your partners discussed
some compartmentalization and some performance not to expectations. Could you give us a little color on that and
what you all think you can do here?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, Jasmine production performance has been a bit below what we anticipated it would be
because of a bit more reservoir complexity. It's within the range of our expectations, but at the lower end of the range.
In fact, as we were drilling the Jasmine development wells, we actually now believe that there's more gas in place, gas
and condensate in place in Jasmine than we thought. But it's a bit more stratigraphically complex. So we're evaluating

that just now. And because we knew that there was some uncertainty here, we actually installed a platform at Jasmine
that has 24 slots on it and our initial plans were only to drill 8 wells from it. So there's a lot of flexibility for us to add
production and overcome this reservoir heterogeneity issue as time goes on.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Can you give us a sense of what kind of an incremental CapEx spend it would take to kind of get
it back to say the midpoint of that range of expectations?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: No, it's really too early to say, Scott. We're digesting the results from our production
performance to date, and we'll build that into our plans as we get a better understanding of the reservoir dynamics.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. Understood. Thanks.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks Scott.
