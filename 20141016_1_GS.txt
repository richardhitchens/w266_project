Harvey Mitchell Schwartz
Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through our third quarter results, then I'm obviously
happy to answer any questions. Third quarter net revenues were $8.4 billion; net earnings, $2.2 billion; earnings per
diluted share, $4.57.
Core to our strategy over the past few years has been a consistent focus on strengthening our relative position within
the industry. Our success begins with a fundamental approach of engaging our clients, understanding their challenges,
and then addressing their needs. That is the foundation for expanding the breadth and depth of our existing
relationships and the basis for building new ones. For the first 9 months in 2014, revenues are $1.4 billion higher than
this time last year. The increase reflects the combination of greater client activity in certain businesses and a strong
market position. For example, as client activity picked up in global M&A, you saw an increase in our market share.
Our global market share in announced M&A for the year to date of 29% is up 300 basis points compared to 2013. Our
volume advantage to our next closest peer is more than $100 billion. We have also been focused on making sure that
we are well-positioned to deliver operating leverage as client activity increases. In 2011, we announced an operating
efficiency initiative. This initiative was subsequently increased twice and ultimately reached nearly $2 billion. We
continue to expand upon that prior initiative to grow margins and increase returns.
The benefits of those efforts are demonstrated in our year-to-date results. We had $1.4 billion of incremental revenues
and nearly $1 billion of incremental pre-tax earnings. Ultimately, the embedded operating leverage contributed to an
improvement in our year-to-date annualized return on common equity to 11.2%. We have also achieved this result by
being a prudent allocator of our global resources. Getting this right not only drives positive results for our clients, but
also for our shareholders.
Now let me take you through the quarterly results for each of our businesses. In Investment Banking, we produced third
quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, down 18% compared to a strong second quarter. Importantly, our Investment
Banking backlog increased again during the quarter, reaching its highest level since 2007. Third quarter Advisory
revenues were $594 million, up 17% from the second quarter on an increase in completed activity. Year to date,
Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of significant
transactions that closed during the third quarter, including Hillshire Brands' $8.6-billion sale to Tyson Foods,
InterMune's $8.3-billion sale to Roche Holdings, and Gates Corporation's $5.4-billion sale to Blackstone. We're also an
advisor on a number of significant announced transactions. For example, we are advising on TRW Automotive's
$13.5-billion sale to ZF Friedrichshafen, Siemens' $7.6-billion acquisition of Dresser-Rand, and Corio's €7.2 billion
sale to Klépierre.
Moving to Underwriting, net revenues were $870 million in the third quarter, down 32% compared to record second
quarter results. Equity underwriting revenues of $426 million were 22% lower sequentially as industry-wide activity
declined in the third quarter across secondary offerings. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and
equity-related and common stock offerings. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 39% from a record second quarter to
$444 million due to reduced activity, particularly within leveraged finance. During the third quarter, we remained
committed to meeting our clients' diverse financing needs. Whether it was Alibaba's $25-billion IPO, Sysco's $5-billion
financing in support of its acquisition of U.S. Foods, or AEPs $1.6-billion high-yield offering.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, net revenues were $3.8 billion in the third quarter, with FICC Client Execution
of $2.2 billion and Equities of $1.6 billion. ICS includes a one-time, $270-million gain related to the tender of a portion
of our trust-preferred securities. Excluding fixed portion of the one-time gain in DVA, FICC Client Execution net
revenues were $2 billion in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially.

Mortgages declined quarter-over-quarter as clients were less active amid a relatively stable backdrop for prices. Credit
declined significantly as increased volatility, wider credit spreads, and lower issuance provided a more difficult
backdrop. Currencies, interest rates, and commodities were all higher sequentially, as volatility and volumes generally
increased from relatively low levels.
When you exclude Equities' portion of the one-time gain in DVA, the results within the segment were as follows: total
equities' net revenues were $1.5 billion, down 10% sequentially; equities client execution net revenues of $372 million
were down 26% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting lower net revenues in cash products; commissions and fees were $745
million, relatively flat with the second quarter; securities services generated net revenues of $343 million, down 8%
sequentially from the seasonally stronger second quarter; turning to risk, average daily VaR in the third quarter was $66
million, down 14% relative to the second quarter, mostly driven by interest rates.
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities, collectively they produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in the third
quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $876 million, primarily reflecting company-specific events,
including IPOs and net gains in public equities. For example, one of our investments, Mobileye, went public, and our
investment generated $285 million in net gains during the third quarter.
Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $606 million and benefited from net gains on certain investments due
to asset sales and net interest income. Other revenues of $210 million include revenues from the firm's consolidated
investments.
In Investment Management, we reported third quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion. Management and other fees reached
a record $1.21 billion. During the quarter, total assets under supervision increased $8 billion to a record $1.15 trillion.
Let me quickly walk you through the long-term flows. Long-term assets under supervision had net inflows of $13
billion, with $7 billion in equity assets and $6 billion in fixed income assets. This was largely offset by foreign
currency translation, which drove net market depreciation of $12 billion. As we have discussed before, the key to
long-term success is delivering strong and consistent performance for our Investment Management clients. Across the
global platform, 81% of our client mutual funds assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year basis, and 76%
ranked in the top two quartiles on a five-year basis.
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of
prior-year equity awards, and other items such as benefits was accrued at a compensation-to-net-revenues ratio of 40%.
This is 300 basis points lower than the firm's accrual in the first half of the year. The lower compensation accrual
reflects stronger year-to-date revenues, greater clarity on full-year compensation levels, and our continued efforts to
improve operating efficiency across the firm. Third quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.3 billion, down 4%
sequentially.
Now let me quickly run you through some key stats. Total staff at the end of the third quarter was approximately
33,500 employees. This is up 3% from the second quarter due to summer hiring. Our effective tax rate was 31%
year-to-date. Our global core excess liquidity ended the quarter at $180 billion. Our Basel III common equity Tier 1
ratio was 11.8% using the Advanced approach. It was 11.1% under the Standardized approach. Our supplementary
leverage ratio finished the quarter at 4.9% based on the final rules. We repurchased 7.1 million shares of common stock
for $1.25 billion during the quarter. And finally, we announced an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend
from $0.55 to $0.60 per share.
Before we turn to Q&A, let me leave you with some concluding thoughts. A constant in our history as a public
company is an unrelenting desire to provide world-class service to our clients and superior returns to our shareholders.
Given the dynamic nature of our industry, meeting that objective requires adaptability. Since we went public in 1999,
there are several examples that are readily available.
We went from $250 billion in assets in 1999 to $1.2 trillion in 2008, and then back to approximately $870 billion today.
And along the way, we made Goldman Sachs a stronger firm. We increased our common equity from $10 billion to
over $70 billion, and substantially increased our liquidity pool, which now sits at $180 billion.

We've expanded our global footprint and increased the diversity of our franchise. Our number of offices is up by more
than a third to over 50 offices, with one quarter of our staff located in Bangalore, Salt Lake City, Singapore, and Texas.
Back in 1999, we had approximately 3,000 people in our Technology division. Now we have nearly 8,000 people. They
represent close to a quarter of the firm. We also built an Asset Management business, largely organically, from a few
hundred million dollars in assets under supervision to $1.15 trillion today. By adapting, we have fundamentally
improved the strength of our firm, our opportunity set, and as a result, our ability to deliver for our clients and our
shareholders. Going forward, we will make any necessary changes to continue our history of providing superior client
service and generating industry-leading returns. It's what our clients, our shareholders, and our culture demands.
Now just before I take your questions, I'd like to make one additional closing comment about the market environment
we've seen over the past week, and particularly yesterday and this morning. It's clearly an environment that reminds all
of us about the power of investor sentiment and how fragile it can be at times. Yesterday in particular, it's clearly a
mark in the morning where investors were, quite frankly, shooting first and asking questions later. We've seen this
market reaction in the past, and while painful, it's somewhat a normal part of how markets function.
Clearly, investors are now debating whether we will see lower rates for longer, and more importantly, whether the
global economy is slowing or continuing to grow. These are questions that the market has certainly debated before.
We've always believed that over the long term, markets follow fundamentals. And speaking with our economists only
yesterday, they would argue that nothing has fundamentally changed in the past few weeks, or certainly the last 24
hours, regarding the long-term outlook for the global economy.
That doesn't mean it will continue to grow, but it certainly doesn't mean it will stall. For us, in any environment, it's
always about staying close to our clients. Yesterday was a difficult day for many of them. Our focus is being there for
them. We have the intellectual capital and the financial capital to help address their needs. And we remain committed
to doing it.
With that, I'm happy to take any of your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions] Your first
question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi. Thanks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Good morning. So investment lending continues to do great, and the future be what it is with
this quarter. But I'm just curious, you mentioned the good IPO market obviously, but if you could break down maybe
on the equity side, what was realized gains versus marks and then if we've seen any big changes in the composition of
the overall asset base between equity debt and lending assets.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So there hasn't been a major shift from the – if we look at that Investing & Lending
balance sheets, you won't see a major shift in terms of the quarter. As you know, the investing and the lending business,
it's a long-term business, and so you'll see changes over time. Obviously, as I highlighted, we continue to harvest. Part
of that is obviously driven by the strength of the markets, but also part of that is driven by the idiosyncratic strength of
the portfolio. And so it continues to perform quite well.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: But no breakdown on realized/unrealized on the equity side?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So, it's not a question of realized or unrealized, I'd be – that's why I'm struggling
with that point. In terms of – if you're talking about, things that, for example public versus event-driven events, but we
always mark-to-market the portfolio as we work through, and so good portion of the events of the past quarter were the

result of events and IPOs as I highlighted.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Good. That's all I was really going towards.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Sorry, I got confused by language.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: No worries. I confuse myself, too. I appreciate the comments on some of the balance sheet
data that everyone is looking for. Maybe just one more thing on total losses absorbing capital, you're at the highest.
You have tons and you've turned out a lot of your long-term debt. You also have among the highest on short-term
wholesale funding at last look, which the Fed has focused on, and so last quarter, you did a bunch of repositioning
ahead of CCAR and reducing balance sheet in the [ph] RICO (18:04) book. I'm assuming that no call-out means no big
changes this quarter, but if you could just comment on your views on [ph] RICO (18:13) book size, short-term
wholesale funding and if any more adjustments are needed?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So at this stage, we don't feel there's any adjustments needed. As we highlighted
and we focused on in the last quarter, the balance sheet had come down pretty significantly. I will say, with respect to
the balance sheet, as you know, it's always going to be dynamic and we'll always take our cues from our clients in the
marketplace. But as you saw in the quarter, it basically went up $9 billion, and when you compare the quarter
end-to-quarter end, second quarter-to-third quarter liquidity pool, basically all of that it is in the liquidity pool. So that
was any growth in the balance sheet. In terms of the balance sheet, we're going to continue to remain very disciplined
in terms of returns. And as you said, there was no response in terms of the CCAR process last year, which drove us to
reassess our ROA hurdles that we require, and we did that in conjunction with our client. But we'll continue to focus on
it. But as you said, the firm's capital levels and liquidity levels remain quite high, I mean at this stage, 20% of the
balance sheet is our liquidity pool.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Yes, that was it. Last one. I appreciate your comments on the market. In the past, when they
were big spikes in volatility, if it happened in a short time period of time, that was typically bad for the brokered deal
community. But inventories are down like 80%, 90%. I'm just curious if big spikes in volatility are less painful this
go-around, given all the changes in broker/dealer balance sheets.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So I think that the comment, with respect to the short-term reaction function as it
relates to market volatility, as I mentioned, yesterday, today, particularly difficult days for our clients, and if it's
difficult for our clients in the short run, markets can be challenging. And so, we always root for good things for our
clients and for good markets. I'll have to see how this period of volatility translates. If you take a step back and you
look at the third quarter, we came into the third quarter, everybody was focused on the fact that there is absolutely no
volatility, and as we sit here today, people feel like there's too much. So it's a little bit of, too hot-too cold.
In September, I think a takeaway from September is that in a right market environment, you can really see a huge
pick-up in client activity, and then you can see the operating leverage for us. In terms of the – de-risking in terms of the
balance sheets that you've seen across the industry, I don't think that's a "broker-dealer" issue. I think if you look across
large global financial institutions, when you look at the reduction in risk weighted assets over the course of the past
several years, I think that's a question that we'll see over time as to whether or not that decline in risk-carrying capacity
along with other adjustments and other regulatory rules, what impact that has ultimately on liquidity for the
marketplace. So we'll see.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: I hear you. Okay. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thanks, Glenn.

<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Michael.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: The only thing on the numbers, just in terms of the – I think you gave the Advanced and
the Standardized, it looks like it might've been a [ph] transitional for the term common (21:49). Just wondered if you
have the fully phased in?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, so fully phased Advanced is 10.6%, fully phased Standardized is 10%, and
I'll remind you again that I think maybe it's a midpoint between fully phased in Advanced, if you were to think about –
sorry, fully phased and Advanced, if you would think about kind of how our capital ratios will migrate as we take
investments out of funds, more or less think of it as a midpoint in terms of the long-term projection. That of course, if
you assume that, between now and 2018, the balance will still be totally static.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. That's helpful.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Of course it won't be.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Yeah, and then just on the compensation and the comp ratio, I think the color that you gave
is helpful, and obviously, it's a moving target. When I think about this year, last year, the true-up that you do in the
third quarter, and then you're trying to gauge what can happen in the fourth quarter, is there anything that's changing, or
is it just the same process, you'll see other revenue environment factors in, and then we'll readjust in the fourth quarter?
I just want to make sure the process isn't changing versus what you've done in the past.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Well, absolutely no change in the process. I won't drag you through the
underpinnings of the process. We've talked about it a lot. But at its core, it's just pay-for-performance. That's the
philosophy, and that's how we do it. In every quarter we make our best estimate as to the compensation accrual and I
think the extent to which you're seeing it change, there's no change in process, but you've seen a change over the last
two years just in our operating leverage and the cost reduction efforts that are coming in, and so this year's accrual
reflects the fact that last year's third quarter [ph] looked what, (23:40) 25% better year-over-year, third quarter-third
quarter, and we're running $1.4 billion ahead of revenues. And so, that just gives us greater clarity in terms of the
compensation levels. But it reflects, I think, more predominately, the operating leverage that's in the business.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. And then finally, just on, I guess you went through some of the [ph] ratios (24:01)
on all the regulatory changes that we know, and then you're coming up, whether it's NSFR, [indiscernible] (24:08),
things that are ahead. But it also sounds like the industry is doing some things to maybe get in front of that, and
whether it's the agreement on derivatives, some chatter on the repo markets going through CCPs, so I guess on any of
these initiatives that are in the works, is there anything that you would point to that might, I don't know, take care of or
deal with some of the concerns that this – the future regulatory items you are focused on? I know it's early, so I know
typically you don't want to comment too much until the rolls are out there. But I just wanted to get your take because it
does seem a little bit different that the industry is trying to get in front of some of these things.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So I think it's a really, really important question and I think that when you look at
any one of the rules that, as an industry we work with regulators on and regulators have put in place capital
requirements, new liquidity requirements under the LCR, leverage debt, in any one of these rules, you could have a
very active and heated debate with respect to the molecules in the rule and whether this was calibrated too intensely,
but I don't think you could debate, really, the concept of the rule. And so I think in concept, most of the rules that we've
seen have made sense and that goes back to the initiatives around clearing, swap execution facilities, and I think, and I
said this before, I think you have to give the regulators a lot of credit, quite frankly for creating an immense amount of
regulation and thoughtful regulatory response and giving folks a long timeline to adjust to it; very important for our
clients and for the capital market.
I think the big open question is, and it's a very, very hard thing for any market participant, or regulator to weigh, is kind
of what's the collective weight of all of this? And I don't know that we'll really be able to assess that until a lot of time
passes. I think when it comes to things like the discussions around having repo clearing, I think those are good, healthy
market reactions. Generally speaking, those are a combination of discussions with clients because they raise concern.
Regulators observe, for example, increased fails in treasury markets, and I think it's incumbent upon all of us as market

participants to be thoughtful and creative about how we make sure that we protect our capital markets. But I do think
it's pretty early days in being able to assess these things. But I think the industry is being very active in trying to make
sure that we have the most robust capital markets in the world.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Sure.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning, Christian.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Good morning. I just want to follow-up on the question on Investing & Lending. Debt revenues
in particular were robust this quarter, and stands out given the backdrop for credits were choppy in the quarter. You
mentioned asset sales. I would appreciate any color on how much asset sales drove this quarter's revenues. And more
broadly, any color on the long-term drivers of the debt line?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So in terms of the long-term drivers of the debt line, again, this is just going to be
our approach to how we think about allocating capital and when we see opportunities. So during the period, it's not so
much that a specific asset, we're responding to a particular change in credit spreads in the marketplace, but it will be
driven by harvesting over a long period of time. So as companies refinance their capital structures, we may be a
beneficiary in that, for example, if we are providing mezzanine-level debt to a particular entity. And so that's why we
said that it was driven by net gains on investments. And of course, there's net interest income in there also, which is
roughly about $200 million.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. That's helpful. Just on the Investment Banking backlogs, you mentioned that remains
strong and increased again this quarter. Just curious, do you have any sense of how much of your backlogs are tied to
so-called tax inversion deals?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So with respect to the backlog, the backlog again was the highest it's been since
2007, and actually, would we look at it, we look at it across the three categories of advisory, equity underwriting, and
debt underwriting, obviously, and all categories were up, so that was good to see. It's not a question of, I think
inversions in the backlog. When you actually – when you talk to our M&A team, and you actually look at the data
either this year over long periods of time, inversion transactions have not been a significant driver of global M&A
activity. And really, when you get into conversations with the team, what they'll tell you is, it's not, it's never just about
an inversion or a tax benefit. It's really about the strategic benefits because the two organizations can come together.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. That's helpful. Just a quick clean-up question here. In the earnings release, you
referenced high impairment charges in non-comp expenses. Just will be helpful if you could kind of size that to what
the nature of those charges relate to. I'm just trying to get a sense of kind of...
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I didn't hear – I heard you that you referenced non-comp, I didn't hear the first part
of what you said...
<Q - Christian Bolu>: You said higher impairment charges within the non-comp line per your earnings release.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Oh, it's not a material number. We just call it out. But as you know, every quarter,
we mark-to-market the balance sheet, and so assets sitting on the balance sheet, but this quarter, it wasn't material. It
was roughly about $50 million.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: $50 million. Okay. Thank you. And then just lastly for me, you spoke about strengthening your
relative positioning across all your businesses. I guess the Equities business is probably the one place where there has
been some market share slip based on reported numbers, anyway, and I appreciate those numbers in on [indiscernible]

(30:11) apples-to-apples. But I would just be curious to, maybe help us frame Goldman's competitive pursuit in that
business and kind of longer-term outlook.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So – well, we can cut to the quick on that. Respective of longer-term outlook and
our sense of position in the marketplace, we couldn't be more pleased with it. We measure the business by our
engagement with clients, and our ability to deliver to them, and that's – in the Prime Brokerage business, it's in our
global footprint, our ability to provide electronic solutions in terms of trading, commit capital, and obviously our
connectivity with our banking team in terms of driving capital markets transactions.
And so from a franchise perspective, we couldn't feel better about it. Quarter-to-quarter in terms of top line revenue, I
know that's the data that you have available in terms of market share. Not really the way we look at market share, we're
much more focused as I said on delivering to clients and driving returns to the bottom line at the same time. And so, I
think in terms of the long run, we feel quite good. But quarter-to-quarter, you may see revenue move back and forth
between us and our competitors, but it's not a big issue for us.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: All right. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Morning.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: You had a pretty big increase in the SLR, I think about 50 basis points versus last
quarter, and just trying to reconcile what drove that? I think some of it was the assets you actually brought down last
quarter that helped the ratio. Obviously, you had positive net income, but was there also a nice benefit from the final
SLR rules?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So there were a whole host of things that drove it. We definitely got benefit from
the final rules, about 10 basis points. But then, when you go through, there was the balance sheet reduction, which was
15 basis points of that. So as you know, we took the balance sheet down in the second quarter, but it's a daily averaging
in the SLR and so you didn't really see that benefit translate through until the third quarter. And then there is other
reductions, there's other reductions in terms of like the CDS in the portfolio in terms of that. And then obviously there's
a capital, we reduced our significant financial institution deduction. All these things are contributors in terms of driving
increase in the ratio.
I do think that the SLR is a good example of sort of our philosophy on how we approach regulatory reform, because as
you know, obviously, there's been a significant improvement in that, 70 basis points over a fairly short period of time,
and as you point out, 40 basis points in the quarter. We have found that by giving our people the tools, waiting till we
see the final rule and then just really focused on complying with the rule, we can move the needle. So this is just all
about compliance.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: And where do you think you are on the optimization of that? So you talked about
obviously as you get compliant for Volcker, there'll be a material benefit there, but what about just the other
opportunities? You had a list of things, the CDS and the other reductions, how much more, if any, is there of that?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: It's funny, we don't – I don't think we think – it's not like a baseball game here in
terms of where we are in the innings of how do we comply. I think the takeaway here is that the SLR is not a significant
issue, as we talked about a year ago. It's much more reflective about complying with the rules. But this will be a
process that will be ongoing. If you – you mentioned the Volcker compliance as you come out of the funds, again, this
– we're talking about something that's forward-looking to 2018, if we [indiscernible] (33:55) made those adjustments,

we'd be well in excess of 5% today. But let's see how it goes.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately on getting compliant for Volcker, there's a lot of
focus on that and what it might mean to your equity I&O revenues. But I guess as you think about replenishing the
investments with Volcker-compliant investments, how is that landscape? Because as I talk to investors, there's some
concern that new investment opportunities may not be as good as they've been in the past, but what do you think about
the outlook for deploying capital in Volcker-compliant matters right now?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So as we talked about before, there's a number of ways that we can use our capital,
and as it comes out of the funds, capital is fungible. And so we'll have the ability to continue to invest in
Volcker-compliant funds, use our balance sheet, other Volcker-compliant structures. And so we feel like we have
enough flexibility in terms of re-deploying that capital. And of course I think this is the critical point, if the
opportunities aren't there, obviously, we can look to re-deploy it into other areas of the firm that demand the capital, or
we can look to return it to the shareholders. So from that perspective, so for us it's all about the process and the
environment.
As we discussed, the environment has been a good one for harvesting. We have been able to put capital to work in
certain parts of the world, and our global footprint certainly gives us an advantage in terms of seeing opportunities, but
it's always been – investing and lending has always been a very long-term, long-cycle initiative, and we'll be very
disciplined about the returns. If the opportunities are there and they make sense, we'll deploy the capital. If not, we'll be
disciplined and we'll wait.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And we'll probably get it in the 10-Q, but do you have the level of direct
investments now and maybe how that compares to a year or two years ago, just to show how quickly that's been
ramping?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: It's been – I don't have the year or two years ago numbers, Dane can follow up with
you off-line, but it's been obviously a bit of a high-class problem – as we've been harvesting, values have been
increasing. We can come back to you and get you the numbers. The I&O balance sheet at the end of the second quarter
was roughly $71 billion.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thank you.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Security services had some pretty attractive quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year revenue

<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, I think what you're seeing there may be the allocation of the gain that I
referenced as it related to the retirement of the trust-preferred securities.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Oh, got it. It's there.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, so as you know, we don't have a corporate cost center, so just as a
philosophy and a discipline, we allocate out all costs to all of the businesses. In this particular case, there was a gain
related to funding, so the Institutional Client Service businesses of fixed income and equity, they are the biggest
consumers of balance sheet and liquidity, so they also get the benefit of the gains, and so that's actually really – I think
when you look at it, you'll see that that's probably it. We detail it out in the earnings release.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: So that aside then, maybe can give us a sense for what is the impact on that business of some
of the changes that you made with respect to bringing down the balance sheet in the second quarter?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So that's a good question. So in terms of how we looked at it, it was really, as I
said, I would describe it as a two-part process. One is pretty simple and it's mathematical. One of the easiest things to
do in terms of responsive to leverage tasks is actually just to rank the balance sheet of the businesses from lower ROA
to higher ROA. The second part of the exercise is a really high-touch exercise. There is engagement in the trenches
going through and working with clients and really finding out where we're providing value and where maybe in our
balance sheet. And that's the nuance for part of the exercise that we went through, and we will continue to go through.
But so far, the client engagement in that business, it's one of our strongest franchise businesses so it feels quite good.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Thanks for that. The other question that I had, and it goes really back to some of the liquidity
points that were being asked about earlier. People have been worried about the impact of The Street reducing liquidity
it provides to investors for a while. We heard a lot more about it in the last few weeks of the third quarter. At the same
time, we know that in the third quarter, the G50s had to begin to make daily reports to regulators based, I guess, on
Volcker and some of the liquidity ranks at a pretty deep level of granularity. And I was wondering if you felt that this
had had any impact broadly on the attractiveness of providing liquidity?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I would say no, certainly not at Goldman Sachs, and I would imagine not the case
across the market, although I don't have any visibility into our competitors. You're right when you say that data
requirements in the first submission that went in right around Labor Day, it's a pretty significant amount of data. I
actually think that speaks to the opposite reaction function, and I'll tell you why. You can't create that data overnight.
We had to invest quite a bit of talent, mindshare, technology, operations, front office time, and federation time in
building the systems, and so that's been a process that's been underway, I would assume, for all of our competitors, and
certainly for us, since the rule came out.
So it wouldn't be as though you'd show up reporting and somehow you would change your profile. I don't know, that
seems like a stretch to be. I think again, it's much more a – it's the collection of the rule sets. We did see increased sales
in treasuries. We've seen stress. I'm talking about in normal market functioning times, not in stress market function
times. Definitely where balance sheet has felt scarce, and I think under periods where clients want more liquidity, it
may be more difficult to find. But we'll see how this all shakes out. Again, the impact of the collective rule sets of all
the rules – balance sheet, leverage, risk-weighted assets, liquidity, it's pretty enormous. And I don't think we can only
have positive effects from that over the next 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, 10 years. I wish that was case.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And when you add all of that up, and going back also to the pricing of security services and
other securities financing transactions, are you in real-time seeing that the scarcity value of balance sheet is driving
re-pricing that would be favorably to you presumably?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Well, I don't know. Look, we've never been a firm that's first and foremost
competed on price. We compete on – we like to compete on content, and we like to compete on the ability to provide
liquidity, which may mean being the best price at any point in time for our clients. But our clients understand. They're
very knowledgeable and increasingly knowledgeable about the regulatory constraints that are on us and really the entire
industry, right? We all have the same rule set, and so as the market responds, I just think everyone needs to be more
disciplined. And some of that will depend on where your return hurdles are. If our return hurdles are higher than

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Just maybe, a couple of questions on the regulatory side. Did you – did I miss it, did you
disclose your LCR? Are you over 100% at this point?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: We didn't disclose a number. We're still digesting all the data, as you know. But
yes, we're in excess of minimum requirements. As you would expect given all the focus we've put on liquidity here.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Right. Right. Now that's fair. And then, just maybe a follow-up question on just sort of the [ph]
Terillo (42:49) commentary, and the impact, you just talked about how ROE becomes high ROE hurdles, as we think
about his focus about wholesale funding potentially a charge on top of the current SIFI charge, he seems to be
specifically focused on repo and even the matched book. How do you – do you think – is it just too early to start
worrying about it? Because you mentioned you're not – you think your balance sheet is fine, or do you think is this
something that's going be increasingly something you have to focus on and may continue to shrink that market or
change the way you do it? Just some color there. Thanks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So I think it's definitely, and we haven't even seen a proposed rule. And as you
know, our philosophy around these things is we've seen and we will continue to assume that regulators will give the
marketplace basically a good glide path to adjust to rule changes. And so, we would never react or change the business
methodology to commentary. We wait to see the rule, we engage in active dialogue on creating a constructive rule.
Clearly, we'll be focused on the impact on markets. It would be very interested to see where this discussion heads. As
you know, and I don't want to digress too much, but as you know, the SIFI surcharges are really at their core, designed
around macro-prudential regulation, not micro-prudential regulation, and so when you look at our proportion of
wholesale funding as a percentage of the marketplace, you could argue we're a lot smaller than many of our large
universal bank peers. So we will really see how the rule plays out, but we'll engage in an active dialogue with the
regulators just to ensure that we get the most thoughtful rule and the best thing for the marketplace and our clients.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay. Fair enough. And maybe just one other quickly on the asset management business,
you've done a good job in turning around and generating positive flows in fixed income and equities. Is the lack of
positive flows and alternatives simply your realizations? And so, if that's the case, when you see, I assume that's a
higher-margin area, when do you see that kind of inflection point where you start to see net flows turn positive?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I'm sorry. Could you say that again?
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: I'm just trying to think to your alternative AUM.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Oh, okay.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Your net flows have been zero, but I assume that's because you've got outflows from...
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, so we can break it down for you after the call and Dane can give it to you.
But basically, what you're seeing there is the harvesting that you've seen in private equity, but you've actually seen
growth away from that in the other alternative asset categories. But we can break it down for you.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Right. Okay. That's great. Thanks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: The growth's been pretty good.

Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Hey. Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey. How are you?
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good, good. Quick question, following up on one of Jim's questions there. So your LCR in
excess of the minimum, is that the fully phased in minimum or the first minimum threshold of 80%?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No, sorry. That's fully phased in.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Fully phased. Okay. Cool. Thanks. And then just a question here on the market and sort of
your comments in the – to open up the call. Clearly this has been sort of a tough year for hedge funds, and October
hasn't been good either. Just thinking about your business and the leverage to financial players, does – do you think that
we could end the year with a real serious withdrawal of risk from some of these – some of the big portion of your client
base? And did that at all impact your decision to adjust the comp ratio here in the third quarter?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No. So that's not how we deleverage the comp ratio. The comp ratio is really driven
by the improvement in top line revenues and the operating leverage we gain by managing our expenses. I think the
volatility comes in different flavors. A couple of months ago, people were saying volatility will never return to the
marketplace, and then they say now, people feel like we have too much volatility. And so I think there's healthy periods
of volatility and less healthy periods. And really, what we've seen in the last 48 hours is concentrated position
liquidation, obviously triggered by stop-loss selling in multiple markets, and that at times, as we've always seen, selling
can beget selling.
Look, our hedge funds and asset managers and institutional clients are an important part of our focus at Goldman
Sachs, but we'll just stay close to our clients during this period. We don't think about it in terms of days or weeks in
terms of the performance of our clients. It's really just a commitment to the long run.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: That's fair. Thanks for that. And then I guess last one for me, and it seems like we chat about
this every quarter so I wouldn't want to disappoint you, but I kind of hear you in the Equities business that you don't
want to get up worked up over quarterly volatility, but it seems as though the Equities business on a revenue basis has
been losing share for a period in excess of a year, and while it's certainly encouraging that engagement with clients
remains solid, when do you think that that translates into revenue? And I guess when do you become concerned that the
engaged, because the engagement is there ultimately to read the revenues, so when do you become concerned about
that not translating, I guess?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So, look, it's an important question, and as I said before, we run the business where
our focus on our clients and then ultimately, margins and returns. In any given quarter, quarter-to-quarter, you could
see noise. In this quarter, and again our visibility into our competitors – in this quarter we certainly, as I mentioned in
[indiscernible] (48:35), we had a more challenging part of the cash business in equities client execution, so a bit more
challenging for us in blocks. Again, I don't have visibility. But I think, if you step back and you look at Goldman Sachs,
I think actually you're seeing it translate into returns. So with an 11.8% for the quarter and 11.2% ROE for the
year-to-date, I think we're doing whatever we can actually to drive to the bottom line. So I think – I actually think you
are seeing it.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Thanks, Harvey.

<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hey, Harvey. Good morning.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey. Good morning, Steven.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So my first question pertains to the topic of operational risk. And digging into some of the
Pillar 3 disclosures for you and your peers, it appears that you're actually running at a much lower level as a percentage
of RWA at roughly 15%, I believe, at least as of 2Q, which compares to the remaining universals or at least
U.S.-domiciled universals running closer to 25% to 30%. And I didn't know if you could clarify, because that
calculation is really determined based on industry rather than company-specific event risk. What's driving that delta?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So you're right to say we have less, but I think it really correlates more to the fact
that we're just a less complex financial institution than many of our peers. We don't have the payment systems, we don't
have the consumer banking side of the business, we don't have that, that a lot of our universal peers have. And also, as
you know, this is also driven by loss experience. And when you look at our loss experience over the last several years,
it's been significantly lower than many of our peers. But I think it's a pretty straightforward answer.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. Fair enough. And then just switching gears over to I&O, we've been having more
conversations with investors which suggest continued reluctance to ascribe as much value to the contributions simply
given the lack of earnings visibility tied to the portfolio gains, which at least from my point of view I'd argue dilutes the
contribution from some sustainable fee streams you have there, such as lending tied to the private bank. I didn't know
given the lack of credit that some have been willing to ascribe to merchant banking and the portfolio gains whether
you'd consider updating or amendments to your segment disclosure, at least within I&O to, at the very least
disaggregate the merchant banking portion from I would argue higher multiple and sustainable revenue streams tied to
lending activities.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So, maybe I'll take a step back for a second. So in terms of how we think about the
Investing & Lending businesses, if you look back over the history of time, and again we approach this business over the
long-term, it's been a significant builder of book value, and certainly a valuable contribution in the way that we partner
with clients over many, many years. And we do you think we have some competitive advantages in that business in
terms of our global footprint and ability to source transactions. And so I think it's economic value in terms of its
contribution at the margin, you can see it speaks for itself. I think it's procyclical. So there's always a discussion about
its value in different times of the cycle but we run it as a procyclical business.
And so I think the question of financial statement presentation, I'm happy to take off-line with you and Dane. As you
know, we went through a very thorough review as part of our business standards committee process, to actually design
our financial statements in a way that actually provided increased clarity around the various business lines. But we're
always looking to improve that clarity, and so – look, I think we're better for having this financial disclosure. At the
time we got very positive feedback for it. I don't want to close and be quippy with you, but yeah, do I think generally
speaking the marketplace is undervaluing Goldman Sachs' businesses? Yes. But I don't know if it's necessarily the
result of the financial statements, but we're happy to look at it.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: All right. Fair enough. You know, I appreciate the color, Harvey, and thank you for taking
my questions.

<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: We had several conversations with investors trying to guess that, or estimate that, for various
companies.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah. No, we haven't focused on a buffer yet. Remember that the balance sheet is
very dynamic, and so as we comply with the rule, you can see we're making significant progress, but we haven't
determined any buffer. And obviously, we have a couple of years. Again, I will underscore that as we take our
investments out of funds, if you're actually to translate those same assets onto the balance sheet, that gets us to a 5.2%,
5.3% level anyway. So there's almost a natural tailwind that creates that. But we will constantly reassess and define all
these buffers as we get all the final rules.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. That's helpful. And you mentioned the backlog being so strong, and that's a
combination of a number of different businesses. And I'm going to ask, when you talk to the folks in – particularly in
the fixed income side of banking, if the rates actually do go up at some point, how are they thinking about potential
future global debt issuance in a period of rising rates, given that there's been so much issuance over the past few years
at declining rates? I realize it's hard to figure out given the nature of the business tends to focus in many ways in sort of
drive-by issuance, but how are they thinking about the potential for that type of volume over the next couple of years?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So – and with my crystal ball on these kind of things has never been particularly
good. So I remember it was a year-plus ago, we were getting asked questions when we first hit a new record in debt
underwriting a year-plus ago, about the end of the debt underwriting cycle, and so – and then again, in the second
quarter, we had another record this year. So very difficult to predict. I think a lot of it depends on the environment
associated around the rate increases. I think if it's again a return to normalized rates around the globe where we don't
have so much incredible central bank intervention, and it's associated with global growth, I think you could see growth
in many economies around the world.
I think you'll see an increase in capital markets activity because you will see companies want to issue debt as they grow
it, they move away from being financed by the local banks. So I think it will be environmentric-centric. If you saw, part
of what we've seen is, if you see large M&A transactions, and the M&A environment is quite active, you see a lot of
related debt issuance. So I definitely think there's something of a reaction function over short periods of times to rate
levels. I think a lot of it will be correlated with global growth.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Thanks very much. And then just a follow-up for me. The $9 billion of the remainder of
investments or Volcker-related investments you need to move out of over time, it sounds like that number really hasn't
changed much since the second quarter. Is that what we should understand from your earlier comments?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah, that's right. It's actually right around $8 billion now.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah.

Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay. Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning, Devin.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Most of my questions have been asked, but maybe just a question on acquisitions and [ph]
you'll never going to look (56:49) a little bit better picture of the capital and regulatory framework. When you think
about where you'd would like to expand the business over the next several years, does the door open more to thinking
about doing acquisitions or really, is there anything that could become more interesting kind of growing inorganically

as you guys think about the go-forward?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So – look, I think we're the leading merger and acquisition advisory firm in the
world. It'd be somewhat inconsistent philosophically for us; I just think it would be inconsistent with our core being if
we said we weren't willing to consider acquisitions. And so I think you should assume philosophically and culturally
that as a management team, we'd consider any acquisition if it was accretive, in any area of our firm. I do think that as
you point out, I do think that the ongoing nature of the regulatory environment probably just makes that more difficult
for the industry generally. But we'll see over time. But we're always open-minded. Having said all that, I think we've
benefited us as a firm over many years by keeping our culture intact and doing nothing major. But you've seen us do
bolt-on acquisitions from time to time. So – but that's how I'd describe it philosophically.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay. Helpful. And then just I guess, staying on the M&A theme, just – as you mentioned being
the leader, when you look at the backlog, are you seeing further diversions surround trends within the U.S. and Europe,
particularly given I guess, maybe the divergences in the economies right now or does it feel like the European M&A
backlog and what you guys are seeing over there in terms of the outlook is pulling off the bottom? I know the U.S. has
kind of led the charge there.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So in terms of – nothing really material to share with you in terms of the shape of
the geographic backlog. As you know, merger transactions, the most significant decision a CEO, his or her
management team, and a board makes in the lifecycle of the company, and so these decisions tend to come into place
over many, many years in terms of how they're executed. At the margin, obviously markets can drive thinking.
Sentiment has been a big factor a couple of years ago in preventing transactions from happening. And then when
sentiment shifted, you've obviously seen a huge uptick in activity. But there's nothing I would comment on with respect
to global activity. Certainly growth, as we see big disparity in growth around the globe, that may be an influence there.
But it's nothing to share with you today.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay. All right. Thank you.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey. Good morning.
Operator
Marty, your line is open. Please check to see if it's on mute.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Oh, there we go. Good morning.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Morning.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: I wanted to make sure that as we looked at the comp ratio, when we typically get these
adjustments as we get towards the end of the year, which you're saying reflect operational improvements and
efficiencies, is there any thought about permanently kind of incorporating this throughout the year so that it seems more
sustainable and less, kind of temporary in the year-end adjustments?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah. No, so there's – again, there's no change in philosophy on that how we'll do
this. It's always going to be a quarter-to-quarter assessment. It's our best estimate for where we stand at that particular
point of the year. And as I said, it reflects all the factors you've heard us talk about.

<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then you mentioned on the debt underwriting, the regulatory pressure on leverage
lending and maybe some impact there. Does that feel a little bit more permanent as you move forward, given the stance
that we've seen, talked about openly by the regulators?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So the comment I made about leverage lending actually wasn't, didn't have
anything to do that. That was actually just transaction-specific quarter-to-quarter. As I mentioned, the backlog was up
at the end of the third quarter across all categories.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Okay.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Specifically what you're talking about, though, it'd be interesting to see how that
will evolve. I know market participants, regulators, certainly all of us at Goldman Sachs are very focused on the
compliance with that. And that will be very interesting see over the next couple of years what impact that has in terms
of markets where those transactions get financed, at what leverage levels, and that'll be even a developing story we'll all
keep an eye on.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then lastly, the $0.05 dividend increase, while still in that kind of 10% range, your
earnings have grown much higher than that over the last year. Revenues were up much more than that, excess capital is
abundant. Your payout ratio is low, and your dividend yield is still relatively low. So it seems like you had some
headroom to maybe potentially go up a little bit more than that. I just didn't know what your thought was there.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So when we assess capital return, as you know, our preferred mechanism for
capital return is related to the share repurchase. We think it allows us to be very dynamic in terms of responding to our
clients' needs and market conditions, and so while the dividend has certainly come up meaningfully, I think you should
still assume that Goldman Sachs will rely on share repurchase as its predominant tool.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Got you. And humor me for one more question. If you look at the market commentary,
you said with the pain of the volatility, coupled with the kind of regulatory Volcker kind of compliance move and you
VaR coming down, do you feel like, as a market maker you're just – are you kind of hamstrung in ability to kind of
help the market go through some of these transitions now, given all the new regulation?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So I just want to be clear, because I thought – you may have misheard me or I may
have misheard you. There's nothing that I saw about Volcker compliance that I think is, at this stage, preventing people
from providing liquidity. Volcker has been pretty visible for a while now.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Right.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: The comment I was making is that it's very hard to assess the collective impact of
leverage rules, increases in risk-weighted assets, reductions in balance sheets globally in terms of the entire industry
and what that means for market liquidity. And we've certainly seen areas where people – I haven't looked at all the data,
but most firms at this stage have actually shrunk their matchbooks, I think I'm pretty accurate in saying that. And so, all
market participants, regulators included, have been asking themselves the question of when we are seen increases in
sales and treasuries, whether how much of that was driven by market makers' inability or lack of appetite or not being
able to position balance sheet in terms of providing that liquidity at important times. We'll have to see again, how all
this evolves. When you look at Goldman Sachs today, given the level of our capital ratios, which I described earlier in
the call, we certainly have the capacity to deliver for our clients when they need it, so.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thanks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thank you.

<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Hey, just a quick question, when you look at some of the regulations coming down the
road here, wholesale funding surcharge being one of them and the NSFR, both of those would benefit from a greater
level of deposit funding on the balance sheet [indiscernible] (1:04:12). Are you thinking about growing deposits
currently, and if you are, kind of, are you thinking about it organically or through acquisition or are you just not even
thinking about it at all?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So we obviously focus on it, I think in the context of rule making, this will be very
interesting because, you mentioned the NSFRs, let's just use that as an example. I think as an example of a rule in a
concept, I think again, that falls into the bucket of a good concept, because you want good asset-liability management
across the industry. We spend a huge amount of time on asset-liability management, the way we look at secured
funding and how we manage our balance sheet, and we run a very conservative profile in terms of how we manage that.
With respect to this rule, it will be very interesting because we haven't even seen the Basel rule yet. I think the big
question will be again is this – when you add this rule onto other rules, is there some long-term impact on market
liquidity? So obviously, clients and we will be very focused on that. As this goes through the rulemaking process,
because you specifically linked it to deposits, it will be very interesting when you get to the U.S., because as you know
in the U.S. it's a different legal structure in terms of your ability to use deposit funding for certain businesses, and so,
not only do we need to wait to see the Basel rule but then, we'll need to see the U.S. rule and how they incorporate just
a different legal structure that exists in the U.S. So we'll have to see how it goes.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Okay. And just a separate question on the ECM backlog, is there any specific reason
that's kind of driving strength there? I think you said last quarter, Europe was strong in underwriting, but this quarter,
has that changed?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No, it's just a normal part of the marketplace in terms of people coming to the
markets and raising capital for a variety of needs. But there's no key driver.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Okay. Fair. Thanks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thanks.
