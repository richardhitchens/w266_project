MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Greetings. Welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Monsanto Company Earnings and R&D Update Conference Call. At this
time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations Lead from Monsanto. Thank you. Mr.
Hurley, you may begin.
Bryan Hurley
Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining our first quarter earnings update. I'm joined this
morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; as well
as Pierre Courduroux, our CFO; Robb Fraley, our Chief Technology Officer. And also joining me from the IR team are
Ashley Wissmann, Tim Boeker and Manny Cruz.
As it has been historically, our first quarter call is the first data point on our business for the year as well as an
extensive review of our R&D pipeline. So our emphasis today will be on the color in both categories.
The call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and replay at monsanto.com.

We've provided you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP and an ongoing-business basis. Where we refer to
non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on
the website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on
assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a
material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.
A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent
10-K and in today's press release.
We'll move quickly to the heart of our strategic discussion. As we do, let me anchor it on a brief point of our first
quarter results on slide 4 in the financial section of the slides.
Our first quarter EPS was $0.67, which was ahead of last year's Q1 and reflects the first increment of growth, in line
with our expectation as we outlined our full year outlook and earnings flow at the beginning of the year.
Likewise, our free cash flow for the quarter was $457 million, which includes the expected investment in The Climate
Corporation acquisition and incremental CapEx that are built into our full year guidance.
Combined, both measures reinforce confidence in our full year outlook.
So with that, let me hand it to Hugh for the strategic view at this first quarter.
Hugh Grant
Thank you, Bryan. Good morning and Happy New Year to everybody on the line. The first quarter is an important
milestone as it sets the tone for the year. So I think what's important about the first quarter is, on the key measures,
we're exactly where we expected to be.
Even at this early point, that's the validation that our business is delivering on our expectations, we have the right
growth strategy in place and fiscal year 2014 is off to the right start.
Brett and Pierre will walk through the specific details, but let me set out the key points that I feel put Q1 in the strategic
context of both fiscal year 2014 and also our multi-year growth outlook.
First, with everything on track, we're confirming our full year guidance today, as shown on slide 5. All of our indicators
continue to line up to deliver our projected mid- to high-teens operational growth and bottom line ongoing EPS
guidance.
That's no small point, particularly in a year where there's more volatility and more headwinds across agriculture than
there has been in the past few years.
Secondly, while Q1 isn't a big quarter in terms of dollars, it's a quarter that featured several key milestones that
reinforce this year's outlook and our mid-term growth, ranging from the strength of the order book and strong pre-pays
to the visibility of our 3 million acre launch of Intacta in South America.
It is still early and with the end of the Latin America second season and the full Northern Hemisphere season ahead. So
while early indicators are right on track, we're going to stay focused on delivering in each of those seasons before we
declare success.
I'd also highlight that we've another key milestone; our second quarter in a row with record use of cash for share
repurchases. We've now bought more than $1.1 billion in shares over the last two quarters as we've moved from
addressing dilution to meaningfully reducing share count.
As we look ahead from the first quarter, we're now in a period where there's always a lot of speculation about acres and
shifts so it's a year where our balanced portfolio is a real benefit. Commodities and acres are shifting this year more

than the last few, but our balance provides hedges in different crops, products and geographies that balance those
year-to-year ups and downs.
Maybe more importantly, the broad opportunity in agriculture on slide 6 creates a long runway outside of the shifts in
any one year. The simple reality is that demand continues to grow, and even with conservative rates that don't yet factor
further demand, with lower commodity prices, there's a long horizon of opportunity ahead for companies like
Monsanto that can leverage technology to help farmers meet this demand in new ways.
And that's my final point. This quarter always reflects our annual update on our R&D pipeline as the innovation in this
pipeline is going to continue our leadership in driving yield and productivity to serve that demand.
It's leadership that's reflected in the fact that we've a record number of advancements in the pipeline this year, but it's
also leadership in defining what's next for this industry. With the new platforms we're ramping up in precision
agriculture and biologicals, we've more technology and more platforms to drive that next increment of yield and
productivity than ever before.
So with that, let me hand it over to Brett to add some color to these key milestones.
Brett D. Begemann
Thanks, Hugh, and Happy New Year to everyone on the line. Hugh noted that our business results came in right as
expected, an early indicator that we're on track to deliver the growth we expect in 2014.
At an operational level, I'd take that one step further. In the first quarter, the visibility has improved across-the-board on
our key growth drivers shown on slide 7.
As we entered the year, I said my emphasis would be on margin expansion. We're seeing a pricing uplift as we upgrade
the portfolio, the mix lift with technology upgrades, contributions from our global business and the benefit of an
improved cost of goods position. And with one quarter of results in hand, margins in both corn and soybeans are
showing the first increment of improvement we expected.
Let me make that practical as I focus on the metrics that matter. The biggest of those is one of the most important
metrics at this time of the year; the U.S. order book on slide 8. We're coming off several strong years for the U.S.
business and we're in a good position to continue that again in 2014.
At the end of the calendar year, the order pace for the U.S. portfolio is strong and tracking very well with our growth
targets. That's particularly important given that farmers are ordering against a lower expected planted acre base than
would've been driven the intentions for crops like corn last year at this time.
U.S. customer pre-pays are up over last year and provide a good indicator that there are solid commitments behind the
order book. The deadlines for pre-payment and cancellations were in December and, with those behind us, we now
have strong clarity on our position ahead of our primary shipment season.
That's also reflected in the quality of the order book, where we see the mix uplift we expected that backs our plans. In
corn, we're on track with the germplasm portfolio upgrades that drive the 5% to 10% price mix uplift. Likewise in
soybeans, we see order book strength, which is relevant in a year where we see some shifting in acres between crops.
The order book is a good indicator but we'll stay focused until the business proves out. At this point in the year, I feel
as good as I can about the order pace, mix and growth opportunity.
The order book is also a reflection of the strong wrap-up of the U.S. harvest for our products, and that's part of the
improved line of sight I mentioned. It provides another year of strong product yield performance that Robb will
highlight. As our teams work with our grower customers, that's a critical component that reinforces our performance
advantage year-in and year-out.

The other key post-harvest milestone is the better visibility on the cost of goods improvement we expected. With the
production in full swing, we've seen the benefit begin to flow through and that underscores our confidence in our cost
position and margin improvement.
The next critical drivers take us to Latin America and specifically the Intacta opportunity on slide 9. With most of the
South America's soybean acres planted, we've achieved a major milestone. We have very good visibility into the
success of our largest-ever soybean launch with an expected 3 million acres of Intacta.
Practically, we've been very focused on making sure farmers have a good experience as the record pace this year starts
a slingshot for what we expect is a faster ramp-up than any previous soybean launch.
This is a year where some heavy insect pressure actually showcases the benefits of Intacta more visibly. Across Brazil,
there are common reports of growers already spraying normal soybean fields four to five times to deal with heavy
pressure. When you can reduce two to three sprays with Intacta, it speaks to the direct value and savings they get,
combined with the improved yield.
Our South American teams are working closely with growers, our channel partners and across our brands to bulk up the
right varieties in the marketplace to enable a quick ramp-up in both Brazil and Argentina against the 100 million acres
of opportunity.
Moving to corn, despite the fact that there were less planted summer acres in Brazil and Argentina, we are still seeing
the trait upgrade that's critical to our longer-term growth. Those upgrades are happening consistently as next-generation
traits are expected to represent around 50% and 60% of our trait mix in our brands in Brazil and Argentina,
respectively.
In the larger portfolio, our Ag Productivity business is on track with the stable to stronger outlook we provided and we
are benefiting from our consistent and disciplined pricing approach. Effectively, we are seeing the contribution from
the price accumulation that occurred through 2013 as we compare back to the first quarter of last year.
As we move forward, we expect this to normalize and have not built our plans around price increases but rather to a flat
to potentially declining generic price. Specifically, in places like the U.S. and Brazil where indicators point to a
significant number of soybean acres planted and growers are looking for solutions to manage tough-to-control weeds,
we expect demand for glyphosate to say strong over the coming year and to further drive our mix towards our branded
products. And today, that branded mix is already at some of the highest levels we've seen over the last few years.
And finally, let me emphasize one that doesn't drive the financials this year but sets much of the opportunity ahead and
that's our precision ag platform on slide 10.
2014 will be a year of strategic milestones and we've already had several major advancements since our November
Investor Day. First, we recognize we want to turn our early head start into a major long-term advantage and you do that
by building your organization for speed. We formally united Integrated Farming Systems, Precision Planting and The
Climate Corporation teams into a focused operating group. It is being led by David Friedberg, The Climate
Corporation's CEO, and will report directly to me.
This is a business structure that will drive the natural connections between these technologies and we'll have the
autonomy and flexibility to optimize the dollars we are investing in the platform and deploy technology at a
software-industry pace.
The biggest priority for Dave's team will be the commercial launches of FieldScripts, Climate Basic, Climate Pro and
multiple Precision Planting upgrades, in addition to expanding Climate's risk management operations.
Just as we've looked at the order book for our Seed business earlier, you can project a similar outlook for these products
and services. And I'd tell you, we're making good progress against our targets and we expect a strong first year base of
subscription acres across our precision ag family of offerings.

The second critical priority in building the platform is to get anchor partnerships in 2014, and I'm pleased to announce
today that we've entered into a memo of understanding with WinField, our largest distribution partner and the largest
U.S. agricultural retail distributor.
We've agreed to work together to explore formal connections between our IFS and Climate Corporation tools in
conjunction with their industry-leading R7 precision ag offering. This is a giant first step, and we see this as a catalyst
to accelerate the formation of an industry-wide information and decision tool platform.
So with that, let me hand it over to Pierre.
Pierre Courduroux
Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Brett outlined the significant milestones that reinforce our confidence in
the business and underscore the growth opportunity for this fiscal year. I will now highlight a couple of points related
to how I see this year's financial outlook at the end of Q1.
First, as Hugh indicated, the financials for the quarter are right on track with what we expected. And although Q1
reflects less than 15% of our full year earnings, it reinforces our confidence in our full year projections and our ability
to deliver on our commitments.
Second, over the last year, I have indicated that we will be more aggressive in taking action on our cash deployment
and in this quarter we've been true to that priority.
We've reflected our confidence in growth within the business for additional CapEx investments. We've invested in
additional growth through the additions of The Climate Corporation and our alliance with Novozymes. And we've been
deliberate in being more aggressive in returning value to our owners, as we've just completed our second quarter of
record spending on share buybacks which contributed to lowering the share count versus the first quarter of last year by
about 8 million shares.
I'll cover these cash deployment's emphasis in more detail but, before I do so, let me briefly cover a couple of key
points in the quarter and how they tie to our full year growth metrics on slide 11.
The most relevant financial milestone in the quarter is the incremental margin improvement we start to see in both corn
and soybeans. Importantly, we are seeing the first steps toward the expected full year margin improvement and we are
squarely on track for the growth of around 3 points in corn and 6 points to 8 points in soybean.
This is important because this reinforces our confidence in our expected Seeds and Genomics gross profit growth for
the full year.
In a small quarter, the bottom line performance reflects some of the anticipated changes from last year's Q1 and all of
the financials line up well with how we see the business playing out for the full year.
As expected, the majority of the quarterly contribution came from our Seeds and Genomics segment. The biggest factor
there is the most strategic; the positive margin contribution coming from the traits and mix of grades in corn and
soybeans. This positive driver is balanced against the expected decreases in corn acres in Latin America, some acre and
timing effects related to cotton in Australia and a more normalized U.S. contribution pattern after the step-up from last
year's accelerated season.
The first quarter also reflects the Roundup contribution Brett mentioned, as we saw the anticipated carry-over benefit
from last year's pricing and some early volumes. For the rest of the year, we expect that to normalize to the
steady-to-better view we now have on Ag Productivity.
Regarding operating expenses, we did see a quarterly increase coming from our early launches. In particular, some of
the launches related to precision agriculture and Intacta required some early investments.

Page 6 of 20
While operating expenses will grow this year, we expect to continue with our disciplined approach to spending those
investments as we achieve milestones, like launches and approvals.
As I think about the earnings flow from here on slide 12, it's helpful to work backwards from Q4. As we expect to see
the positive contribution from soybean royalties in both Brazil and the U.S. and don't anticipate to see a repeat of some
of the isolated factors that impacted Q4 in FY 2013, we expect the fourth quarter to be significantly less of a loss this
year.
We expect Q2 to be the largest earnings quarter and contributing to growth. But with a more normalized U.S. season
and some of the Ag Productivity timing benefits in the first quarter, we don't expect to see the same magnitude of Q2
growth as we saw with last year's accelerated U.S. season.
Through the coming quarters, we expect to make incremental progress on our margin and EBITDA growth targets with
the full effect realized by the close of Q4.
From there, I want to focus on our cash generation and deployment on slide 13. In the quarter, we generated $457
million in free cash, reflecting strong pre-pays and the investment in The Climate Corporation. This keeps us on track
for our full year free cash guidance of $600 million to $800 million.
And to be clear, this guidance is inclusive of the $932 million purchase price already applied to the acquisition and the
$300 million related to the recently announced Novozymes deal.
Over the last year, I've reinforced our commitment to use that cash generation to fund growth and continue to be
aggressive in returning more of the value we create to our owners. Within the quarter, we completed a $1 billion public
debt offering, taking advantage of the favorable debt market and our strong balance sheet, largely to fund the
acquisition of The Climate Corporation.
I think this demonstrates that we are willing to use the strength of our balance sheet to fund all the priority items we've
called out, including our CapEx, share buybacks and dividend programs.
We've continued to fund organic growth as demonstrated by the $300 million CapEx investment in the quarter. We've
also continued to fund future growth as highlighted by The Climate Corporation acquisition but also the investments
we've made in the alliance with Novozymes.
And we have continued to fund our share buyback program and, for the second straight quarter, we have set a record
for buyback spending with $561 million in Q1. Combined, we add/repurchased approximately $1.1 billion over the last
two quarters. We've closed out our previous share buyback authorization in just seven months and are already making
significant progress against the $2 billion program announced last June.
That aggressive program is already showing through in the financials as we've made a significant transition from only
offsetting dilution to reducing share count. We began this year with a lower share count than the same time last year
and we'd again expect to further reduce on a full year basis ahead of 2014.
And finally, we also stay committed to funding our dividend program as demonstrated by the increase in our annual
dividend at the end of the fiscal year.
So as I wrap up, let me emphasize that we are confident in our earnings growth for this year and that we are focused on
using the strong cash-generating capability of our business to continue that growth while also being aggressive in
delivering value to our owners.
With that, I will hand it off to Robb to talk about the continued opportunity created by our pipeline.
Robert T. Fraley
Thanks, Pierre, and good morning to everybody on the line. I'm going to jump right into the pipeline update, starting
with slide 4, and here's the headlines.

Page 7 of 20
So first, I think this is more than just a record year in terms of project advancements. It's an exponential step-change in
the pace and breadth of our R&D engine. We've expanded the number of projects and platforms as we capitalized on
the only pipeline in the industry that truly targets a total system for yield and productivity.
On slides 5 through slide 8, you can see we have more than 70 projects in the pipeline and we advanced almost 30 of
those this year. This sets a new trend. And with the expansion of the pipeline and the opportunity with some fast-cycle
technology, I think we've moved from the days of advancing a-dozen-or-so projects to advancing waves in our new
platforms each year.
Second, that's important because it sets the commercial opportunity. In this year, you'll see a record number of projects
graduating from the pipeline. You've heard me say we don't do science for the sake of science. Our focus is on getting
products to the commercial marketplace so they can help our farmer customers, and this is the proof point; there's five
products coming online this year, including game-changing technologies like Intacta and FieldScripts.
And that leads me to our final highlight. Among these advancements, some of the most exciting advances are coming
from our new platforms. It's not just that we have new platforms but that these platforms build on the established lead
we already have in breeding and biotech.
That's a tremendous competitive advantage, and we're really entering a new era where we expect farmers will see
waves of technology that build on each other in a total system in the seed, in the bag and in the field.
Given the number of advancements, I won't go project-by-project. So I'll highlight across key themes, starting with the
strategic leap we've made this year with our new platforms. We've added or advanced more than 10 projects in
precision ag and biological, including several first-ever product launches.
The most powerful near-term catapult will come from the Integrated Farming Systems pipeline on slide 9 and there's
been big progress since our November investor event. Most importantly, the cross-synergy we expected between The
Climate Corporation and FieldScripts is already proving out.
With the first version of FieldScripts barely out of the pipeline, we are already working on the enhanced version that
increases the power of FieldScripts by building in the hyper-local weather modeling capability from Climate. From
there, we're adding on even more layers as we're working on prescriptions for varying nutrition and other inputs and
then positioning multiple corn hybrids and soybean varieties per field.
Likewise, The Climate Corporation team is supercharging their algorithms with the massive genetic database from
Monsanto's field testing, differentiating decision tools like Climate Pro with the scope and scale of data that we believe
is unrivaled.
The pipeline is analogous to software upgrades in terms of timing and frequency, with rapid upgrade cycles adding
features and functionality that help drive initial adoption and continuing adding value. This is exciting work and I'm
thrilled with what we've been able to assemble and the progress we've made in this area in such a short time.
Practically, our Ground Breakers program this past season was among the most successful and insightful that we've
had, as it allowed us not only to test multiple types of prescriptions but also the equipment and the delivery system.
Growers are more interested in this precision agricultural opportunity than I've seen with almost any other new
technology.
So as we make the early transition to the commercial arena this year, the first couple hundred thousand acres are
strategically important but they're not material financially as we start the ramp-up with the early adopters for our
precision ag family for what we see as a transformational platform over the next few years.
We've made just as important strides in the area of biologicals with a springboard year for both our BioDirect
application and new microbials in our alliance with Novozymes.
Our first topical BioDirect RNAi technology appeared in the pipeline only two years ago. And today, on slide 10, we've
made advancements across multiple projects in insect, in disease control and even bee health.

These projects are now in Phase 1 so there's still work to do, but as you can see by the data and the photos on the slide
the results are extremely exciting. And so, we'll continue the development work as this is definitely a breakthrough
technology that could create significant value in the next decade.
Our biologicals platform was accelerated with our recently announced BioAg Alliance with Novozymes. This is the
premier microbial R&D engine in the industry. And while I hinted at it when we announced the alliance, we now have
numerous search data that proves our testing capability can result in game-changing products.
On slide 11, this year we saw the early power of our testing network in only first year of testing but these early results
are directional; however the data is very encouraging. In corn, we saw an average yield benefit of 4 bushels to 6
bushels per acre with key products that will be part of the alliance, marking a level of performance that compares with
some of the most successful biotech traits.
Now, we'll expand the field testing power with plans for an unprecedented 1 million yield plots over the next few years.
Just as importantly in this year's research, we saw encouraging results that tell us that there are variable reactions to
microbial performance in different agronomic conditions. We believe there is a tremendous synergy between our
microbial and precision ag platforms where we can optimize the placement, performance and realized benefit of
microbial products.
Not to be lost is another key point that applies to both BioDirect and microbials. These are a different class of products
than GMOs and we expect many to have expedited regulatory approvals, lower cost development and the ability to
benefit markets were biotech traits aren't relevant today.
If we shift to the next theme, it's around breakthrough areas where Monsanto is developing technology that departs
from anything anyone else in the industry has done. The best example of this is our Corn Rootworm III technology on
slide 12, where we've developed the first insect control product to use RNAi-based modes-of-action inside the plant.
So while the rest of the industry still focuses exclusively on Bt genes, we have a completely novel approach.
The lead project advanced again this year to a pre-commercial testing in Phase 4, marking rapid progress through the
development phases and setting us up for a regulatory review as we've submitted in the U.S. and in several international
markets.
With that milestone, we're transitioning from a project to a product that will be branded as SmartStax PRO. That keeps
us on the right path for the next commercial upgrade of our SmartStax platform later this decade.
Just as importantly, last year we advanced the next generation of RNAi candidates. So we have a wave of unique
modes-of-action come in to upgrade, solidify our durability and to add incremental value for farmers.
The other technology unique to our R&D effort is the work we're doing in yield-and-stress with the BASF
collaboration and today there are two pieces of new news. First, I'm pleased to announce that we've extended the
yield-and-stress research and development collaboration with BASF, allowing us to continue this valuable partnership
as we target new yield opportunities for farmers.
On the performance side, last year we mentioned that we were seeing early but promising signs in corn taking a
multi-gene approach to increasing yield. On slide 13, you'll see we've made some important progress this year as we've
identified a new wave of promising gene candidates that gives us a pool of yield-enhancing options to test.
This is obviously early, but we see this ability to identify multiple yield genes as one of the differentiators in our BASF
collaboration and critical to being able to really address yield-and-stress on a broad scale.
As we move on, one thing that stands out in our pipeline is our depth. Others in the industry are still pursuing
first-generation and second-generation products while we're generally focused on third-generation and
fourth-generation upgrades with broad acre global potential. And the case study is clearly our weed and insect control
programs, where we've made several advancements this year.

The biggest, of course, is Intacta on slide 14. This blockbuster moves out of the pipeline as it enters the commercial
market. But scientifically, the step-change is in the rapid deployment of next-generation upgrades.
In the U.S., a decade passed between first-generation and second-generation technologies. With Intacta, we just
advanced our second-generation to Phase 4 in the same year we launched the first-generation version, and look no
further than this year to see why this matters.
As Brett said, with a significant outbreak of insect pressure, the better performance of Intacta is very visible. With that
insect pressure so top-of-mind, next-generation products that expand insect control and enhance durability really matter
to growers, and that's exactly what's in our pipeline.
The next obvious example is weed control, where the Roundup Ready 2 Yield Xtend Crop System starts a similar
upgrade cycle for third-generation and fourth-generations. Both the biotech trait and the complementary chemistry are
in Phase 4, where some of the new progress focused on our chemistry formulation we announced called XtendiMax
with VaporGrip, and that's designed to significantly reduce volatility while providing excellent weed control and
residual activity.
With the increasing need for multiple modes-of-action in weed control, this product will be able to serve a large
addressable market with a fit on over 100 million acres across the Americas. We're progressing towards commercial
launch in both the U.S. and internationally.
The recent dicamba chemistry over-the-top label approval in Canada reflects a significant milestone of the first
complete Xtend System approval of trait in chemistry. We continue to see progress on approvals in the U.S., Argentina
and other key import markets. The recent announcement of progress on the Dow Enlist Environmental Impact
Statement provides us further encouragement that these product approvals are progressing on track in the USDA.
And we're not stopping here. On slide 15, we've added two new third-generation and fourth-generation projects this
year both focused on building on our Xtend platform by incorporating additional modes-of-action for weed control.
The last theme I'd like to emphasize is our breeding engine, which I often describe as our biggest blockbuster. And it
matters for two reasons. First, it provides the horsepower as we upgrade our global germplasm portfolio every year, and
most people appreciate that.
But lesser appreciated is the power in breeding technology to target problems plant breeders simply couldn't tackle five
years ago, and our disease resistance program is the perfect example. With the tools of high-throughput screening and
advanced markers, we're able to supercharge our efforts here, and that acceleration is evident this year.
On slide 16, we've deployed this resistance capability in row crops, with four major advancements that target some of
the most devastating diseases in corn, soybeans and cotton. And likewise, we've leveraged those same tools in
vegetables, and you can see on slide 17 that we've added two completely new projects and advanced another key
project in our focused crops.
And as I complete the run of the technology platforms, I can't stress enough the differential advantage we get because
of our breeding engine across crops. Now we did an extensive review of our data at our November event, but I have
one significant new update to highlight today.
On slide 18, you can see our cotton results for this year, with the new cotton varieties we're launching are delivering
similar step-change in performance to what we're seeing in corn. We're out-yielding the competitive best by 6%, and
that's about 74 pounds of cotton lint per acre or nearly a $60 an acre advantage for Deltapine cotton.
On slide 19, you'll also see that we've now put back-to-back years together with a better than 4 bushel per acre
advantage of Roundup Ready 2 Yield over the first-generation product.
But the highlight for me continues to be our corn advantage on slide 20. With our final results, our yield advantage is 8
bushels an acre. And so, even in a year where overall yields were some of the strongest we've seen, we're still in that 7
bushel an acre to 10 bushel an acre advantage band. And it's that consistency in performance that defines our DEKALB

products and really forms the base of technology and performance across all of our products.
And that, I think, is an absolutely critical point on slide 21. There's always a lot of talk about new technologies or
products, but everything we do is built on the best performing seed in the industry. And increasingly, it means that the
more we pair our germplasm advantage with technology in the seed, in the bag and in the field, the bigger our
competitive advantage can become.
While our R&D leadership is key, it's more than just the fact that we have a record number of advancements. The
pipeline itself paints a compelling picture of where this industry is going. Increasingly, we're moving beyond farmers
making do with disconnected input components and we're on the leading edge of giving farmers real integrated systems
in their fields.
Think about it; you start with a seed that's capable of delivering more yield than at any other point in history and then
we protect that with cutting-edge traits embedded in the seeds, wrap around that chemical and microbial seed
treatments that fend off disease and increase the health of the plant. And then, utilize sophisticated algorithms to plant
and position all the inputs meter by meter across the field.
We're talking about a prescription agriculture that looks a lot like individually personalized medicine, and that's how
we're going to drive yield and productivity. And you can see all the elements coming together today in waves that build
on each other and which drive the opportunity for our farmer customers and our companies.
So, thanks. And I'll turn the call back over to Bryan for the Q&A.
Bryan Hurley
Thanks, Robb. And with the extended conference call to accommodate the R&D update, we've planned for some
additional time for questions as well.
With that, we'd like to open the call for questions now. And as we typically do, I'll ask that you please hold your
questions to one per person so we can take as many questions from people as possible. You're always welcome to
rejoin the queue for a follow-up.
So, Rob, I think we're ready to take questions from the line.

Thank you. Mr. Hurley. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan
Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thank you and good morning, everyone. I just want to try to square some of your qualitative
comments about the order book and where the year sits with what we saw in the quarter as well as where your deferred
revenue is. And I guess in particular, what I'm trying to understand is how the deferred revenue wound up being flat
year-over-year. And the simple math that I'm doing is that we see corn acres down in Brazil, it looks like they'll
probably be down in the U.S., and so I'm assuming that means your overall volume will be down. And if volume is
down, I kind of think that means price/mix must be up to keep deferred revenue flat. Is that too simple of a calculation
or are there other moving parts?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Vincent, thanks for the question. I'll maybe let Pierre add a bit more color on that because there's
bit of algebra and geometry play in there. But I think the headline in this is we feel good – in a more normalized year,
we feel good about where our order book is. But Pierre, maybe a little bit on deferred payments?

<A - Pierre Courduroux>: Yes, regarding the deferred revenue and the pre-pays and the order book, which all go
together, we really feel we're in a very good situation. And maybe what you missed, Vincent, in the criterias you listed
is that remember last year season was extremely early. So actually, with all the discussions around the acres that are
going on right now, with the fact that the season last year was way earlier and farmers were trying to secure supply,
actually being at the same level of pre-pays as we were, actually we're a little up versus last year, I mean we feel it's
really a vote of confidence from the growers. So we feel it's still very early, but we feel actually very good about the
situation regarding our pre-pays and deferred revenue.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Okay, thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Brian P. Maguire>: Hey, good morning. It's actually Brian Maguire on for Bob today.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Hi, good morning.
<Q - Brian P. Maguire>: Yes, Hugh and Brett, I appreciate the comments around the order book. Sort of just
following on to that last question, just qualitatively it seems like – you indicated the mix was improving. It seemed
maybe a bit counter to what some might have thought with corn prices falling here. So I was just looking to see if there
are any trends below the surface you're seeing to indicate that farmers might be either trading down on the type of seed
that they're buying or that you're seeing any increased competitiveness when it comes to pricing or discounting going
on right now?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yes, no, thanks for the question. I think that the danger is we always default to corn and the love
affair with corn, and soy sometimes gets neglected. And I think, Brett, you started this by talking about margin
upgrades, and we've seen that in both corn and in soy or the front end of that in corn and soy. Maybe just a word on
mix and volume, how you're feeling about that.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yes, I think that's the really important part of this, is we started the year with a focus on
margin. And that margin improvement comes from continued movement to second-generation traits in South America,
which albeit acres are down but we clearly see our second-generation traits moving up in our portfolio. So I see farmers
stepping up, not stepping backwards. We see the strength in our portfolio, where they're stepping forward to our new
germplasms, our new hybrids and varieties.
And when I look at the U.S., I feel really good about the mix that we see in our early order book. As I look across, the
farmers are not stepping back. They're actually stepping up to the better performing products in the order book. So,
that's why I feel so good about it right now.
From a competitive standpoint, to your point in the market, we're back to normal year and there's normal noise in the
marketplace, but I don't see anything out of the ordinary of what we would expect. The focus for us is we've got the
best germplasm and performing products, the best trait packages, and we'll stay focused on that.
<Q - Brian P. Maguire>: Okay. And just a follow-up for Robb, if I could, on Intacta, just the difference between
Intacta and the second-generation of it. As Brett mentioned, we're seeing a lot of pest pressure in Latin America in
soybean out here, hearing a lot about corn earworm there. And I see on the slide 14 there, it seems to indicate that
maybe the second-generation is providing more comprehensive protection. But could you just qualify if the Intacta
that's out there in the market today will be giving farmers a level of protection against corn earworm or is that
something that's coming in the second-generation one?
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Yes, so we're seeing, as Brett mentioned, a pretty heavy insect pressure across parts of the
Brazil production areas, and the Intacta product has performed very well against caterpillar pressure and the earworm.
As we bring the second-generation product with multiple modes-of-action, that performance will only increase as will
the durability of performance in the product. And we're working on the third-generation product as well, with

additional weed and insect control benefits.

innovations over the next decade.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Cox with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: Thanks a lot. Congratulations on a nice quarter, guys.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thank you very much.
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: My first question is I was a bit surprised to see the decline in corn gross profit given your
commentary around the biotech mix benefit in LatAm, I guess not withstanding some of the acreage issues there. But I
was wondering if you could provide maybe a bit more color around what drove this year-over-year decline in Q1.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Maybe I should have Pierre say a few words.
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: Yes, I'll take this one. So, very consistent with what we were expecting. So what we've
seen in the first quarter is, first, what Brett was mentioning. I mean in South America, both in Brazil and Argentina, we
are seeing the trait upgrades we were expecting. So from a pure business perspective, things are going really well.
However, as you mentioned, I mean this is balanced by the reduction in acres that we've been seeing in South America
and that we were anticipating. And the other factor that's been playing in the first quarter and that we are watching very
closely is the currency. I mean the reais compared to last year has been weaker against the U.S. dollar, and that's
something we are watching and taking a good look at this point in time.
But overall, I think what's really important is really the margin improvement. We are very consistent with what we
were expecting and very consistent with our plans at this point in time.
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: Okay, that's helpful. And then, just one quick follow-up on FieldScripts. I believe Robb
mentioned it in the prepared remarks, that it's important to get the first few hundred thousand acres done right. And is
that a fair estimate for your expectations for FieldScripts this year, somewhere in that few hundred thousand acre
range?
<A - Hugh Grant>: It will be in that order. I think the name of the game at the start of this, and I'm really, to Brett's
point, on combining this group and letting David run it, the name of the game is getting happy, satisfied customers,
really driving that experience and building subscription acres. I think it would be in that kind of order in the first year.
I think the other piece, the news this morning of the MOU with WinField, I think, is really huge. They're early pioneers
in this space. They've done a bunch of work across a number of crops, and I'm really delighted that we're strengthening
and building that relationship with the team there. They're really good people.
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: Thanks. Yes, the farmers love that R7 tool. Thank you.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yes, they sure do.

<A - Hugh Grant>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: I guess a couple of questions maybe for Pierre. Did you collect any meaningful amount of
revenues from your new DuPont royalty arrangement and did that show up in soybean gross profit line?
And secondly, on your share repurchase, you bought back $561 million worth of stock but your fully diluted shares
actually went up sequentially from 531.5 million to 532.6 million. So, how did that happen?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So regarding the first question, there's no revenue associated with our agreement with
Pioneer booked in the first quarter, so the answer to that is no. All the revenue is coming from our Brazil business,
which basically is related to Intacta. So, that's a big upside for us this year and we are right on track there. And the
second element is also the early season in the U.S., where we see very, very good momentum.
Regarding your questions regarding shares, so one of the factors you see playing in the first quarter is the buybacks but
also some of the dilution factors we had related to our stock options program. Now on the accuracy of the numbers, I'll
need to come back to those.
But basically, overall when we're looking at it, from a pure quarter comparison to quarter, year-to-year, we've been
reducing by 8 million. I think you're comparing with the end of August and I don't have this number in front of me. But
from a year-end to year-end, I mean we've been able to reduce our share count by about 8 million. Now, within the
quarter, you may have seen some dilution effects related to stock options. We may have to come back to you on this
one.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Okay, great. And then, just as a quick follow-up. Were your glyphosate volumes up in the
quarter or down?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So, volumes were marginally up. So, we are seeing some timing benefits in the first
quarter.
What is really important I think beyond the pure volume upside, and there is some, is the portfolio. The breakdown
between branded and non-branded products has been really favorable to us in the first quarter.
And remember also when you're drawing the comparisons with last year's number, in the first quarter last year, we
didn't have the prices set at the same level as we've seen for the rest of the year. So in this first quarter, you're seeing a
huge catch-up in terms of pricing to get us consistent with the last three quarters of last year. That's kind of the way it's
been playing out.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Okay, thank you very much.

Thank you. Your next question is from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Thank you. A question for Robb on R&D. Robb, with the new platforms, precision planting
and biologics, what impact is this going to have on R&D spending in both absolute dollars and percentage of sales in
terms of perhaps a higher rate of growth? And you used to talk about how Seeds and Genomics' R&D was roughly split
50/50 between breeding and biotech. How would you break it out with these two new platforms?
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Thanks, Don, and Happy New Year. In general, we're just starting the investment on the
microbes and the BioDirect and the other IT platforms. So there's still overall a small portion of the R&D engine.
I think when you look at our overall projections and expectations, I think we'll still continue to be in that 11% to 12%
band in terms of sales. I always make the point that one of the things that we're able to capture and take advantage on is
just the incredible efficiency gains that we get both as a result of the new technology platforms. I gave the example that

the cost of sequencing, the cost and data point per marker is dramatically down. We're a lot more efficient in terms of
our use of IT tools across our breeding and R&D efforts.
So, I expect us to stay in that band. We might have seen a little bit of uptick in the first quarter because, as was
mentioned on the call, we've had a number of product launches and a few start-ups, particularly with the microbes and
some of the BioDirect projects. But I see us staying in that historical band as a percent of sales.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: And just as a follow-up, on Corn Rootworm III, given you advanced to Phase 4, given the
greater efficacy and durability of RNAi versus Bt, what are your thoughts as to the kind of value that's inherent in that
product in terms of a premium over what you might be able to charge on existing corn rootworm control projects?
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Well, I would never take away the opportunity to price from Brett. But what I can tell you is
from our field testing this last year, the performance is outstanding. And the synergy, we will deploy it, as I mentioned
in the prepared remarks, as an upgrade to SmartStax and it will become our SmartStax PRO product towards the end of
this decade.
Having a new mode-of-action against a pest that is as important as Corn Rootworm I think is a really big deal. Now
that we've launched Intacta, I think you have to look at both the SmartStax PRO and the Roundup Ready Xtend in
soybean and in cotton. That's really the next two big biotech blockbusters coming out of the pipeline.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson of Credit Suisse Group. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Perfect, thank you. You mentioned this briefly on the call, but I noticed there are
some interesting advancements in cotton on both the biotech and breeding fronts. Can you just further hit on some
general thoughts here concerning the competitive positioning and the potential this market could bring over the next
year or two given there hasn't been any huge investor focus recently?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yes, I'll maybe ask Robb to say a little bit more on the technology. The interesting thing on cotton
is, as in all these crops, performance really counts. In cotton, that really, really counts. And you see quite significant
share movement when you have that performance edge. So I think the increment the Robb talked about today can
translate into share gain in the next couple of seasons and that cotton grower, given the economics of cotton right now
and how much pressure there is, they're looking for that next opportunity. But Robb, you talked about significant gains.
Anything else?
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Yes, there's a lot of exciting new technology targeted into cotton. I mentioned the breeding
gains that really come from the full deployment of our markers. We've also seen some really nice breeding trait
technologies and I specifically highlighted the nematode tolerance.
And then, on the biotech front, the Roundup Ready Xtend will be a major technology addition for U.S. and South
America growers. And we continue to make progress on the advancement of Bollgard III.
So, the challenge in cotton is not the technology platform. The acres are more limited in cotton than in other crops. As
you know, in Australia, our market tends to be regulated by the amount of water and rainfall. And we've seen the
challenges, of course, in India with the slowdown in regulatory acceptance for biotech products. But overall, cotton
remains an important crop for us. It's a crop that we invest proportionally to the fact that it is probably the third largest
crop platform in our portfolio. But we also recognize it is one we have to ensure that we extract the appropriate value
for the technology.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Perfect, thank you. And just a quick follow-up on some of the corn questions
earlier. Given the South American corn acreage decline, how should we think about the offsets of some Eastern
European acreage growth, particularly in the Ukraine and Romania? And if you could just give a quick overview of

what you're seeing there, including any market share developments?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Brett, maybe a quick word on Eastern Europe and the Ukraine?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yes, I think that's one of the big advantages we have today, is the geographic balance of
our portfolio. Whether those corn acres happen in South America or Eastern Europe or in the U.S., we're in a position
to participate in a significant way.
I think it's really important when we talk about corn acres to step all the way back to the broad picture. The reality is
corn demand continues to grow around the world and we don't see anything that's changing our expectation with that
overall demand growth.
Sure, we've seen the acres pull back a little bit in South America. There's some discussion about where they're going to
be in the U.S. this coming year and what that means for Eastern Europe. But at the end of the day, global demand is
continuing to grow for corn. We have to figure out how we can increase the productivity of corn and acres are going to
be a component of that. That's going to be a variable every year. And rather than trying to guess acres every year, we're
focused on the big demand for corn, how do we increase productivity, and we'll use those tools on whatever acres get
planted each year because our profitability is going to come out of increasing the productivity and bringing new
technologies and tools and suites of tools to the farmer.

Your next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes, good morning. How would you assess the level of competitive intensity in U.S. corn
this year versus last year? And specifically I was wondering if you could comment on where you think your price mix
contributions are tracking versus your target of up 5% to 10%?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Hi. Kevin, I'd say this was more a normalized year in every respect. So in terms of pace, in terms
of draw-down of orders, the build and order book and also competitive intensity. So we saw some hotspots, but Brett
how would you compare with last year?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Well, I would say that the thing that we have to be careful of is when we start comparing to
last year. With the tight seed supply...
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Right.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: No one was too interested and being too aggressive with anything. But what I see out there
in the marketplace today is more like what I would call normal.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: When most seed companies are in a good position with supply and the markets are little
tighter because there's discussion about less acres and those kinds of things that's moving at a normal pace, I'd call it
normal. I'm not overly concerned about the activity that's out there. You manage the hotspots and you move on. And
we're fortunate today to have such a broad deep portfolio of products that we're offering in the marketplace, that it sets
us up well to participate in those conversations.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Great. And then, as a follow-up, if I may, for Brett, on the subject of glyphosate, it looks
like we've seen Chinese technical grade prices come off over the last three months or so. What implications would you
expect for Monsanto's price and volumes as the year progresses? And perhaps you could provide a bit more color on
where your mix of branded products stands today and how that's trending?

<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yes, let me start with where you ended, Kevin. As I look at the Roundup business, as I
mentioned, our mix of branded product is the highest it's been in many years. So I feel really good about that and I see
that intensifying this year particularly with the increase in acres of soybeans in North America and South America. And
over-the-top applications tend to prefer the Roundup brand, so we're a good place there.
I kind of look at Roundup as we kind of have a six-month line of sight on what's going on in Roundup and we don't pay
as much attention to what's going on with acid prices out at China as we do the – what the generics are doing and how
they're pricing in the marketplace.
But as I look at that next six months or so, I don't see a lot of change occurring in it. That's why I'm looking at it as
flattish prices to what we're seeing today. The step-up we got in this first quarter, as Pierre already mentioned, was the
catch up in the first quarter year-over-year comparison to where we were last year.
So, I don't see a lot of change. Our history has been in that $10 to $12 range. We're kind of floating towards the high
end of that $12 range and I still feel like as we look to this year, that's going to be reasonable place. But I still think it's
flattish as we go through the next six months.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: That's helpful. Thank you.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Thank you.

The next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Given last week's Cheerios news, what's your view on this potential growing
consumer resistance to GMOs and what can you guys do to offset that or put your case forward more aggressively?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yes, thanks for the question. The Cheerios news, the interesting thing with Cheerios over that
particular brand is they're made from oats and there are no biotech oats in existence today.
So I think we've talked for years about we would support voluntary labeling and that was up to companies to do. I think
what you saw last week was the first real life example of true voluntary labeling and probably a little bit of marketing
as well.
I would say this: since I think the last six months, maybe eight months now, we've had a better dialog with the broad
food industry than I've seen in the previous 10 years. The back-end of last year, September, October last year, you saw
the food industry led by GMA getting out there and posting websites that talk about the safety and benefits of these
technologies.
So, it's a lively debate. I think we're going to see more of these marketing initiatives and more voluntary labeling. But I
like the fact that there's a dialog and I like the fact that the food industry is in the game and is actively discussing these
technologies. It's a lot healthier than it's been in the last 10 years I think.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: And just quick follow-up for Brett. Brett, on Ag Productivity, is your guidance still the same
for the full year of flat to up modestly or is it a little bit stronger than that now given the strong Q1?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I think it's very consistent. It's playing out as we had expected. We expected the step-up in
first quarter, but I'm still looking at pricing being flattish for the year. So, it's as expected.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Mark Gulley of BGC Financial. Please proceed with your question.

<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: Hey, good morning. Robb, I've got a question regarding yield in the field. It has to do with the
kind of data you need to help growers make better decisions. Are you going to need to supplement the data you're
getting from weather to private corp with something else, so field surveillance, I'm thinking in terms of robotics or
something like that? Is that necessary to drive this forward or do you have enough to work with now?
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Thanks, Mark. In general for us, let's just focus on FieldScripts, which are the product that
we'll launch this spring and we did the Ground Breakers last year. For me, the highlight of the Ground Breakers, we
tested a couple of different scripts. And our high-intensity script where we had knowledge that we've worked with the
grower both on past crop history, on fertilization levels, gave us a script that put us in the 5 bushel per acre to 10 bushel
per acre yield benefit. So the information that we need to move forward with that first-generation script, I think we've
proven that and tested that last year.
The other big thing that came from the testing last year was how well the system worked in terms of the wireless
transmission, the delivery, the reliability and the robustness of the iPad system that we have in the tractor cab.
So, I feel really good about our ability to execute on that first-generation script and deliver value to growers and we
know clearly the information content there that's important to deliver that yield benefit to the grower.
What we'll see with the benefit from The Climate Corp. capability is we'll make – we'll add to that basic script a
weather-enhanced version. So, we'll be able to make even better selections on hybrids, make better recommendations
on planting dates and which fields should be planted first. So, that will only enhance the yield benefit of FieldScripts.
And then on the last part, I'd just highlight, as mentioned in the call, we're really working now to develop partnerships
with the other companies that will expand on that base. And it's very great to be able to announce the MOU today on
the partnership with WinField, because they're a leader in this space and they bring both a footprint of additional crops
that we're not participating in and that'll be a nice opportunity to, I think, create incremental value for both companies.
<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: And then in terms of helping farmers increase their profitability, I'm intrigued by the
comments you've made so far on soil fertility and application rates. I know it's early days and, again, as you just
indicated, you've got a lot on your plate right now. But any long-range view on what you can do to perhaps reduce
application rates of various nutrients?
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: I think that's something that we continue to work on. And as you see in our scripts, one of our
next-generation scripts will be variable nutrition. I think right now, the most important benefit that we'll see, as we vary
the population, we will need to vary the nutrient proportional to the seed planting density. So our first focus is to
optimize the use of nutrition to optimize yield, not necessarily to reduce it, and that's the key.
The other factor that comes in that is being built into the models and really, I think, is going to be a key benefit of the
integration of all the technology with The Climate Corporation is we know that the nitrogen uptake is both
weather-conditioned and hybrid-specific...
<A - Hugh Grant>: Right.
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: So being able to bring together the unique knowledge of the hybrids with precise field
weather history is going to be really important as we think not only about the initial applications of nutrients but the
side dressing and the in-crop feeding that may also be very, very important.
<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: Thanks, Robb.
<A - Hugh Grant>: We'll get some nice insights there from WinField as well. Bryan, a few more?
<A - Bryan Hurley>: Yes. I realize that we've extended the conference call a little beyond our normal stopping time,
so why don't we take two or three more questions here?

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thank you. As you start to negotiate deals like WinField, how are you thinking about your
desire for market penetration versus maybe their desire for exclusivity? And is that going to be different in row crops
versus fruits and vegetables?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yes, we haven't really done too much in fruits and vegetables. I guess as we think about the row
crops, we're thinking about expanding that pie. I think our early philosophy on broad licensing continues to apply, so
the thoughts of getting as many people in as we possibly can. I think the days of exclusivity are long behind us.
And as I mentioned at the start, the growth experience, building growth, confidence and really, really driving
subscription acres is the goal. But I'm very, very pleased to have WinField as the first partner up in the platform, and I
look forward to the days when we're announcing more in the future.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Sure. And if I could just ask you a quick question to Dr. Fraley. In the past, sometimes
your decisions on pipeline dropouts have been almost as important as the things you move forward to. For example,
when you decided that the corn for ethanol wasn't attractive. Is there anything like that in the pipeline that's dropping
out this year that represents a major decision or a significant shift for you?
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: There's not really anything major this year. I think probably the only project that I'm aware of
that dropped out of the pipeline is we've made the decision to stop some of the yield work in cotton that was part of the
BASF collaboration. But that was a pretty minor effort. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we've extended
that relationship and it's really focused on bringing those advanced yield traits in corn to the marketplace.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Super. Thank you both.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thank you.

The next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Good morning and Happy New Year. Apologies for beating a dead horse here on this Ag
Productivity, but it was the best level that it's been in, like, five years. Brett, I know you said that you expect flat
pricing, but are you going to continue to see the mix of branded versus non-branded increase, which obviously would
bode well for your gross profit for the rest of the year? And I think you indicated that you're going to see – your
expectation is to see it reach normalized levels, which I believe is a level below here. When are you thinking? What
kind of timeframe are you thinking about that?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yes, thanks, Frank. As I look at the year, I really look at it as good visibility for the next
six months and I don't see any drivers that really encourage significant change in pricing. But of course, we'll always
monitor that and watch where the generics are in the marketplace.
We're already at some of the highest levels of brand versus non-brand that we've been in, in a number of years. And
yes, that continues to strengthen. And the part of what's strengthening this year is, as we mentioned, the higher soybean
acres and the demand for the over-the-top product.
But I remind you that when we think about our Roundup business, we make around 300 million gallons and sell around
300 million gallons. So yes, we'll continue to improve with the mix gain and we'll do that as we can throughout the
year, but we won't have additional volume.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Thank you so much. And then on TCC, they announced that they were launching Climate Pro
while we were at the Investor Day in November. What's been the receptivity for Climate Pro? And can you share with
us any expectations in terms of acres for fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2015?

<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yes, thanks. I have to tell you I'm really excited about that whole space as I shared on the
call. We just brought all of those businesses together between, The Climate Corporation, our IFS work that we had
already going on, and Precision and putting that into a new business platform. And David is leading that and that's all
feeling really good.
And yes, they launched The Climate Pro. I would tell you, just like Robb said, this is an area where I see more farmer
interests than anything we've done in quite some time. And our focus in the early years, number one is going to be
around a whole suite of things that we're bringing forward and making sure that we help the farmer leverage the whole
suite to get the biggest impact, buying the best genetics, protecting it as best that they can with what's in the bag, and
then what we can do to help them grow that crop.
And our focus is going to be around a few hundred thousand acres in the early period with this to make sure the farmer
has a great experience, and that gives us the momentum to build from. So this is strategically more important about a
great farmer experience than it is about acres in the near term, and then we'll take it further beyond that. The Climate
Pro will be a component of that.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Thank you so much.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thank you.
<A - Bryan Hurley>: And, Rob, I want to be respectful of everyone's time and recognize that we've already gone long.
Why don't we take one last question and then we'll wrap up with some final remarks by Hugh.
Operator
Thank you. Your final question is from the line John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Thank you. In terms of the Roundup pricing adjustment, should we think about the first
quarter as annually being the sort of catch-up either up or down on your pricing relative to generics?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I look at it as it was coincidental that pricing was somewhat stable through the last three
quarters of last year and that we're catching up in this one. As I said, our price adjustments going forward over the
years is going to be more based on where the generics are in the marketplace. So depending on when they choose to
move around, that's going to drive ours. So I think it's coincidental that it just happens to be the first quarter catch-up
whether it's up or down.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: And then, secondly, Robb, you kind of slipped in the weed advancement to Phase 2 in the
appendix there. While it's technically moved forward, has anything market-wise changed in terms of customer interest
or receptiveness around having GM weed?
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: I would say – and I'm glad you noticed that, yes. So we field-tested and advanced one of the
first weed biotech products based on improvements in weed control. And from an overall market perspective, the grain
industry and the wheat industry, specific the wheat trade industry, has remain very interested and supportive of biotech
advances.
I mean a wheat farmer generally is also a corn and soybean farmer and they understand the benefits of the technology.
And the wheat industry has watched the benefits that this technology has brought to both corn and soybean.
And so, we continue to make advances. We're still several years away from product launch, but it's nice to see those
products in the pipeline. Thanks for noticing.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Thank you.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thank you, John. Just to re-emphasize Brett's point, there is no seasonality or timing in this. We
laid out – ran our brand price really close to that Chinese generic real price. So we have no doubt that we continue to
compete with that Chinese generic material.

Hugh Grant
So, let me wrap up. I'm conscious of the time this morning. So let me begin by thanking everybody for joining us on
this call. As I mentioned in my opening, there's no doubt that the first quarter increasingly provides an important
milestone in affirming our confidence and it reinforces the 2014 opportunity.
And in the near-term I think we're seeing the right indicators for the important opportunities in Latin America as well,
as the ongoing delivery of our core businesses in the U.S. And that's reflected in our confidence in delivering our
outlook even in a year where agriculture is more variable than it's been in the past few.
Beyond this year, with the R&D update that Robb walked through today, you can see that we're in a better position than
ever to add waves of technology that come together in the seed, in the bag, and in the field.
And today, as we bring together The Climate Corp., IFS and Precision Planting, we see the opportunity for
collaboration and open architecture with equipment partners, with crop nutrition and with grain partners going forward.
And that's what will continue to drive our opportunities into the future.
So I want to wish, on behalf of the team here, all the very best to you as we start another new year. Thank you very
much for your participation.
