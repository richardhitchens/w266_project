MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Crystal, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Second Quarter FY 2013 Operating Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to
prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions] Thank you.
Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO, you may begin your conference.
Richard A. Galanti
Thanks, Crystal. Good morning to everyone. This morning's release of course reviews our second quarter and fiscal
first half 2013 operating results for the period ending – that ended on February 17th.
As with every call, let me start by stating that the discussions we're having will include forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Many of these statements involve risks and
uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such
statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other
risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.
So to begin with our 12-week second quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.24, up 38% from last year's $0.90
reported number. As noted in this morning's release and as I had mentioned during our first quarter conference call –
earnings call back on December 12th, this quarter's net income was positively impacted by a $62-million or
$0.14-per-share income tax benefit that was in connection with the portion – that portion of the special cash dividend
paid by the company in December of 2012 to company 401(k) plan participants. Excluding this one-time benefit, our
earnings per share for the quarter would have been $1.10 or up 22% year-over-year.

In terms of sales for the second quarter, total sales were up 8%, and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure was
up 5%. For the quarter, sales were very slightly benefited by gasoline inflation, less than 10 basis points of an impact,
and were also benefited by strong foreign currencies overall relative to the U.S. dollar year-over-year and that added
about 50 basis points. Even so, the 5% U.S. comp sales excluding the gas inflation remained at 5%. And while the
reported 6% international comp figure, assuming flat year-over-year FX rates, would have been 4%, total company
comps were reported at 5% excluding both gas and FX, they still came out to 5% for the company overall. And as
announced last week for four-week month of February, which of course includes two weeks in – the last two weeks of
fiscal Q2 and the first two weeks of our fiscal Q3, but in terms of those four-week month of February, comps came in
at 6%, both for the U.S. and the total company.
In terms of new openings, after opening 9 new locations in the first quarter, which ended November 25th, we opened 5
new locations in the second quarter, 1 in Washington D.C., 2 in Canada, 1 in Oshawa which is in the Toronto market of
Ontario and 1 in Drummondville which is in the Montreal market in Quebec. We also opened in Leicester, U.K., in
Central England and in Gwangmyeong which is outside of Seoul, Korea. All told that puts our 2013 fiscal year
openings through the second quarter end at 14 new locations, such that we now operate 622 locations around the world.
Between now and the end of fiscal 2013, which I think ends on September 1st, we expect to open an additional 14
locations, 5 in the current fiscal quarter and 9 in the fourth quarter. Of these 14, before fiscal yearend that we haven't
opened yet, 4 will be in the U.S., 5 will be in Japan, 2 in the U.K. and 1 each in Taiwan, Australia and Mexico, such
that we will most likely end the fiscal year with 28 new openings this fiscal year and be operating a total of 636
Costcos worldwide at that time.
I'll also talk later in the call about E-Commerce, membership trends and discuss guidance of course about margin and
SG&A. On to the quarter itself; again, sales were up 8%, comps were up 5%. In terms of the reported 5% comp number
that was the product of an average transaction increase of a little over 2% for the quarter and an average frequency
increase of a little over 3%. The trend – the frequency trend for the last three calendar months that we reported was a
5%, a 3% and a 4% for December, January and February and year-to-date we're at a 4%.
In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, overall the Southeast Texas and Midwest regions were the
strongest. Internationally, in local currencies Korea and Japan were the weakest, again mostly due to the
cannibalization on a relatively small base of existing units and with Canada and Mexico being the strongest
internationally in local currency.
In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, for the second quarter within food and sundries, overall in the
mid-single digits. Frozen foods, candy, and deli were the relative standouts and hardlines overall in the
low-single-digits. Departments, the strongest results were hardware, patio, garden and lawn and garden, and tires.
Consumer electronic sales were slightly negative, mostly due to the timing of the fiscal calendar as the typically strong
Black Friday sales around Thanksgiving benefited Q2 last year and benefited Q1 this year. So you take that out and
those numbers would've been a little better.
Within the higher single-digit softlines comps, small electrics, domestics and jewelry were the standouts, with media of
course continuing to be the relatively weak area. And in fresh foods comps in the mid-singles, deli and produce were a
little better than the two other large categories.
Moving on to the other line items, membership fees, we came in at $528 million or 2.17% of sales. That's up 15% in
dollars or up $69 million from the $459 million last year and up 13 basis points. In terms of membership, we continue
to enjoy strong renewal rates and I'll go through a little bit of that in a minute. Continued increasing penetration of the
Executive Membership which is the $110 – roughly $110-a-year fee. And we're still of course benefiting from the $5
and $10 membership fee increases that began a little over a year ago in both the U.S. and Canada for – and of the
$69-million increase year-over-year membership fees, right at – half of it or about $35 million was due to the fee
increase.
Membership fee income, as I've talked about in the last few quarters, based on the deferred accounting nature of those
increases and recognizing the increases occurred over a 12-month period based on when somebody originally signed up

and then the income comes in over the succeeding 12 months of that first increase, basically we'll continue to show
year-over-year benefits from that fee increase throughout fiscal 2013 and to a lesser extent into the first quarter of fiscal
2014 this coming fall. And again that's due to the deferred accounting treatment for membership fee income. New
membership sign-ups in Q2 company-wide were up about 1%. There were more locations open this quarter, 5 versus
last year's 2. It's mostly reflective of the very strong sign-ups we have internationally, most particularly in Australia and
Asia. Last year we opened 2 units in Japan during the quarter and 2 right at the end of the quarter in the first few days
of Q3. Of the 14 units open thus far this fiscal year, only one of them has been in Asia. And, again, we have pretty
much oversized sign-ups in some of those new units.
In terms of number of members at Q2 end, Gold Star 27.8 million, up from 27.3 million at Q1 end. Primary business
remained at 6.5 million. Business add-on went from 3.6 million down to 3.5 million. Again that's somewhat reflective,
I believe, of people as they switch into their own membership as an Executive Member. All told, total members went
from 37.4 million at the end of the first quarter to 37.9 million, and including extra cards, spouse cards, 68.2 million
went to 69.1 million at Q2 end. At Q2 end paid Executives were a shade over 13 million, an increase of 181,000 over
the last 12 weeks or about 15,000 new Executive Members. That's both new members and conversions from the base
Gold Star membership. Executive members are approximately a third of our membership base and a little over
two-thirds of our sales.
In terms of renewal rates, they continue to tweak up in the U.S. and Canada, which is about a little over 80% of our
total company and certainly the oldest and most mature part of our company. Business renewals which ended the fiscal
year at a 93.7% rate and at the end of the first quarter was 93.8% are now at 93.9%. And Gold Star which was 88.7%
and remained there at the end of the Q1 was 88.8%, such that total U.S. and Canada was – went from an 89.7%
essentially to 89.8% over the last quarter. And worldwide, recognizing in newer markets you start off with lower
renewal rates anyway, we went from an 86.4% at yearend, remained there at the end of first quarter and it tweaked up
to an 86.5%. So really since we – over the last year, since the increases, we've always been asked a lot about renewal
rates. Basically, each quarter have been either the same as the prior quarter or slightly up and then they continue to
tweak up almost a full percentage point in the last year and a quarter.
Going down the gross margin line, reported margins were up 6 basis points from a 10.53% to a 10.59%. Here we get to
write down a few numbers, a little chart with five line items and four columns. Basically, we'll do two columns for each
of Q1 and Q2. And of course, those of you who've heard this before, this relates to the fact of how many basis points of
margin reduction or improvement come on a year-over-year basis in the comparison. And once we do the chart, I'll give
you a couple of comments.
In terms of core merchandising, reported in Q1 was minus 7 basis points year-over-year and without gas inflation was
minus 1 basis point. Going across that line it was zero and zero in Q2 and Q2 – reported and without gas inflation. On
ancillary business, the second line item, plus 14 basis points and plus 15 basis points in the Q1 columns, plus 2 basis
points and plus 3 basis points in the Q2 columns. 2% Reward minus 2 basis points and minus 3 basis points in the Q1
columns and minus 1 basis point and minus 1 basis point in the Q2 columns. LIFO plus 1 basis point and plus 1 basis
point in the Q1 columns and plus 5 basis points and plus 5 basis points. And lastly, total reported Q1 was a plus 6 basis
points which would be the sum of column one. That's what we reported in Q1 year-over-year margins. Without gas
inflation, it adds up to a plus 12 basis points. And then, of course, for Q2 reported as I just mentioned, we were up 6
basis points which would be that third column summation and without gas inflation plus 7 basis points, recognizing
there was very little gas inflation.
Basically – again, core margins were basically flat year-over-year. Those are the four core businesses, food and
sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods which is a big piece of our business. Basically, not a bad showing. If you
look back of course, as you know over the four quarters of fiscal 2012, on average, year-over-year prior to fiscal –
compared to fiscal 2011, those numbers were minus 13 basis points without gas inflation and the trend in Q1
year-over-year was minus 1 basis point and of course now it's zero year-over-year.
And secondly, ancillary businesses, you'll note that in Q1 it was 15 basis points year-over-year. A big chunk of that as I
mentioned in the first quarter call was strong gas margins year-over-year and some inflation. I think I said in the first

quarter call about two-thirds of that plus 15 basis points related to that. In Q2, gas reversed as gas prices went up.
Margins go down as cost of gas goes up, we make less and that plus 3 basis points reflects strong ancillary business
margins, offset by probably 5 or 6 basis points of negative related to gas. 2% Reward is simply a reflection of a little
higher sales penetration to those earning the 2% Reward. And LIFO was a plus 5 basis points. Again that's a LIFO
credit of I mentioned – I'll mention in a minute, it is about $9 million of a credit versus a $2.5-million LIFO charge in
the same fiscal quarter a year ago. Mind you, when LIFO is a positive, it means the cost of the merchandise are coming
down, and as you might expect, we tend to reflect that in our sales price as well, which would be on the merchandise
margin line.
The – for the second quarter, year-over-year food and sundries gross margins were flat, hardlines and softlines were up,
and fresh foods was lower. As I mentioned on ancillary overall in the chart you saw was a plus 3 basis points without
gas inflation. Again, all the other ones, pharmacy, optical, hearing aids, food courts were all up during the quarter, more
than offset – or offset by what I just mentioned about gasoline. The impact of the membership on Executive Member I
already mentioned and LIFO I mentioned as well.
Moving to reported SG&A, our SG&A percentage second quarter year-over-year was slightly higher or worse by 2
basis points, coming in at 9.70% versus 9.68%. Again, we'll write down four columns, the same four columns, two for
Q1, reported and without gas and then two for Q2 and the five line items would be core operations, central, RSUs
which would be stock compensation, quarterly adjustments, and total.
Going across, in Q1 the two columns were plus 10 basis points and plus 5 basis points, meaning lower – plus means
good, lower; and in Q2 zero and zero. Central was minus 7 basis points and minus 8 basis points last year and zero and
zero this year in Q1 and then zero and zero in Q2. Stock compensation was minus 4 basis points and minus 4 basis
points and then in Q2 was minus 2 basis points and minus 2 basis points. Quarterly adjustment in Q1 was plus 8 basis
points and plus 8 basis points. That was the – that plus 8 basis points last year was compared to the prior year a
one-time charge for the – an initiative in Washington state that we funded for alcohol. And then quarterly adjustment is
zero and zero in Q2. So all told, reported in Q1 was a plus 7 basis points, meaning that SG&A was better or lower by 7
basis points in Q1 year-over-year; plus 1 basis point total without gas inflation and then in Q2, again, it was minus 2
basis points and minus 2 basis points so again higher by 2 basis points.
Within core operations, our payroll as a percent of sales improved year-over-year by 5 basis points. It was lower by 5
basis points. Total payroll dollars increased about a little over 6% in Q2 compared to the 8% sales increase so a good
showing there. This improvement in payroll was offset by higher costs in benefits and healthcare including healthcare
and workers' comp, pretty much a wash between those things. Some of that was accrual related. Again, these are big
expense numbers that we also do actuarial things for. Central expense, it was flat year-over-year in Q2, notwithstanding
ongoing IT modernization costs. I think in Q1 we talked about that was 6 or 7 basis points year-over-year increase. On
an ongoing IT modernization basis as we're halfway – well, not halfway through but into the second year of a
three-plus-year project, it represented – on an ongoing basis we estimated it's about a 3 or 4 basis point hit over the
coming quarters year-over-year.
Next on the income statement line is pre-opening. It was $6 million in both Q2 last year and this year. Now, last year
we only had 2 openings, this year 5, really no surprises. A lot of it has to do with timing. Pre-opening starts in some
cases many months before the actual opening in terms of the costs associated with it. All told, operating income in Q2
was up $94 million or 15%, as operating income went from $644 million to $738 million year-over-year.
Offsetting this reduction – hold on a second. In terms of below the operating income line, reported interest expense was
lower year-over-year with Q2 coming in at $25 million, $2 million lower than the $27 million last year. Basically, we
had one big reduction in interest expense in the quarter and then an increase related to the recent debt offering. As you
recall, last year on March 15th we paid off $900 million of what was five-year maturity fixed rate debt. The annual
pre-tax interest savings to Costco paying that off, I think I mentioned back then, was about $46 million pre-tax per year
or about $10.5 million pre-tax for this quarter. So that would make it lower – made it lower by $10 million. Offsetting
this reduction, of course, was the – was about $8.5 million of additional interest expense related to our recent debt
offering.

As you know, on November 28th we completed a $3.5-billion debt offering in the form of senior notes, a combination
of three, five and seven-year notes with a weighted average maturity of five years and an all-in annual rate of interest
just under 1.25% which again is about $44 million pre-tax per year currently. And so that's about a $9-million increase
in interest expense for the roughly 11.5 weeks of the 12 weeks that it was issued and outstanding during the quarter. So
pretty much a wash between those things and that's why interest expense year-over-year was pretty much in line with
last year.
Interest income and other was higher year-over-year by $16 million in the quarter. Last year it was $10 million. This
year it was $26 million. Actual interest income for the quarter came in at $11 million, the same amount year-over-year.
The other component of interest income and other amounted to income of $15 million this year versus $1 million of
negative last year or a $16-million swing. About $13 million of this $16-million year-over-year change was related to
foreign – forward foreign exchange contracts we used to manage the cost of U.S. dollar merchandise purchases in our
international operations. These contracts are required to be marked-to-marketed each quarter end, and a change
year-over-year was attributable to the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar as of the end of Q2 of this year versus a
general weakening compared to the U.S. dollar and these various foreign currencies in Q2 of last year. Last year, again,
we recognized a small loss related to it. This year we recognized a gain.
Now mind you – and again this doesn't show as part of our gross margin. This is where you put these FX contracts but
these are generally done by our buyers in foreign countries where they are basically locking in typically foreign
currency or U.S. dollar merchandise purchases in many cases where they've locked that in. And so again, as it relates to
the buyers, they – many of them consider that part of their margin, although we show it here.
Our company tax rate this quarter came in at 25% – 25.1% versus 34.2% last year in Q2. As discussed earlier on the
call, the income tax line benefited primarily from a $62-million tax benefit in connection with that portion of the
special cash dividend paid by the company in December of 2012 to employee 401(k) plan participants. At such time,
Costco shares held by employees in the plan approximated 22.6 million shares. These were held through an employee
stock option – employee – ESOP established several years ago. Dividends paid on these shares were deductible for
U.S. income tax purposes and we recognized that one-time tax benefit during the quarter. Excluding the one-time
benefit, our tax rate in Q2 came in at 33.5%, slightly lower compared to the last year's 34.2% during that, basically a
combination of a few positive discrete items that went our way in Q2. Generally – let's see. Ongoing, we'd estimate our
effective tax rate, barring anything unusual, for the balance of 2013 to be in the range up to 35%.
Overall, net income was up 39% versus last year's second quarter and excluding the one-time benefit the 39% increase
would have been 23% on a net income basis and as I mentioned earlier 22% on an earnings per share basis.
A quick run-down on a couple of other topics. The balance sheet will be included in the info packet that you can get
online. Actually, it was in the press release as well. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $217 million and
$430 million year-to-date. The other component that we're asked about is our inventories to payables ratio since we're a
high turn business and we fund a lot of our inventories with trade payables. It improved year-over-year in the second –
as of the second quarter end. On a reported basis, it looks really great at 98% at the end of Q2 versus 91% AP as a
percent of inventory. There is a lot – given our ramped-up expense right now, there is a lot of non-merchandise
payables there for construction and related stuff. So really, on a merchandise inventories to merchandise payables, it
was 86% a year ago and it showed a little improvement to 87% this year. So it's certainly in the right direction there.
Average inventory per warehouse was up $600,000 from $11.6 million per warehouse a year ago to $12.2 million this
year so up about 5% on the 8% sales increase. Just under – a little under half of that $600,000-per-warehouse increase
related to higher levels of merchandise in electronics and small electrics – consumer electronics and small electrics,
with the balance mostly spread over mostly other non-foods departments. Overall, our inventories are in good shape.
No big markdown issues through the recent holidays as well as our midyear fiscal inventories which we take in January
and February. Halfway through our fiscal year were our best ever.
In terms of capital expenditures, in Q1 we spent $488 million; in Q2, we spent $455 million for a total of $943 million
through the first half. I'd estimate that for the year it will be in the $2 billion dollar range compared to last year for the
whole year of about $1.5 billion. And again that certainly reflects our ramp-up in openings.

In terms of Costco online, we – as you know, we operate both in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. now. Both sales and
profits were up again in Q2 and Q2 year-to-date. As you know, we replatformed the site last fall and also have our first
apps and so far so good.
In terms of next on the discussion list, expansion; as again I mentioned, we have no relos or closings this year. So – but
in terms of units, basically for the four fiscal quarters, 9 in Q1, 5 in Q2, 5 in Q3 and 9 in Q4; that would put us at 28 for
the year, up from 16 net new openings in fiscal 2012 and 20 in fiscal 2011 so finally we got up a little bit there. If you
go back to fiscal 2012, the 16 units on the base of 592 was about 3% square footage growth. The 28 this year, assuming
we can get them all open, on a base of 608 that we began the year with, which would be a square footage growth in the
4.5% to 5% range. New locations by country for the year would be – of the 28 would be 13 in the U.S. and 3 in
Canada; 3 in the U.K.; a total of 7 in Asia, 1 in Taiwan, 1 in Korea and 5 in Japan; and 1 each in Australia and Mexico.
As of Q2 end, total square footage stood at 88,986,000 square feet.
In terms of stock buybacks, we did not purchase stock in Q2. As you know, we purchased quite a bit less than we had
in the last few years – a couple of years in Q1. Certainly, we – during the first several weeks of Q2 we completed a
special dividend and the debt offering through the holidays. I don't think there's a whole lot to read into that at this
point. Sometimes we'll buy a little more, sometimes a little less and as we've said in the past we'll let you know each
quarter.
In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividend stands at 27.5% – 27.5 cents per share per quarter or $1.10 a year.
This currently represents annualized dividend costs for the regular dividend of $480 million. That's of course in
addition to the $7 special dividend which totaled a little over $3 billion paid out to shareholders in December of 2012.
As I mentioned, the supplemental information pack will be posted to the Costco Investor Relations site later this
morning. Lastly, I'll go ahead and our third quarter scheduled earnings release date will be May 30th. That will be for
the 12 – that's a Thursday I believe. That'll be for the 12-week third quarter which ends on May 12th.
With that, Crystal, I'll turn it back to you for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Just a couple of things, drilling into payroll and benefits a little bit, if you looked at total
labor cost, payroll is probably what, 80% and benefits are 20% or something like that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No. Well, keep in mind, benefits is everything from healthcare to FICA to vacation and
sick leave, it's everything. It's not just healthcare. The big one that has the most inflation in it, of course, is healthcare
cost and to a lesser extent, but percentage-wise this quarter workers' comp, but roughly for every payroll dollar it's
about 50% – another $0.50 in the U.S. and less in other countries.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Well, because I'm wondering the 80/20...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: 80/20 is – maybe 80/20 just in healthcare and benefits, yes. But I don't have the exact
number off the top of my head.

<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: So, if you look at the other part that would have offset that, the all-in benefits was
probably up what double digit or not that high?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't think it was up that high, no.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't have that level of detail in front of me, but the big issue is, as I mentioned earlier,
accruals. Keep in mind, given we're talking about $20 billion, $25 billion sales numbers, every basis point is $2
million, $2.5 million, just accruals on $1 billion annual U.S. healthcare cost and $150 million – $100 million, $150
million annual workers' comp cost when you look at different actuarial numbers, you're always going to get plus or
minus a few basis points, sometimes plus, sometimes minus. And it's kind of like the – as I mentioned on some of the
discrete income tax items, on all those small little things more went in the positive than the negative, a couple of more
in the negative than the positive here, so that – is healthcare and workers' comp in the U.S. still inflationary? Yes. It's
still – healthcare I think is definitely in the low double digits in terms of percentage dollar growth in Q2.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: And you still think you need what about a 4.5% comp to leverage expenses or has that
changed?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's somewhere in the 4% to 5% range. We've given up on trying to figure it out since there
is so many other moving parts now with international and manufacturing businesses and everything else we do in life.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Another thing, so on Kirkland; where does that stand roughly when you think about
percent of units sold and percent of dollars and to what degree has that been growing?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think units, I don't know the units off the top of my head, I would guess we tend to
try to build bigger packs and better quality and there are examples as you know in the past from the tuna fish where we
sold our brand, which is packaged at a higher spec, higher-quality than the leading national brands at a higher price, but
a greater value. But, let's assume, on average it is a lower price point by 10% or 20% versus what we would sell the
brand for. Private label is in the low 20%s and continues to grow.
And when we talk about aspirational numbers, we'd like to see a three in front of it, instead of a two, but I don't know
how long that takes but certainly we keep adding new items. In the last couple of years, we've certainly added several
items in apparel, in canned goods, those types of items. I think, I mentioned last quarter on the call, like the KS men's
wool slack, which is a very high quality slack at $50 or $65 where we've gone from low six digit units to closing on 1
million units a year. So, those are the kind of things that eke out some numbers too.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: And it's growing – is it growing as a percent of SKUs inside the club, I imagine maybe a
little bit?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Absolutely.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: So that mix that you are getting, if you are managing where it is coming out to a flat gross,
the positive mix you are getting from Kirkland, it to some degree is getting reinvested in price somewhere. I don't know
where, but it's somewhere, right?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Again there is a hundred moving parts. At the end of the day I think that we've seen as you
know I think you were one of the ones who pointed out earliest back in Q4 of 2011 as we were "investing in price" and
seeing some of the numbers come down year-over-year – overall gross margins and certainly as I mentioned in the
quarters where a lot of it is, we saw that year-over-year trend flatten out in last two quarters relative to being down 10
to 15 basis points on a year-over-year basis each quarter last year.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: All right. And then just one last thing. I don't know if you have anything to say about this,
but what are you seeing in Texas with Sam's membership fee increase; anything different competitively than what you
are seeing from them elsewhere, since they have that fee to play with?

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We really don't see a lot of difference elsewhere. I mean, we generally are – we try to be
fiercely competitive everywhere. First of all, I think it would be too early to tell, nothing is – I haven't looked that
closely, but nobody has also mentioned in the last few budget meetings anything regionally big in terms of margin
change, but I'm not suggesting it's not a little lower, it may very well be, I just don't know off the top of my head.

And your next question comes from the line of Karen Weinswig (sic) [Deb Weinswig] (32:37) from Citigroup.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: It's Deb Weinswig. Hi, Richard. Can you talk about your e-Commerce strategy as you
move outside of Canada, the U.S., the U.K.? How should we think about it on a market-by-market basis? And then just
from a SKU perspective, how should we think about your overlap between online and offline?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, just like we've done with our brick and mortar warehouses, we go into a new
country, we do it slowly and we see how it goes. So, don't expect a lot of – don't expect to see us in five more countries
in the next 12 months. We certainly want to expand it and we'll do so over the next few years in a methodical way. So,
our strategy is the same, do it as we normally do stuff.
In terms of – I think we've expanded some of the product categories to test in apparel items and there's a little overlap
there but it's still small. Historically over the last few years the view was, this was an extension of our product line, not
the same product line that we have in the warehouse. Typically I used to hear numbers in the 80% to 90% range was
not overlapping with the warehouse, and maybe it's a little lower percent today but by no means going dramatically in
that other direction.
We still don't put our stuff online of what's in every warehouse and what the sales prices are in the warehouse and the
brick and mortar. One of the challenges in the fast turning business like ours is, is we could sell the stuff pretty quickly,
and we'd hate for a member to look at something and it says we have units in locations they are going to go shop at of
something and it not be there.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: All right. And then...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: So, at this point, we'll continue to do what we do and we're pleased with what we've seen
so far with the re-platforming and all the little growth pains that you have when you redo stuff and as you might expect
it was more of a hassle for the buyers as they're learning how to use the new system and put stuff on, but we're doing
fine.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Okay. And then what do you attribute your renewal rates tweaking up to?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'd like to think it's we're wonderful.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Of course you are.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's everything we do. The mantra around here is, as you've known for a long time is, is
constantly driving quality up and prices down and never being static and constantly pushing ourselves and improving. I
think Executive Members certainly helps. Gas and food, I'm convinced over the last 4.5 years of a bad economy, has
certainly driven more frequency, that helps, and more food and so anytime we get another reason why you want to
come shop at Costco, it's another reason why you are going to renew every year. And we try not to disappoint. And
then to a lesser extent it's the – on Amex there is auto renewal of course, you can opt out of it. A member – a
cardholder can opt out of it, but certainly that's in my view less of an issue right now because the rate of increase is not
as big as it used to be.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Okay, and then last question. If I go back and look over our model for a long period of
time, it does seem from an SG&A perspective on the operations line that there is a more consistent pattern in terms of

leveraging the operations. Can you just discuss if there is anything that's significantly changed in terms of how you
approach the operations, or any kind of philosophical changes, I guess?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Nothing philosophical. I mean, as – a couple of things I mentioned on prior calls in the last
several fiscal quarters are things like increased penetration in non-U.S. and Canada markets, where certainly non-U.S.
markets are related to healthcare costs, lower – higher – lower wage relative to the price points in those markets. So
you have little lower payrolls, you have little – you certainly have lower healthcare costs. Those types of things help
that increasing penetration.
I think as the economy – I know I have mentioned over the last few years a couple of times on a qualitative basis the
word focus and as wonderful again as we think we are in being efficient, when the economy got bad, everybody looks
to see what can you do better and what you should stop doing that you used to do but you don't need to do. And it's
those little things.
I think in the past year I mentioned the example of overtime hours. We are probably pretty good at managing and
minimizing overtime hours, but once we started getting all the 12 or 15 or so senior VPs of operations around the U.S.
and the world every month at the budget meeting to report on it, guess what? When total hours were going up 3%-plus
year-over-year or 3.5% to 4% or whatever it was, overtime hours were going down 20%-plus. Again, that's a year or
two trend benefit, but those are kinds of things I think that we've gotten better at.
I think getting back to John Heinbockel's question earlier about expense, what do you need in comp sales? One of my
canned answers in the last few years has been – it's hard to know what – who knows what exactly the expense leverage
is. I can only tell you that I believe that whatever it used to be it's a lower number now because we've gotten a little
better in the bad economy.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Okay. Great. Well, thanks so much, and best of luck.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with BMO.
<Q - Karen F. Short>: Hi there. Thanks for taking my question. Just on merchandise margins, it sounded like giving
us what your core merchandise margins did in 2011 and 2012, and then comparing that to what happened in the first
half this year, it sounds like you are trying to signal that we should not expect this first half of the year to be the trend
for the remainder of the year. Did I read that right?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, we try not to signal other than to say – I know last year as each quarter we showed
that the core year-over-year prior – versus compared to the prior respective quarters of the prior year, when they were
down 10 and 15 basis points year-over-year that people would say, well, once you anniversary that for four quarters,
does that mean you're "investing in prices" and getting more, and of course I would say there is no telling what it will
be, we'll continue to do what we do for a living.
Certainly, we are cognizant we want to try to increase earnings and sales, and – but we're going to try to do it by
driving sales and lowering expenses first. But so far so good, there is two quarters behind us this year that have shown
certainly a better relative trend in the four fiscal quarters last year. But again, I can't really tell you what the next
quarter or next year is going to be.
<Q - Karen F. Short>: Okay, thanks. And then one of your competitors had also signaled that they had accelerated
their price initiatives. I guess, are you seeing anything on that front? Are you changing anything in terms of your
pricing in response?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We – I don't want to sound arrogant, but we do what we do every day and we haven't seen
any big changes out there in general. And again, we and our competitors and probably the one you're talking about are

both fiercely competitive. And as I've said in the past direct warehouse club competition, most particularly with Sam's,
is going to be the most competitive that we have and that hasn't changed over the years. We get questions about what
happens when the supermarkets are doing something or other forms of retail food and sundries as an example, that's
less of a direct impact with the exception of a few areas like some of fresh foods areas like fresh meats and everything
and some cuts of beef, but other than that we haven't seen any dramatic deltas.
<Q - Karen F. Short>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just last question. You have been giving us cannibalization
impact on your total comp of about 50 basis points. Is it fair to say that that's kind of steady-state for a while? I mean I
know you gave the cadence and the locations of new store openings in the back half of the year.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, I think, years ago it used to be bigger because we had a smaller base of units even in
the U.S. and we've opened half a dozen units in LA or something like that. And we've always just given it out and then
it got down, so it was maybe a quarter of a percent cannibalization and now it's back up to 50 or 60 in the last year.
And, yeah, it's not going to change dramatically from that. Certainly as we continue to ramp up expansion, it stays in
that range. I don't ever see it going to 1.5% or 2%. I don't know if it gets up from 50 or 60 to 80, but it probably stays
up there as we continue to open, particularly in some of these new international markets where we have very high
volume units that we've got to cannibalize some and get more locations open.
<Q - Karen F. Short>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan from Bernstein.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Good morning. Morning, Richard.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Hi.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: First question on expansion; it looks like you are now targeting 28 units this year. I
think last quarter the budget was 30, although you have always said units can slip. It looks like you lost a Korea and a
U.S. Anything of note there and anything to read into that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No, I think the U.S. one is – one that's just delayed for 6 or 9 months, and I am not sure
about the other one. No, nothing unusual.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Okay. And then just sticking with expansion, there has been a few press reports of
some interest in Europe and France, and maybe you can update us on your thinking of Continental Europe as a
longer-term future opportunity?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think we've spoken generally and there have been articles in the local and national
press in those countries like France and Spain. And I would say over the next couple of years, we hope to be open but
it's a long process in some of these countries as it relates to the zoning and the permitting and the approval and the
appeals of residential and other businesses can appeal. So, there is a lot of things going on but we have people landed in
a few different countries, including those two and those are the most likely, but again once we know more we'll let you
know.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the LIFO, obviously you had a little bit of a
benefit. How are you thinking about that through the year in terms of inflation/deflation? What are the merchants
saying about what is coming down the pipe?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: The only area I'm hearing a little more inflation still is in protein; beef and poultry and
pork. And that relates both to international demand for some of those items as well as the costs associated with the
drought last year and grain prices, corn and wheat and things like that. As it relates to – as freight costs have gone up a
little, it has – I don't think they went all the way down when freight costs peaked a few years ago and then came back
down. So, I am not hearing a lot of inflationary talk out there. On balance, there is not a lot going either way with the

exception of protein, that's really all I have heard from our buyers.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Okay, that's helpful. Final question, just on MFI, fees came in a little above our
estimate; but it looks like we were fairly good at figuring out the dollar value of the membership fee increase. So two
questions there; was there anything else? Or was it just you had 1% growth in new members and high renewal rates that
drove the little bit of upside to MFI? That is the first question. And then just out of curiosity, is there any lumpiness
through the year in terms of when renewals happen?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: On the first question, your thoughts are generally correct. On the second question, there's –
I probably need to go look at it again, but historically since we generally try to get openings done – ideally if we can – I
am thinking of the U.S. holiday and seasonal calendar here, but you can take it to each country and do that as well, but
generally speaking, we'd love to get every location opened; A, as soon as possible, and every location opened the week
before back-to-school and Labor Day, and to enjoy again Labor Day, back-to-school, Halloween, Thanksgiving,
Christmas, seasonal, you name it, New Years and that's why there's typically more done, and then of course if you're
trying to push those views to get open, you'll probably slow down a little bit in January and February.
So, I think if you look back at the calendar, probably there is a little lumpiness of openings, probably not as much as
there used to be, but then because of deferred accounting and such a big piece is the total now, it's not as lumpy as – it
buffers – it tempers some of that lumpiness even more.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Okay, that's helpful. And I said that was my last question but let me slip one more in.
The U.S. comps have been really, really consistent. It looks like your business has been incredibly resilient and
impervious to some of the pressures out there like the payroll tax hike, the delay in tax rebates that other retailers have
pointed out. Have you guys done any work on how that might be impacting your business and any offsets to that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No. We haven't – we kind of joked about that we don't spend a lot of time trying to analyze
other than driving quality and lowering the prices and everything else take care of itself. But yeah, I know back when
the payroll tax holiday occurred and some of those same companies were talking about how it did help them a little bit
and when asked, we basically indicated and looked at it and indicated that we didn't really see much benefit from it.
And so I think the same thing's happening on the tail end the other way. It can't help but it doesn't seem to really be
impacting our numbers.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Great. Thank you very much, Richard.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning. Executive Membership, 15,000 per week, it slowed down here in
the second quarter. Does that have to do with the timing of the opens in Japan? Do you generally over-index to
Executive in those countries versus domestic? And do you sit there and say, hey, we need to step up Executive
Membership to a higher percentage of sales as you think about what traffic could be in the future? Is it something that
you are watching and maybe saying – you know what, if Executive Membership doesn't – grows at a slower rate that
maybe our traffic could fall below that recent very consistent trend?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't think – look everyday people in our Membership marketing department are coming
up with ways to drive both new members and converting members to the Executive Members and then signing them
up, a higher percentage of new members are signing up as Executive Members. I think we have done a good job over
the last few years of doing that.
I remember a few years back, for every 100 members that signed up in the U.S., 20 or 21 were Executive or 10 or 12
were Executive Members. And then a few years later it was in the low to mid 20s. Why, because we started focusing on
a little bit in the warehouse. Not doing a whole lot of fancy stuff but just doing the 80/20 rule that we were pretty good
at, one of the simple things that we can do drive this.

Certainly trying to get people to also do the triple value play, what we jokingly call it, is to also sign up for the Amex
co-branded card. So all those things drive frequency, drive loyalty, drive sales and so we are constantly looking at ways
to do that. I think part of – ultimately it's got to slow down a little bit. We have now had it in the U.S. for 13 or 14
years, in Canada for 7 or 9 years I think, in a few other countries for less time than that. Those other countries though
were a much smaller piece of the total company pie. So I think it's – I would expect it to continue to come down a little
bit and I actually think 15,000 a year is still pretty good – 15,000 a week.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Yeah, absolutely. Can you talk about – you said one-third of your members are Executive
and two-thirds are the sales. Can you talk about the deviation around that? What's some of your – is there a wide
deviation around that among your stores, and maybe where some of your better and best stores are as an indicator of
where potentially that could go?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think it has more to do – less to do, if I think about it, I'll take the United States, I
think it has less to do with the typical geographic areas other than the people – the operators in those areas that push it a
little harder, and we try to learn from them. And one of the benefits I think of our 13 four-week meetings – every four
weeks, so 13 times a year, our 13 fiscal period meetings out here for two days, a day and a half, is each of those 15 or
so Senior VPs of Operations in this example, In the U.S. the eight Senior VPs of Operations gets up and one of the
things they talked about is what's going on in these areas and what are the new things they've done to drive whatever.
And I think some do focus more on it than others, and we try to learn from that.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: And so I guess you have some stores where it's 40% to 50% of your membership base?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Absolutely. Yeah, okay, I see what you're saying. Yeah, I don't have that number in front
of me, but I would assume if you say – if I'm assuming, let's say, something if it's roughly a third or a little over a third
overall, it's probably in the U.S. in the mid to high-30s. Let's just make up a number here, 36%. If it's 36%, I would bet
you across the 430 plus locations, it would range anywhere from the high-20s to the low-50s.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: But I'm shooting from the hip with that answer.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Sure. Very helpful. And just from an accounting perspective, can you talk about how the
calendar shift might impact total sales versus comp in the next two quarters?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't think it's a big deal in the next two quarters. There's no Easter shift; it's in the same
month – it's in the same month and quarter. I don't think there's a whole big deal there. I think – now, of course, in Q4,
last year was a 17-week quarter and I haven't look that far out in terms of when Labor Day falls and all that stuff. I
think Labor Day – well, if Sunday the 1st – we end on Sunday, Sunday the 1st, September 1st is fiscal year end, so I
guess Labor Day is 2nd. So that might affect it a little bit, too, but I haven't thought through that yet.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Okay. And the last question. Online you accept credit card purchases. So how does that
change the profitability of an online versus an in-store transaction? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, one of the cost components of course online or – and in-store as well is what we call
bank charges which is credit, debit and other fees related to vault and cash and currency and check-cashing. And
online, we of course have the ability to – since you can't pay by cash or check online, we also accept other national
forms of credit cards – of course in stores it's exclusively American Express in terms of branded national cards. And it's
higher merchant fee elsewhere. So we have a higher bank charge line, although we have overall a much, much, much
lower SG&A number online because 75%-plus of the goods are shipped factory direct so there's a lot less handling and
it's – as a percent of sales, online is a more profitable business than brick-and-mortar but we do both.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Hi. Good morning. It's encouraging to see the step-up in club openings particularly more
coming in the first half of the year. I wanted, Richard, to get your view on – I know there is an objective to possibly
accelerate the club growth further. I think it had been potentially as high as 6% you'd hope over the long run. But is that
the upper end of the objective of becoming more credible in your view? And maybe you can just talk about that
pipeline of club openings you look at I think with that pool going out, say, three years. Is that group of opportunity
stores going at that type of rate?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Probably 6% is a little high but given that we were at 3% and now we're getting towards
5%, that's a good sign. I think there's certainly a lot more in the pipeline now to give I think us a little more – be a little
more credibility with you in terms of what we talked about at the beginning of the year. There's always going to be a
couple that fall out because we try to be optimistic that everything we've got going on is going to work and get done on
time and maybe push the envelope at the end of any fiscal year to get them still open. But I'm feeling better now that
two years ago I was feeling that let's try to get into the low-20s at least and we did 20 and 16.
Then we talked – we began this fiscal year talking about 30 and I think we have a good chance of actually hitting the
28. And I think that going forward, I think Craig would like to see it in the – have a 3 in front of it but it probably a
very low 3 in front of it. So if I was a betting person, over the next three years, in fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, 27 to 33
or 34, which would give you a 30 estimate but I could be off a few but I think we've got enough in the pipeline to be
able to do that and we'll go from there.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Great. Thanks. And then on a pre-opening you indicated that it was nothing particularly
unusual there but the pre-opening costs first half were up about a third but the number of openings was more than
double first half. Is that because you've got the openings coming late in the year with the nine club openings in the
fourth quarter? Or is the pre-opening costs coming down a little bit for you?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I would be willing to bet it's the former reason, not the latter. A lot of it just has to do with
timing. And keep in mind, pre-opening, let's say, that we're doing a leased not an owned and you get the property four
or five months in advance of opening. And we might have a few hundred thousand dollar charge per period for rent
expense, which is pre-opening prior to the opening day; that alone might be $1 million or a little over $1 million on a
location; now that is the exception, not the rule since we own a lot of the units. And certainly, when we're building a
multi-story unit with parking and two stories of retail on a 2-acre site in Japan or Korea, it takes a lot longer to do, so
you might have even more pre-opening and some of those are leased. So those are the kinds of things that will buck
that number up the other way.
So it's – overall, I mean, again like everything around here, each location has pre-approved by senior – by Jeff and
Craig and the heads of the respective operations, heads in those areas of what pre-opening is going to be and we hit it
and miss it but overall we have a pretty good handle on what it is. The thing we don't have a good handle on sometimes
when there's a delay, again a two or three month-delay because of soils issues or rain or freezing ground, you couldn't
get the foundation laid before the ground froze, that could be $200,000 to $800,000 on a location of pre-opening during
those several months.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: All right, fair enough. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich from ISI Group.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi. Thanks and good morning, Richard. I wanted to follow up on the LIFO gain. Which area
was actually deflating or which categories? And did any of that actually [ph] flow through in terms of (58:03) retail
deflation?

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: On the deflation, I mean, if I look at the big pools, what we call foods and sundries, foods
was down a little, about 0.5%. Sundries was up less than 20 basis points. Apparel is down a little bit. Electronics and
appliances are down a little bit more than that but still less than two percentage points. [indiscernible] (58:37), which is
a mix match – a mixture of things, including gas and sporting goods and office and auto is down a shade. And then
alcohol and tobacco, beer and wine is up a shade. But overall, again, it's down a little over 0.5% from the beginning of
the year.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Got it.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Again, there's certainly the bigger deflationary items are still electronics and sometimes
there's inflationary items like, I'm just looking at the top 20 deflationary components. There's – aside from gas and a
small amount from gas and the biggest chunk is electronics, pecans. Pecans, they're down 20%. Well, that's because
they were probably double last year or whatever it was. So sometimes you have these giant commodity price increases
a year ago, particularly in the nuts category or some of the grains and then it comes down the other way.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Got it. And on the $600,000 increase in inventory per warehouse, could you help us sort of
break that down and figure out where it's going into that investment?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think right at $200,000 of it was electronics and another $75,000 plus of it was small
electric. And then I think there was – we definitely expanded apparel. I gave the example of the wool pants. We've got
a much better I think commitment to apparel. And then there's a lot of little stuff everywhere else. But the single
biggest component is consumer electronics. And you go into the warehouse, you see a lot of 60- and 80-inch TVs now
and tablets.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Just to maybe understand a little bit better as you grow the online business, how should we
think about the inventory per warehouse, vis-à-vis, the online growth? Is it the same SKU assortment? Is it an extended
assortment?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, right now, it's an expanded assortment, it's not the same. I mean, certainly you're
going to see some overlap on electronics or a few apparel items or some. But you're going to see more SKU selection
online and perhaps [indiscernible] (60:53) and so whatever changes you're going to see there are going to be very slow
in terms of percentages because the brick-and-mortar is so big.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Right. Great. And then lastly, you mentioned on the accruals, and we know that just $2 million
or $2.5 million is one basis point. But the ones that you cited in this quarter, was that sort of a one-off catch-up
accruals? Or do you think now there's a different sort of accrual run rate for those things you cited?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No, no, there was – I think as it relates to – I don't have the exact basis points in front of
me, but like on worker's comp, I think there was a couple basis points there. That's just looking at – that's probably my
guess is there's a little catch-up in that number. But again, it's more when, again, I get back to the income tax. We
benefited by several million dollars – I'm not talking about the big $62 million number but there are some discrete
items. Usually when you've got discrete anything there's two or three pluses and two or three minuses and it balances
out to be very little, a basis point or two. My guess is, is there are three or four here. So it's not a whole lot – I wouldn't
read a lot into that.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay, great. And lastly, on the club openings, as we do more outside of North America, how
should we think about CapEx in terms of how many of those might actually be leased? I mean, I know you're well over
– you're 90% plus here, but as we go international, are most of those units in Asia and elsewhere going to be leased?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Probably a little more of them are leased or at least ground leased, and with long-term
ground leases. We still try to buy where we can and I think we're getting a little more aggressive on that but it's hard to
predict. I think overall we're in the low-80s in terms of how many we own. But I think – I know even in the U.S., when
interest rates plummeted four years ago, all of a sudden you'd have a – a lot of times when you have an individual
landowner, they don't want the cash and so we've done a few more leases in the U.S. as well in the last several years,
but certainly there's probably a higher proportion of those done in areas like Asia. I think we own more in Japan than

we do in – like Korea, I think we lease more. Every country is a little different but if I had – and I took the three Asian
countries overall, there's more leases there of course than in the U.S.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: So maybe asked a different way, if there's 27 or 28 openings, is it fair to say maybe this year
given where they are, that half are leased and half are owned or would that be too extreme?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No, we'll still own more.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Still own more? Okay, great.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Thanks a lot.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder from Jefferies.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Hey. Good morning. It's Dan Binder. A couple questions. First, on IT modernization costs, I
didn't hear you call it out this quarter. I know it's been adding some pressure. Are we now kind of through the worst of
that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No, I think on an ongoing basis looking over the next few quarters and this is a guess,
somewhere in the 3 to 4 basis point year-over-year, I think it was higher in Q1, it was closer to flat in Q2, but some of
that is just again timing of things. You also capitalize some of those costs. And again, overall, it's going to – my guess
over a two or three year period, it's going to add sometimes three, sometimes five.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Right. Okay. Yeah, I remember last year you guys were very focused on some of the
operational opportunities to improve your cost structure. You called out some of that today. Overtime reduction was
one of them, which you mentioned earlier. I'm just curious as you look at the organization today, are there any big
buckets where you can still pull costs out?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't think there have been any big buckets. Even by the way, like the – as I did mention,
the overtime, 20%-plus reduction in overtime hours. That was several million dollars a year maybe a basis point or two
over a couple of years but nothing so dramatic that's going to change. Nothing like everybody thought that RFID would
free up the front end and reduce our biggest labor cost area. That didn't happen. But we have done a better job at front
end labor; kicking and tackling little things and there is still the focus out there but I can't think of – other than driving
sales, and I mean, again, I am shooting from – little things here but we've streamlined and tested and now rolling out
how we return merchandise and in some cases, not doing it at the warehouse but bringing it into some of the depots.
And if that can continue to work, do we save a few million here or $5 million there? Yes, but there's no giant thing out
there.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: I'm sorry if I missed it but did you comment on the dotcom sales growth and the contribution
to comps this quarter?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No. I think it was in the low teens in terms of sales growth.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Okay. What does that look like in terms of the contribution to comp?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't know. I mean, we're going to do in the high-2s for the year on a 100 – and whatever
your budget is for total sales for the company, so it's 2.5% of sales and up in the low teens.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Okay, great. And then on consumer electronics sales, I know you called out the calendar
issue that affected the quarterly number but generally your monthly sales updates have been pretty – showing some
pretty good strength in that category. I was just wondering if you could speak to some of the bigger trends that you're

seeing take place in the club there?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think in electronics the biggest take-away is our TV sales in general. Even though
they were and again – I mean that's the biggest – TV sales are the biggest piece of electronics. While that was down
slightly in February, over the last several months it's been up in the mid to very high-single-digits and a lot of that I've
been told in the budget meetings is as it relates to the fact that we've done very well with 60- to 80-inch TVs. We've
done relatively well. We've now cycled by not selling, as you know, we stop selling some of the Apple products, the
ones that we were allowed to sell, well over a year or maybe two years ago. So, on that low base we are selling, starting
to sell some of the other tablets and the like. The cell phone business is pretty good, but again, it's all dwarfed by TVs.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Great. Okay, thanks.

And your next question comes from the line of Sandra Barker with Montag & Caldwell.
<Q - Sandra M. Barker>: Richard, I just had a clarification on the website. What impact have you seen from making
it searchable and adding the mobile apps? I mean, has it been anything notable now that you're sort of more visible?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think sales are up a little better than they had been but the first thing is I know for
the months leading up to it, everybody is warning us – from our own dotcom people to the IT people that the day you
flip the switch is not the day you start to see immediate benefit because it takes time to build the clicks and all that
stuff. But again, kind of like the other things we do, we're methodical and slow about it and it's showing some
improvement. But off the top of my head, I can't give you any specifics.
<Q - Sandra M. Barker>: Great. And I can't remember, is Jim still in the building a little longer? Or what's he focused
on?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Jim is on vacation this week but yes he's still there a lot. He's general – somebody asked
me the other day, I mean, you go to Craig to ask questions and get permission to do stuff. And Jim's still traveling and
he's still on the Board, of course, and I see him quite a bit. But to his credit and I think to the company's success, it's
been a very good three – really three – a little over a three-year transition with he and Craig. And he's still traveling a
lot to openings and with the merchants and with Craig and spends a lot of time with Craig and Jeff still. But he's doing
a good job of staying away a little more. If you asked me six months ago, I would have said he's in the office 80% of
the time, now it's still well above 50% but we'll see. He's still doing well.

And your final question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Barclays.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Hi, Richard.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Hi.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: I just have two questions for you. The first one is can you talk a little bit on the numbers around I
think you said new member signups, the metrics in the international markets versus the U.S. and Canadian markets, the
number is higher abroad. Can you give us – can you tell us how much higher it is? And the second question is you
talked about the buyback a little bit but on the buyback going forward, is there any reason why you wouldn't be active
at these levels where the stock is?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think the last question first. No, I mean, we look at it and we'll keep looking at it. I
think generally speaking, as I mentioned in the past, we issue our issues that add 3.5 million – 3 million to 3.5 million

shares a year. It would be nice to cover that, but we don't feel pressure on a given day or week to do something.
Generally speaking, we still feel good about the company long-term. And again, I think at this point, we'll wait for 12
weeks and see what we're doing. On the other question, what was it?
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: How much higher are sort of the new member signups in international markets versus the U.S.
and Canadian?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'll give you some general numbers. I mean, we've had numbers – keep in mind, when we
talk about opening day signups, it's for the generally eight to 12 weeks leading up to the opening day where the parking
lot's partly done and you get in and out of the parking lot and people come up and come in and signup in advance of
opening. There's the little flags outside and the whole bit with the table activities. And in the U.S., where we've opened
a new unit, even in a very strong existing market you might have a few thousand signups because you've already got a
lot of people in that market and it's not like this giant thing for a new market.
We opened – I know I was at an opening back in the Carolinas three or four months – four or five months ago, and it's a
relatively medium-sized town less than a million people and a brand new market and through opening day, so opening
day signups for those several weeks and they're all booked, if you will, starting on opening day was in the 6,000 or
7,000, which was better than we ever thought. We have some openings that we've done over in Asia and Australia,
whereas through opening day we've had anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 members signed up.
Now mind you, you're going to have a much lower renewal rate on those a year later, but we have units – I think our
membership numbers, and we've been in Japan for a while now, but we also have some new units there, the number of
members per unit over there is a little over double what the company is running. So it's a little different metric in some
of those markets quite a bit. So when you open four or five in those, that's going to jump your membership increase, the
number of members, recognizing we don't use deferred accounting if we're counting members, but for their dollars we
do.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Great. Thanks very much.
