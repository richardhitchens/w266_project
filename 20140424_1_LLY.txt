MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Eli Lilly first quarter 2014 earnings call.
[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
I'll turn the conference now over to your host, Mr. John Lechleiter, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.
John C. Lechleiter
Good morning, everyone, thank you for joining us for the second time this week, today to discuss Eli Lilly and
Company's first quarter 2014 earnings. I'm John Lechleiter, Chairman, President and CEO.
This quarter and going forward, we're taking a slightly different approach to our quarterly calls. We're bringing more of
our senior leaders into the room to participate and to answer your questions, and we hope that this enhances the quality
of the information we are able to provide you during these sessions. So joining me today on the call are: Derica Rice,

our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Sue Mahony, President of
Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Jeff
Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Phil Johnson and Ilissa Rassner of the Lilly Investor Relations team.
During this conference call, as usual, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our
current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on
slide three and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about
our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not
sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Before covering our first quarter 2014 results, I'd like to share some high-level observations. Lilly continues to make
good progress in executing the strategy we laid out nearly five years ago to navigate through this period of
unprecedented loss of revenue and income precipitated by patent expirations for several of our largest products. We
have continued to invest in R&D and have successfully replenished our late-stage pipeline. The first fruits of these
efforts are manifested in the approval of Monday evening of CYRAMZA by the U.S. FDA. We have three other
molecules currently under regulatory review, with more to follow soon. And we have the very real prospect of
launching two additional NMEs, empagliflozin and dulaglutide, in major markets later this year.
We have focused our business in core therapeutic areas, including diabetes, oncology, neuroscience, and animal health.
In oncology, our 2008 acquisition of ImClone is paying off, while in diabetes, our global partnership with Boehringer
Ingelheim will enable us to launch two potential best-in-class oral agents in a three-year period. And you know about
Elanco Animal Health, soon to be the second-largest enterprise of its kind following our acquisitions of Lohmann
Animal Health and Novartis Animal Health.
Finally, we've worked tirelessly and largely behind the scenes to reshape every aspect of our company to reduce costs,
improve quality and productivity, and to regain the customer focus that has been at the heart of Lilly's historic record of
success. Today, we're a more capable, more agile, and more focused competitor than ever before. While we will never
declare victory, we are encouraged by our progress through this most difficult period, and with every positive data
readout and every regulatory filing, more and more confident that this company is on a clear trajectory for success. All
of this further buoys our confidence that 2014 is indeed an inflection point for Lilly leading to a bright future.
Now with that framing, let me get into the meat of today's call by highlighting key events that have occurred since last
quarter's call, and it's certainly been an event filled last three months that we believe shows great promise in the
execution of our strategy.
On the regulatory front, the first quarter was another eventful period. In oncology, the FDA approved ramucirumab as a
single-agent treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer with disease progression after prior
chemotherapy. With this approval, ramucirumab becomes the first FDA-approved treatment for patients in this setting.
This is an important milestone for patients with this difficult to treat disease. It is the third leading cause of cancer death
worldwide. In coming weeks, we'll make the product commercially available under the trade name CYRAMZA.
In diabetes, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for empagliflozin. The letter cited the need to resolve
previously observed deficiencies at the Boehringer Ingelheim facility where empagliflozin will be manufactured. The
FDA did not ask for any new clinical trials to support the approval of the application. The FDA has completed its
inspection of this facility and Boehringer Ingelheim has provided its responses to the FDA's observations. At this time,
we cannot comment on exactly when we will resubmit the empagliflozin NDA. However, we continue to expect FDA
action in 2014.
In late March, Europe's CHMP issued a positive opinion recommending approval of empagliflozin as an adjunct to diet
and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. Assuming the European Commission follows
the CHMP recommendation and approves empagliflozin, we anticipate launch of the product in European countries
beginning in the third quarter. Meanwhile, earlier this month, Australia became the first market to approve
empagliflozin under the trade name JARDIANCE.

We also announced that the NDA for the fixed-dose combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin has been accepted for
review by the FDA. We're optimistic that this first-in-class fixed-dose combination of a DPP-4 inhibitor with an
SGLT-2 inhibitor could provide a valuable additional treatment option for patients with Type 2 diabetes.
Finally, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for the NDA for HUMALOG 200 KwikPen, a concentrated
version of HUMALOG. We expect to resubmit the NDA before the end of the year.
In clinical news, we announced that the Phase 3 REVEL trial studying ramucirumab in second-line non-small-cell lung
cancer met its primary endpoint, as patients treated with ramucirumab plus docetaxel experienced an improvement in
overall survival compared to patients treated with placebo plus docetaxel. We intend to submit the first application of
these data to regulatory authorities in 2014, and we'll present the detailed data at ASCO [American Society of Clinical
Oncology] later this year. This marks the third positive Phase 3 trial with ramucirumab. We're pleased with this
continued progress, which confirms the promise we saw in this molecule when we acquired ImClone.
At the AACR [American Association for Cancer Research] meeting earlier this month, we presented data from the
Phase 1 trial of our CDK 4/6 inhibitor, bemaciclib. These data were from a cohort expansion in patients with advanced
breast cancer and supported our decision to begin our Phase 3 program in breast cancer. You may have seen that the
first Phase 3 trial has been posted on ClinicalTrials.gov and will begin this summer. We're pleased with the
single-agent activity seen in this patient cohort as well as the product safety profile and believe we could have a
best-in-class molecule.
Moving to diabetes, we announced that the AWARD-6 trial comparing once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5-milligrams to
once-daily liraglutide 1.8-milligrams met its endpoint of non-inferiority in the reduction of HbA1c from baseline at 26
weeks. Dulaglutide is the only GLP-1 agonist to show non-inferiority against liraglutide's highest approved dose in a
Phase 3 study. We look forward to presenting the detailed data at ADA [American Diabetes Association] later this year.
In business development news, earlier this week, as I mentioned earlier, we announced an agreement to acquire
Novartis Animal Health for approximately $5.4 billion. We're excited to combine two premier and complementary
animal health companies, which will create a new top-tier global animal health player, one that will continue to lead in
innovation and customer value. We expect the acquisition to close by the end of the first quarter of next year.
As you will recall, we also announced in February an agreement to acquire Lohmann Animal Health, a privately held
German company that is a global leader in poultry vaccines. This acquisition, expected to close this quarter, will
establish Elanco as a global poultry leader and solidify Elanco's vaccine presence and manufacturing capabilities.
In other news, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ruled in Lilly's favor, upholding the U.S.
vitamin dosage regimen patent for ALIMTA, which expires in May 2022. A German court also ruled in Lilly's favor,
confirming that ALIMTA's European vitamin dosage regimen patent would be infringed by the contemplated entry of
Actavis's generic pemetrexed dipotassium product in Germany prior to June 2021. We are pleased with these rulings
and are confident that these patents are valid and enforceable.
Also in the news, Sanofi filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that our new
insulin glargine product for which we are seeking FDA approval infringes certain of their patents. We do not believe
that the application for approval of our new insulin glargine product infringes any valid claim of the asserted patents.
On March 2, U.S. patent protection for EVISTA expired. After a short delay, generic raloxifene is now on the market.
And we've entered into an agreement with Prasco to sell an authorized generic raloxifene.
In an ACTOS product liability case in Louisiana, a jury found in favor of the plaintiffs, awarding compensatory
damages and significant punitive damages. Lilly disagrees with the verdict and intends to vigorously challenge this
outcome. The agreement between Lilly and Takeda calls for Takeda to defend and indemnify Lilly for losses and
expenses with respect to the U.S. litigation. After the verdict was entered in this case, Takeda notified Lilly that it was
reserving his right to challenge its obligation to defend and indemnify Lilly with respect to the Allen case only. Lilly
believes it is entitled to full defense and indemnification of its losses and expenses related to Allen and in all other U.S.
cases.

Finally, during the first quarter we executed share repurchases totaling $55 million under our $5 billion share
repurchase program. We now have $4.4 billion remaining in the program, which we expect to complete over a
multiyear period.
And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter.
Philip L. Johnson
Great, thanks, John. First I'll review our GAAP results and then discuss a few non-GAAP measures to provide some
additional insight into the underlying trends in our business.
On slide seven, you can see that revenue in Q1 2014 was $4.7 billion, 16% below Q1 2013. This decline reflects a full
quarter effect of the CYMBALTA U.S. patent expiration as well as the initial effect of the EVISTA U.S. patent
expiration. Excluding CYMBALTA and EVISTA in the U.S., the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 1%. It is also
worth noting that wholesaler purchasing patterns substantially dampened U.S. revenue growth in the first quarter.
Excluding this effect, the rest of our worldwide revenue would have grown 4%.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 5.4 percentage points, driven largely by the loss of CYMBALTA's
U.S. exclusivity and to a lesser extent by the loss of EVISTA's U.S. exclusivity as well as by the impact of foreign
exchange rates on international inventories sold. This quarter, foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold
had a negative effect on gross margin. However, in Q1 2013, foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold
provided a benefit to our gross margin. Excluding this FX effect from both 2013 and 2014, gross margin as a percent of
revenue declined from 79.1% in Q1 2013 to 75.8% in Q1 2014. As in past quarters, we've included a supplementary
side providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect.
Non-GAAP measures are shown on slide eight. Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A,
decreased more than $400 million or 14% versus Q1 of 2013. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses were
down 10% while R&D was down 18%. The reduction in marketing, selling, and administrative expenses was due to
our ongoing cost-containment efforts and the reduction in the U.S. sales and marketing activities for CYMBALTA and
EVISTA. The decline in R&D expenses was driven by milestone payments and an asset termination charge in Q1 2013
that did not recur this quarter as well as by lower clinical development costs.
Other income and expense was net income of $56 million in Q1 2014 compared with net income of $34 million in the
first quarter of 2013. This difference was driven both by lower net interest expense and by higher other miscellaneous
income.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 18.7%, an increase of 3.2 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. There
are a number of pushes and pulls driving this change. Recall that our non-GAAP tax rate in Q1 last year was
substantially reduced by the recognition of the full-year 2012 R&D tax credit. In addition, our tax rate in Q1 this year is
higher, as no legislative action was taken in the quarter on the R&D tax credit up for extension. Finally, in Q1 this year,
we recorded a discrete tax benefit of approximately $30 million, which lowered our non-GAAP tax rate by 3.3
percentage points.
At the bottom line, net income declined 40% and earnings per share declined 39%. While this is a significant decline, it
is consistent with our expectations and places us on track to achieve our full-year guidance.
Slide nine provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and this reconciliation reflects the charge of
$31 million pre-tax, equivalent to $0.02 of EPS, that was incurred in Q1 2014 as a result of restructuring to reduce the
company's costs. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.
Many of you have noted that nearly all our peers exclude amortization of intangibles from their non-GAAP results,
while we include this expense. For your modeling purposes and as you'll see in our 10-Q, we recognized amortization
expense of $132 million, representing nearly 3% of revenue this quarter.

Moving to slide 10, you can see that the total revenue decline of 16% in Q1 2014, shown in the yellow box in the
middle of the page, was driven by a negative volume impact of 8%, a negative price impact of 6%, and a negative
foreign exchange impact of 2%.
By geography, you'll notice that U.S. volume decreased 26%. This was largely due to the loss of exclusivity for
CYMBALTA. U.S. volume did benefit this quarter from shipments of our authorized generic EVISTA. Excluding
CYMBALTA and EVISTA, volume on the rest of our U.S. pharma products was down 6% this quarter. Excluding the
effect of wholesaler buying patterns I mentioned earlier, volume on these products increased 2% in Q1.
Revenue in Australia, Canada, and Europe, or ACE, was essentially flat; while in Japan, volume growth was
particularly strong, up 37%, driven primarily by ZYPREXA, FORTEO, CYMBALTA, STRATTERA, TRADJENTA,
and ALIMTA. An increase in the consumption tax that went into effect on April 1 contributed to higher customer
purchases. Our best estimate is that this added roughly $70 million, or 15 percentage points of growth, to our Q1
revenue in Japan. You can also see that the weaker yen trimmed revenue growth by 17%. At current foreign exchange
rates, this negative FX effect is expected to be much lower for the remainder of the year.
In emerging markets, we saw strong performance growth of 15%, partially offset by a 6% negative impact from foreign
exchange. Volume growth was a robust 13%, driven by CIALIS, HUMULIN, HUMALOG, VANCOCINA,
TRADJENTA, and CYMBALTA. Volume growth in Brazil benefited from a HUMULIN tender, while volume in
China grew 15%.
Elanco Animal Health delivered revenue growth of 6%. And excluding FX, Elanco grew 7%. This performance growth
was driven by higher prices for both companion and food animal products as well as by volume growth for food animal
products. This was partially offset by a volume decline for companion animal products.
Now, let me turn the call over to Derica.
Derica W. Rice
Thanks, Phil.
Slide 11 shows the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2014 results. At a high level, FX had a modest
negative effect on our underlying foreign currency dominated revenue and cost. However, this quarter the effect of FX
on our cost of goods sold also had a negative effect on our results. In the first rows of numbers, you'll see that FX
negatively affected worldwide revenue growth by two percentage points, as Phil mentioned earlier.
In the second row, you can see that FX caused cost of sales to increase by seven percentage points. Driven by the
strengthening of the euro, in Q1 this year the effect of FX on international inventories sold led to a substantial
additional cost being booked to cost of goods sold, while last year it led to a modest reduction in cost of goods sold. As
a result, excluding FX, cost of goods sold actually decreased 1%. So as you can see on the last two rows why our
operating income and earnings per share declined substantially due to the patent expiration of CYMBALTA in the
U.S., foreign exchange further reduced operating income and EPS growth by double digits.
Slide 12 shows our pipeline as of April 21. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrows
showing progression and red arrows showing attrition. Now as John mentioned earlier, we received approval of
ramucirumab for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer as a single agent after prior chemotherapy. In addition, we
began Phase 2 testing of a biologic for anemia, and we began Phase 1 testing of a small molecule for cardiovascular
disease. And we terminated the development of four assets, two in Phase 2 and two in Phase 1.
As John also indicated, with a number of encouraging data readouts in 2013, eight assets in Phase 3, three assets under
regulatory review, and one just recently approved, and more Phase 3 data readouts, regulatory submissions, and product
approvals possible this year, we are confident in our ability to return to growth post-2014.
Next, let me remind you of our key events for 2014 and review our updated 2014 financial guidance. In the first 3.5
months of this year, we were pleased with the progress we've made on key events that we highlighted on our 2014

guidance call. While I will not go through each item on slide 13, we're excited about the opportunities to continue to
advance our pipeline and to share data that will not only help investors better judge our growth potential but also
convey why we view this year as a new beginning in the next phase of Lilly's rich history.
We expect to begin Phase 3 studies for two assets, bemaciclib, our CDK 4/6 inhibitor for cancer, and our anti-sclerostin
antibody for osteoporosis. As John mentioned, the first Phase 3 trial of bemaciclib was recently posted to
ClinicalTrials.gov, and will begin this summer.
With respect to Phase 3 data, we expect to report top line results this year, with detailed data presentation next year for
four NMEs and one additional indication for ramucirumab. In January we disclosed detailed data of the RAINBOW
trial for ramucirumab as combination therapy in second-line gastric cancer. And we anticipate detailed data disclosures
yet this year for dulaglutide, our new insulin glargine product, necitumumab, and ramucirumab in non-small-cell lung
cancer and possibly in liver cancer. We've also submitted the fixed-dose combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin
for regulatory review in the U.S., and could have multiple additional regulatory submissions this year across our
diabetes and oncology portfolios.
Importantly, we've seen positive regulatory action on CYRAMZA as monotherapy for second-line gastric cancer. And
we expect to receive European approval for empagliflozin later this quarter following the CHMP's positive
recommendation for approval in late March. Still this year, we could have regulatory action on empagliflozin here in
the U.S., on dulaglutide, and on our new insulin glargine product, although launch timing will be gated by expiration of
LANTUS's patent protection and in the case of the U.S. by ongoing litigation.
In other key events for 2014, we are pleased with the ALIMTA patent relief granted in our favor in both the U.S. and
Germany, and we could receive a ruling this quarter from the recently concluded trials in the UK. And we lost patent
protection for EVISTA in the U.S. in March, and data package exclusivity for CYMBALTA will expire in Europe in
the second half of this year, although we do not expect generic duloxetine to enter the European market until 2015.
Clearly, we have a lot going on in 2014, and we're off to a great start.
Now turning to our 2014 guidance, financial guidance, when we announced the acquisition of Lohmann Animal
Health, we lowered our 2014 EPS guidance range to reflect dilution from the deal due to business combination
accounting and transaction costs. That non-GAAP EPS range remains unchanged, and our updates are to specific line
items primarily to reflect the impact of the Lohmann acquisition as well as movements in FX and the Q1 discrete tax
benefit. On FX, the main change is in the strengthening of the euro, although a number of other smaller currencies have
weakened. In aggregate, these changes modestly benefit revenue, but due to the euro more substantially add to the cost
of goods sold.
Our revenue guidance is now a range of $19.4 billion to $20 billion. This increase of $200 million reflects estimated
revenue from the Lohmann acquisition as well as the benefit of FX.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue is now anticipated to be approximately 73%, down one percentage point from our
prior guidance. Again, this reflects the Lohmann acquisition, including the anticipated inventory step-up and the
negative effect of the stronger euro.
We've raised our SG&A guidance by $100 million to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion, again, to reflect the
Lohmann acquisition. Our R&D guidance remains unchanged at $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion. And other income is still
expected to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million.
To reflect the discrete tax benefit booked in Q1, we've lowered our full-year tax rate by one percentage point to
approximately 19%, which still assumes extension of the R&D tax credit in 2014.
In terms of net income, to reflect the dilution from the Lohmann acquisition, we now expect net income to be at least
$2.9 billion.
At the bottom line, EPS on a reported basis reflects the Q1 charge of $0.02. Our EPS guidance is now $2.70 to $2.78 on
a GAAP basis and remains $2.72 to $2.80 on a non-GAAP basis.

Finally, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be at least $4 billion and capital expenditures to be approximately
$1.3 billion.
Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2013 and the associated growth rates from
these numbers to our 2014 guidance.
Now I'll turn the call back over to John.
John C. Lechleiter
Thanks, Derica. Before we take your questions, let me briefly sum up.
We've described this moment as a pivotal point for Lilly, and it's literally that. Even as we feel the maximum impact of
our patent expirations, FDA approval of CYRAMZA along with the CHMP's positive opinion on empagliflozin are
significant milestones as we move beyond this period to a path of renewed growth. Our recent announcements to
acquire Lohmann Animal Health and Novartis Animal Health position us for continued growth in the attractive Animal
Health business.
For the past five years, we've been candid with you about our challenges and our plans for overcoming them, and we've
delivered what we said we would. We said our first priority was to continue to advance our pipeline. And over the
course of 2014, we will continue to generate and disseminate data on a number of Phase 3 molecules. We expect to
make a number of regulatory submissions of potential new medicines. And we expect to launch multiple products,
starting later this quarter with CYRAMZA.
We said we would offset some of our revenue loss by driving revenue growth across a broad range of products,
geographies, and businesses. Three of our so-called growth engines performed very well again this quarter. Japan grew
16%, China grew 21%, and Elanco Animal Health grew 6% despite the negative impact on companion animal health of
a colder than normal winter. We said we would increase productivity and reduce operating expenses significantly, and
operating expenses in the quarter were down 14% versus the first quarter of last year.
Overall, our first quarter financial results put us on track to meet our 2014 guidance. Our solid financial performance
will enable us to continue to invest in our pipeline, including our new product launches, to pay the dividend at least at
its current level, to recapitalize our physical asset base, to reinvest in our business through opportunistic business
development, and to return excess cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program. We remain confident in
our strategy and in our ability to execute it.
And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for the Q&A session. Thank you.
Philip L. Johnson
Great. Thank you, John. If I could ask John, the operator, who is helping us with the call today, to provide the
instructions for the callers for the Q&A session, and then we'll get started with the first caller.

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first we'll go to the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great, thanks very much for the questions, and I appreciate you guys bringing the whole
management team on the call here. My first question was for John. We've seen a trend of increased focus and
specialization occurring across the Pharma group here. I guess more recently we've seen companies actually taking
actions to look at strategic alternatives for non-core or subscale businesses. Obviously, you've been able to acquire

some assets from these decisions. But more broadly, can you just elaborate your thoughts on these trends, and would
Lilly look to further narrow its focus and potentially divest assets?
My second question was on the CDK 4/6 program. I guess if you could, elaborate a little bit more on the Phase 3
program here. I guess first would be, would be looking at adjuvant in addition to the advanced breast cancer market?
Second, can you just elaborate? What's the earliest you can get this product to market? I'm trying to understand how
quickly you can roll a study, if there are interims. Just real quickly when could we think about this program being in a
position that you could file? Thanks very much.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Chris, thank you very much for the questions. We'll have John take the first one, obviously.
And then, Sue, if you want to comment on the second piece, I can help if necessary. John?
<A - John C. Lechleiter>: Chris, thanks for your question. I think judging from events of the last week, if they
combined to make a trend, I think as I think I said in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week, you're seeing companies
build on their strengths, add to existing areas of strength, and get rid of assets where they believe they might be a
subscale. Animal Health realistically is one of the few opportunities we have to diversify in a meaningful way in a
business that we believe still has very strong synergies back to our Pharma business. When we look at research, we
share a common footprint for research. We share a good number of manufacturing capabilities and assets and a global
infrastructure that I think enables Elanco to be successful and will continue to enable Elanco to be successful.
I can't comment specifically about whether we would look to shed other assets. I think from – we're pretty – we don't
have that many extra assets or businesses, an OTC business for example or a vaccines business or what have you. But I
think it's pretty clear that we're going to continue to focus a lot on diabetes and oncology and Animal Health. I think
our Bio-Medicines portfolio gives us some options. We're going to know by the end of the year will we be able to
establish an autoimmune portfolio with three Phase 3 data readouts. We have a big bet still when you look at
Alzheimer's with sola [solanezumab] and the EXPEDITION-3 trial ongoing now and enrolling. And then as we said
last call, we've completed enrollment on evacetrapib, which I think could be a very significant product in the
cardiovascular space. So yes, I think we're guided more by where can we build on a solid footprint in an area where we
have greater opportunity with the assets we have? And the idea of divesting assets would only follow from that
go-forward thinking, if that makes sense.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Thank you, John; and, Sue, on the CDK 4/6 inhibitor?
<A - Susan Mahony>: Let me try and address the question of CDK 4/6 inhibitor, bemaciclib. We presented the breast
cancer cohort data at AACR this year, and we've announced that we will be starting Phase 3 studies this year. In fact if
you look at ClinicalTrials.gov, we have on that the Phase 3 study with fulvestrant in metastatic breast cancer. In
addition to that, we have a Phase 2 single-agent study. We are excited by our single-agent activity that we saw in our
breast cancer cohort, so we are initiating a confirmatory Phase 2 study there.
With regards to other lifecycle planning and timing of approvals, obviously I can't speculate on those at this point in
time, other than to say that we're going to continue to progress this molecule as we do the safety, yes, we are excited by
the single-agent activity and dosing and safety profile that we've seen so far. We also will be presenting our lung cohort
at ASCO this year and look forward to sharing more data on that.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Thank you, Sue. John, if we could have the next caller, please?
Operator
And that's Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you, if I could just maybe finish out with a question on the CDK and that lung
data coming up. Could you just directionally just give us an idea of your level of excitement with that drug in the lung
indication, and assuming that the data shows some degree of positivity, just the development plan forward?

And then my other question is on your Animal Health business from Novartis. Can you give us an idea of what you
think the dilution would be to 2015 earnings on an adjusted non-GAAP basis? And you're talking about remedying the
manufacturing problems that Pet division has had. The operating margin that Novartis disclosed I think is basically
breakeven, so it's not profitable. It would seem to me that the minute you transport those products into some other
manufacturing facility, you'd have an immediate margin bump-up. Am I thinking about that correctly, and what would
be the timeframe for that?
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great, Tim. Thank you for your questions. We'll have Sue answer the CDK 4/6; Derica, if
you'd go ahead and take the question on the impact to 2015 non-GAAP earnings. And then, Jeff, if you'd like to talk
about some goals we have for getting profits back up over time, that would be great. Sue?
<A - Susan Mahony>: So with the bemaciclib data, we presented last year at ASCO this Phase 1 study and we've done
a number of cohort expansions since then. As I said, we presented the breast cancer expansion data at AACR. We'll be
presenting the lung cancer expansion data at ASCO. Until we present that, clearly I can't comment on that data. Again,
just to say that we are continuing to look at opportunities to progress this molecule, and we'll be updating you as we get
new data.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Thank you, Sue. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Sure. Tim, this is Derica. I can't comment or I'm not able to comment as to what the dilutive
effect would be in 2015 at this stage. Obviously, it's going to be predicated on when we actually close the transaction,
and right now we're still projecting to close by no later than the end of Q1. What we have said is that if we assume a
January 1, 2015 close, we would expect that this deal would be accretive on a cash basis by 2016 and should begin to
return to historical levels or margins that you've seen on Lilly's Animal Health business no later than 2018, or three
years post-closing.
<A - Jeffrey N. Simmons>: Tim, so I'll follow up on that. First of all, I want to emphasize that the manufacturing
problems were, as you know, in Lincoln, Nebraska. They were human health-related. This is a big part of our diligence.
The transfers have already started to take place on the Animal Health side. We are very confident as we look at the
second half of 2013 and Novartis Animal Health the trajectory that they're on.
They came into these problems in a top-tier growth, 6% to 8% as an Animal Health business. And we believe when we
combine what we've seen in their history and the trajectory in the late part of last year and the transfers that are in place
that we can get to exactly where Derica mentioned. Two to three years out, we can get back to that mid-20s% EBIT
percentage. And we've definitely spent a lot of time on the diligence looking at this transfer and transition in this
business, so this was a big part of our assessment of their value. I'm limited on more details than that at this stage.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Thank you. John, if we could have the next caller, please?
Operator
And we'll go to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: [inaudible] (38:42)
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Hey, Mark, we can't hear you.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: I'm sorry, guys. Sorry about that. Can you hear me now?
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Yes, we can.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Okay. So I'd just like to come back to the CDK 4/6 if possible, a couple questions.
Congratulations on the data; it looked really good. I'm just wondering in the Phase 3 program you're using IV
fulvestrant. I'm just wondering why the choice to combine with that drug as opposed to letrozole, which was obviously
Pfizer's choice. And then also I'm wondering on the differentiated neutropenia profile that you've seen for your drug, if

you have any explanations for that. Pfizer has made some comments in the public domain that your compound may
bind at different targets than theirs et cetera. I'm just wondering if you might be willing offer a mechanistic rationale.
And then finally on use of capital, given the Animal Health acquisition recently, earlier this week, should we as
investors and analysts view you, at least over the next year or so, as reasonably balance sheet constrained such that we
shouldn't have expectations that you could do a deal of similar size on the human health side? Thank you.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Mark, thanks for your questions. We'll go and have Sue to take that CDK 4/6
questions, obviously, and then Derica on the business development going forward. Sue?
<A - Susan Mahony>: Sure. The Phase 3 study that we have currently on ClinicalTrials.gov, as you said, is bemaciclib
in combination with fulvestrant in metastatic breast cancer. That includes both first and second-line patients. We also,
as I said, have a single agent Phase 2. We're going continue to look at other areas with regards to this. Fulvestrant is
one of the obvious combinations. Therefore, we chose that.
With regards to the mechanism of action, we know that bemaciclib is selective for CDK4 and 6. We can't comment on
why we're seeing different levels of neutropenia other than we are seeing a different safety profile. And as I say, we are
able to do continuous dosing with this agent. We have single-agent activity with this agent, and we have a different
safety profile with lower levels of neutropenia. Other than to say that we selected the CDK4 and 6, I can't comment on
whether there's a specific mechanism of action here.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Mark, this is Derica. As we've stated on our Animal Health investor call earlier this week, the
Novartis Animal Health transaction does not change or materially affect our ongoing capital allocation strategy. We
still believe we have the capacity to sustain our dividend at least at its current level, and we're still in the position going
forward to consider future dividend increases. This does not affect our outlook in terms of our ability to complete our
share repurchase program. We're still committed to the $5 billion.
And as it relates to business development, we still have the capacity to pursue the types of deals that you've seen from
Lilly historically. We've never been in the space of megamergers. But if you look at our history, the largest deal we've
done is ImClone, now the second largest deal is to be Novartis Animal Health, and after that was ICOS for about $2.5
billion. So within that space, we absolutely have the capacity to pursue those types of opportunities.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Mark, one thing I might add on the CDK 4/6, the neutropenia, it certainly could be that
Pfizer conditioned the market to believe that this mechanism would be causing neutropenia full stop and those were
linked. There was data we presented at AACR that showed of those patients that received a 30% or greater reduction in
tumor size, a significant proportion of those did not have neutropenia. So I think we may need to rethink a little bit
what is actually causing the anti-tumor response and what may be causing neutropenia.
John, if we could have the next caller, please?
Operator
And that's Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.
<Q - Stephen M. Scala>: Thank you. Regarding the 2015 outlook, assuming a January 1, 2015 close of Novartis
Animal Health, does Lilly view consensus of $3.17 as reasonable at this early stage? And if you're not willing to
comment, should we conclude you're not comfortable?
The second question is on your novel basal insulin. Based on the data that you now have in house, are you fully
confident that you have a differentiated molecule versus LANTUS?
And then the third question is on dulaglutide. You achieved non-inferiority to VICTOZA in AWARD-6. But if the
numerical trend was worse on some endpoint, how will you overcome that obstacle in the marketplace? Thank you.

<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Steve, thank you for the questions. Derica, if you'll take the first one on 2015 guidance
relative to the Street's expectations that they have currently; and then, Enrique, for the two diabetes questions.
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Hi, Steve. I like the phrasing of your initial question, but let me try to clarify. I am not able to
comment on specific 2015 guidance at this time, and it has nothing to do with our level of comfort or discomfort. It just
means that we're not in a position to provide guidance and we typically haven't at this stage of the game. What we have
said is that we do expect that in 2015 that we expect a return to growth and margin expansion. And obviously, that was
prior to the impact or the contemplation of the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Steve, we have I think very consistently said that when it comes to our innovative basal
insulin, we would only see us launching that if we truly can differentiate against LANTUS. Now all of our trials are
basically against LANTUS. We have a number of measures that we are looking at. We have talked about glycemic
control. We have talked about nocturnal hypoglycemia, a better weight profile, and also lower use of the mealtime
insulin dose with a product of some indications that we basically saw in Phase 2. Clearly, we also saw some signals
when it comes to some side effects. At this point in time, I'm just going to ask for all of us to wait. We believe that we
should be in a position to issue a top line press release this quarter.
On dulaglutide, I really cannot comment more than what we basically have said as part of the press release. We are
pleased with the results of AWARD-6. We will have to wait for the detailed disclosure of the data. At this stage, we
believe we have a very competitive product, and we're very bullish on it.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Thanks, Enrique. John, if we could have our next caller, please?
Operator
And we'll go to John Boris was SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions. First question, John, you had mentioned about improved
customer focus. Can we maybe hear from your business leaders about that customer focus, especially since it's changed
pretty significantly over the last decade to the payers and the pushback from payers and pricing; but in particular on
oncology and diabetes, how well prepared you are to secure formulary access for your assets here going forward?
And then a quick question on the CDK 4/6, have you applied for Breakthrough designation on the compound? If you
haven't, what is the hold up for applying for Breakthrough designation on the asset? Thanks.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great, John, thank you for the questions. We'll go ahead and hit the commercial folks for our
Pharma businesses. We'll start with Dave Ricks, and then we'll turn it over to Enrique. And then Sue can comment on
the oncology part of your first question and also CDK 4/6 we'll finish with Sue. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Great, John, thanks for the question. As John Lechleiter mentioned in his comments, we've
taken the opportunity over the last four years as we've restructured our company to really improve our capabilities to go
to market. This includes significant investments in our payer capabilities. I'll let Enrique in particular comment on that
as we prepare for the diabetes launches. But we feel good about both the U.S. and non-U.S. investments we've made to
represent not only to major payers but key accounts at all stages in the healthcare system.
We've also substantially restructured our sales force not just to be stronger and leaner but I think go to market in a
pretty different way. We're not going to go into the details of that for competitive reasons here, but I think we overall
feel good about our ability to commercialize the future pipeline. I'd also comment that Lilly continues to invest in our
direct-to-consumer and direct-to-patient capabilities globally, which of course includes DTC in the U.S. but also other
direct patient contact initiatives and patient support outside the U.S. So overall, I think we're in good shape
competitively here. Enrique, do you want add to that?

<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Sure. When it comes to diabetes, I think all of us know the payer environment is very
complex. It's challenging, both coming from the decisions the payers are making as well as the competition that we
have. From our perspective, we believe and we continue to believe that choice continues to be extremely important.
Now we clearly see that sometimes this is not an option that we have. And in those cases, we do compete for
preferential access, in particular when it comes to our insulin portfolio, which is what we are marketing now. As we
make the decisions, we do look at both financial and strategic considerations in terms of how competitive we are going
to be with the different accounts. I would mention that in the case of TRADJENTA, the engagement with the payers is
done through BI.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Sue?
<A - Susan Mahony>: And with regards to oncology, clearly from a sales force perspective, we have a very
experienced sales force globally in oncology. With payers, again, our focus is very much on ensuring that we bring
value to those patients and continuing to bring medicines back to offer value to patients, payers, and physicians. We
also are really clear that we need to ensure that we continue to get value from continuous innovation, which is the
foundation of oncology development.
With regards to our CDK 4/6 inhibitor, our focus here is to ensure that we get this medicine to patients as quickly as
possible, and we will continue to work with the FDA and other regulatory authorities to enable that.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great, thank you. John, next caller please?
Operator
And we'll go to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. This is really a question for Sue. Just in the spirit of the industry specializing and
getting more focused, in the area of oncology, Lilly is conspicuously absent in immuno-oncology. Is that an issue?
Without immuno-oncology agents, can you still be competitive in this arena? And then secondly, are you planning to
develop studies combining your CDK inhibitor with immuno-oncology? Or rather ramu [ramucirumab] or the other
VEGF inhibitor, could you combine that? Is that part of the game plan? But just really, can you be competitive in
oncology given where the paradigm is changing? Thanks.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Thanks, Jami. Sue?
<A - Susan Mahony>: Thank you, Jami. It's a great question. Clearly, there's a lot of interest and excitement about
immuno-oncology. And I think it's been very clear that we're seeing some exciting data in some tumors, particularly
melanoma and in others. We don't have a PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor. We do have a number of molecules in our pipeline
though that do work on the immune system. The TGF-beta pathway is important in immune defects in a number of
tumor types, and we have both large molecule and small molecule inhibitors to TGF-beta. We also have other
molecules in our pipeline in an earlier phase, including our CXCR4 antibody, CSF-1 receptor antibody, and our p38
small molecule inhibitor as well as our research efforts focused on it.
So no, we don't believe that we are absent in immuno-oncology at all. Clearly, we are excited at this point in time by
the fact that over the last 18 months or so, we've had four positive Phase 3 studies showing overall survival
improvement in lung cancer, in gastric cancer. And so we are very much focused on ensuring that we get those
medicines to patients as soon as possible. And yes, we do believe that combinations of both target agents,
chemotherapy and immuno-therapy is going to future in oncology, and we're very much focused on that.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Thank you, Sue. Jan, do you want to comment as well?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: Yes, I can also add to that. We have seen I think the emergence of a new area where a lot
needs to be done still, and there are a number of additional targets at the breakneck pace that it's being explored. But
that will come to the clinic in due course. So I think we are serious about this, and we have also done some key
recruitment recently and are strengthening this area where we can actually then apply our core in drug hunting skills

And we'll go to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes, thanks very much. I was hoping that you could just explain in some detail how you
calculate the – sorry, excuse me for one second here. Sorry, I had an incoming call, my apologies. If you could, just
explain your calculation of U.S. net price. So obviously, CYMBALTA had a significant negative impact on that
calculation, but I just wanted to better understand how you run the calculation, whether it's the step-down in U.S. net
price in the first quarter, or your full book of business was solely driven by CYMBALTA, or whether the diabetes
franchise is experiencing price declines, and how you go about calculating it? Maybe you assume, I don't know, the
authorized generic price for CYMBALTA or something, and that drives that calculation down dramatically.
And then separately, with respect to ASCO, I'm just wondering what you're planning on in terms of an investor event or
specific investor discussions at that event. Thank you very much.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great, thanks for the questions, Dave. We'll have Derica respond to your first question and
then Sue on your question regarding ASCO. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Hi, Dave. In regards to our U.S. net price calculation, it is really comprised of three elements.
One is obviously any ongoing rebate that we provide relative to the prior period. Secondly, here in the near term, it
does include the impact of the authorized generic, which would be at a lower net price. And the third would be any
adjustments we make to our gross or net accruals as we reconcile to any receipts that we're receiving from the
government.
As it relates to the rebates, the first point I started, we did see in the quarter obviously the impact of the ESI [Express
Scripts] contract in the U.S. in our diabetes business where we did see price deflation rather than price growth on a net
basis. So those are the three elements that are driving the price effect that you're seeing in our Q1 results in the U.S.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Thanks, Derica. Sue?
<A - Susan Mahony>: With regards to ASCO, we have a number of interesting presentations at ASCO. We have a
follow-up to the RAINBOW gastric cancer study being presented. We've also got the necitumumab SQUIRE first-line
squamous study being presented as an oral, and the ramucirumab CYRAMZA second-line lung cancer study being
presented as an oral as well as the CDK 4/6 lung cancer cohort. So clearly, we feel that we've got some interesting
information, and we are planning to have a conference call of some sort to be finalized with you all there, so stay tuned
on that one.

environment in U.S., if you can, because obviously you've got a bit of a one-time impact here. Just can you give us
your thoughts about, going forward, how you view the insulin pricing environment, particularly in the analog space?
Secondly, do you think there are any other specific areas within Animal Health that you would look to add or build
through bolt-ons in the future?

And then just lastly on your CDK, I know there have been a lot of questions today, but do you think it's possible there
could be any kind of different tolerability profile regarding neutropenia when this product is used more chronically in
combination with fulvestrant versus as monotherapy? Thank you.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Jeff, thank you for the questions. We'll have Enrique take your insulin pricing question for
the U.S., obviously, Jeff in for the Animal Health question, then back to Sue for the topic of the day, the CDK 4/6
inhibitor. Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: First when it comes to our overall insulin business, let me provide just a bit of broader
context. When we look at our overall insulin franchise, we had very good volume growth worldwide. Our volume
growth was basically 8% to 9% when we look at our insulin franchise. And this volume growth was solid across all
regions based on our ability to be competitive when it comes to our presence in different geographies.
When it comes to the U.S., I think it's important that we do recognize there were two impacts here. There was a net
pricing impact of the contract with ESI and other contracts as well, as well as there was a very significant inventory
effect when it comes to wholesalers. That inventory effect was in the high single digits in the U.S. So that was an
important impact for us. When we look at our overall demand and all of you have access to the script data, it is very
clear that we've seen a very significant impact when it comes to our share performance and our overall volume
performance.
Going forward, this is something that we monitor very carefully when it comes to pricing. But we have now over 50%
of the market that has gone to preferential formularies when it comes to analogs. The question is how quickly will the
rest of the market go there? I think it's fair to say that we are fighting to make sure that patients continue to have choice.
But at the same time, as I have shared, we need to be competitive whenever a payer basically makes the decision that
they're going to narrow the formulary. At this stage, it is difficult to make more comments when it comes to looking at
the future of insulin pricing. I would just say that we do monitor this very carefully, and we have become increasingly
more sophisticated to think about both financially and the strategically what's in our best interest.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Jeff?
<A - Jeffrey N. Simmons>: Yes, Jeff. I think to answer your question, the first thing I would say is Novartis's deal we
announced this week was our eighth acquisition since 2007. So I think we've got a good track record here in terms of
integration. And our focus, no question, the rest of this year and going forward is going to be on efficient and timely
integration of both Lohmann, which we hope to close here in this quarter, as John mentioned, and Novartis. That will
be our focus. I think as you look at acquisitions, it will be back at earlier in the pipeline, heavier focus on innovation,
60% of this growth, we've outgrown the industry 3x, and 60% of that growth has been innovation. So it will be
acquisitions more at a product level earlier back in the pipeline.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great, thanks. Sue?
<A - Susan Mahony>: With regards to bemaciclib, clearly we see lower neutropenia in single agents, with single-digit
bemaciclib. We'll have to see the Phase 3 data with combination fulvestrant to see both the efficacy and safety there.
We do have a Phase 1 safety study that will be in combination with fulvestrant at ASCO so you'll be able to see some
more data there on the safety profile of bemaciclib with fulvestrant.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Sue. John, next caller please?

<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes, first on ALIMTA, can you give us a little more detail on the usage trends both in the U.S.
and ex-U.S.? And then, Enrique, you were talking about diabetes and insulin. Maybe you can just give us your sense of
what you're seeing out there with the orals, DPP-4, SGLT-2, and also maybe comment on the GLP ones as well, just
trends you're seeing in the market and growth rates and how much SGLT-2 is moving ahead of DPP-4 and how much is

used in combination therapy. Thanks.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Marc, thanks for your questions. We'll have Sue obviously take the first one for ALIMTA
and then Enrique the second. Sue?
<A - Susan Mahony>: Sure. So with ALIMTA, if we look at our Q1 performance, ALIMTA sales grew 2%. That was
driven by the U.S. with negative growth, offset by strong performance in ACE and Japan. In the U.S., the decrease was
really driven by buying patterns, with to a lesser extent some selling price impacts as we're seeing higher share in 340B
accounts. OUS, in Japan we saw again buying patterns which went the other way. It was more positive this way with
regards to stocking in prior to the tax consumption change. And also in ACE, we saw very strong volume growth,
driven really in the maintenance.
So what we're seeing is we're continuing to see first-line market share growth and continuation maintenance growth.
And our focus really with ALIMTA is to continue to drive that to ensure that when patients start on ALIMTA, they
continue on ALIMTA and we get more continuation maintenance. ALIMTA continues to be the market leader in
non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer in the first-line selling globally. Also, ALIMTA is the market leader in the
maintenance setting. However, we still see that there's a lot of opportunity to grow the maintenance market so that
when patients start on ALIMTA, they continue onto progression and go into continuation maintenance, and that's
clearly our focus now and going forward.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Very good. First on the market dynamic for the orals, I think we're seeing very good
growth when it comes to new patient volumes. When it is taken in combination, both the DPP-4 new patient starts, the
DPP-4 class plus the SGLT-2 class. This new patient growth that we're basically seeing is slightly above where we had
expected it to be, so we are very pleased with that. I think the SGLT-2 class is off to a very good start. It seems it is
being adopted very well.
When it comes to the GLP-1s, I think it's slightly different. We believe that the GLP-1 market could expand in a very
significant way, but we have not seen that at this stage. I'll be very frank. We are counting on dulaglutide to be an
enormous catalyst for that growth. As I have shared, while we have basically looked at dula against liraglutide at
highest dose, our intent of doing that has been to basically ensure that we get the right price and reimbursement for our
product. We are not seeking to just switch patients from liraglutide. The big opportunity that we have in this particular
case is to ensure that we can expand the GLP-1 class in a very significant way. And once again we see dulaglutide as a
pretty important catalyst to that.
You were also asking about the payer environment on both of those classes. Without going into a lot of detail, payers
today view, when it comes to GLP-1s, more differentiation between the products than maybe when it comes to a
mealtime insulin. I think that's also the case for basal insulins. So the formularies as to when it comes to GLP-1s and
basal insulins don't tend to be as narrow as they are in the case of mealtime insulins. In the case of the orals,
formularies today are not as narrow. That is clearly a risk going forward, but it is not like the case of the mealtime
insulin, where you may have just exclusively one product in the formulary. In most of the formularies when it comes to
orals, there tends to be more than one product, maybe two products in that formulary; maybe not all, but maybe two.

And then just a second one, unrelated, on the destocking, it seems like quite a bit of an impact there for you guys this
quarter. Any special dynamics that you can highlight, can you talk about the weather maybe playing a little bit of a role
this quarter? And is there anything else that we should be thinking about, any way to quantify for some of your bigger
products like ALIMTA, CIALIS, HUMALOG, exactly how much of an impact that had? Thanks.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great, Vamil, thanks for the question; Sue, if you want to take the ramucirumab question.
And then we'll actually have Dave Ricks talk a little more in detail about the destocking that we saw in the first quarter
based on stocking in Q4. Sue?
<A - Susan Mahony>: Let me talk about CYRAMZA because clearly we're extremely excited this week to announce
that we have the first FDA approval for CYRAMZA. In fact, it's now the first FDA-approved medicine for advanced
gastric cancer following chemotherapy. This is clearly a huge unmet need. And although it's a very common, it's the
fifth most common cancer globally, it's the third leading cause of death, it's a rare disease in the U.S. We estimate about
22,000 patients will be diagnosed with gastric cancer this year. And a proportion of those will go into second-line
treatment. So while I'm talking about ramucirumab, I want to make sure that I mention that.
And also we are planning that we will have this product available over the next few weeks because we want to get it to
patients. We also know that we've got a number of questions on price, so I might as well tell you this now while you're
all there. As I said, it is a rare disease in the U.S. Ramucirumab, CYRAMZA, has been given orphan drug status, and
we have priced CYRAMZA to match other orphan drugs and [ph] thirdly (1:07:25) biologics. So the price of an
infusion based on a 60-kilogram patient is – based on a 70-kilogram patient, sorry, is $6,120. And given the median
numbers of infusions that we used in our REGARD trial, which is the pivotal trial that led to this approval this week,
the total price per patient will be $24,480. So that's in the single-agent, second-line gastric cancer.
With regards to the combination gastric cancer trial, the RAINBOW study, we plan to submit that as a supplemental
NDA to the FDA very soon. Clearly, we also have completed the submission to Europe based on the REGARD study
and are working to find the most efficient way of getting the RAINBOW study submitted to Europe, and we plan to
submit in Japan as well.
You mentioned as well we've got the other positive phase study, Phase 3 study in lung cancer, which we'll be
presenting at ASCO. And the HCC and colorectal studies should be reading out yet this year, so we're very excited.
Yes, we do plan to do other studies of CYRAMZA as we plan our life cycle plan. We're not able to give you specific
details there other than to say that given the positive data that we've seen in both gastric and lung, we clearly are
looking to ensure that we have full life cycle plans for this molecule.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Thanks, Sue. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: In regard to inventories, there are two big effects on Q1, the first obviously the U.S. We have
some, as Enrique mentioned, headwind in the high single digits, even low double digits across the marketed product
portfolio.
I just want to remind investors that we had a very robust Q4 on exactly these same products and stated at that time that
there was a tailwind. Why this happens I think is a cluster of just how the calendar works in terms of their buying
patterns, covering the holiday period in early January coupled with price speculation. Obviously, if we look over a
longer period of time, these tend to smooth out in the U.S.
We also in Q1 had a very strong performance in Japan. A portion of that is driven by Japanese stocking from Q2 into
Q1, so you need to look through that as well. Again, in the long term, these tend to smooth out, and I think in-market
performance for these key brands in diabetes as well as bio-medicines I think are on track and consistent across the two
quarters.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Thank you, Dave. And, Vamil, thanks for the questions. John, next caller please?

Will go to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. First, a follow-up on the immuno-oncology
question. Just to clarify, are you looking for external collaborations for ramu in lung cancer with a PD-1 or a PD-L1?
And could you remind us if the ramu HCC [Hepatocellular Carcinoma] and the other trial that's ongoing if there's going
been an external readout this year? Thank you. The colorectal cancer is the one I meant.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Sure. Alex, thanks for questions. Sue?
<A - Susan Mahony>: Sure. Alex, we are continuing to look at multiple combinations. Obviously, CYRAMZA with
its mechanism of action could be combined with a number of different agents. So we are looking at multiple
combinations, including looking at immuno-oncology combinations with many of our pipeline molecules, not just with
CYRAMZA.
With regards to the HCC and colorectal, we should have the HCC readout in the first half of this year, mid- this year.
And later this year, we should have the colorectal readout. We're anticipating that we would do top lines on both of
those and have external data disclosure on the HCC Phase 3 trials this year.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Thank you, Sue. John, if we can, go to the next caller please.

And that's Colin Bristow with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Thanks for taking the questions. Regarding business development on the pharma side, are
you willing to highlight any mechanisms or therapeutic areas of particular interest to you right now?
On evacetrapib, it feels like there's less optimism on this class from a mechanistic commercial standpoint since you
embarked on the outcomes trial. What gives you continued comfort that this is a viable mechanism? And could you just
give some color on where you see this fitting in the evolving landscape in this [ph] NCV (1:12:20) risk reduction?
And then finally, with regards to ramucirumab, can you just confirm the Japanese filing is still anticipated before year
end? Thanks.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great, Colin. Thanks for the questions. Let's have Dave start out with your evacetrapib
question. Sue, if you want to reiterate our plans for ramucirumab in Japan. And then, John, do you want to comment
maybe on – or Derica on the business development areas that we're looking at in pharma?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Great, thanks. On evacetrapib, certainly Lilly remains very optimistic about this mechanism.
And thus the basis for our original investment in evacetrapib remains, which is that this drug has a very substantial
impact on both LDL and HDL as well as other important cardiovascular markers. We believe that that effect will
demonstrate a significant reduction in major cardiovascular risk. We have a large Phase 3 program which is fully
enrolled. We're waiting for events, and we believe we are powered to demonstrate that reduction in major
cardiovascular risk based on all those factors and actually on LDL alone. So we're optimistic about evacetrapib.
I think some of the noise in the class has died down post the dalcetrapib readout, reminding investors that the
dalcetrapib molecule was quite different from evacetrapib in both its biomarker effect but also structure, had a much
more modest effect, and only on HDL. And of course, we have a competitor at Merck in anacetrapib, and they've had
some interesting data come out of their own which I think is dampening enthusiasm for that program. But we remain
both committed and excited about evacetrapib as potentially a very large product in our future.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Thanks, Dave. Sue, on Japan?
<A - Susan Mahony>: Sure. With regards CYRAMZA, yes we are on track to submit in Japan this year.

<A - Philip L. Johnson>: John?
<A - John C. Lechleiter>: With respect to business development, we have lots of business development activity, sort
of like the duck floating on the water. The feet are paddling away. But we're looking at business development
opportunities across all categories that we compete in. You know a lot about Elanco and some of the things we've done
there. Obviously, in areas of strength like oncology and diabetes, we're looking at opportunities that might complement
our strength in our current portfolio of products which could be used in combination with those products. And in
bio-medicines, which covers a whole broad range of therapeutic areas, I think a couple of good examples recently
tanezumab, the collaboration with Pfizer on the anti-CGRP – or anti-NGF antibody for pain, and then our acquisition of
Arteaus in January with the anti-CGRP antibody for migraine. I think we're biased toward areas where we have internal
therapeutic expertise, where we understand development pathways, and where we have key customer relationships.
You can expect that we'll continue to remain vigilant and opportunistic when other opportunities come along.

We'll go to Damien Conover with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
<Q - Damien L. Conover>: Great, thanks for squeezing me in here, just a question on the strategic level. It looks like
we're seeing more movement from Phase 1 right into Phase 3. I'm thinking a little bit about the CDK 4/6. But we're also
seeing that with a lot of your competitors, AstraZeneca making some announcements earlier today. I just wanted to get
your thoughts on the risk/reward of this dynamic, and then also any commentary you have on how much of this
decision is internally based versus gated by regulatory authorities. Thanks.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great, Damien, thanks for the question. I think we'll have Jan respond.
<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: We have seen this for some time in the oncology area where Phase 1 data then are used and
then you go directly into Phase 3. Clearly, the signal has to be strong if you want to do this, and you should also have a
clear-cut understanding of what is the patient population that you are targeting and preferably have some biomarker in a
way to guide that.
There is clearly a risk in doing this because in reality you would like to have more Phase 2 data to ensure then the
highest probable Phase 3 success rate. In our strategy, we are talking about robust Phase 2 data as a good guarantee
from improving Phase 3 success rates when you actually know the dosing regimen, the patients you are selecting, and
the marker and the endpoints and so on.
In relation to the Alzheimer area, we and others have limited Phase 2 data than before you go into Phase 3, which is
unfortunate. But in reality you need so many patients and so long studies, you might as well do the Phase 3 trial right
away. What you can do there though, however, is begin to select the patients better by only selecting patients that for
instance for anti-amyloid therapy that really have amyloid in their brain as detected for instance by analytic scanning.
So we actually again try to target your population in Phase 3.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Thank you, Jan. I understand the queue is filling up again a bit, so we'll continue
since we have some time before the bottom of the hour. John, if we could go to the next caller please.

Phase 2 to warrant a move forward into Phase 3 given the subset analyses that were a bit questionable from a
competitor moving forward and then the ultimate failure of that Phase 3? What is it that has you take a harder look at
that?
And then can you give us a little bit more color on the oncology side from a scientific perspective, how we should be
thinking about the CSF-1R antibody and your enthusiasm around that approach in oncology?
And then lastly, Derica, I know you've been asked this question number of times. But can you just give us again – you
said that $2.9 billion of adjusted net income but $4 billion of operating cash flow. What proportion of that is historical
amortization and depreciation? Is it 100% of that, or is it about $700 million, just to help us think about the comparable
valuations given that most of your competitors actually exclude that from the P&L. Thanks.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Seamus. We'll have Sue take your first question with regard to the MetMAb.
We may actually need to get back to you on the CSF-1R question. And then Derica had to step out for a moment, so I'll
go ahead and take your question on the amortization and depreciation. Sue?
<A - Susan Mahony>: Yes, thanks, Seamus. With regards to our MET program, we remain still excited with our MET
program. Our MET antibody is different to the Genentech antibody. It's a bivalent antibody and it blocks both
ligand-dependent and ligand-independent c-MET signaling, which we believe could be important. We have two Phase
2 trials ongoing in lung cancer with this MET antibody, and we're specifically targeting each of our mutant populations
since the science shows that there is evidence for the relevance of EGFR and MET crosstalk. So we believe that with
the antibody that we've got that's bivalent, as I say, targeting both the ligand and independent ligand MET expression
plus our focus on EGFR mutant population that we've got an interesting molecule on the right development path. And
clearly, we've got a Phase 2 program that we want to see the outcome of that Phase 2 program to decide whether we
move forward with Phase 3. So we remain optimistic.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Great. Thank you, Sue. Derica is now back with us, but not to spring the question on him
last minute, let me go ahead and I'll take the answer, and you can add in if you need to, Derica. So, Seamus, on your
question of the amount of depreciation amortization, on an annual basis that's about $1.3 billion, with a good chunk of
that being amortization of intangibles. As I mentioned for this quarter that was about $132 million that we had of
amortization of intangibles that, as you pointed out, many of our competitors now exclude from their non-GAAP or
core earnings. We do not do that and don't have any short-term plans to change. We certainly have noticed the trend
over time for more and more of our peers to exclude this, and we continue to have discussions internally. But we'll go
ahead make sure that you guys know where to get to our 10-Q and 10-K language to find these numbers so that you can
make appropriate adjustments for apples-to-apples comparisons. John, next caller, please?

And we'll go to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Hey, thanks for taking the follow-up question. I appreciate it. I just wanted to get a quick
update on your PCSK-9 antibody program. It's been a little bit since I think we've got an update on that. And the
specific question is there has been some speculation out there. I was wondering if you could clarify, if you'd be willing
to clarify it or not, that your antibody might be able to be dosed less frequently than all the other competitors out there,
something like once quarterly. Thanks very much.
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Thanks for the question, Mark. Dave, if you want to answer; Jan, feel free to chime in.
Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Sure. Mark, as a reminder, we're in the middle of a Phase 2 study. We expect data in the second
half. The purpose of that study is really to better elucidate the dosing schedule for the medicine, but I think it's safe to
say we believe that PCSK-9 can make a significant difference in cardiovascular risks and that Lilly PCSK-9 may have
the benefit of an extended dosing schedule. How long we would actually decide to do if we proceeded with the
medicine is to be determined.

And that will be Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you. One of the bare arguments on Lilly as it relates to ALIMTA and what the
future of that product is given changing landscape of the PD-1s. I know companies maintain five and 10-year
long-range plans. Directionally, what can you say about how you view ALIMTA's trajectory given what seems to be a
change here? Is it something that you think is going continue to grow, or are there going to be some share losses as you
see PD-1s start to take some lung business?
<A - Philip L. Johnson>: Tim, thank you for the question. Sue, that's right up your alley.
<A - Susan Mahony>: Tim, that's a great question. And clearly the patent decision that we got this year makes us feel
much more comfortable with regards to the future of ALIMTA. We're going to have to wait and see what happens with
regards to the PD-1s in immuno-oncology. We need to see the data mature. We need to see which patients would be
most eligible for those agents. Our focus, as I said previously, is really to continue to drive the first-line and the
maintenance, so the continuation maintenance indications for ALIMTA. And even though we are a market leader,
we've only got less than 40% share of market in the first-line setting. And only approximately 20% of patients go on to
receive maintenance after the first-line setting. So we do continue to see that there are opportunities.
There a lot of different agents being investigated in lung cancer, which is great because the need is huge. We've made a
lot of improvement over the years, but there's an awful lot of improvement that needs to happen. So I think clearly
we're watching and we're involved in bringing new medicines to patients, and we see that the lung cancer market is
continuing to be an area of interest as we are bringing new medicines in because of the size of it, because of the unmet
need. So I still see opportunity clearly for ALIMTA to grow. I'm glad that we won the patent, and we're continuing to
drive what we believe the opportunity is with three Phase 3 trials that show an overall the survival advantage with
ALIMTA, showing that if you start with ALIMTA and stay with ALIMTA in the front-line setting that we can continue
to help patients and we'll continue to grow this brand.
