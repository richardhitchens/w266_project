With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn A. Hewson
Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. We are pleased to have you with us
as we review our first quarter results and full-year outlook for 2016.
As today's release details, we had a very strong quarter financially and operationally. The Corporation continued to
perform at a very high level in delivering critical solutions to customers, while returning value to stockholders. I want
to highlight a few key items in the quarter, including an update on our Sikorsky activities, as well as the current status
of the strategic disposition of our Information Systems & Global Solutions business to Leidos.
Turning to the quarter, our team continued to deliver broad-based results across the Corporation with achievement of
first quarter financials that exceeded all of our internal plans. This strong year-to-date performance enabled us to
increase full-year 2016 guidance for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations.
As a reminder, the guidance continues to assume inclusion of full-year 2016 financial results from the Information
Systems & Global Solutions business. We will adjust our financial outlook when the disposition of IS&GS is
completed, which we continue to anticipate will be in the third or fourth quarter of this year. Bruce will provide a
detailed review of the guidance and assumptions in his comments and web charts.
One of the standout items in our financial results is the strong performance of cash from operations. Consistent cash
generation is a financial hallmark of our Corporation and enabled us to return over $1 billion to stockholders this
quarter through dividends and share repurchases. I would also note that share repurchases year-to-date have reduced the
outstanding share count to approximately 304 million shares. This lower level illustrates the progress we are achieving
on our goal to reduce outstanding shares to below 300 million shares by the end of 2017.
This longstanding goal does not consider the additional share reduction opportunities from the pending disposition of
IS&GS. We anticipate further share reductions will be accomplished by a stock exchange contained in the deal
transaction. Additionally, the $1.8 billion special cash payment to our Corporation at deal closure also provides cash
deployment and share reduction opportunity.
For the full-year of Sikorsky operating as part of our Mission Systems and Training business area, I'd like to offer my
high level perspectives on their activities. Integration actions are progressing well as we work to transition Sikorsky
operations into Lockheed Martin. As we perform the integration, we continue to evaluate the best-in-class processes,
procedures and tools. Our goal remains to identify and apply the best practices across the enterprise throughout the
integration process.
We continue to see cost reduction and efficiency opportunities emerging as we work as one team with Sikorsky. Areas
like supply chain, where multiple business areas procure similar materials have allowed us to look at where we can
realize better buying power, and align procurement specifications. By utilizing best-in-class processes from across the
Corporation, further efficiencies can be achieved, and will help ensure we capture the synergies identified from this
acquisition.
Moving to an operational perspective, significant progress was achieved on the CH-53K program for the U.S. Marine
Corps. The second prototype test helicopter achieved first flight in February, providing additional assets to the flight
test program, and expanded our ability to achieve future critical milestones. We look forward to demonstrating the
maturity of the aircraft through the current development phase.
Since the end of the quarter, we received a contract from the U.S. Navy, for long lead items required for the first two
CH-53K helicopters on Low-Rate Initial Production Lot 1. These initial units are part of the naval aviation procurement
plan to field 200 helicopters on the program in coming years.

In the area of commercial helicopters, we are seeing some emerging interest from other customers beyond the oil and
gas sector for S-92 platforms, and we are pushing aggressively into the search and rescue, VIP transportation and
international military segments. We also see significant potential to create additional value in these sectors in
sustainment.
To pursue this area, we recently opened a State-of-the-Art Customer Care Center in Connecticut that is designed to
enhance platform reliability and ensure 24 hour availability to customer's aircraft needs. Overall, I remain enthusiastic
about the opportunities for long-term creation of the rotary aircraft business to customers around the world.
Turning to our Information Systems & Global Solutions business area, key events associated with the pending strategic
disposition included successful clearance of the Hart-Scott-Rodino regulatory review in the United States, satisfying
one of the key conditions to deal closure. The only remaining review of competition impact is in process in the United
Kingdom.
We also filed the required registration statements last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing
and a comparable filing by Leidos initiate a review process by the SEC staff. Once the review process is completed, a
prospectus describing the terms and conditions of the exchange offer and transaction will be provided to Lockheed
Martin stockholders.
Switching to some brief comments on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, overall, the program continues to progress on
satisfying remaining development activities, while also ramping up the production rate.
Several noteworthy events were achieved this quarter, and included completion of the first trans-Atlantic F-35 flight
from the Italian final assembly and checkout facility to the U.S. to enable commencement of training for Italian pilots,
surpassing 50,000 flight hours of the F-35 fleet, demonstrating the increasing level of flight operations.
And lastly, we also successfully conducted first flight of the software required to achieve Initial Operational Capability
of C-12 aircraft to the U.S. Air Force. Achievement of this milestone enables the program to progress towards IOC
scheduled later this year.
I will conclude my remarks by recognizing the difficult, but necessary workforce reduction actions implemented this
quarter by our Aeronautics and IS&GS business areas. As stewards of the enterprise, it is a business imperative that we
remain agile and competitive in our cost structure. In response to dynamic business conditions, these businesses
implemented voluntary and involuntary head count reductions. While these reductions resulted in a special severance
charge in the quarter, they also significantly improved our competitiveness and ability to win future new business
opportunities with a leaner cost structure.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line
for your questions.
Bruce L. Tanner
Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along
with the web charts we included with our earnings release today.
Let's begin with chart three, and an overview of our results for the quarter. Sales for the quarter were $11.7 billion,
slightly ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was also higher than expected at $1.2 billion, resulting in
earnings per share of $2.58, which included the impact of about $100 million in severance charges associated with
planned head count reductions.
We generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations, a good start to the year. We returned $1 billion of cash to our
stockholders in the quarter, about equally split between share repurchases and dividends. And because of our better
than expected performance, we are increasing our outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from
operations. So we're off to a strong start in 2016.

On chart four, we compare our sales and earnings per share in the first quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales
were about $1.6 billion higher this year than last year, driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky into the results of MST for
about $1 billion, and more than $600 million in growth in Aeronautics, driven by about $400 million in higher F-35
production volume along with higher C-130 and C-5 aircraft deliveries.
Earnings per share were lower than last year, but this year's results include those severance charges for reductions in
Aeronautics and IS&GS, as well as the headwind effects of the Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustment and
integration costs.
On chart five we'll discuss the cash returned to shareholders in the quarter. With nearly $1.6 billion of cash from
operations, and slightly more than $150 million of capital expenditures, we had $1.4 billion of free cash flow this
quarter. And with over $500 million each in share repurchases and dividends, our total cash returned to shareholders
was 73% of free cash flow. With our share repurchase level in the first quarter, we are right on track to our planned
level of $2 billion in share repurchases for the year.
If you turn to chart six, we'll provide our updated outlook for 2016. Because of our strong performance in the quarter,
we are increasing our yearly outlook for all key financial metrics. We are increasing our sales outlook by $100 million
and our segment operating profit outlook by $125 million due to our performance in the first quarter.
We're increasing our earnings per share range by $0.05 per share, and I'll discuss that in greater detail on the next chart.
And we increased our outlook for cash from operations by $100 million consistent with our improved profit outlook.
Chart seven provides a reconciliation of our current and prior earnings per share outlook. The $125 million increase in
segment operating profit results in a $0.26 increase in EPS, while the $100 million special charge associated with our
severance actions reduces our EPS outlook by $0.21, netting to the $0.05 increase that I mentioned on the prior chart.
On chart eight, we show our revised sales outlook by business area. The $100 million increase in sales is due to the
improved outlook we have for IS&GS after its better-than-expected results in the first quarter. We are reaffirming the
sales ranges for the other core business areas at this time.
Chart nine provides the updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. We increased our operating profit
outlook in four of our five business areas, with Aeronautics, Space Systems and IS&GS increasing $25 million each,
while Mission Systems and Training was increased by $50 million.
And finally, on chart 10 we have our summary. Our strong start to the year led us to increase the outlook of sales,
operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. We continued to provide significant cash returns to our
stockholders, and we remain on track to complete the IS&GS RMT transaction later this year.
With that, we're ready for questions, Abigail.

Operator
Thank you. In the interest of time, we are limiting you to one question. Please return to the queue for any follow-up
questions. At this time, we are opening our lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from
Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey. Good morning, Marillyn and Bruce. Good quarter.

<Q - Carter Copeland>: Couple of – just quick ones on the margin. I noticed that the profit contribution from the
C-130 that you called out on the $200 million in higher revenues is only $10 million that sort of implies a lower margin
than we would think is normal for that. I wondered if there was a negative offset there.
And then as a second one in the guide, I noted the sales in MFC have obviously been strong and benefited from, I think
some of the consumable stuff and some of the stuff you highlighted in the release. But the guidance didn't increase
there, and I wondered if there was again an offset to call out for the full year. Thank you
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Thanks, Carter. Thanks for the question. So the first one, I think was your margin
contribution question relative to the C-130, and you picked up right. I think we had $190 million increase in sales and
about a $10 million or so increase in profits, what we called out, I think on the earnings release.
This is somewhat of what I talked about, I think, either in October or January, where we're sort of finishing kind of an
older, I'd say, multi-year contract, because it's more than a multi-year contract, but an older contract of C-130s that we
performed well on, and it's at the tail end of that contract, and we're starting off with sort of the new deliveries and new
performance on the new multi-year contract that was just negotiated.
So some of that is sort of the resetting, in my words, of the profits – initial profit booking rate on the C-130 contract. As
I've said, all along, I still think the economics between the two contracts are very similar. But as is our sort of historical
practice, we're starting that program a little lower than we ended the last program for C-130s, if that makes sense.
On Missiles and Fire Control sales, you're right, we did not increase for the year. We're watching that closely. I'll just
leave at that, as we sit here in the first quarter, it didn't feel like now is the right time to look at that. I think there is
some upside opportunity. We've seen some good signs, particularly as you said, Carter, in some of the consumables,
particularly with some of our Middle East customers. But I'm watching this to see if it perhaps warrants something later
on in the year, but not at this time.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Thank you. I'd just like to follow up on the Missiles and Fire Control side, because you
also in the release talked about, it sounded like more a timing issue with contracts; on Missile Defense, you referred to
PAC-3, can you talk about, when you look at international contracts, particularly in the Middle East on Missile
Defense, where do you stand today in terms of the maturity of those programs? Because it appears you may be in some
that are earlier stage, and perhaps lower margin at this point than when they mature.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Doug, I'll give that a shot. So I think the watch item in terms of the air missile defense
programs for the Middle East are more in the orders expectation for this year, rather than, I'll say, the margin
expectations. You should think of essentially all international orders for both PAC-3 missiles as well as the THAAD
program, or sort of combined with U.S. orders. So they'll perform essentially at parity with U.S. orders over that period
of time. There's not, per se, any greater risk associated with the Middle East portion of the order than the U.S. military
portion of the order, if you will.
And this again, is somewhat akin to what I talked about just now on the C-130, where we have sort of a shifting from
an older contract where we closed out a good performing contract, and a newly negotiated contract where we're starting
off at our typical pattern, probably a little more conservative than we expect to make, and that's exactly what's going on
in both the PAC-3 and THAAD programs as we negotiated some new contracts and they're starting off slightly lower
margin than what we experienced at the end of the previous contracts that finished up.
Again economically, I'm not sure there's a whole lot of difference between the contracts, but sort of from a booking
perspective, that's the way that's playing out. But I wouldn't attribute that necessarily to any greater perception of risk
that we have associated with those deliveries.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good Morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: I had a bit of a multi-part question here on – trying to get an update on the F-35 margin
profile we should expect. So in 2016, I think you're north of about 8%. As you ramp up production and some of the low
margin development work winds down, I want to know if you could comment on what the margin progression should
be. How quickly do you think you could get to F-16 types of margins? And if you would, could you comment on F-35
sustainment, and if that could drive upside to margins?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Rich. I'll take that one as well. So, F-35 margins are going to vary over time. I think
from a big picture perspective, we do expect them to increase sequentially year-over-year. We talked about last year
being expectation of 100 basis point improvement in the overall margins of the F-35 program, we achieved that.
I think, I talked about; again, either October or January, the fact, we thought margins on F-35 would be higher in 2016
than 2015. We still expect that, although not at the same 100 basis point improvement as we saw in 2015, and we
would expect that trend to continue in 2017 and 2018 as we start to sort of progress to what you're describing, Rich,
which is our ultimate expectation, which is that, by the time we get to full rate production, the margins on the F-35
program ought to look very, very similar at a very similar stage of its lifecycle as F-16 margins, F-22 margins, C-130,
et cetera. So, I don't think that we're deviating from that expectation.
Interestingly, as I look at some of the numbers in front of me here, we had probably slightly higher pick-ups on the
production program last year in the first quarter than we did this year, although we did have profit step-ups on
production contracts this quarter as well. If I look at last year's first quarter results, and I know I didn't talk about this
last year, but we were actually close to 10% on the production program. So it will sort of peak and valley depending on
the step-ups, and when they occur, and how many of them occur on multiple production contracts in the same quarter.
But our expectation again is, we'll get to sort of legacy program margins when we get to full rate production. Your
second question was on the F-35 sustainment margin. Those are typically negotiated at pretty comparable margin levels
as the production program, so it's not – not at this point sort of either a drag or a benefit at this point in time. It is
growing fairly rapidly, and we're going to start seeing some of the sustainment contracts sort of split out of the
production contracts as this volume gets bigger, so we may in the future end up talking about sustainment separately
from production, but you shouldn't think of that as being a whole lot different than the production margins at this point.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.
<Q - Joseph DeNardi>: Hey. Thanks very much. Bruce, I wonder if you could just talk about kind of Sikorsky
performance relative to expectations at this point from a revenue and margins standpoint. And then also, just as you
look into 2018, I think that's when the required contributions start again for the pension. So – just based on current
assumptions, can you talk about what the contribution could be in 2018?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Sure, Joe. Thanks for the question. So I would say, Sikorsky, and look, we're still early into
the integration and into the incorporation of Sikorsky into our results. So I'm still getting my head around describing
Sikorsky, and what the expectation should be and shouldn't be. I would characterize the first quarter as pretty much in
line, maybe slightly better than our expectations. That's both from a revenue perspective, as well as a margin
perspective or an EBIT perspective.

We're sort of front-end loaded during the year with these things I talked about in last quarter's call, these customer lien
rights that sort of depress the sales, because of sales for products that were recognized prior to our ownership. That
plays out sort of to – for the most part in the first half of this year, so we would expect to see sort of sequential growth
in sales at Sikorsky quarter-over-quarter with the fourth quarter obviously being the highest quarter of the year.
Similarly, we expect to have the margin profile for Sikorsky increase quarter-over-quarter, again obviously having the
fourth quarter being the highest margin quarter as well. And this is, again, some of the timing of the customer lien
rights in the first half of the year as well. So I'd say, just big picture that's pretty much in line with what we expected to
happen in the first quarter, we're going to watch it throughout the year, and we'll give you updates as we go and
progress through the rest of the year.
Secondly, Joe, you asked a question about 2018 pension funding. So we had described several years ago, our
expectation that we were going to have a three-year pension holiday, cash funding holiday, as I called it, I think. And
that was 2015, 2016 and 2017. And unfortunately, that holiday does stop at the end of 2017, and in 2018 we would
expect to have to start making cash contributions to the pension plan as well going forward. I think as we sit here today,
Joe, that's probably somewhere north of probably $1.5 billion or so.
But importantly, I think you shouldn't think of that as necessarily being sort of taking the current run rate of cash and
subtracting – so say, $5 billion and subtracting $1.5 billion, and we're down to $3.5 billion. We expect by 2018 to have
much greater cash from the Sikorsky acquisition as well as cash from the other business areas that's going to offset
most, but not all that pension contribution. And we also get a tax benefit from that as well. So we get a cash tax benefit
associated with that. So it's somewhat mitigated in 2018, so you shouldn't think of it's sort of is falling off the cliff from
2017.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Yeah. Hey, good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning, Ron.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Can you kind of just walk through the laundry list of upcoming competitions that we
should keep an eye on? I mean, we all kind of know trainer is happening, and maybe you can make some commentary
on that, but what's on that list of stuff we should keep our eyes out for?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Ron. This is Bruce. Did you say competitions or just big awards coming up? Or do you
care...
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: No, competitions. Yeah, competitions. All right, so you've got trainer, and then what else
do we have on the horizon?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: There's not a whole lot of, I'll say, large dollar strategic competition is coming up. Even
trainer is likely going to be – the decision is likely going to happen in 2017 as opposed to 2016. Another large one that
we're watching is JSTARS, but that's probably not a 2016 decision either.
Frankly, most of the – I'll say the strategic competitions that I think is at the heart of your questions would probably not
be in 2016. I mean, these things like long-range – or the LRSO competition, GSBD, Ground Strategic Ballistic
Deterrent. But those are probably 2017, and even beyond as far as the real big ticket strategic items.
And beyond that, I mean, the one we're watching obviously closely, which I wouldn't characterize in the competition,
but MEADS in Germany is one that we're hoping to close, perhaps at the latter part of the year. And I'll let Marillyn
add some color to what I just said.

<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: The only other ones I would say that we're watching are some of our international
partners making their decision on F-35 buys. So Denmark's coming, they're going through this process, and Canada
will ultimately set; we think the best choice for them is F-35, but they'll go through their process for that.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning. I wanted to ask really a two-part question on IS&GS, if I could. First, I
think as you both stated, the business is doing a little better than perhaps you guided, or you've tweaked up the
guidance there. So I wanted to talk about whether that is just timing on some of these program close-outs or pricing
environment, which I think you said is pressuring – maybe it's a little better than expected.
Then separately, Marillyn, the deal was contemplated, I think on what the business will look like at the time of
transaction, but of course that's a nine-month period. And so from the time of announcement, how do we think about
some of the puts and takes and strategic things that you're doing with regard to head count vis-à-vis the new
management team? Are these things that were negotiated? How do we think about that? Thank you.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: So, Rob, let me take the first part of that question, sort of the IS&GS performance, and I'll
say, I mean, obviously we increased the outlook for both sales and profits, so it's exceeding our expectations, and I
think there's couple of things going on, and some of them are a little subtle.
So sales is just, this is a test business to sort of predict which competitions are you going to win, which ones are you
going to not win. And you get scenarios where things get protested, even if you lose, and therefore you can actually get
the sales stretch out of those. We're sort of seeing all of those happen at the same time.
The one thing I'm really pleased with probably more than anything even higher than sort of the sales volume, because
again that's a little bit hard to call, is the better than expected earnings performance and the margin performance. This
was a quarter where we had a pretty significant write-off on an international contract, and even with that write-off, we
still exceeded our expectations and we still, as obviously, we said earlier, increased our guidance for the year.
I think that's sort of due to three reasons, at least as I look at it sort of big picture-wise. One, we had expected a number
of recompete activities to occur on some of our larger contracts in the year. And we bid those probably more aggressive
than the previous contract where we were the incumbent, and because these contracts are actually being protested, we
are continuing the performance on the older contracts, which are at the, if you will, the higher margin on the incumbent
contracts. So it's good for us from both a sales perspective, and more importantly on the margin side, because of that.
I think we also had better performance on sort of the close-out or transition of some of the programs that we lost. So
you should think that most of these contracts tend to have transition periods that extend for some period of time, and
we're actually performing very, very well on those transition periods, then taking some costs out as we end the program
higher than our expectations, which are resulting in higher margins.
And then the third thing I would just say is, is really just across the portfolio, strong performance by the IS&GS team,
and I think credit goes to that team. I think, it's indicative of the fact that they haven't taken their eyes off the ball. It's a
well-run organization, and the entire team understands that the mission that they perform for their customers is
important, no matter who they work for, and I think we're seeing that play out live in person in front of us here. I'll ask
Marillyn to answer the other question you asked, Rob.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Yeah. I'll pick up on the second part, where you ask about at the time of transaction, how
to think about some of the puts and takes in the head count, and how we think about it. First of all, I just want to build
on what Bruce said. I mean, this is a management team that's running a business. They've outlined some commitments
for the year, and they're performing the commitments, and the whole – entire team in IS&GS is making sure that their
cost structure is in line with the business base that they have.

So as they look at what they need to do to be competitive in a very competitive environment that they operate in, it's
ultra-competitive, and it's an area that you've got to constantly be watching your costs, and you have to manage to that.
There's close coordination with Leidos as they make head count reductions. Certainly, we have an agreement as we're
going through this process to closing the transaction. So actions that we take on the Lockheed Martin side, they're
aware that we're going to take those kinds of actions. But it is our job to continue to run the business to perform well on
the business, and it's in all of our best interests, and we will continue to do that with an excellent team that's working

Thank you. Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Thank you. A couple of questions within one, I guess. Bruce, can you talk about, only six
F-35s that were delivered in the quarter; was that your plan or was that actually below your plan?
And then on Sikorsky, can you talk about, it looks like MST that you're guiding for fairly flat EBIT from here through
the rest of the year, but I would think, as you've commented, Sikorsky is expected to get better, and whether you're still
tracking to plan for Sikorsky as a neutral to earnings in 2017? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Thanks, David. Good question. So the six F-35s, probably a little lighter than we expected,
and there's probably three or four different reasons for that, but none of them that will play out, I think, by the time we
get to the end of the second quarter. I think we'll be back on track at the end of the second quarter, and we're very much
on track to have the 53 aircraft that we talked about in the first quarter – or the last call in January, excuse me, delivered
for the year.
So no issue there, some of it was just sort of the transition between lots and getting new acceptance for new software
and the like that delayed some of the deliveries. But sort of from a production or manufacturing side, there is no issue
there. It was more of a, I'll say not quite administrative, but not a production issue there.
You talked about Sikorsky within MST, and guidance looks like sort of flat earnings for the rest of the year. That's
what we're showing, David, in the outlook there, and even with the $50 million increase in guidance from an earnings
perspective with MST, that's one that we're still watching closely. It's a little early in the year to go more than that, but I
think there is some potential upside in the numbers that we've got on the table right now. If you just do the math the
way you did it, David with including the Sikorsky uptick for the rest of the three quarters of the year, you'd kind of
come to that conclusion, I think, as well.
And then lastly, I think, the Sikorsky, you asked about Sikorsky being neutral in EPS. So all of this has to do with the
share reduction from the Reverse Morris Trust transaction and expectation of some of the bleed-off of the transition
costs or transaction costs, including the integration. That's still our expectation, David is that will be neutral going into
2017, with all the pluses and minuses going into that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, Marillyn and Bruce. Hey, Bruce, a question on kind of just a big
picture on the backlog, you closed 2015 at a record level, and then we had a little bit of a down-tick here this quarter, I
guess, timing related. On IS&GS, you're going to lose that. Is there a number that we kind of should be looking for, for
where you think backlog ends up at the end of the year? And then just, Marillyn, if I could, related to that, how are you
looking at the kind of the international front? We've seen a healthy drop in oil over the last 18 months. We haven't seen
a big impact on your awards, but just seeing if you're seeing any behavioral changes. Thanks.

<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Peter, I'll answer the backlog question. So we were down in the quarter after the record
backlog at the end of the last year. Actually we were ahead of plan in the first quarter. I think a couple of billion dollars'
worth or so. So that may not be apparent. Even though it was down, it was not down as much as what our plan had
suggested it might be.
An interesting thing we're going to have, probably a little bit of an opposite or unusual pattern to backlog this year, at
least as we see it, of the orders this year. We're probably not going to have as large a fourth quarter from an orders
perspective as we ordinarily would. The largest quarter is actually third quarter this year. And that's sort of the planning
and the biggest single ticket item there is the definitization or award of the LRIP 10 contract on F-35, and it's worth a
significant amount of money.
Depending on when that happens, and when IS&GS's disposition, we could actually see potentially $100 billion worth
of backlog that will quickly dissipate with IS&GS's disposition. And if I was to pick a number, it's probably going to be
somewhere between low-$90 billion to $95 billion by year-end is the expectation. We were sort of expecting about a –
almost $4.5 billion or so, $5 billion drop steady run rate with IS&GS in the mix, and when you take out IS&GS it gets
down to the $90-ish billion level.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: And Peter, I'll pick up on your question relative to impact of oil prices and what it might –
what we're seeing on our awards. We often talk about this, because we're trying to watch. We're not seeing pullback on
essential national security assets, and what these countries need. What we are seeing is that, there's a couple of them
that we're watching, and particularly one that's in our numbers, and that we're watching very closely is, they cut our
THAAD order because that's something that we're hoping to have in this year, and it is in our plan, if it – it could
potentially delay.
I think, it's not an indication they're not going to buy it. To me, it's just a matter of them balancing their – the pressure
on their budgets with oil prices balancing what they can buy. And I think that we'll see probably some of that – maybe
it will impact some volumes or delays in some orders.
But the bottom line is, you know the conflict in that region. You know the challenges they have from a global security
standpoint. And because they have increased security responsibility since the U.S. is not so prevalent there, they're
having to step up and buy the things that they need in order to protect their citizens. So we anticipate continued
demand. It's just a matter of, maybe some things will slip. That's not unusual in the international marketplace, even on a
good day.
I mean, we don't always see things come right online with what we anticipate, anyway because as they were dealing
with multiple procurement they may have to do it more serially sometimes and get one out of the way before they move
on to the next one, and so we have to wait through that process.

<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Sam.
<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: Can you talk a little bit about the ULA? You had said, you thought it would be flattish
this year. It looks like it was down a little in the first quarter. And at least the press talked about further head count
reduction this year, and then again next year. So trying to just think about how severance would flow through, and then
if I could just follow up with a second one. Just in your proxy, you removed the orders category from some of the
incentive comp, and just want to talk through why you would have made that change at this point?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, Sam, I'll take the ULA question. So ULA was down in the first quarter, in terms of
the equity earnings, it's purely timing. We actually expect ULA's earnings will be higher in 2016 than 2015. That's
actually the primary reason behind the guidance increase in Space Systems, is in fact because we do have a higher

expectation of ULA.
The severance charges that were taken on ULA, I don't think you'll see much impact of that in the numbers, and that's –
that's just a little bit of – you've got the severance costs offset by the lower cost, once the people are removed, and
that'll, I think at least in 2016 be somewhat neutral for the year. It's a little too early for me to call 2017, but that's the
expectation for 2016.
Orders in the proxy, we had a lot of discussion about that Sam, and we actually had – and Marillyn can comment on
this as well, obviously, but we actually had a lot of discussions with the board, and our Compensation Committee. And
the concern was that, because orders are so variable. I mean, a perfect example, perhaps is, you know you can imagine
a scenario where we had won the Bomber program in 2015, but it had been protested and pushed out in 2016. Do you
give actually someone credit for having won it? Or do you say you missed it because you didn't bring it home?
I mean, these are some of the real-life conversations that we had, and we ultimately decided that sales, earnings and
cash flow were better measures of the actual performance without the customer vagary going on there in terms of
awards.
I'll remind you also that we do have an incentive compensation metric associated with the Focus programs. And the
thought was, as long as we win the right programs, I mean, whether or not – I'll make this up – whether or not the fiscal
year LRIP 12 on F-35 happens in December or January is probably not as important as winning some of our critical
competitions. And so we decided to sort of focus more on the critical competitions as opposed to some of the timing
vagaries associated with orders that really don't influence the economics or financials of the company whether they
happen again end of this year or beginning of next year.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Let me just add to that, I think, Bruce, has covered it well, but just – if you look at how
we have outlined our incentive compensation, we have very clearly on the financials, sales orders and cash – I mean
sales eating cash, as you see, and then, where the orders come into play is in the strategic and operational area, and that
is still an element of compensation. We look at it more in terms of Focus programs, as Bruce said, or programs that we
need to continue on contract growth with and keep sold, and keep them forward.
But as we flow down those metrics throughout the organization, the individuals in the organization are still going to be
tracking their orders, they're still going to be driving to achieve levels of financial performance on the orders front. So
it's not something that we've taken out. It's just that we've looked at it more realistically on how we, what we should be
compensating for in terms of incentive compensation. And it's still an element. It's just not outlined as a digital
requirement.

Thank you. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes. Bruce, I wanted to pursue on the F-35 margin, you said last year was 10%, obviously
including the one-time catch-ups. Given that this year the profit was only up $30 million on $400 million sales
increase, obviously that relates to having lower pick-ups. Could you tell us though what the F-35 margin actually was
this year? Or maybe kind of what the run rate it's been going at?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, George, it's a little lower. I mean, the reason I highlighted the first quarter of last
year, that's probably the high point of any quarter in the history of the F-35 program. And that's to say that, that's what
we expect eventually become sort of standard practice, is that will be a double-digit program going forward just as
F-16s, F-22s, C-130s and you name the program are.
First quarter of 2016's a little less than 2015, but not much less. We still had good performance and you should think of
that as, even though the step-ups were lower, the – sort of the run rate of the programs is higher. And therefore, it's
almost comparable, but not quite to what we performed in 2016 – in 2015 in the first quarter, compared to 2016.

Run rate, as I said to the earlier question, I've lost track now who asked it, but our expectation is, we still do expect to
have margin improvement. The entire program, including the development contract, but the total F-35 program this
year in total is probably 50 basis points margins higher than it was in 2015. So again, nice progression. Not quite as
high as the 100 basis points we talked last year, but still progressing nicely, and sort of in line with what I've said all
along which is that double digit by the time we get to full rate production.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Seth M. Seifman>: Thanks very much and good morning, everyone.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning, Seth.
<Q - Seth M. Seifman>: Morning. On F-35, I think, we all understand that there's a lot of good progress that's been
made, but there's still challenges ahead. So when you think about those challenges, which we read about fairly often, if
the development portion of the program was to become extended, let's say into 2018, in terms of financial implications,
I'm guessing there's fairly little exposure to you. But are there concurrency implications to that? For example, if there
are issues that delay the program further, is the exposure for you sort of in going back into and making upgrades to
aircraft? And could you talk about how much we should be concerned about that if at all?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, let me take a shot. It's a good – really good question, Seth. And let me just give you
hopefully a thoughtful answer to your question, there. So the challenges that we have on the development program are
surely winding down as we're progressing through a lot of the changes. A lot of the, I'll say the impacts that might
result; your question sort of tallied what's going on with concurrency changes if in fact the development program is
stretched out.
Most of the structural types of testing that could result in, I'll say, large concurrency changes, we should have a really,
really good idea of where those are, probably by the end of this year or in the middle of next year. As we complete sort
of the fatigue testing and the multiple useful life testing of all three variants. I've lost track off the top of my head where
we are in progressing on that, but all three variants are well past a single useful life in terms of their durability and
we're in 150% of useful life and beyond, I believe for where we are on the testing of that.
So most of the structural items, I would say, I wouldn't expect to see huge concurrency impacts. There may be some
relative to some software changes that come out of it, relative to some testing and particularly some of the armament
testing later in the developmental program that might result in some software changes.
I don't typically view those as sort of concurrency issues. We're still on track for the IOC of the USAF later this year.
We're making really good progress on the software to accomplish that. The ALIS program is probably the other thing
that we all have our eyes on in terms of – this is the sustainment vehicle that sort of is your one-stop shop for
sustainment on the F-35 program. And the huge amount of software that we're doing there is high on our list on things
to be mindful of, but I think that's still going to support the IOC, and whatever that's scheduled, the fourth quarter or so
this year.
I'll remind you, the development contract is still cost reimbursable. And I know your question was more on the
concurrency, but we really do think most of the concurrency risk starts to fade pretty measurably, once we get past
these testings the latter part of this year, and into early 2017.

Aeronautics, but that's also where you did the head count reduction actions. So two kind of sub-part questions, one, is
that growth rate still the right growth rate to think about? And two, is this more of a reactionary head count to some of
the ongoing negotiations as it relates to F-35 and/or other internal DoD competitive pressures?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Let me try that to begin with. I'll let Marillyn chime in, Myles. So, I think, I've said publicly,
once you sort of strip out IS&GS and you sort re-baseline Lockheed Martin without IS&GS in the portfolio, I think
organically going forward you should expect us to have about 3% to 5% growth, heavily driven obviously by the F-35
program and Aeronautics in general.
Also contributing to that is across all the business areas, it may not be self-evident, because we've actually got some
DoD contraction in some of the business areas there, but our international growth is probably going to grow from 21%
or so this year to somewhere in the 25% in the not too distant future, so that's helping fuel that growth as well.
As far as the reductions, I would say, that's not because of pressure that's being put on us from a DoD perspective. If
you just think of sort of the lifecycle, and it goes back a little bit to Seth's question there, the development program is
winding down. The production program is going leaps and bounds year-over-year, and so the workforce is sort of
transitioning more from sort of an engineering-dominant workforce to more of a manufacturing-based workforce, and
we're starting to see that transition occur.
And that's what some of these reductions are for, it's simply the lower level of, sort of the development program going
down, and the higher production program increasing without the same number of heads required to support the
manufacturing growth is what we saw in the development programs, if that makes sense.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Yeah, I think you've got that right on the mark, Bruce. But to add to that, it's also
changing the nature of the work that, the indirect personnel support to that. And so, you don't need the same number of
people that are in certain roles as you move into the production phase, and you ramp up that production.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. It may not be perfectly evident, Myles, but recall, we did, we Lockheed Martin did –
were responsible for the large bulk of the development program, whereas the production program obviously is a lot
more of the supply chain, including two large partners there. So they're doing pretty good chunks of the aircraft from a
production perspective, whereas we were doing, I'll say, more of the development program as pure Lockheed Martin.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you very much. Marillyn, there's – not to kind of show off a little bit, but you
didn't mention Pakistan and F-16s, and I suspect you probably have some other opportunities there. And then in
addition to addressing that, would you also talk about a number of the items that are in the HASC mark that sure seem
to play into your wheelhouse, whether it's the F-22 restart or some new Air Defense System opportunities?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Thanks, Howard. Appreciate the question. And just from – back to your question about
F-16, I mean, we continue to look for opportunities for F-16. Certainly, Pakistan as it got through its congressional
notification, we'll look forward to the opportunity on that. Bahrain, we hopefully ultimately at some point in the future
will have an opportunity. In India we're continuing with our upgrades of the F-16, a lot of the modification work like in
Taiwan and...
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: And a potential line startage in India we talked about.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: That's right. Yeah. We talked about – that India is looking at their tactical fighter
competition, and we are in there with an offer to move our production line to India. In terms of the mark, the most
recent mark that came out of the HASC Floor, the Defense Bill, they have, as you have seen, have added 11 aircraft for
the F-35. And so we saw an increase last year in the FY 2016 omnibus. And so, seeing that coming forward is
important, there are also, a lot of our programs are well-supported just in the budget itself, and then with potential adds
as they look at additional opportunities.

On the F-22, I know there's been some discussion about a restart on the F-22. And we just stand ready to support with
whatever information we're asked to provide. You're probably aware that the [ph] two (55:17) does still exist, and so
there will be a – as most programs that you start from a cold start, I'm sure that they really want to understand the costs
associated with a cold start. But at the same time, you wouldn't want to build the same aircraft. So you'll do some
upgrades to that aircraft to modernize it, and some of the design – incorporate some of the things that we've learned
through F-35 and other programs that you can incorporate into that. So we'll stand ready to support that.
But bottom line is, I think our program's well-supported in the President's budget submission. And then I think the mark
that's going through would potentially add some additional ones for us. And we know there's a long way to go on the
budget process. It's early days and getting through that. So we'll remain hopeful that with our programs that really line
up with Department's strategic priorities, that they'll continue to be well-supported.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Yeah. Thanks. Nice quarter, guys.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Thank you, Pete.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: I appreciate the color on Sikorsky, earlier. I was just wondering if you could go farther
and update us on your expectations for – your updated expectations for intangibles amortization this year and
integrations costs, and how fast or what magnitude you expect that to kind of drop off in 2017 and 2018.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Thanks, Pete. I'll take that on. So intangibles, we've said in the January call that those
might move around. I think we have a year's time to sort of set the numbers there. I think we're real, real close. It's a
slight improvement in the intangible amortization. When I say slight improvement, it's a little bit slower or smaller
intangible amortization in 2016 than we'd originally talked about, but not enough to get too excited about, to be honest
with you.
The integration cost, I still think that the bulk of that will be completed in 2017, and still some of that might carry over
into 2018 – or excuse me, 2017 as we look forward there. I still think as we sit here today that we're tracking towards
what we talked about when we did the acquisition, which was about $150 million or so per year of steady state savings
beginning in 2018, I still think that's a good possibility that that will be the number that we're seeing then. We've got a
lot work to do between now and then, and as I said earlier, I think we're actually tracking very nicely to what our
expectations were on Sikorsky.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher>: Abigail, this is Jerry. I think we'd have time for one more question.
Operator
Our last question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Your line is open.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thanks so much. So if we can go back to the severance charge, Bruce, $99 million, can
you give us some color? How does that split between Aero and IS&G? What sort of folks did you lay off? Do you
expect to recover all of it this year? And if so, how come the guide for Aero and IS&G didn't go up by more than $25
million each?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So I think the way you should think about the severance charge, Cai, is somewhere in
the range of roughly three quarters is Aero, somewhere in the $70 million-ish and the difference – $70 million, $75
million maybe and the difference is in IS&GS. I don't have the numbers exactly to memory, Cai, but somewhere in that
range three quarters, one quarter or so.

As I've said earlier, and I think I was talking to Myles on the question on the head count reductions at Aeronautics.
Most of these are salaried folks. As Marillyn said, some of the indirect support required is no longer required to support
sort of the production ramp rate that was required to support some of the developmental work that we were doing.
Importantly, I think a big piece of the Aeronautics reduction was actually a voluntary reduction, and I think we actually
got about what we were expecting as a result of that voluntary reduction. So we're pleased with that, that people, that it
came with very few, I'll say involuntary reductions. So I think that's a good thing as well. And then as far as the
recovery of this year or not, that's still playing out.
Cai, we're trying to – I mean, I think in big picture terms that you should expect to see a somewhat neutral reaction in
2016, and there may be some benefit as depending on what the timing is of the reductions or the severance charges as
they play out that may carry them to 2017. We'll watch that closely and monitor that as we go through the next three
quarters to see if there is an impact in 2016, and if there is, we'll surely tell you about it. And if it happens in 2017, we'll
try to give you insight into that quickly as well.
Marillyn A. Hewson
So, let me conclude the call for today, and I just want to end by reiterating that the Corporation completed a very strong
first quarter. Our robust backlog coupled with an increasing DoD budget has the Corporation positioned for top line
growth, and increasing cash flows into the future.
So thank you again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in
July. Abigail, that concludes the call today.
Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You
