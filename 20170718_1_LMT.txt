With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn A. Hewson
Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today, as we review our second
quarter results and our increased outlook for 2017.
As today's release illustrates, we had strong results this quarter operationally and financially. Our strong year-to-date
financial performance also enabled us to increase our full-year 2017 guidance for sales, operating profit and earnings
per share. These results reflect a high level of execution being achieved across our businesses and providing critical
products and services to our customers while returning outstanding value to stockholders.
It was particularly noteworthy that our quarterly cash flows exceeded last year's second quarter by nearly $200 million
when we adjust for the $125 million of IS&GS cash that was included in the 2016 results. Our team continues to
progress toward our full-year objectives in growth in sales, EPS and cash from operations, and I thank our team for
their dedication to our mission.
Bruce will cover the financial results in detail a little later. However, I want to touch on two events, which occurred
after our accounting quarter closed. I'd point to the strength of our portfolio and the significant growth opportunities
they provide. First, in our Rotary and Mission Systems business area, our Sikorsky line of business secured a $3.8
billion five-year contract for 257 BLACK HAWK helicopters to be delivered to the U.S. Army, as well as to the Saudi
Arabian National Guard. This award marks Sikorsky's ninth multiple year contract with the U.S. Government that
includes options for an additional 103 aircraft bringing the potential value to over $5 billion. We are honored to have
the opportunity to continue providing rotary aircraft and support of the important missions of the U.S. Army and our
international customer.
Second, our Aeronautics business area received an F-35 award on LRIP 11, which include funding for 74 U.S. jets and
totaled nearly $5.6 billion. This brings the total quantity of U.S. aircraft authorized for LRIP 11 to 91 planes, a growth
of 36 fighter jets from the LRIP 10 U.S. Government order and represents a 65% increase from the prior lot. We
anticipate a separate award later this quarter, which will add additional aircraft for our international F-35 partners and
foreign military sales customers. The recent U.S. award demonstrates continued evidence of the strong support the F-35
has earned and we look forward to finalizing these contracts as we progress to full rate production.
Turning briefly to defense budgets. The FY 2017 DoD budget appropriations have been enacted and were consistent
with the bipartisan budget agreement of 2015, brining Defense Department base budget funding to approximately $524
billion as well as overseas contingency operations funding to about $83 billion. We're pleased to see that our programs
continue to be well-supported as seen by the legislation increasing F-35 aircraft and BLACK HAWK helicopter
quantities. The higher levels for both the base and OCO budgets reflect a growing level of bipartisan recognition of
rising global security threats and the need for additional budget resources.
The additional funding for FY 2017 will help again to address some of the acute budget needs to recapitalize our
defense assets and respond to the global security environment. Also, the President released his request for the FY 2018
DoD budget. This included $574 billion for the base budget, an increase of nearly 10% from the FY 2017
appropriations, and 3% from the prior presidential base budget submission.
Additionally, both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have released their fiscal year 2018 National
Defense Authorization Act markups, both of which greatly exceeded the President's request. And the House has since
passed their version by a wide margin. While we realize that these proposals exceed the current budget caps, we are
encouraged to see the recognition that our defense budgets require increased levels of fundings. We are hopeful that
bipartisan agreement can be reached to rescind or modify the budget caps and fund our military at the levels needed to
address the current set of world threats.

Moving on, I'd like to highlight several operational successes we achieved on our F-35 program, and then, briefly
comment on the recent historic announcements from the U.S. and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia governments to bolster
global security. The program featured two milestones that highlight the growing international nature of the Joint Strike
Fighter. The first Japanese-assembled F-35A conventional takeoff and landing variant was unveiled at the final
assembly and checkout or FACO facility in Nagoya, Japan. This aircraft marks the first of nearly 40 jets that will be
produced for the Japanese Ministry of Defense at this location.
Similarly, the first F-35B variant to be assembled outside the United States was rolled out in Italy from the Cameri
FACO facility. Cameri has already delivered multiple F-35A versions and it slated to produce over 100 aircraft in total.
Together, these two events underscore the benefits of the multinational partnerships that have been forged as we work
to provide this generation capabilities to both U.S. and coalition forces. Keeping with the F-35 program, we were also
proud to spotlight our F-35A at the Paris Air Show last month. The C12 variant performed its inaugural areal
demonstration, showcasing its aerobatic maneuvering and the jets raw power to climb and run.
I watched along with the rest of the amazed crowd at the La Borsa airport as aircraft flawlessly executed 90-degree
climbs, remarkable angle of attack displays and several unique moves that only a fifth-generation fighter could
accomplish. All of which shined a bright light on the impressive capabilities this unrivaled stealth fighter provides. As
the crowd erupted into applause, I could not have been more proud of what our Lockheed Martin team together with
the U.S. Government, the JPO Organization, international partners, industry teammates and hundreds of suppliers have
been able to accomplish.
Before I conclude, I'd like to take a moment and say a few words about the impressive announcements that President
Trump and His Majesty King Salman of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia made in Riyadh in May. As part of those
announcements, the Kingdom expressed its intent to procure more than $28 billion worth of the Lockheed Martin
products and services, including air and missile defense products, such as THAAD batteries and PAC-3 missiles,
Multi-Mission Surface Combatant Ships variants of our Littoral Combat Ship, C-130J aircraft and various other
defense-related capabilities and solutions.
These announcements reflect the strength of the relationship that our Corporation has built with the kingdom over the
past 50 years. In addition, the requests touch each of our four business areas, demonstrating the breadth and depth of
our offerings and the growth potential that our portfolio brings.
Finally, I would like to acknowledge our Space Systems team as they mark the one-year anniversary of the Juno
spacecraft orbiting the planet Jupiter. Images from the Juno orbiter graced the cover of the May issue of Science
magazine, delivering breathtaking views of the giant planet's Polar region.
The mission also included measurements of the magnetic and gravitational fields and unique perspectives on the
atmospheric and weather environments of Jupiter's surface. Scientists are excited at the initial in-depth results being
provided, as well as with the potential new discoveries that may be made in the upcoming experiments.
We believe our continuous commitment to innovation and our long-term partnership with NASA have contributed to
these remarkable achievements and we are proud to be a part of this ambitious undertaking.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our second quarter financial performance in more detail and then we'll
open up the line for your questions.
Bruce L. Tanner
Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning everyone. I'll be making remarks based on the Web charts that we included with
our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results. We're pleased with our performance
in the quarter. Sales of $12.7 billion were slightly ahead of our expectations and showed solid growth over last year's
results. Our operating profit and earnings per share results were also ahead of our expectations, while cash from
operations was in line with what we were expecting. We continued our strong cash deployment actions and we

increased our full-year outlook for sales, operating profit and earnings per share. So we had a very solid second quarter
and a nice rebound from some of the performance issues we had in the first quarter.
On Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the second quarter of this year with last year's
results. Sales were $1.1 billion higher this quarter compared with the last year, with most of that growth coming from
the Aeronautics and Space Systems business areas. Aeronautics growth was driven by higher volume from the F-35 and
C-130 programs and an additional C-5 delivery this quarter compared with last year. Space Systems growth was driven
by the inclusion of the atomic weapons establishment sales in the quarter, compared with none in the second quarter of
last year.
Segment operating profit was $55 million higher this quarter compared to last year. This was driven by higher volume
and improved performance for the F-35 program in Aeronautics, improved performance across multiple lines of
business within RMS, and these were partially offset by lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance and Space
Systems.
Turning to Chart 5, we'll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. EPS from continuing operations of $3.23 was
about 10% higher than the results from a year ago, reflecting both higher operating earnings and lower share count this
year compared with last year.
On Chart 6, we'll compare our cash from operations this quarter versus our results from 2016. We generated more than
$1.5 billion of cash in the quarter, over $70 million more than we did in the second quarter of last year. But as Marillyn
said in her remarks, that understates our relative performance as last year's results included around $125 million of cash
generated by IS&GS which was not divested until August of last year.
On a year-to-date basis, our $3.2 billion of cash generated is also about $70 million higher than our results from the
first half of 2016, but last year's amount included nearly $300 million of cash generated by IS&GS.
Chart 7 shows the cash returned to stockholders in the quarter. Subtracting capital expenditures in the quarter from our
cash from operations, our free cash flow was just under $1.3 billion and we returned slightly more than $1 billion to
stockholders, about equally split between share repurchases and dividends. This cash deployment represents 81% of
our free cash flow in the quarter.
On Chart 8, we want to make you aware of two large awards that took place shortly after the end of the quarter that are
not reflected in our reported backlog level. The largest award was for the F-35 LRIP 11 UCA for domestic aircraft that
Marillyn mentioned and was worth $5.6 billion. The second award was for the Multi-Year IX by BLACK HAWK
helicopters and was worth $3.8 billion. Both of these awards occurred within two weeks after the quarter close and
their combined values would have pushed our backlog above $100 billion for the quarter had they occurred just a few
days earlier.
Chart 9 provides our updated outlook for the year. We increased sales by $300 million, with all of that increase coming
from the Space Systems business, due to the higher volume we're seeing this year. We increased segment operating
profit by $35 million, with $20 million of the increase coming from our Aeronautics business and $15 million from
Space Systems. Aeronautics increase recognizes better than planned performance so far this year, while the Space
Systems increase is primarily volume-driven.
We had an improvement in our unallocated costs worth $25 million, driven mostly by a reduction to a previously
established reserve. With these improvements in our operating profit, we increased our earnings per share by $0.15 and
lastly, we are maintaining our cash from operations outlook at equal to or greater than $6 billion.
Chart 10 and Chart 11 show our revised outlooks by business area for both sales and segment operating profit. I
covered the revisions in the outlook in the prior discussion.
Chart 12 provides a reconciliation of our prior EPS outlook to our current outlook. The $35 million increase in segment
operating profit increases our expected EPS by about $0.10 while the $25 million decrease in unallocated expense
improves EPS by around $0.05, resulting in a revised outlook for the year of $12.30 to $12.60. This new range is higher
than the guidance we provided when we began this year, more than offsetting the setbacks we experienced in the first

quarter.
Finally, we have our summary on Chart 13. Our quarterly results for sales, profit, EPS and cash from operations were
all either in line or ahead of our expectations. That resulted in the increased outlook that we just discussed. We are well
positioned to achieve our full year goals and as we look ahead to the third quarter earnings call, we'll provide our initial
trend information for 2018. As a reminder, the new revenue recognition rule will be effective for us starting in January
and will be incorporated into our trend information.
With that, we're ready for your questions. John?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we do ask if you please limit yourself to one question and feel free to re-queue
for additional question as time permits. First from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Sam.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: Bruce, always a lot of focus on the cash flow and there's been a lot of discussion about
capital spending at various defense contracts. Your CapEx is certainly up over the last few years and up year-over-year.
How should we think about that in future years and what's going to dictate that? Is this F-35 volume? Are there contract
wins or losses like T-X, what's going to dictate kind of the levels of CapEx we see over the next few years?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yes, Sam thanks for the question. It's a good question. As we looked at our long-range
planning from last year, that covers basically 2017, 2018 and 2019. 2017 is sort of the peak in terms of the capital
expenditures for the Corporation. That reflects a number of things, some restructuring that we're doing within our
Space Systems business, moving some of the work around within locations, within Space Systems and it also reflects
the sort of the last tranche of investments required to get the F-35 sort of fully capitalized. It increased in, I'll say,
between 2015 and maybe years prior to going forward because we added Sikorsky into the portfolio, which obviously
has higher capital expenditure requirements than the IS&GS business, which really had practically immaterial capital
expenditure requirements. So, if you start to sort of think of 2017 as sort of being the high point, at least as we look at it
today, going forward, we'd expect that number to slightly decrease going forward. And within that slight decrease
going forward, there are some requirements for additional new capital for some of the wins, one of which you
described in your question, but that's sort of more than offset by the reductions in the other capital expenditures
required, including F-35.

Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey Noah.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Bruce, how should we think about Aeronautics organic revenue growth in 2018 just because
now you're going to have a pretty tough sort of just growth comparison? You'll have more F-35 growth, but you had
mentioned before other aircraft in the segment being headwinds, not sure if those have moved around. And then, if you
could just perhaps tie that into – a few quarters ago, you had talked about kind of staying in the 3% to 5% total

company growth range, but 2018 maybe being at the low end of that. Just wanted to check back in, if that was still sort
of the case. Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yes. Thanks, Noah. So, Aero's organic growth, I think what I said previously or what you
said that I said previously in earlier quarters still is true today. We're still looking out – I'll probably answer your
second question first. We're still looking at the total company about the 3% to 5% growth going forward and 2018 is a
little less than that and actually 2019, as we sit here today, it probably picks back up and a lot of that is because, as to
your first quarter, in 2018, we're actually seeing a drop off because we have the end of the F-16 production line at least
are based on current orders at the end of our – close to the end of 2017, we had no new production of F-16s planned for
2018 as we sit here today and that's not in the numbers that we've talked about previously.
We also have the end of the C-5 program in the early part of 2018, and so those two events are kind of bringing down
Aeronautics organic growth. You're still seeing tremendous growth potential in both the production and sustainment
programs for Aeronautics for the F-35 program. But the other two are slightly, as I said, dissipating some of that
growth. And that's one of the reasons why in 2019, we kind of bounced back as we're operating off of a lower compare,
if you will, in 2018.
Operator
Our next question is from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. I want to change a little bit from operations, talk strategy for a
moment, and there's two things related. One, Marillyn you've started to make some investments outside of your core
that look like they're complementary and maybe you could address that and talk about how significant a commitment it
could be. And then related to that, is from a longer term point of view, you have to think about people and what are
going on there and how do you think about succession planning?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Excellent questions, Howard. Thanks a lot, both of which I spend a lot of time on, on a
regular basis. So, thank you for the question. From the strategy standpoint, our focus is on growth, we've been very
clear about that. We think we've got a lot of opportunities to continue to grow. We see our international growth
increasing from what today is about – in 2016 was about 27% of our sales growth to 30% and we'll continue to see that
growth. The demand around the world is high for not only F-35, but missile defense, one of our F-16 C-130s, other
defensive systems that we have as well as our opportunities in Space-based situation awareness, et cetera, so that
growth.
We have been – in terms of your comment about outside our core of the complementary, I would say that our
commercial satellites, our commercial helicopters, work that we're dealing with the LM-100J, which is the commercial
version of the C-130, those are absolutely areas to move in commercial, but very closely aligned. And then of course,
the hybrid airship is another opportunity for us.
So those all are in line with our core competencies and our capabilities, but moving into some of the – more into a
commercial space and aligning with that. Long term, we're always focused on our talent management, our talent of
development, it is an ongoing part of our business. And in terms of succession planning, as you look at the leadership
team that we have at Lockheed Martin, very seasoned, very strong talented team that is – that I'm really proud to be a
part of the team and working collectively with them on how we're executing our strategy for the Corporation. But at all
times, we're looking at building that pipeline of talent into the business.
And yes, we also look at that talent from the standpoint of its diversity. And so I'm proud to say that 21% of our leaders
are women and we continue to bring more talent in from that regard. So succession planning is something that we
continue to look at as a company and it's an ongoing effort for us. Thanks for the question.

And next, we go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Rob.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: I wanted to ask, as you go into next year and we think about going back to the cash flow,
Sam asked about the CapEx and you talked, I think, at the tail end of last quarter about trying to, ex-pension
contribution, perhaps cash flow could be – operating cash flow could be flattish with this year. Bruce, does that still
work with the multi-year on the BLACK HAWK and the quantity adjustments that are happening there and any other
new incremental information that we have since last time?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: I think the answer is no. It doesn't change, Rob, as far as our thinking is concerned relative to
the way you've described 2018. Sans pension contribution, I would expect the operating cash flow for the Corporation
to look pretty similar to this year and again, we've talked about after those pension contributions both in 2018 and
2019. But if you add the cash from those years along with 2017, we expect to be in excess of $15 billion. We're off to a
great start obviously this year in 2017 and we'll give you more insight into what we're looking for 2018 and maybe a
little beyond as we'd talk to you on the next quarter call.

Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: I just want to maybe talk about some business opportunities, the first of which would be the
T-X and JSTARS. How's that going and when would you expect a decision made on those?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Sure. I'll take those. We're looking at where the air force is and T-X and JSTARS, they're
looking at. They've set an award in the fourth quarter this year. Obviously, we never know until they actually do it, and
so we could do it, but that's what they've outlined as the fourth quarter of 2017 for JSTARS and T-X.
And then, we see some other nearer-term awards that we're hoping to see in September, October timeframe, ones like
the Special Operations Forces, Global Logistic Support Services that we're an incumbent on that today and that's being,
it's in competition, and we hope to see that award. It's got a total program value with options of up to $8 billion. Our
Ground Based Strategic Defense is another one that we would look to have to see an award coming here in the fourth
quarter. And we're hoping as we look at the Saudi operations, the opportunity that we have there that potentially we
could see a THAAD award sometime late in the year or early next year.
And then another would be LRSO, the Long-Range Standoff missile that is also looking at September timeframe, and
let's see, another would be the Saudis are looking at getting the search and rescue an S-70i Helicopter award that we
expect in the September timeframe as well. So, several awards in the near time. I think, I rattled off six or seven of
them just there, and so we're excited. And Bruce, you have some other thoughts?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Just maybe one to address the question at the start of your question, Ron, you should think the
most of these as we've already submitted the proposal, so you sort of asked what's the status. Well, the status is I think
we're all sort of waiting and for the most part, the government is evaluating ours along with everyone else's proposal
and we said anxiously waiting to see the results of that. But there's not much we can do at this point as I said, because
almost every one of the ones that Marillyn, if not all of them, that Marillyn just rattled off are, we've already submitted
the proposals for those.

<Q - Finbar Thomas Sheehy>: And hi, it's Finbar Sheehy for Doug. In your press release, you talked about higher
sustainment activities in the quarter for the F-35. Can you talk to us about how big those are now relative to total F-35
revenues and how you expect that's going to evolve over the next few years, maybe how big a percentage of F-35
revenues will sustainment be, say, by the end of the decade? And how do the margins on sustainment compare to the
incremental margins you're getting now on new aircraft?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yes. I'll try that, Finbar. So sustainment is growing fairly rapidly, I mean, I want to say it's
not quite growing this year at the same pace as is production, but it's growing dramatically over last year's numbers. I
mean, you should think of this as in the sort of high-teen sorts of number. So it's growing incrementally and it will
continue to do that for a number of years as we set up more and more basis both around the United States, but as well
internationally as internal customers start letting down the aircraft in their home locations. So that growth is going to
continue. I don't have the exact split, but I want to say if you look at sustainment out of the total of F-35 production, I
want to say it's probably 20%-25% as large as the production volume on an annual basis, something like that, and it
stays at those sorts of levels for the next few years. So, as production grows over the next couple years to its peak when
we hit full rate production, I would expect that the sustainment will sort of follow suit there.
And then your last question, Finbar was relative to the margins and how we do on sustainment contracts, and I'd tell
you, we do about the same on the F-35 sustainment as we do on production. That might change somewhat in the future
going forward, but at least historically and where we sit today, they're pretty comparable without a whole lot of
difference between.

Next, we'll go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seth M. Seifman>: Thanks very much and good morning. I wanted to ask about the SAR that came out last week
and the change in the key quantity of the Air Force buy in the out years and it came down from 80 to 60, but we're
talking about numbers that are pretty far out there in 2022 to 2023 timeframe. But I'm wondering how you're looking at
that. What implications you think it might have, whether it's a change that you expect to kind of stick around?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: I'll take that, Seth, thanks for the question. I would just say, first off, we haven't really
seen the SAR. I mean we know that it's been submitted to Congress. We know there's been sort of top-level readout
from the JPO of a fact sheet that came out on it and thinking that the Joint Program Office highlighted the fact that the
reason that the numbers were changing were predominantly due to a change in the procurement profile of the Air Force
jets, which is the largest volume buyer for the Air Force. I know that in my discussions with the Air Force, there is a
desire to buy as many as they can as quickly as they can. So, I haven't got an official position from them that they've
reduced their procurement profile, that just happens to be what's in that select acquisition report that came out. I mean,
certainly, lots of opportunity to change the quantities, as you can see just with, let's say, on the budget deliberations
right now with the ads that are coming forward on the F-35 for the various services. We'll still see potentially some
upside on it. So that would be my take. Bruce, anything you want to add?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: The other thing I might offer just for a little bit of a perspective. I think you had it right, Seth,
in that the plan peak volumes for the USAF are sort of far out there right now, just to give you some perspective on
that. We're still in discussions with the Joint Program Office relative to a potential block buy and the numbers that have
been thrown out for that block buy, and this is just again to put some perspective over three LRIPs, is between 440 and
think of it as 450 or so aircraft over that three-year LRIP period. So nearly 150 aircraft per year. And that's what we're
talking about for LRIPs 12, 13, and 14, so these are literally right around the corner.

That's a 150 aircraft with the USAF buying 48 aircraft in each of those three fiscal years. So the cut to 80 to 60, we're
not even approaching the 60 yet. And we're building aircraft at quantities of a 150 per fiscal year. So as Marillyn said, a
lot of opportunities to change quantities between now and then. And it'd be interesting once we do see the full SAR
report, how much of that was sort of budgetarily-driven with the potential to change that budget that far out versus, I'll
say, a quantity difference. And if I read the fact sheet right, actually, from the JPO, I think the actual total quantity of
U.S. Government buys for F-35s went up coincidently enough by about 13 aircraft for additional Marine Corps buy. So
pushing out to the right, but again, as Marillyn said, lots of opportunity to change those values between now and then.

Our next question's from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Can you hear me?
<A - Greg M. Gardner>: Barely, George. Try it again.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. On the F-35, the incremental margin was 17%. So did you increase the margin on
the LRIP 9 or LRIP 10 or both? And then also, the deliveries were flat with last year and down from Q1. So I would
think that we'd be starting to see increases here given the deliveries are going to be higher. So what's happening there?
Thanks.
<A - Greg M. Gardner>: Yes.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: George, I'll try those. So incremental margins, I didn't do the calculation that you just cited.
But you're probably right. Your math's always good, George. And we did have a couple of pickups. I think we actually
– you ask which specific LRIP, we had some risk retirements or step-ups, and we actually had – I want to say three
separate LRIPs, and you should think of these as somewhat older LRIP contracts or LRIP numbers, I believe two of
those three were LRIPs 5 and LRIP 7. So this is sort of reflecting the fact that we're closing out or getting ready to close
out some of those lots. The ones you talked about, the more current ones, Lot 9 and so forth and Lot 10, we're getting
good performance on those, but that's probably step-ups that we look forward to in the coming years or coming quarters
as opposed to this quarter here.
And as far as deliveries, George, the way I look at that, I think we're planning 66 aircraft to be delivered for the year.
And what may not be clear in that number is only the biggest lion's share of that, 61 of those are being delivered out of
Fort Worth. The other five are going to be delivered out of the international locations that Marillyn talked about, the
FACO in Nagoya, Japan, and the other FACO in Italy.
So none of those five aircrafts have yet to deliver, although they've rolled out as Marillyn said. So all those are out in
front of us. And as you look at where we ended the first half of the year, we'd actually delivered 29 aircraft. That
number is a little deceptive, because we closed the quarter actually on June 25 as opposed to the end of the month. And
we actually had some deliveries between then and the end of the month.
As we sit here today, George, I want to say we've delivered 34 aircraft so far. And I think we're on track to deliver 36
by the end of this month. So we're actually progressing. It's actually right on track on the domestic deliveries. And we
do expect those five international deliveries to all take place in the second half. So short said, I think we're tracking to
our expectations relative to 66 aircraft for the year.

Our next question is from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Yeah, I had a further F-35 and Aeronautics margin question.
Bruce, it seems like the F-35 has been less of the headwind maybe than you expected going into this year. And I know
some of it's on better performance at the international facilities and whatnot. But as you look out into 2018, it will be a
bigger part of the mix F-35, Aeronautics. Do you have any confidence [indiscernible] (39:33) to say that this year is the
trough for Aeronautics margin and we'll start to expand as we go out on higher F-35, or is there still some uncertainty
in some of the latest LRIP lots?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Just to be clear, Pete, you're talking about trough for Aeronautics or a trough for F-35 –
you're talking about Aeronautics, I presume right?
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Correct. Correct.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. I'm not sure I want to call that in this quarter, Pete. I feel a whole a lot better. We do
our planning between now and the third quarter. And when we give you the trend information in 2018 I will surely
address that then. But I don't think your question is that far off the market. If the answer is not – yeah, that's probably
where we'd expect the trough, but the answer is it's probably pretty close to that; maybe 2018, but we'll take a look at
that when we give you the trend information in October.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Great. Fair enough. Thank you.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. I should say, in any event, we would still expect there or even if it was a trough, I don't
see it dropping below 10%. The only question is we've had some, to your point, some pickups earlier this year is can
we match that next year going forward, but again, I'll give you a lot more insight on that in the October call. Thanks.
Operator
Next we'll go to David Strauss with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Hi, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Bruce, I guess, first a clarification, the 3% to 5% revenue growth and talking about maybe
being at the lower end of that in 2018, does that include the change in revenue recognition? That's the clarification.
And then thinking about cash conversion, free cash conversion over the next couple of years, you've obviously got
pension cash moving down, but then, as we look out towards the end of the decade, you have – your FAS expense is
going to come down. Could you just talk about the progression of how you're seeing free cash flow conversion over the
next maybe towards the end of the decade? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. David, I'm actually glad you asked that clarification on the 3% to 5% [audio gap]
(41:44) sort of based on current rev-rec methodology. Although – we'll give more information on this when we have
the results or when we give the trend information in October. But at least preliminarily [audio gap] (42:00) in
anticipation of that rev-rec change, we're kind of – obviously running rev-rec in addition to the normal methodology for
the first quarter and second quarter. I haven't seen the second quarter results yet. But so far everything is indicating that
you would think we shouldn't see a whole lot of difference.
And part of the reason for that is a lot of the units of delivery, or what we call POT, passage on title transfer where we
essentially record sales upon delivery. As long as you're delivering at a constant rate and the program is not at the end
of its life, if you will, then you wouldn't expect to see a large swing even when you convert it over to percentage of cost
or cost-to-cost methodology. And that's sort of our expectation. We don't see a large drop-off, or a large increase, or a
decrease in our POT deliveries there.

So most importantly, on our rev-rec, F-35 does not change one bit. And that's obviously the biggest driver of
Aeronautics, and for that matter, sales for the corporation. So I'm hopeful, having said that, David, that the 3% to 5%
works under either methodology; the current methodology or the new rev-rec methodologies is what I'm trying to say.
And we'll see what that looks like when we provide the trend information in 2018 as I keep saying.
Relative to the free cash flow conversion, we teed this up in the past, David. You and I've had a couple of conversations
on this. I think we talked about FAS income; you brought that up in 2020. The 2020 timeframe is the end of the
accruals relative to our pension trust going forward. So essentially, the trust becomes completely froze at that point in
time. And because you lose the service cost, we actually end up getting FAS income in that point in time.
As far as cash is concerned, we will expect to see cash contribution, the ERISA contributions continue to increase
through that period of time, but we would also expect to see CAS recoveries in our price, then our government
contracts increase by about a similar amount. So we still expect to have a tailwind associated with pension, cash and
free cash flow, literally going out, I think, is still consistent with what we showed maybe as much as a year ago. All the
way out through 2025 at least as we sit here today, we expect to have some tailwinds from pension dynamics relative to
our cash flow going forward. And that's still what we see today.

Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you very much. So since your first quarter, it looks like your foreign sales
prospects have improved. Can you update us in terms of what you're looking for for book-to-bill this year and then
color on next year? And secondly, you mentioned lot of the foreign potentials, you didn't mention some of the NATO
missile defense potentials such as Romania, Sweden for the Patriot System and MEADS. Thank you very much.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Cai, I'll take a shot at that and Marillyn can add some color to it, if she wants to. So relative to
the first question and how we're doing, we're actually tracking, I'll say, at or better than plan relative to international
orders to-date. I don't want have necessarily the book-to-bill for the year, but trying to this math in my head, I think,
we're slightly ahead of book-to-bill as we sit here today, meaning international orders are higher than the international
sales to-date.
I would expect that to be the case at the end of the year. A lot of that obviously is predicated on whether or not we get
the first tranche of the KSA, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia orders that Marillyn talked about those $28 billion worth of
orders. There's a potential that some of those can come in between now and the end of the year. It's not obviously clear
that they will. There's obviously some Congressional notifications and the like that has to take place and getting the
funding in place to do that, but there is that possibility.
Now, even without that, I still think we'll probably be – probably in a positive situation book-to-bill because we don't
have the sales for that either for our international business there. So having said that, as we look out in the future, and
you didn't ask this question, Cai, but we still think we've got a chance to end the year potentially at around a $100
billion of backlog as some of these – especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia orders come in this year as opposed to
next year. But even without that, $95 billion to $100 billion is probably what we're expecting. And again, more on the
international side than the sales for the year, so positive book-to-bill.
You asked about the air missile defense, we're still in conversations with Germany right now on the MEADS
opportunity there. There is a stated objective to get that negotiation complete by the end of this year. We'll see if that
actually closes in. But, if not then, I would hope that that closes at least in the early part of 2018. Obviously, there's
Poland with the Patriot sale and we'll do a lot of the PAC-3 – all of the PAC-3 missiles associated with that sale. You
mentioned some other NATO countries, I'll let Marillyn maybe jump in and give me a little more insight than I can
provide to you.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Sure. You mentioned Poland, Romania and others, of course, we have Aegis Ashore,
which is U.S. system that's been placed in Europe, but that's an opportunity. Missile defense, there is a strong demand

in Europe as well as in other parts of the world, Asia Pacific and Middle East where we continue to see opportunities.
JASSM, there was an opportunity from the standpoint of Poland, and you're exactly right. There continues to be in the
NATO environment, missile defense opportunities for us to continue to meet as well as for other parts of the world.
And yes, I think as we have recently done, the THAAD test out of Alaska; that was a very successful test. In fact, 14
out of 14 on THAAD, one that I'm sure that many countries took a look at it at the successful capability of that to take
out a ballistic missile. And so that being an opportunity that we've talked about that currently in South Korea protecting
that area in Guam, but certainly Japan and other countries will continue to look at THAAD as a capability in the
European market as well.

Our next question is from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Good morning. On Space, you raised the sales guidance there, I'm just
curious with your outlook for Space in general going to Q1 2017 where the uptick was coming from? And then, if
2018, this gives you an indication that it's actually got some growth in it? And then, conversely, the incremental
margins [indiscernible] (49:51) 5% incremental margins, is that just to absorb the commercial satellite charges or
something else? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. I'll try those, Myles. So, yeah, we're pleased with where Space is setting this year in
terms of sales. As I said in the prepared remarks, it's a little higher than our expectations when we – obviously, we
increased the guidance for the year. It's a little higher than what we expected when we started the year. I do think that
pertains well for 2018 growth. And there's some of that coming from our special programs business. And there's some
opportunities there that we have to see how they play up that will drive that either higher or not as high depending on
the outcome of those opportunities.
And then relative to the incremental margin, you have that right, Myles, and that is reflective of the fact that some of
that volume was offset by the commercial satellite charge that we did take in the quarter. And that's probably worth
talking maybe a little about not only because that sounds like a bad item to have a charge on the commercial satellite.
But this is really taking our old legacy A2100 satellite bus, which we've had for a number decades and really providing
a technology refresh of that legacy satellite.
So it's updating it to the current state-of-the-art; we're putting a whole lot of new technologies and capabilities into it
everything from power capabilities and increases to the propulsion on the satellite, the electronics; we've got a new
solar array, new power regulator. So a lot of different items all being put together. And unfortunately, the satellite
where this happened to be the first article for production was the largest commercial satellite we ever built or will have
ever built.
And so – well, that's the bad news. The good news is, is this new configuration satellite has already resulted in new
orders from the U.S. Government. And I look at it this as something that we had to do. We had to refresh that product
line. And while I'd prefer it not to be on a fixed price commercial international contract to have to cut your teeth on,
we're glad that we're doing this now because this will position us to have a foundation for new satellite offerings
hopefully for years to come.

Next we'll go to Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph DeNardi>: Yeah. Thanks very much. Bruce, wondering if you just talk about capital deployment from a
leverage standpoint, are you comfortable with where you are now and we should just assume that all of the free cash
flow gets spilt up between the buyback and dividend, or do you see some deleveraging over the next year or two?

<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: So good question, Joe. That's something we're – we obviously talk every September with our
board relative to future deployment actions, relative to dividends. But before that session, before we have those
discussions and we discuss that strategic view with our board of directors, I'll say the expectation is more of the same in
terms of our deployment actions.
We do have some nearer term debt retirements coming up, starting in 2018, that's something that we'll guide you
towards relative to the trend information in 2018 as far as our thinking relative to refinancing that or paying that off.
But our expectation is we'd probably do some deleveraging, as I said here today going forward in near term, those
aren't huge chunks of debt; but some of these frankly, they're very short-term financing that we did actually to finance
the Sikorsky transaction.

Next we'll go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yeah. Good morning, Marillyn and Bruce.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Peter.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Hi.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Bruce, just sticking on Sikorsky, which you just mentioned, total military helicopter deliveries
were down about 18% year-to-date. How are you thinking about that for the balance of the year? And then, in the
context of obviously the new Multi-Year with U.S. Army and Saudi, how should we think about the government
deliveries going forward?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So good question, Peter. That's actually something I looked at as I was prepping for the
call also as the first half deliveries of BLACK HAWKs are down and at least as I pulse that with our team at RMS that
that really is just because of the timing of the contract deliveries in the current Multi-Year VIII BLACK HAWK order
profile. Even though we're down, as you pointed out, relative to last year, the expectation is that we still expect to
actually deliver more BLACK HAWKs this year than we did last year, just not a huge number, just a handful there.
But we would expect to catch up and actually have showed a sequential growth in BLACK HAWK deliveries with the
fourth quarter obviously being the highest by quite a bit relative to the first quarter; a little bit of a different pattern than
what we saw in 2016. But that is the contractual pattern. And I didn't look close enough to see if that's because of the
types of aircrafts we have. We have some MEDEVAC helos versus utility helicopters. And that might be part of it as
well. But all sort of expected and that is the plan going forward against to finish the year higher than we did this year.
You also asked about – well, the another part of your question, Peter. I think you asked about 2018 and relative to the
Multi-Year IX. The Multi-Year IX I think – and I haven't got my head exactly around the deliveries next year, but I
think they're fairly comparable; maybe a little less than this year, but not hugely less. Alternatively, as we look forward,
the bigger drop-off frankly is in the Romeo helicopters, these are the Naval Hawk helicopters, if you will. That's
coming to a much lower number of production aircraft delivery like maybe by a third or so or more reduction next year.
So the one thing that we're watching to see if we can get some rebound on that is from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
one of the items that was in that – actually two of the items that was in that $28 billion that Marillyn referenced before
was for additional BLACK HAWKs on top of what's in the Multi-Year IX BLACK HAWK deal today and an
additional or additional Romeos or the Naval Hawk helicopters as well. So those have got to sort out.
And again, the timing of that, Peter, is what we're watching very, very closely to see whether or not those orders come
in this year, the early part of next year, but we're hopeful they can bud up against the Multi-Year IX deliveries we're
talking about.

And that will be from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Jason.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Hey, guys. Marillyn, I want to ask you about the company's supply chain, your strategy there.
You've spoken in the past about the need for Lockheed and its suppliers to focus on two things, affordability and cyber
security, essentially to ensure continuity. Can you just provide us a bit of an update on the company's effort to drive
affordability out of the supply chain and is your strategy continuing to evolve there? You're looking to maybe vertically
integrate a little bit more than where you've been in the past. And as you look out at things, how far along do you think
you are in accomplishing your near- to medium-term goals on affordability?
And then on the cyber security front, how do you view the health of the industry overall at this point and what's
Lockheed and the rest of the industry currently doing to improve the cyber security to help with the supply chain?
Thanks.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Thanks, Jason. Those are great questions. If you look at our supply chain, it represents
60%, sometimes 70% of the revenue on many of our programs. It's a very important element of our business in terms of
our execution on programs, performance on programs, as well as what we're able to financially accomplish with those
programs. So that's a great question.
On the affordability front, I would just start with our largest program, which is the F-35, and representing last year
about 23% of our sales. So we put a lot of effort into that piece of it. And collectively, with our teammates – the major
teammates with Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems, we worked together on something we call – that the
government calls the blueprint for affordability where we actually put funding upfront, working not just with the three
teammates Lockheed Martin, BAE and Northrop Grumman, but all the way through our supply chain on identifying
areas where we could invest, continue to drive the cost down on the F-35 beyond what you would normally get through
a ramp-up of production and the volume.
And we'll continue to do that. We're also doing that on the sustainment side. So we look at where are the cost reduction
initiatives that we can put in place there that would continue to drive the cost down. But we work with supply chain
affordability every day on all of our programs. I feel really good about our affordability initiatives in that regard. Our
teams that work directly with our subcontractors, with our suppliers, that is one of their primary efforts and ones that
working alongside them they're constantly focused on.
The other thing I would say is where we have a big opportunity on F-35 is through the block buy because that's where
we can get the volume reduction, that's where we can get suppliers that they know they're going to get three lots worth
of work, 450 airplanes and plus then they can invest in driving the cost down. They can commit to although were
priced to us on their element of the system. But bottom line is we look all the way across our supply chain on ongoing
basis and are constantly driving.
In terms of vertical integration, I think it's really just driven on a case-by-case basis where it makes sense. If we're
assuming that we think we have the capability inside Lockheed Martin that we could do at less cost and more – better
technology then we might look at some vertical integration there or through an acquisition that gives us the opportunity
to do that. But generally speaking, we're mainly focused on the affordability and the performance of our supply chain
on an ongoing basis.
You asked a question about cyber security and the health of the industry and what are we doing on that front. I would
just speak to it from the Lockheed Martin standpoint. We recognize that the supply chain is, it's critically important that
they have in place appropriate cyber defenses in their business. And so we have worked with the Department of the
Commerce and the National Institute of Standards to help put in place voluntary initiatives that in frameworks that
work with supply chain on how they can get in place appropriate defenses. We will then audit and monitor what our

supply chain our suppliers have in the way of cyber security defenses on an ongoing basis. And we actually work with
our customer.
Our customer often looks to us for the depth and capability we have in cyber security. It is a line of business for us. We
do it for many customers and supporting them. And we likewise take that same capability and try to work it back
through the supply chain as well.
In terms of the health of the industry, I think it's an ongoing effort that we've got to constantly stay focused on as a
nation. The threats are constantly changing or there is always an unpredictability in the sense, but we have been a
thought leader and an industry leader in cyber security for many years.
In fact, we have the National Cyber Range where – we developed that and where our government customers and others
can bring their solutions and touch them on this National Cyber Range to determine whether that brings the kind of
defenses that they're are looking for, that they expect. And so I would say across the board, cyber has been an area for
us that is in everything that we do across the system, it runs through all of our programs. We have a robust capability to
provide the customers and we work hard with our supply chain to make sure that they get the right defenses in their
own networks on ongoing basis. Thank you.

So I think that was the last question, Greg. Let me just wrap up and conclude the call today. I want to conclude by
restating that our second quarter results and our increased 2017 outlook reflect that we have an ongoing commitment to
our strategy for growth, strong cash generation and we continue to deliver innovative solutions for our customers and
long-term value creation for our stockholders. We're very pleased with the solid results that we had for the quarter. I
want to thank you all for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking with you on the next earnings
call in October.
So, John, that concludes our call today.
