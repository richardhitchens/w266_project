Before Ursula begins, I'd like to remind everyone that as a result of the pending sale announced on December 18 of our
ITO business to Atos, and having met applicable accounting requirements, Xerox is now reporting the ITO business as
a discontinued operation. We'll be reporting today our Q4 and full-year 2014 results on a continuing operations basis.
Prior period results have been revised to reflect this change, details of which can be found on our Investor Relations

Ursula?
Ursula M. Burns
Thanks, Jim. Good morning, and thanks for joining our call. Today we are reporting fourth quarter and full-year 2014
earnings.
A lot has happened in the last 90 days, and overall we are pleased with where we ended the year. We're reporting solid
results that in some places exceeded expectations. I'll give a quick overview of our financials, provide some perspective
on the year, and share updates on key initiatives contributing to our results before turning it over to Kathy to go into
more detail on the financials.
We delivered strong profit and cash for the year and we closed strong in Services revenue and margin. Services revenue
growth improved through the year and we saw improved margin performance. Services signings increased as well,
driven by renewals in BPO and we ended the year with strong Document Outsourcing signings of over a $1 billion. In
fact, our Canadian operation closed its largest ever multimillion-dollar MPS deal with the Government of Canada in
November.
In Document Technology, we delivered strong margin throughout the year, reflecting both our continued focus on
profitability, as well as a favorable environment. And for the fifth consecutive year, we are the leader in equipment sale
revenue. Demand has been strong for our iGen and the new Versant products in the U.S. and Europe. These products
provide our graphic communications customers with the ability to produce digital color prints at scale with a high level
of personalization, quality and reliability.
As you know, Xerox has been focusing on the segments where we have the most competitive advantage and we've
been steadily shifting our portfolio mix. As an example, we announced the pending divestiture of our ITO business
through a sale to Atos. This will allow us to focus squarely on business process services and Document Outsourcing,
and provide additional capacity to invest further in these businesses. We've aligned our Services go-to-market model
into a set of industry teams, and our delivery model along functional capabilities such as customer care, human
resources, consulting and analytics, and transaction processing.
We've made progress improving our government healthcare business, and in 2014, we committed resources to maturing
our MMIS enterprise platform. While we still have work to do, the hard work of the team is paying off. We remain
bullish about this market and its opportunities for us.
Innovation is a differentiator for us now and will continue to be in the future. Within customer care, we introduced an
intelligent virtual customer care agent that can diagnose and resolve customer inquiries in the same way, if not better,
than a human agent would.
Xerox invested in HealthSpot, a pioneer in patient and provider-driven healthcare technology. As their exclusive BPO
partner, we will support HealthSpot as they provide groundbreaking telehealth to patients at convenient neighborhood
locations. It's an important step in the transformation of healthcare and an exciting place for Xerox to be.
In the second half, the Document Technology team launched 20 new products that were well received and are a
reminder to the market of our innovation power. We continue to receive recognition from the industry for business and
technology leadership. Gartner, Quocirca, and others recognized us for our managed print and content services, finance
and accounting, and BPO. Everest Group named Xerox a leader in its service provider landscape ranking for the
contact center outsourcing market for the healthcare industry.
We're feeling good about our progress. We remain focused on being the best partner to our clients, making Xerox a
great place to work for our people, and delivering value to our investors.
Now let's take a look at the results in more detail. We delivered earnings just above our range and grew margin in both
our segments and on a total Xerox basis. We're reporting adjusted EPS of $0.31 and GAAP EPS of $0.26. Profit

improved this quarter, as we made progress in Services. Services margin improved in the fourth quarter to 9.8%. And
we continued to benefit from a favorable environment and strong operational management in Document Technology.
On the revenue side, the improved growth in Services to 3% in the quarter is notable, especially considering the impact
from the loss of the Texas Medicaid contract. Document Technology revenue declined in line with recent trends.
Acquisitions remain a key aspect of our portfolio management strategy. For the full-year 2014, we invested almost
$350 million in acquisitions. We're focused on enhancing our Services offerings and expanding our global reach. We
have a goal in 2015 to get more done on this front, up to $900 million in acquisitions with part of those funds coming
from the sale of our ITO business.
With that objective in mind, we closed on one modestly sized acquisition since the beginning of the year, Intrepid
Learning Systems, which includes a service to ensure companies' employees are equipped with the latest skills and
knowledge to improve their business performance.
And underpinning our results and business model is strong cash generation. We closed the quarter with $850 million in
cash from operations and over $2 billion for the year. This supported our acquisition activity, our growing dividends
and share repurchases. In fact, we announced today a 12% increase in our annual dividend rate to $0.28 per share.
Shifting ahead to 2015, our results will be impacted by the recent volatility in foreign currencies. As a result, we have
adjusted 2015 guidance to reflect these headwinds. Kathy will go into greater detail on currency in just a moment.
With that, I'll turn it over to Kathy, then I'll wrap up and we'll open the call to your questions. Kathy?
Kathryn A. Mikells
Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with the progress we made this quarter. Both Services
revenue growth and margin improved. And with the announcement of the planned sale of our ITO business to Atos, we
took a key step in our portfolio management strategy. In addition, our Document Technology business continued to
deliver strong profitability. The positive results in Services and Document Technology yielded earnings higher than our
expectations and strong cash flow. I'll cover the segments and cash flow in a moment, but first let me walk through our
fourth quarter earnings.
As noted earlier, with the pending sale of our ITO business, my commentary will be on a continuing operations basis,
excluding ITO. Total revenue in the quarter was down 3% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. This
compares to down 2% at both actual and constant currency in the third quarter. Underlying constant currency growth
improved from the third quarter, driven by better Services performance, and as expected, we saw the impact of actual
currency rates turn negative in the quarter.
Gross margin of 32.1% was up 10 basis points year-over-year as the positive benefit in Document Technology from
productivity initiatives, currency and pension expense more than offset the greater mix of services at a lower margin.
RD&E was modestly lower year-over-year, as increased investments in Services were more than offset by reductions in
Document Technology. SAG was lower in both segments as we benefited from productivity initiatives, as well as lower
bad debt and pension expenses.
These improvements resulted in our fourth quarter operating margin increasing 100 basis points year-over-year and
operating profit growth of almost 7%. And for the full year, operating profit improved $72 million and operating
margin was up 60 basis points.
Moving down the income statement, adjusted other net was a $6 million higher expense year-over-year. Lower gains
on sale of assets of $20 million and ruble-related currency losses of $5 million were only partially offset by $19 million
in lower restructuring costs. For the full year, a tough compare resulted in adjusted other net expense coming in $102
million higher. In 2013 we realized greater benefits from transaction gains and other non-operational below-the-line
credits. In addition, restructuring charges were $13 million higher this year.

Our equity income was $41 million in the fourth quarter, down $2 million year-over-year, driven by the impact of
negative translation currency. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.3% was up about a percentage point
year-over-year and within our guidance of 23% to 27%.
Adjusted EPS of $0.31 was $0.04 higher year-over-year, driven by operating profit growth and lower share count. For
the full year, adjusted EPS of $1.07 was $0.03 higher as operating profit growth and lower share count were partially
offset by higher adjusted other net expense.
I'll now move to the Services segment slide to review those results in a little bit more detail. Services revenue grew 1%
and was up 3% at constant currency, which was two points better sequentially. Within Services, at constant currency,
BPO growth increased to 4% from 2% in the third quarter with good growth in commercial healthcare payer, electronic
tolling, litigation services and international.
Document Outsourcing was up 1% year-over-year at constant currency, a modest improvement from the third quarter,
but under our segment growth objective. We're beginning to see good traction from our next generation MPS offerings
and we're encouraged by the good signings in the quarter.
Overall in Services, we're making progress improving growth and we continue to expect 2% to 4% constant currency
Services growth this year. Our growth rate will be lower in the first half, reflecting the impact from the Texas Medicaid
contract loss last year, slower first half Document Outsourcing growth, and expected ramp timing for a couple of large
new business contract awards. The Texas loss creates a headwind of about a 150 basis points until we lap it in August.
Total signings in the quarter were up 20%, driven by strong growth in renewals, including the large BPO contract
renewal that I referenced last quarter, which helped to drive a strong BPO renewal rate of 93%. BPO new business was
light as we're still working towards signed and approved contracts for the New York Medicaid and Florida tolling new
business awards. We're getting closer on both and continue to expect them to sign in the first half.
Our sales force is now aligned to specific industry verticals, and we're investing in increased sales coverage and
training. These actions will positively impact new business signings as we move through 2015. Document Outsourcing
signings of a $1 billion were the highest in recent history, with good growth on both the renewal and new business side,
so a good signings quarter for Document Outsourcing, which should enable growth to pick-up by the middle of the
year.
Shifting to profitability, segment margin was 9.8% in the fourth quarter, which was up 70 basis points sequentially, up
10 basis points year-over-year, and towards the higher end of our targeted 9% to 10% range.
We're making progress on our Services initiatives and improving execution. In BPO, we saw multiple lines of business
contribute to the year-over-year profit improvement and Document Outsourcing margins remained strong. Our results
in government healthcare were in line with our expectations and we're seeing positive results from our investments to
mature the platform and improve our operational performance. We're confident we're on the right track and we started
some work ahead of finalizing the New York Medicaid contract to ensure we get off to the right start there.
In 2015 our focus will be on accelerating growth and driving a solid 50 basis points of margin improvement
year-over-year. In summary, the fourth quarter was the strongest quarter of the year for Services, both in terms of
growth and margins, and we're taking the actions required to hit our targeted 2015 core operating results.
With that, I'll now turn to Document Technology. Fourth quarter total revenue in Document Technology was in line
with our expectations with constant currency results down 6%, which was consistent with the full year rate of decline.
As expected, the impact of actual currency rates turned on us this quarter, with a negative two point impact. Equipment
revenue declines were higher, driven by weakness in Eurasia reflecting the volatility in Russia's economy, as well as
the timing of large account sales.
The decline in annuity revenue moderated a bit sequentially, driven by modestly higher supplies demand and a more
favorable compare given the prior-year channel inventory reduction. Similar to last quarter, the finance receivable sales
in the prior year was almost a one point negative impact to revenue growth. From a geographic perspective, the U.S.
and Europe were relatively stable, while developing markets outside of Russia was a positive contributor to results.

Looking at our product groups, high end remains the best performing sub-segment, reporting annuity growth at
constant currency for the third quarter in a row. We saw good traction from the recent launch of our new Versant Entry
production color product, as well as good growth in our iGen product family. Mid-range color activity was relatively
flat and consistent with the third quarter, as we continue to lap our ConnectKey launch from last year. Mono declined
in line with industry trends.
Entry A4 activity was lower year-over-year given weakness in Eurasia, as well as the timing of our Entry product
refresh. We launched 11 new products late in the third quarter and early in the fourth. Market reception's been positive,
but the timing caused us to only catch a partial benefit in the quarter.
Profitability was quite strong. Our Q4 margins came in above our expectations at 14.4%, resulting in segment profit
growth of 14%. This strong performance reflects benefits from restructuring and productivity initiatives, positive
transaction currencies that more than offset negative translation impact, and lower bad debt expense, as well as lower
pension expense, so another solid quarter for Document Technology.
Now I'm going to turn to cash flow. Before I go through the cash flow, I'd like to make one comment related to the
announced ITO sale. Our GAAP net income includes a non-cash loss triggered by the pending sale of the ITO business
of approximately $180 million, driven mainly by goodwill allocated to that business. You can see the loss is added
back further down in the cash flow statement, so net-net there's no cash flow impact.
Moving on, our cash flow from operations was $857 million in the quarter and a little over $2 billion for the year,
which was just above our range. As expected, cash flow in the quarter and full year were lower solely due to the impact
from finance receivable sales in prior years versus no sales in 2014.
Looking at the full year, underlying cash flow, which excludes the impact from prior finance receivable sales was $2.5
billion and compares to $2.1 billion in 2013. The largest driver of the year-over-year improvement in underlying cash
flow was a reduction in net working capital resulting from both performance and timing factors, including lower DSO
and improved year-end collections, especially in Services, improved terms with a few key vendors as well as seasonal
smoothing of working capital. Additionally, we have higher run-off from our underlying finance receivables associated
with lower originations, as well as lower equipment revenue. These year-over-year benefits were partially offset by
higher pension funding.
Moving down the cash flow statement, investing cash flows were a $129 million use in the quarter and a $703 million
use for the full year. For the full year, we spent $452 million on CapEx and $340 million on acquisitions. Cash from
financing was a use of $297 million in the fourth quarter and $1.6 billion for the year. Included in that full year amount
is $1.07 billion spent on share repurchases and $313 million used for preferred and common stock dividends.
Now I'll quickly cover our capital structure. We ended the year with $7.7 billion in debt, which excludes approximately
$75 million in capital lease obligations related to our ITO business, which were reclassified to a discontinued
operations liability account. Applying 7-to-1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at year
end was $4.2 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We manage our core debt to maintain a leverage ratio consistent
with our investment-grade ratings. Our financing debt has come down over the past few years, driven by finance
receivable transactions, as well as lower originations.
During 2015, we have two tranches of debt coming due, about a $1 billion in February and $250 million in June. We
continue to be comfortable with our leverage position and we plan to refinance these notes during 2015, which will
result in our year-end debt being roughly flat at about $7.7 billion. So our capital structure remains stable and if we
move to the next slide, I'll review where we're at in terms of capital allocation.
During 2014, we returned close to $1.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and
dividends. This equates to approximately 85% of our free cash flow for the year. Those numbers include $1.07 billion
of share repurchases and approximately $300 million of dividends. We also spent a total of $340 million on
acquisitions. That's a $185 million higher year-over-year, but shy of our target of up to $500 million. We obviously
have more work to do here and we're focused on concentrating on a bit larger deals, as well as adding more resources

into this area.
For 2015, our capital allocation plan is unchanged and it reflects the redeployment of the expected net proceeds of
roughly $850 million from the ITO sale. On share repurchase, we plan to spend about $1 billion repurchasing stock in
2015. We continue to view our shares as an attractive price and it's a good investment. On acquisitions, we expect to
spend up to $900 million. In keeping with our portfolio management strategy, we're looking to acquire companies that
will expand our capabilities in attractive service areas, as well as to extend our global reach in Services. As I mentioned
on debt, we're comfortable with our leverage position and expect to end the year roughly flat at $7.7 billion.
And finally on dividends, we're announcing today a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.07 per share. This will
result in spend of just over $300 million, with share repurchases effectively self-funding most of the increase.
Before I turn it back to Ursula, I'd like to summarize our expectations for the full year, as well as the first quarter. As
Ursula mentioned, we've seen a sharp movement in currencies around the world in the last 45 days. Where we'd
normally offset modest currency impacts, the dramatic nature of this move creates almost a $100 million of profit
exposure year-over-year. Most significant to us, in this short time, the euro's weakened by about 10% versus the dollar
and 9% versus the yen, and the Canadian dollar's weakened 7% against the dollar. These currency moves caused both
negative translation and transaction impacts. While we continue to look for ways to offset more of this negative impact,
we believe it's prudent to capture the current exposure by revising our guidance.
Let me walk you through the details on where we're at on full-year guidance, and then I'll cover the first quarter. On
revenue, our constant currency expectations are unchanged versus what we communicated at our November Investor
Conference. Total company roughly flat at constant currency, Services up 2% to 4% with growth improving as we
move through the year, Document Technology down 4% to 5%, which reflects some improvement as the negative
impact of the prior finance receivable sales moderate and we realize more benefit from our product launches late in the
second half of last year.
However, we now expect currency will have a negative 3 point to 4 point impact to revenue for the full year versus flat
to about a point previously communicated, with Document Technology having a little higher impact and Services a
little lower, given the geographic mix of the revenues. On margins, we continue to target a 50 basis point improvement
year-over-year in Services, which would put us at the middle of our 9% to 10% range. For Document Technology, we
continued to expect to be within our 11% to 13% range, but likely more towards the middle of the range driven by
year-over-year increased pension costs that we've talked about previously, as well as the negative net currency impact.
As a result of the lower expected revenue at actual currency, as well as related pressure on Document Technology
margins, we expect the flow through to impact earnings roughly by $0.06 and as a result, we're lowering our full-year
adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a $1 to a $1.06.
Turning to cash flow, the timing of the ITO sale negatively impacts free cash flow as we expect to sell the business in
the first half and it produces most of its free cash flow in the second. Additionally, currency impacts our cash
presenting another headwind. We expect to offset some of this impact in 2015 and incremental M&A should offset the
ITO impact next year. Net-net we're bringing down our operating cash flow guidance by $200 million to $1.7 billion to
$1.9 billion and our free cash flow down $100 million to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.
Now to first quarter guidance; in Document Technology, we anticipate revenue declines to be down mid-single digits in
constant currency, with actual results about 4 points lower given currency rates, particularly the weakening of the euro
and Canadian dollar. We expect Q1 Document Technology to continue to deliver very strong margins, but seasonally
they'll be lower and below last year's 12.2%, driven mainly by higher non-cash pension expense as well as negative
currency impact. In Services, constant currency revenue growth will be at the low end of our 2% to 4% full-year
guidance range, driven by tougher compares, expected timing of ramping awarded new business, and slower Document
Outsourcing growth.
We expect currency to have about a 3-point negative impact. We expect margins to be seasonally lower, but up
modestly year-over-year. At the consolidated level for the first quarter, we expect revenue will be down 1 point to 2
points at constant currency with 3 points to 4 points of negative currency impact. Adjusted earnings per share is

expected to be $0.20 to $0.22, which includes approximately $0.02 of restructuring.
The decline versus $0.26 last year is driven by higher non-cash pension expense, adverse currency, higher OID given a
prior-year gain on asset sale, as well as a higher tax rate, 26% planned this year versus 20% last year. That's partially
offset by improvement in Services' operational performance as well as lower share count. Overall, we're making
progress in our core business operations and will be working hard to offset the pressure we're seeing from currency.
With that, I'll hand it back to you, Ursula.
Ursula M. Burns
Thanks, Kathy. I want to get to your questions so I will summarize quickly. Our fourth quarter shows our strategy is
sound and decisions we've made have put us on the right path forward. We're seeing the benefits of strong operating
profit from Document Technology and improving profits and revenue in Services, where we are making visible
progress. Our Services business is now better positioned for future growth. We know 2015 is already bringing some
headwinds. As we mentioned earlier, we are watching the unprecedented movements in currencies, especially the euro,
as Kathy outlined. But as always, we will manage with a disciplined approach, we'll work hard and make the necessary
adjustments to our operations. Our commitment remains the same and our diversified portfolio and strong cash flow,
combined with our operating model, guides our priorities.
In Services, building on the momentum to increase sales and profits through portfolio management, improved
productivity and excellent offerings. In Document Technology, capitalizing on the most advantaged segments of the
business to maintain our leadership position in the industry while maintaining strong profitability. And we'll continue to
generate healthy cash flow to deliver shareholder value.
Thank you and now over to you, Jim.

productivity perspective, looking to get greater growth out of the areas where we have higher margins, and as we pivot
forward towards 2015, organizationally changing our go-to-market approach, focused by industry and putting together

the factors was clearly our overall government healthcare solutions business stabilizing for us. It came in, I would say,
very consistent with our expectations and our overall margins came in consistent with our expectations as well.
So, we feel good about the fact that our government healthcare business is performing a little bit better. Obviously, we
had a lot of pressure in that business in 2014 and it's one of the areas as we look to 2015 that we're expecting continued
improvement. So as you look towards 2015, our fourth quarter performance, I think, is right in line with what we
expected in Services. And it gives us that much more confidence in our 50 basis point margin expansion expectations
for next year. Bob, I don't know if you want to add some color.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Yes, I would just add, we had good cost management generally across the board by our
teams, and in government healthcare we, as Kathy said, had stabilization and we're really able to absorb investments
that we were making in advance on New York and still fit, if you will, inside targeted margins that we want to deliver.
So overall, the plays that we've developed relative to global capabilities and managing our cost structure seem to add
reasonable yield last quarter.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: Great. And then as a follow-up, we're seeing Xerox take a more verticalized industry
approach in its Services business. Can you discuss progress you're seeing with this initiative, and discuss how
verticalization may impact pipeline performance on a near-term and intermediate-term basis?
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Let me briefly cover that. This is Bob, obviously. I would say we're seeing already better
cross-selling opportunities. So, as we go to market and we've moved out of our large number of independent business
units and we have a sales force that has a broader responsibility of all the offering set to those clients, we're seeing
better cross-selling opportunities. We had the whole team together for a big sales kickoff, and I think that that's off to a
fair start. I would say relative to pipeline, as you saw from our release, our overall pipeline numbers are down
marginally. There's a lot of moving parts relative to pipeline with taking ITO out and trying to count once validated, as
opposed to just earlier in the cycle once noticed. But I would expect our pipeline to grow during the year as a result of
the sales force additions and the focus on customers in vertical markets.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, George. If we can have the next question, please?

Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is now open. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. A question with regard to acquisitions, for Ursula and Kathy and I
guess Bob too, actually. Given the $900 million bogey that you've put out there for the year and then sort of the history
that we've seen over the past few years, how are you thinking about ramping it up? I mean is this sort of you've got in
the hopper a couple of large ones, so you feel like it can be done? Or kind of – again, it's a much larger number than
you've done in the past. And then if you can't get there, I assume share repurchase is a focus; but would you want to
keep the cash for some other purpose? Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, it's a good question. We have been improving our acquisition flow, $150 million to
$350 million to $900 million this year. It will be a difficult run for us, but it is one that we are absolutely committed to
and we are putting in place activities, meaning people, incentives to the line people, people focused on deals as well to
make sure that we can actually get up to the $900 million that we have laid out. This is a good problem to have,
meaning we have the money or we will get a lot of it in the middle of the year and we want to spend it and people
know. So we are working through it. I won't comment on any deals that we have in the hopper, just to say that we are
working on making sure that we can spend all $900 million. If we don't spend it, I'll actually turn it over to Kathy, the
strategy that we have is pretty much in place, but she can actually just reiterate it.

<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah, and so one other thing I'd comment on, which I'm sure I've mentioned before, we
have a desire to do what I would describe as chunkier deals. We're never going to get there just doing deals at $25
million at a crack, right? That's just infeasible. And so that's clearly part of the overall strategy. And as Ursula
mentioned, the fact that we've loudly broadcast this hopefully helps to generate a little bigger pipeline. We're also very
actively engaging the business people, right? So, Bob certainly would tell you it's something that's a top priority in the
business people, so we're working collectively across the organization in order to make this happen.
Finally on timing, we recognize that this is a big step-up for us in 2015 in terms of what we're trying to accomplish,
right? By the way, the incremental money not coming in the door until the middle of the year, right? So just a note for
folks on that. And so there is a possibility that we won't get 100% of the $900 million spent this year. Our expectation
is we would look to kind of flow that over and trying to accomplish more in the first quarter of 2016. We've already
announced that we're going to do roughly a $1 billion in share repurchases this year. We ended the year with a strong
cash balance to enable us to again be kind of more consistent in terms of being in the market consistently. So that's
what we expect to do with the money and we're all working hard to get it deployed as fast as possible.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great. And then as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about what your metrics are around
potential acquisitions? How we should think about accretion, what you're kind of focused on from a financial
standpoint when you look at prospective acquisitions?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So, first and foremost, we're focused on what I'd call return-adjusted, risk-adjusted returns,
right? We're interested in doing good deals. We've been historically very disciplined. We're certainly not going to
change that in our approach. So, first and foremost, that's what we're interested in. Of course, we always look at what's
the accretive dilutive nature of the transaction. How much are we paying for it, et cetera, et cetera. We're focused on
trying to do deals that generate synergies because then we have more dollars to play with in what's a pretty competitive
marketplace. But those are some of the things that we're focused on overall. And I'd say before any of the math, right,
we're focused on buying companies that are a great strategic fit for us.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks very much, Shannon. Next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Hey, great. Thanks. It's Tien-tsin. Just want to ask on the Services margin front again, just all
the different puts and takes. I know there's a lot of government healthcare expenses, et cetera, you've got some project
delays with Texas and Florida. So, can it be higher if we normalize for government and healthcare and some of these
unusual items? Trying to understand what's going on underneath the business in Services on the margin front, if that
makes sense.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Well, the overall margins are still lower as a result of our margin dynamics in government
healthcare. So without question, the Services portfolio runs at an overall higher margin than we publish as a result of
the investments that we're still making in government healthcare. But I think as we said, we've got that stabilized. We
had improvement both sequentially in quarter-to-quarter. But as we're looking to ramp up, you'll remember from the
Investor Conference, a reasonable source of our targeted improvement in 2015 this year was coming out of GHS. We
talked about that as being 25 basis points to 40 basis points of potential improvement. So that is still our focus and we
think we have got strong plans to yield that.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: And one other comment I'd add is, if you went back to the Investor Conference, along the
things that we're targeting, improvement in government healthcare, delivering productivity through our now horizontal
operational capabilities, continuing portfolio management, investing in our platforms, there's a yield we expect from
that beyond 2015 as well, right, so 50 basis points solid improvement is what we're trying to put up on the board this
year with an expectation that, that would continue.

<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Understood. Just my follow-up then on Texas, Florida; how much visibility do you have on
the timing of that? To the extent that those things are pushed out, could that have any revenue and margin impact?
What's sort of the cushion there? Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I think you mean New York and Florida. Not Texas and Florida. But Bob will answer it.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Yeah, we're [audio interruption] (41:23). I'm sorry. We built the 2% to 4% revenue growth
commitment that we've made with a plan to get both Florida and New York to come to closure in the first half. We're
still very much on track with both of them in terms of meeting the milestones. And so I would say that we're on track
with both. They're in our range and we don't expect either of them to not be successful in terms of us being a partner
with those clients both with the Medicaid in New York State and with tolling in Florida.

And our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital. Your line is now open. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Benjamin A. Reitzes>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask about puts and takes for the guidance
a little more for 2015. In the fourth quarter, it looks like bad debt year-over-year was a $0.025 benefit. And now
moving into 2015, I was wondering what bad debt was for the year versus currency. If that goes the other way, with –
what's going on in some of the economies you serve, I was wondering if the guidance actually had offsets for if that
goes the other direction. And then I had a quick follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Sure. And so as we look at our fourth quarter beat in Doc Tech, we recognize that's some
of the beat is coming out of bad debt. Some of the beat was coming out of pension, right? So we ended the year kind of
at a higher level overall for the full year than what we would've talked about at our Investor Conference last November.
And so we're taking that into account then as we look at what the year-over-year changes are expected to be. So my
commentary around, hey, as we stare at our margin guidance of 11% to 13% back at the Investor Conference, I would
have been more bullish on the higher end of that range versus now talking about coming down towards the middle.
That's taking into account, Ben, both the fact that bad debt will be a year-over-year headwind for us, right?
We expect bad debt, overall, I'll call it the rate of bad debt to continue to be just fine. It's improved over the last couple
of years and that should continue. But certainly we had a phenomenal 2014 in terms of what the overall bad debt
expense is. And so, we're reflecting that in our margin guidance.
<Q - Benjamin A. Reitzes>: Okay, great. Thanks for the clarity. And then just a quick follow-up on Document
Technology. Are you seeing price competition from Japan-based competitors who can flow through the benefits of the
yen? If so, how is that flowing through your margin guidance as well, which you just commented on for that segment?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: We have been asked this question I feel like every quarter for the last – since the yen
moved from 85. We haven't seen any meaningful change overall in the competitive environment. We always have
pricing impacts that range sort of 5% to 10%. Clearly kind of big enterprise deals are always more hotly competed, but
overall we haven't seen a meaningful shift in the market.
<Q - Benjamin A. Reitzes>: Thank you very much.

<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just two if I could. The first is
just, Bob, with regard to any potential operating margin impact when you go ahead and sign both New York and
Florida. Can you give us some sense of – that we should expect any sort of standup impact to manifest and what kind of
contingencies you might have been able to put in place heading into those? You just seem to have pretty good visibility
to standing them up.
And then I guess just the second one is, when you guys announced the sale of ITO, I think the commentary was that at
that point you expected to be able to make up any impact to 2016 through the combination of buyback and efficiencies
on the EPS line. Now that FX is impacting kind of EPS by about kind of $0.05 to $0.06, do you think there's anything
you can do as you go through 2016 to make up that incremental $0.05 to $0.06? And those are my two questions.
Thanks.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Ananda, it's Bob. Let me start with the first question. So relative to standing up both Florida
and New York, we've built that into our guidance when we shared with you and the rest of the community our target to
be 50 basis points improvement in the 9% to 10% range. We already absorbed some of that hit in the fourth quarter
with New York because we wanted to invest in advance. So do we have to – do we not run at as high a margin upfront
in standing new contracts? Absolutely. But that's part of our design and sourcing model and you should not need to
expect any degradation as a result of winning that business. We want to win it. We planned for it and we have the cost
in our outlook. Kathy, I'll turn to you on the Atos and 2016 question.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah, and so at the time that we announced the ITO sale to Atos, we brought our guidance
down to reflect the impact of the dilution, right, which we'd only be able to slightly offset this year with an expectation
that we would offset the remainder in 2016. And so that's really about getting the share repurchases deployed and
getting the M&A accomplished, as well as I'd say offsetting some of the friction costs associated with the transaction,
sort of stranded costs that we then need to attack. And so we're still absolutely there in terms of offsetting that impact.
The second question you asked was really about sort of currency and our ability to offset the currency impact.
Embedded in our guidance for 2015 already is an expectation we're going offset a little bit of that impact. So you heard
me in my prepared remarks say it's worth a little over $0.06. We're bringing down our EPS guidance by $0.05. So we're
expecting that we're going drive harder to offset some of that impact, and it's built in already.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Ananda. If we can have the next question, please?

Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, thank you. A question and a clarification. The clarification first. Kathy, the $0.06 that
you talk about for FX, does that include the benefit of the yen to cost of goods sold for the printing side? And how
much is that benefit in 2015 due to the yen?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So, it includes everything.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: And so as you can imagine for any global company, everything is a big everything.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Yeah. You bet.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah, it includes all the translation impacts. So we talked a lot about impacts to revenue,
right, and those impacts have some flow thorough to profit, right, the ultimate margin impact of that is a little bit
dampened because it's hitting both revenue as well as profit. And it includes all of our purchasing and the hedging that
we do associated with purchasing. So it is all in.

<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Then my question is – I'm going to direct it to Bob. If you think about the sale of the
ITO business, Bob, if you look back over the last two years, and I realize you haven't been there over the two years. But
if you think about the BPO side of the business, is there a way that you could quantify how that BPO business was tied
to ITO? In other words, when you think about the work of – how much of the ITO business or the BPO business had
ITO tied to it?
And what I'm really going back to is the thought process around – how is the sale of ITO going to impact the ability of
Xerox to win BPO business as you look forward to? I understand you can outsource to folks like Cognizant – or
second, I should say, to Cognizant. But I'm just wondering how it might impact your win rate by not having in-house
ITO capabilities. Thank you.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Yeah, no, I appreciate the question. So this was a really big strategic thought for us because,
obviously, we're betting a lot on our ability to drive growth in BPO and Document Outsourcing. And when we looked,
I won't just do the two years, I'll go at our portfolio, we had ITO in a little over half of our BPO revenue stream, but at a
very, very modest amount.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Right.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: So most of our big BPO plays had little server management. I'm not on the ITO contracts
themselves, which were big contracts for us. And we really have found in the – I guess we're 30 days plus, 40 days, we
have a very good customer reaction. So as we go around with our clients and say our future delivery model includes
Atos as a delivery partner, as a piece of this delivery ecosystem, I do not view it as something that's going to
compromise or put us at a competitive disadvantage. They bring a lot of assets relative to the ITO space, and we think
that that team is an even better team for our BPO business than going it alone.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Yeah, fair enough. Okay. Thanks for the answer, Bob.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Thank you.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks. Next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Great. Thank you, and thanks for taking my question. I guess the first question for Kathy. As
we think about some of the headwinds in particular to cash flow this year, whether it's FX or pension expenses, and we
talk about normalized cash flow being over $2 billion, cash from operations, how do we think about how some of those
pieces may move? Or how do you think about them as we're forecasting for 2016 and beyond?
I guess which ones would you expect to be kind of more prominent in 2015, given where interest rates and FX are?
And which – when might we see a greater inflection, or will we see a greater inflection towards normalized cash flow
in 2016 and beyond, particularly post the sale of ITO?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So, I'm going to just start with a discussion about free cash flow, right? So we brought our
free cash flow guidance down by $100 million. Part of that obviously reflects the sale of the ITO business. We would
expect to start to offset that as we do more M&A basically utilizing the proceeds. And so I would call that impact a
transitory impact, right? Clearly, we've said we think we'll be able to offset some of the currency impacts in 2015,
reflected in the guidance that we gave with respect to free cash flow. But the company is an incredibly I'd say solid and
consistent cash flow producer. And sale of the ITO business is really just a modest transitory impact on cash flow. I'm
not going to try and call where currencies go in 2016, but obviously we're going to do everything that we can to offset
the currency impact as much as possible.

Overall with regard to pension, we're increasing our pension funding this year by about $50 million. I would expect our
pension funding starts to stabilize at that point. Unless there's an opportunity to do something more materially with our
pension, which at this point, I don't necessarily see. So I think the overall factors around our cash flow are very solid,
and we've reduced it at the moment for some transitory issues, but I wouldn't expect those to last forever.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Okay. And can we get a sense of the capital intensity that ITO accounted for? And where might
that have been offset by redeploying those funds into other areas?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah, the ITO business was, in the Services side, clearly our most capital intensive
business, lower ROIC business for us, which strategically is much of – behind the sale, not to mention we were a
sub-scale player in ITO relative to some of our competitors. So from that perspective its impact on free cash flow is
much less than its impact on operating cash flow, which is part of the reason we only brought it down modestly. We'd
expect we're going to deploy it into BPO, which is not nearly as capital intensive.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, thank you. There are obviously a few moving parts in the technology business this year, so
I wanted to understand the timing of some of the puts and takes you've talked about. So could you give us a bit more
color on how we should think about the revenue trajectory margin path and some of these product cycle dynamics as
we progress through the year? And I guess particularly how we think about the dynamics as we move from first half to
second half.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Sure. So as we progress through the year just in terms of the revenue dynamics going on in
Doc Tech, we'll get a bit of a benefit as a result of just from a year-over-year comp perspective, not doing the forward
receivable sales anymore and so that had in the third and the fourth quarter about a point of negative impact in 2014. So
we will get an easier comp towards the back half of the year. From a foreign currency perspective on Doc Tech, with
regard to top line, translation impacts to top line happen immediately, right? The flip side of that is what's going on in
transaction impacts. The transaction impacts don't hit us immediately, as a result of our hedging program. So that's a
little bit more back half it gets worse relative to front half as a result. That's obviously a profit and a margin constraint
as opposed to a revenue constraint. So, hopefully that gives you a little bit of color.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: That's helpful. Thank you. That's it for me.

<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: I can probably answer all of those. So, yes, Jamie, you're right. New York is not in those
signings numbers, neither New York nor Florida. And while our overall signings were strong and the numbers were
very positive, we do need to get new business ramped up and that's a big piece of that. Relative to the problem contract
question, I would say we've made real progress in terms of the new systems implementations. We've got a strong team
that we've added in 2014 that's really been driving that. So you can never say never in terms of an issue in a given
implementation. But overall, we've made very good progress there and we're optimistic that we won't have big financial
hits as a result of future problem contracts.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Bob. Thanks, Jamie. If we could have the last question now, operator? Thank you.
Operator
Certainly. Our last question will come from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is open.
<Q - James Dickey Suva>: Great. Thank you and congratulations. The signings number was very impressive for the
quarter. A lot of times there is seasonality to them, and maybe some deferrals that come in and things like that. And so
if you look at one quarter, the snapshot is very, very impressive. If you look at kind of a trailing 12-month quarter run
rate, you still have down kind of 13%-ish for a trailing 12 quarters. So can you help us bridge the gap of that trailing 12
months versus a very strong quarter, and the outlook for Services and your confidence to grow that Services? Thank
you.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Jim, I would agree. We were happy with the quarter and the year-to-year growth that we had
in the quarter. But still as you represented, we're down double digits on a trailing 12-month basis. And again, the big
piece that would have changed that is if we would have had a little bit earlier timing in either New York or Florida. But
those are in front of us as opposed to already booked in our signings numbers. But the renewals have been really
strong. We have seven out of the last eight quarters in BPO that we've been over 90%. So we're very positive on the
renewal rates. And it's really a new business getting more traction in our new business initiatives and we believe we
will do that in 2015. That is a critical element for us, maybe more on our 2016 revenue than on 2015, but it's critical
element for us. And we're very focused on it.
<Q - James Dickey Suva>: Great. And then as a quick follow-up, you have a couple big contracts, and on the call you
made some references to New York and Florida that are not in the signings; and I understand that correctly. But once
they come into signings is there also a little bit of a timing item we should be aware of as far as when they get included
into your revenues, i.e., like immediately when they sign, then the next day you can start to recognize revenues? Or is
there a, hey, you signed it; then you have to sit down and talk about phases and timing and sometimes a quarter or two?
Because each of those look to be quite substantial and I don't want to get too excited – or maybe I should – that they
immediately start to enter the revenue stream.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Yes. No, we generally begin to recognize revenue pretty quickly but there's a ramp. So you're
not at full annualized revenue in the first quarter after the signing. But I would expect in both, and the way we've built
our track is we expect in both New York and Florida to sign in the first half, to then start a revenue flow not as – an
earlier question, not at high margins but that's all built into our guidance. But it does take a little bit of time, typically
about two quarters before you get to the annualized run rate.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Bob. Thanks, Jim. That's all the time we have...
<Q - James Dickey Suva>: Thanks for the clarification.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for your interest, and
Ursula, anything more to wrap up?
