Before taking questions, we'll begin with some prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra.
Safra Ada Catz
Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal 2015. I'll then review guidance for Q1, and
then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you probably remember, I didn't provide U.S. dollar guidance for Q4 given the unusually high volatility in exchange
rates. The currency headwinds ended up being higher than consensus estimates would reflect, with 8% to software and
cloud revenue as well as to total company revenue, 9% for hardware revenue, and $0.09 for earnings per share.
Currencies continue to move significantly and remain unpredictable, so my comments today generally reflect constant
dollar growth rates, which is how we look at the business.
We are delighted with our results, with the most important thing being that we dramatically overachieved in the cloud.
This is the first Q4 where we had everything together for the cloud. We had the products that we've been working on
for a decade, the operations, the sales force, and the references of many, many happy customers. Having all that in
place caused SaaS/PaaS bookings to grow more than 200%, our best ever growth rate for cloud bookings and more than
$125 million higher than our own $300 million goal. For most companies, as their business grows, the growth rates go
down. In our case, as the business grows, our growth rates are increasing.
So to the numbers, cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue – I'm doing only non-GAAP – was $419 million, up 34% from last
year and well above the high end of my guidance. As our cloud bookings growth continues to accelerate, so too will
our cloud revenue growth. As I just said, bookings grew more than 200%, further adding to the momentum which is
helping drive SaaS and PaaS growth. Now when you translate, the $125 million higher from SaaS and PaaS to had it
been historically, our license business, it probably would have been around $375 million more in license, and it would
all have been booked immediately, not ratably over time. So for us, this was actually fantastic news.
When bookings ultimately turn into revenue depends of course on many factors, but one thing is clear. Our momentum
in the cloud bodes very well for the future. Combined with infrastructure-as-a-service revenue of $160 million, which
was up 31%, our total cloud revenue in the quarter was $579 million.
Engineered systems continued to – excuse me, sorry. To help you further understand just how well we are doing in the
cloud, I thought it would be helpful to compare our cloud billings growth rate to that of our principal cloud competitors.
Billings is generally defined as total revenue in the period plus the sequential change in gross deferred revenue. Our
practice at Oracle regarding deferred revenue has always been to net out the billed but unpaid invoices from our
deferred revenue balance on our balance sheet. I believe that our cloud competitors follow a practice where they
disclose only the gross deferred revenue book balance, not net for uncollected invoices. So we've put up a spreadsheet
on our website to show you the same thing for comparability.
We've calculated Oracle's cloud billings using our competitors' methodology of the sum of total cloud revenue plus the
sequential change in gross deferred revenue. What it shows is that billings grew from $468 million in fiscal 2014 fourth
quarter to $834 million in this just finished quarter. That's a growth rate of more than 70% in U.S. dollars. And though
there may be seasonality to billings numbers, this is dramatically faster than Salesforce's 21% billings growth and
Workday's 31% billings growth in their most recently reported quarter. In summary, our cloud business is significantly
outpacing the competition.
Now, total software revenues were $8.4 billion, with software updates and product support revenues at $4.7 billion, up
8% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels, as our growing installed base of
customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenues were $3.1 billion, reflecting the
accelerated migration to cloud. The shift to cloud was very pronounced in Europe, where new software license sales
were most impacted. But Europe was also our fastest growing region for both cloud revenue and bookings, as you
would expect from the substitution.

Total hardware, including hardware support, grew 5%, with hardware system product revenue of $818 million and
hardware support revenue of $590 million. Engineered systems continue to be strong with double-digit bookings
growth, and we continue to take share from IBM and HP.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $10.7 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income
was $5 billion and the operating margin was 46%, with currency and MICROS lowering operating margins by 2%.
That we were able to maintain our industry-leading operating margins with MICROS and while growing our cloud
business dramatically is a testimony to the strength of our business model.
While we believe our overachievement in cloud bookings will be much more valuable in both revenue and earnings
over time, cloud revenue is recognized ratably, unlike new license, which is recognized upfront. This shift has the
effect of lowering near-term earnings per share but over time will increase it significantly. So for example, a $1 million
license deal which would be recognized upfront, drop right to the bottom line, would ultimately result in about $3
million in revenue over 10 years. A $1 million SaaS/PaaS booking, a SaaS booking, results in $10 million over that
same time period. I would not trade the cloud revenue for the license revenue as cloud revenues and cloud bookings
mean significantly more in revenues and earnings over time.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 25.5% and EPS was $0.78 in U.S. dollars, $0.09 lower due to currency.
The GAAP tax rate was 25.4% and the GAAP EPS was $0.62 in U.S. dollars, $0.08 lower due to currency. Both tax
rates were significantly higher than my guidance and were the result of multiple factors, but generally relate to the mix
of earnings between the U.S. and other jurisdictions, with the U.S. being a larger percentage of our quarter in
recognized revenue than we forecast.
For the fiscal 2015, total software and cloud revenues totaled $29.5 billion, growing 5% in constant currency. Cloud
SaaS and PaaS were $1.5 billion, growing 34%. Cloud infrastructure-as-a-service was $608 million, growing 36%.
New software license was $8.5 billion, and software support was $18.9 billion, growing 8%. Hardware systems
revenue was $5.2 billion, growing 1%. Services revenue was $3.5 billion, essentially unchanged from last year. Total
revenue grew 4% to $38.3 billion.
Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 45%, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.77.
Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.9 billion. Capital expenditures continue to be higher as we provision
existing orders and build out for SaaS and PaaS growth. As a reminder, our cloud data centers are built using our own
engineered systems. So while CapEx is a cost to other cloud providers, a good portion of our CapEx is essentially a
hardware sale, which we sell as a cloud subscription.
We now have $54 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $12.4
billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.2 billion, up 9% in constant currency.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic
acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on
finding the right companies at the right valuations, and both are critically important. This quarter, we again repurchased
4.6 million (sic) [46 million] shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months we've repurchased more than 193
million shares for a total of $8.1 billion. We've paid out dividends of $2.3 billion, for a total that is 80% of our free cash
flow. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.
Now to the guidance, we feel very good about our own performance. But of course, we are keeping an eye on the
macro environment, especially abroad. Additionally, given the continued high volatility in exchange rates, we expect
currency will affect results, but as of now we just don't know how much. So I'm going to again provide constant
currency guidance, though I would take our results as some idea of what we think currencies are doing right around
now. Clearly, customers are migrating to Oracle cloud at even faster rates, and my guidance reflects this accelerating
mix shift.
Since we are starting the new year, I am going to make some changes in my guidance. I am dropping some things,
including smaller components of cloud, and I am dropping GAAP guidance, which both best match how we look at the

business. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency, so here goes.
SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 39% and 43%. Software and cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS,
IAS, new software license, and software support, is expected to grow between 6% and 8%. Total revenue growth is
expected to range from 5% to 8%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.56
and $0.59. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may end up being
very different.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark.
Mark V. Hurd
Just a couple quick comments, Safra, to add. I think one, Safra told you about the 34% year-on-year SaaS/PaaS revenue
growth. That was 12% sequential growth and almost entirely organic. We talked about billings growth of 70% now
faster than Salesforce or Workday. Bookings at $426 million was 200%-plus growth for Q4.
Let me give you some customer numbers. We added 1,217 SaaS customers in the quarter, new. 760 customers
expanded. By pillar, HCM added 312 new customers in the quarter, 933 for the year, three times Workday's total
customer growth over the last four quarters. In Customer Experience, we added 657 customers in Q4, almost 1,900 for
the year. In ERP we added 380 customers in Q4 and 888 for the year. Our install base is now almost 1,100 ERP
customers in the cloud, nearly 10x the size of Workday. And let me add, we really never see SAP.
In PaaS we added 1,419 customers in Q4. Let me just repeat; that was 1,419 customers in one quarter. We booked over
$100 million and grew 100% sequentially. We're now at scale. Our cloud revenue is already above a $2.3 billion run
rate. We added $858 million in ARR this year, $858 million. So using the conversion that Safra used a little while ago,
that would be almost $2.5 billion in license. And we expect to sell between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in ARR next
year. We're now growing faster than both Salesforce and Workday, and we expect revenue growth next year could be
as high in SaaS/PaaS as 60%.
Now I've given you a lot of numbers to reflect on. But when you look at customer counts, booking, revenue, the result
is the same. We're doing what you very rarely ever see happen in our industry. We are getting bigger and our growth
rate is expanding. We will be the world's largest enterprise cloud company.
With that, let me turn it over to Larry.
Lawrence J. Ellison
Thank you, Mark.
Mark gave you a lot of interesting numbers, and I'd like to drill into a couple of them. First, I'd like to look at our sales
growth rate of cloud applications, SaaS, and platform services, PaaS. I'm intentionally leaving out our cloud
infrastructure business so I can do an apples-to-apples comparison to a salesforce.com, which does not sell
infrastructure-as-a-service.
Okay, last year, in FY 2015, as Mark just said, we sold $858 million of new SaaS and PaaS business. About half of
that, $426 million, was sold in Q4. That's a year-over-year Q4 sales growth rate of over 200%. More importantly, the
$426 million is more SaaS and PaaS new business than has ever been sold by any cloud services company in a single
quarter. It's a record. Clearly, our cloud business has entered a hyper-growth phase.
This year, in FY 2016, we plan on selling between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of new SaaS and PaaS business. In other
words, we plan to sell at least twice as much as we sold last year. And that's at least 50% more new business than
salesforce.com will sell in their current fiscal year. And if we exceed our plan like we did this Q4, we could book twice
as much new business as salesforce.com. Now I don't think that's likely that we'll sell double what salesforce.com sells,
but it's definitely possible.

Second, let's look at the impact these record sales rates have on SaaS and PaaS revenue. In Q4 of FY 2015, our SaaS
and PaaS revenue grew 35% in constant currency. Because our cloud sales has dramatically accelerated, our SaaS and
PaaS revenues are planned to grow at 60% in FY 2016, unaided by any new acquisitions. So our cloud business is
much bigger than Workday, and we will grow faster than Workday will this year. Our cloud, SaaS, and PaaS revenue is
still second to salesforce.com, but we're growing much, much faster than they are, so it won't be long before we pass
them.
How and why is this happening? Our SaaS growth is due to the rapid acceptance of our new generation of Fusion
applications. We now have over 1,000 Fusion ERP customers, around 10 times more than Workday. Mark said that
once. I'm going to say it twice, around 10 times more than Workday. Workday says they never see SAP in the cloud
ERP market. That's the one thing Oracle and Workday agree on. It's between us, Oracle and Workday, in the
midmarket and the high end of the cloud ERP market, and we are winning big time. We are the clear number one in
cloud ERP. And we are number one or number two in most other SaaS categories, including HCM, sales, service,
marketing, EPM, supply chain, and so on. We have a lot more SaaS applications than any other enterprise SaaS
company.
Our PaaS growth is due to the huge pent-up demand for the Oracle Database and Java middleware-as-a-service. Our
customers can now move their Oracle Databases and Java applications to the cloud with the push of a button. That's
why our PaaS business is growing even faster than our SaaS business. Things are good for Oracle in the cloud.
Kenneth Bond
Thank you, Larry. Before we go to the Q&A, Holly, if we can have just one quick clarification, share repurchases in Q4
were 46 million shares. With that, I'll turn it over to you.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Look, Oracle wasn't the first and won't be the last software
company to go through this shift from selling upfront perpetual to ratable subscription licensing. And so the metrics
that we were used to are obviously changing, and you guys gave a lot of color around the current quarter. And what I
hope maybe we could do is drill down a little bit more on the longer-term impact of the model and customer lifetime
value. And I know in your 10-year example, you generate more revenue with subscription. Can you guys talk a little bit
about what you think the ballpark breakeven point is on a hypothetical deal, what happens to margins over this time,
and ultimately how this is going impact cash flow? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: I'll repeat what Safra said. Let's take a $1 million deal. If it's licensed over a 10-year
period, you get the $1 million up front for the license and you get 20% a year for 10 years. That's another $2 million.
So over a 10-year period, you get a total of $3 million. And after the cost of sales, it's a very profitable business. Most
of that $3 million you get after the cost of sales is profit.
In a $1 million SaaS or PaaS deal, you don't get anything up front but you have to pay the commissions. And that $1
million deal is worth $10 million, or more than three times as much as the license deal over a 10-year period, over triple
the value, but the accounting is entirely different. The accounting, you take it ratably over that 10-year period. You
have to pay the commissions up front and recognize the expenses up front and you get 10 years.
Okay, so now what's the profitability on SaaS and PaaS? This is going to shock you. It's about the same as license and
support. It's stunningly profitable. Infrastructure-as-a-service is very different. Again, I'm talking about SaaS and PaaS.
Infrastructure-as-a-service, the margins aren't nearly so high, though we make money in infrastructure-as-a-service.

You can see what Amazon's profit margins in its infrastructure-as-a-service. We think it can be a profitable business
when we get scale. But SaaS and PaaS is very similar to license, so that $1 million, which turns into something less
than $3 million in profit after you get to scale in license, turns into something less than $10 million in profit, say $9
million in profit over the 10-year period that you're providing the service. So it's a much better business for us in terms
of revenue, margin. The revenue goes way up. The profits go way up, and the margins are approximately the same.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: I think we have a huge advantage, Jason, that some of our competitors don't have. We make
most of the components for the cloud service ourselves.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Again, Salesforce paid us a lot of money for their platform. They buy Exadata from us to
run their data center. They buy the Oracle Database. They paid a lot of money for the Oracle Database. By the way, we
just signed an Oracle Database deal so SAP could run Concur. We signed an Oracle Database deal – this is all in the
last 12 months – so SAP can run Ariba. We signed an Oracle Database deal so SAP could run SuccessFactors. We get a
really good deal on the Oracle Database, on Java middleware, on Exadata, and all of those things. So our expense
profile is very, very different. By the way, it's interesting. SAP does not use HANA in the cloud very much. I know that
because they keep paying us. Again this quarter, they pay us for Oracle for Concur and Oracle for Ariba and Oracle for
SuccessFactors. If they're using for HANA for anything, I don't know about it.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Jason, just to add one thing, as you talked about the conversion from license to ratable, I gave
this out last quarter, but I'll give it again for this quarter. Last quarter, I think I said that 82% of our cloud SaaS deals
were actually not Oracle customers of an application when they acquired or contracted for a SaaS application. This
quarter it was over 60%. So this is not just a conversion of Oracle customers, Oracle application customers to SaaS.
This is a lot of greenfield new market share for Oracle as well.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: Great, I appreciate the commentary. Thanks, guys.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Again, I'll just follow up on what Mark just said. The SaaS market is much bigger than the
license market. As Mark was saying, we can go much further down market and get to customers we could never get to
before because the SaaS service is much easier to consume for a mid-sized company than buying a computer, opening a
data center, hiring a bunch of people, and running licensed software. So we think the available market is dramatically
larger.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: The global mid-market is now available to us, unlike it would have been in the traditional
license model, and it's very exciting.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James.
<Q - Michael Turits>: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I wanted to drill down on the cloud numbers, especially how
they've stood up relative to licensing. License missed in the quarter, that's consensus, by about 273. Obviously, that's
very much due to that shift over to cloud in terms of accounting structure, term structure. Is that all due to that, or was
there some impact, anything negative that we should read fundamentally in the license miss on either database apps or
middleware?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay. So first of all, I didn't give guidance regarding license. So whatever number you put in
your spreadsheet, we didn't make that number, okay?
<Q - Michael Turits>: No, I just meant relative to consensus, that's all.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay, relative to all of you who have a lot of spreadsheets. However, the reality is I think that
you can see the most instruction from what happened in Europe. Our Europe new license was down a lot. Our Europe
cloud was huge. So it was for them, they focused all in. They went all in on pushing cloud, and that's where the focus

went. Other than that, I think if we're going to talk about spreadsheets that I did not actually guide you to, in currency I
think you all missed the boat there too a bit, but that's okay. We've got another quarter now.
But the truth is that yes, our customers are focusing on cloud as are our sales force. We have a lot of references. And
when a customer comes to us, to the extent that they are a good candidate for cloud, which they are, we are going to be
talking about cloud. We're going to be selling cloud, and we would much rather have a cloud booking, as I said, for $1
million than we would for a license deal which I book all the way right up front, so it goes right to the bottom line. We
would much rather have a cloud booking for $1 million than a new license dollar. And we are pushing that conversion
quickly.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Just a little bit more. No region missed its CD forecast with the exception of Europe. So just to
be clear, CD forecast, when you're talking about dollars from a CD perspective, every region executed as we expected
in license with the exception of Europe. Europe had a phenomenal cloud quarter, inclusive of probably one of the most
exciting financials in the cloud deal we've seen at HSBC. So some very exciting transactions in Europe, and they
definitely made the shift. But to whatever you have in your numbers on a local basis, no region missed its CD forecast
in license with the exception of Europe that had a material shift to the cloud in the quarter, including some pretty
exciting deals like what I just described.
<Q - Michael Turits>: That's very helpful. Thanks very much.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great, thank you. Safra, I know our spreadsheets are nowhere near as good as yours are. But
just to follow up a little bit, Q4 used to be – you would always characterize it as Mardi Gras for Oracle from a license
revenue perspective. And now that this transition seems to be happening so swiftly, it would seem in Q1 you would
always have this big sequential drop-off. And I know you don't specifically talk about license revenue. But given we're
all trying to get a hang of how to think about the company's seasonality going forward, should we think about Q4, the
dynamic for Q4, seasonality is going to become a little bit more muted, continue to become more muted as you have
this success transitioning? But then again Q1, which used to be a quarter where license revenue used to have such a big
sequential decline, maybe Q1 gets a little bit easier? Is there any way you can help us think about that?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Yes, you are on it. Yes, Heather, you have got it actually exactly nailed correctly. The reality is
that cloud is growing sequentially generally, regardless. So Q1 actually in revenues, Q1 cloud is not going to be a giant
drop-off from Q4. My team here is telling me it's going up. I actually just gave the guidance, so yes. So, Heather, you
have that right. So the seasonality for the whole company is muted.
It is still true that from a bookings point of view and things like that, Q4 is Mardi Gras, and it's still Mardi Gras, but
revenue smoothes out. New license, which was always just so enormous in Q4, takes a giant drop-off. It becomes less
and less important. So in total revenue, the seasonality smoothes out a bit. But of course, our new license numbers are
still very big numbers, but in Q1 they're a much smaller percentage of the total than they are Q4.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I do think it's worth noting, Heather, that in Q4 for us on a cloud bookings basis, we came in
with a forecast that we had which is what we talked about at the end of Q3 with the conference call, and every week
this forecast got better, every week. There was not a single – I gave you an example of one deal, but there is no
gargantuan transaction in there. There is no dominant region. There is no dominant pillar. It is consistent by pillar, by
geography, and it was a very consistent, steady move every week as we advanced through Q4.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Thank you very much.

Your next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kasthuri G. Rangan>: Hey, guys. I'm not going to ask you a spreadsheet question, but I want to ask about
databases. Any commentary on the new license sales of Database directionally how it trended? And also an update on
Oracle Database 12c adoption, what percent of the base is on Oracle Database 12c? And any quantification you can
throw in on the options, that would be good. Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Oracle Database 12c was good in the quarter. I think we gave you a comparison last quarter.
But if we compared it to Oracle Database 11, we've been about 50% faster in feature adoptions of Oracle Database 12c
than we were at Oracle Database 11, so it was very strong. And if you went by region, you saw a tremendous
performance in Database in North America, even in license. And you saw it really consistently across the regions
except for the shift that we saw in Europe. But the adoption speed of Oracle Database 12c was quite strong in the
quarter, as it was in Q3.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Kash, let me give you a little interesting commentary I think on the relationship between
PaaS and database adoption on premise. We're the only company that says hey, what you run in the cloud and what you
run on premise should be compatible so that you can push a button and move a workload from your private cloud to the
Oracle public cloud and back again, or you can do development tests in the public cloud and do production in your
private cloud on premise if you want to. So we think over time that's going to dramatically accelerate the adoption of
features, certain features of our database on premise because they're getting those features in the cloud. They're getting
multi-tenancy in the cloud. They're getting the in-memory database features in the cloud, and they'll want to have an
exact analogue in their private cloud on premise. So I think that's going to actually help keeping our customers current
with the latest features of the database.
<Q - Kasthuri G. Rangan>: Wonderful, Safra, any commentary on the license growth for databases?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: I want to talk to you actually about the options that did best. As you would expect, everything
around security, many of our customers are realizing the security options that we have, which are really very, very
critical. Obviously, cyber-attacks and all those things and also inside stress are something they are finally really
focused on. And so database security options were up very significantly, like around 30%, that kind of level. And many
of our customers are looking now at the multi-tenant option which is available with our newest product, and that is
doing very well. That means that our customers are moving even themselves into their own private cloud to manage
more efficiently. So that was very, very good for us this year – this quarter.
<Q - Kasthuri G. Rangan>: Thank you.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?

Your next question will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies.
<Q - John Stephen DiFucci>: Thank you for taking my question. I guess we understand and appreciate the emphasis
here on the cloud business. But I'd like to ask a question on what I guess is still the overwhelming majority of your
revenue today, and that's what I'm talking about, the on-premise software business. How should we be thinking about
your enterprise customer base? What is their behavior like? And what do you think it's going to be moving toward from
here?
In the past, I think we've heard both Safra and Mark talk about the sustainability of the Siebel maintenance stream. I
guess as enterprise has moved to the cloud, is this move largely – as your customers, and I know, Mark, you addressed
this a little bit. But are your customers largely replacing on-premise technology, or is it primarily for new
implementations today and into the future? I'm sorry it's a long question. But I guess what I'm trying to get to is how

should we think about the current support stream from that on-premise software, the current support maintenance into
the future?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: So firstly, it's very important that you understand. Our support base continues to grow. See,
when we sell new licenses at all, any new license, that increases our base. We do continue to sell billions of dollars of
new licenses. Our renewal rates, by the way, remain extremely high, very, very high, historically high rates. So many of
our customers are not necessarily – are not canceling support and moving everything to the cloud overnight. They are
adding cloud capabilities.
What happens invariably is even when they add something in the cloud that they did on premise, they have other uses
for many of our licenses that they've had before. We would like them over time, frankly, if we had our way, to move
everything to the cloud. That would mean probably revenue rates significantly larger than we are now. But our
customers, our base continues to grow. Our customer base continues to grow and our support numbers continue to go
up, up obviously 8% just this quarter.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I think what Safra said is right. We had 8% CD growth for the quarter. Renewal rates were very
strong, again if you will, flat year over year, meaning they were very, very, very good. And again, I'll try to go through
this again, so to be clear. Most of the new things that we sold or most of what we sold in the cloud was incremental in
terms of certainly SaaS applications. So I think again, the way to think through this is you're going to have a very large
on-premise environment, I think for a long period of time. But workloads are shifting to the cloud, and that is an
opportunity for us as we maintain our on-prem base, but frankly grow our market share through this shift to the cloud,
and we can see it and it's exciting.
With it, remember, John, too. When we win a SaaS application, we gain all the hardware, all the operating systems, all
the database, and all the middleware. When we gain PaaS, we get all the database, all the operating system, and all the
hardware as well. So I think you're going to see on-prem, I think our position on-prem is actually strengthening on a
relative basis to what's in the market, and we are now growing faster with these numbers. And I don't know how many
more ways to go through these numbers to show the market share we're gaining and the speed by which we're
accelerating our market position in the cloud. And I think we have a chance to get both.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Let me just add, briefly summarize what Mark said. Our support base, our installed base
on premise is going up 8% and will continue to go up, while our cloud business is experiencing hyper growth, 50%
revenue growth, 60% revenue growth, maybe even more than that.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?
<Q - John Stephen DiFucci>: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator
And your next question will come from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.
<Q - Brent J. Thill>: Thanks. Safra, in Q4 did you see a greater percentage of deals in the pipeline that maybe were
more forecasted to go as perpetual license that made the shift to a cloud model, and therefore that was the weight on the
license I think relative to what we all were looking for? There was a big delta there. I'm just curious if you had any
commentary.
And then maybe for Mark as it relates to some of the cloud initial deal sizes and duration of these contracts, if you
could maybe point at what you're seeing in terms of some of the contract values that you're seeing throughout the year
and any change in characteristics there, that would be helpful.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: No, that isn't how it works. It's not that – by the time a deal itself is actually listed in the
forecast, it's already qualified as to what it's going to be. The reality is that conversion rates moving in the cloud were
very, very, very high, and they to some extent were the big focus. That is what we push in the forecast call every week.
That's what we're talking about all the time, and that's what was very clear. In the forecast overall, there are many,

many different shaped deals and types of deals. And what exactly will close in the quarter, I never know. I have to use
my own conversion and closing historical rates. This quarter showed a marked move towards converting the cloud
deals. Those did very well. They far exceeded where we thought they would go. So that's how it worked out.
Obviously, it doesn't show up in the revenues because we don't book them up front like licenses.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: To your second question, productivity and ASP, your point about pricing both inclined. So our
productivity per rep and our average deal size in cloud went up in the quarter. It went up a bit sequentially as well as it
went up year over year.
There is an important other dynamic that when you look at our cloud business, you've got several factors going on,
Brent. You've got, one, frankly the products are just better. They're just getting better and they're more mature. Our
salespeople, we have more of them and they have longer tenure. They're also simply better trained than they were just
even a year or two years ago. And so the combination of this is what's driven the performance in the cloud. And make
no mistake about it, there is a keen sales focus on growing our cloud business. Our cloud business is important for all
the reasons that we've already talked through.
Now one other point that we haven't brought up that I think I'd add to it is, when you look at where we're heading with
the cloud, we're going into a year now where we now get, frankly, more of our portfolio available in the cloud. So
we've done just what we described in Q4, which are these numbers that everybody is all excited about, frankly, with not
our entire product line available to us in the cloud and not even all of the products that we have localized to all of our
geographies. So you have a set of factors occurring next fiscal year, the year we're in, where now we have yet more
salespeople with more tenure, with more references, with now more of our products online, if you will, in more
geographies.
<Q - Brent J. Thill>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Hey, thanks for taking my questions, two quick ones. First, Safra, if I look at sales and
marketing, it came in a little bit higher than we had expected. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics there? Are
you actually paying out more on cloud provisions, et cetera, or is it just that Q4 actually was very successful and we
can't [ph] change in (47:17) revenue because it was all from cloud?
And then for Larry a question on PaaS. What are the use cases that you see on PaaS? Is it all test and development, or
are people actually putting hardware production workloads over onto your cloud already? Thank you.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: So what you're seeing in the sales and marketing percentage is that, again, since we're not
recognizing the revenue upfront like with license, though we have commissions and things like that with cloud, there
are also additional sales expenses that are recognized immediately, but they don't have the corresponding revenue like
new license does. So you're just seeing timing differences more than anything else, and that's impacting a number of
our ratios clearly.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: In PaaS we have a number of things going on. Yes, your point about dev/test is correct.
There is a lot of dev/test use cases for PaaS, but there's more going on in PaaS than just database-as-a-service and just
dev/test. We have released our first really BI solution into the market, which is now Visual Analyzer, which now goes
head up against Tableau, and we had good success with that product in Q4. So again, our competitors are shifting now
as opposed to in BI on premise. Where we would have competed with Cognos or BusinessObjects, we now compete
with Tableau, and that's in our PaaS results that we described. Also Java-as-a-service was strong in the quarter. The
collection of those services were 30% – 40% of our PaaS bookings. And yes, dev/test, other than that, dev/test is
certainly a very big use case for our customers.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Perfect, thanks, Larry.

<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?
Operator
Your last question will come from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Thanks, guys, for taking my questions. I think we've hit a lot on the software side of the
business in cloud, but we haven't really touched on hardware much. You guys came in actually a little bit above the
midpoint of your constant currency guidance on hardware this quarter. I'm just wondering if you could comment on the
trends that you're seeing there, engineered systems versus the non-engineered business. And, Safra, I know you didn't
give specific guidance for the hardware business. But how are you guys thinking about that going forward?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Engineered Systems bookings grew double digits in the quarter, very strong. We had over 1,500
– I'm doing this off the top my head, 1,500 – 1,600 incremental systems in the quarter, so very strong in Engineered
Systems. We had very strong growth in North America, very good performance out of one of our Oracle Database
appliance products. SuperCluster was very strong in the quarter. We grew in storage in the quarter, and this is really
we're going through a shift in storage now. We released our SAN product, FS1, in the quarter, which saw some
bookings. This is really the first quarter we got any bookings out of FS1, our ZFS product. Somebody has renamed that,
but I haven't certainly...
<A - Kenneth Bond>: VS1.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: VS1, I wish they wouldn't do that to me, so they renamed it VS1.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: It's probably VS4. They shouldn't rename it because it's hard to remember.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I meant [ph] to name it (50:46), but anyway, so we had good growth in that thing as well. And
then we had server performance that declined in the quarter, and then the growth in the other products that I've
described netted to the growth rate that we described. Let's face it, we are the only hardware company growing in the
industry.
So when you look at the market share numbers, they get to be staggering. We've taken over the – and this is not a
question you asked, but I'm going to say it anyway. In the United States, when you look at servers above $15,000, the
number one company in market share now is Oracle. I believe that will occur region by region by region because of the
strength of not just our hardware product line but the alignment of our software portfolio with it. So it was a good
quarter for us in hardware, and I would expect that trend to continue.
Very similar to John's question, I don't think we're telling you that there isn't an on-premise market. Please don't take
that message when we describe, but I think the fact that you can take a workload from your autonomous data center and
now move it seamlessly to the cloud and back and forth to a data center gives us a tremendous advantage. The
configuration we have in the cloud, the configuration we have on premise now can be identical, the ability to move
workloads back and forth, use that on our hardware in your data center, use that on the very same hardware perhaps in
the cloud, we're the only company in the industry that can do this. And so I think this bodes very well for our hardware
business, granted in a declining market. But I believe Oracle will gain market share in that declining market.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Got it. Thanks, guys.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Thank you.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Thank you.
