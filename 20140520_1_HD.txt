Francis S. Blake
Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $19.7 billion, up 2.9% from last year.
Comp sales were positive 2.6%, and our diluted earnings per share were $1.00. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of
3.3%. Our sales for the quarter were below our expectations. In 2013, we experienced the delayed spring in the U.S.
and Canada, and we expected more normal weather for this spring. Instead, much of the U.S. and Canada had an even
colder spring, and this had a significant impact on our sales.
In previous years, we've talked about the bathtub effect that weather can have on our spring seasonal business, where
weak sales in the first quarter are counterbalanced by strength in the seasonal business in the second quarter. We expect
the same effect to be true this year. As we look at the performance of our business in the first quarter, the strength in the
areas of the country where more normal weather existed supports this outlook.
In the U.S., as Craig will discuss, our Northern Division, our largest division, negatively comped, driven by weakness
in seasonal and outdoor categories. But in our Southern and Western Divisions, we not only positive comped, but we
actually did better than we expected. There's been a fair amount of discussion about the fact that many indicators in the
housing market has softened over the last several months leading to the question of whether this indicates that the
housing recovery has run out of steam. As we parse the data from our own business, that is not what we see. The core
categories in the store remains strong, Pro sales continued to grow, our services business grew high-single-digits in the
quarter, and we had another quarter of big ticket growth.
And our fundamental view on the recovery in the home improvement market has not changed. We didn't expect the
recovery in 2014 to be as dramatic as last year's, but we continue to believe that home price appreciation, affordability
in an aging housing stock in need of investment will continue to drive growth.
On the international side, our Canadian business posted a positive comp in local currency for the quarter. In Mexico,
our team posted their 42nd consecutive quarter of positive comps. They also inaugurated an online e-commerce site
piloting it now in limited geographies, but eventually planning for coverage across the country. The power of
interconnected retail and the opportunities it creates for us are now becoming apparent throughout North America,
Canada, Mexico, as well as the U.S. And we are pleased that as we invest in this area, we are seeing a positive response
from our customers, as indicated by improving customer satisfaction surveys and by our sales results.
Our dot-com business had sales growth of almost 40% for the quarter. We are consistently seeing over 3 million visits
per day and our conversion rate continues to increase. Also, our dot-com presence was a contributing factor to our
transaction growth. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales guidance and increasing our earnings per share
guidance for the year to reflect the benefit associated with the sale of a portion of our equity position in HD Supply.
Let me close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication, with a special thank you to all of our
associates who have helped communities in need throughout the country as they deal with floods, tornadoes, and fires.
Based on this quarter's results, over 90% of our stores would be eligible for Success Sharing, our profit sharing

program for our hourly associates. We're proud of this result and look forward to improve on it in the second quarter.
With that, let me turn the call over to Craig.
Craig A. Menear
Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. The extreme winter weather we experienced across much of the Midwest
and northern parts of the country had a negative effect on our sales. However, in areas not affected by the weather, we
are pleased with our performance in the first quarter as we saw continued strength across the store. From a geographic
perspective, 15 of our 19 U.S. regions posted positive comps. The regions with negative comps were heavily impacted
by weather and included New England and the Mid-Atlantic. New York and New Jersey were also negative due to
weather. Further, these two regions were up against tough comparisons given last year's strong repair sales from
Hurricane Sandy, which contributed about $145 million to sales in the first quarter of 2013.
In the Western and Southern Divisions, we had solid positive comp performance, almost twice the U.S. average. The
departments that outperformed the company's average comp were tools, electrical, plumbing, kitchens, bath, hardware,
decor, building materials, millwork, and lighting. Flooring, indoor garden, and paint were positive, but below the
company average, while outdoor garden and lumber were negative.
The core of the store continued to perform well as we saw strength in maintenance and repair categories across the
country, including the Northern Division. HVAC, light bulbs, insulation, cleaning, pipe and fittings, hand tools, safety
and security, water heaters, fasteners, caulk, and air circulation all had comps above the company average. Outdoor
project categories were pressured from the weather and we saw comp sales below the company average in roofing,
chemicals, lawnmowers, soils and mulches, and live goods. As we saw last year, the majority of these projects will
likely be deferred to the second quarter.
On the other hand, our customers continue to complete projects inside the home. In simple décor, bath, lighting, and
hard surface flooring had strong sales that were driven by tile, laminate, setting materials, faucets, and bath fixtures.
Total comp transactions grew by 2.1% for the quarter while average ticket increased 0.6%. Our average ticket increase
was negatively impacted by commodity price deflation mainly from lumber and copper. The total impact to ticket
growth from commodity price deflation was approximately negative 30 basis points.
Despite the softness in outdoor garden, transactions for tickets under $50 represented approximately 20% of our U.S.
sales, were up 1.6% for the first quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900 also represented approximately 20% of our
U.S. sales, were up 2.5% in the first quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were HVAC, Pro
sales, and appliances.
Our Pro customer continues to recover and we saw broad-based strength in areas that were not affected by weather.
Total Pro sales grew at the company average, but sales from our larger Pro customers which we define as those who
spend more than $10,000 a year with us grew more than twice the company average. Our Pro Xtra loyalty program
continues to gain traction and we now signed up over 1.5 million Pros. The goal of the program is to make our Pro
customers' jobs easier and it provides them targeted offers, e-receipts and discounted business services. Our tool rental
and service businesses also performed well during the quarter, posting comps well above the company average. In
services, bath, HVAC, and window installations were the main drivers of sales during the quarter.
We continue to invest in our stores for both our customers and our associates and we are pleased that we are live in our
first store with our new customer order management system, or COM. This system is designed for greater visibility and
execution of special orders by our associates in a frictionless experience for our customers. We are planning for the
system to be rolled out to all U.S. stores by the end of the year.
Now let me turn our attention to merchandising activities in the second quarter. We have an incredible lineup of great
values and special buys for our Memorial Day, Father's Day, and Fourth of July events. We continue to bring new and
innovative products to market. For example, expanding our offering of LED light bulbs from Cree with an additional
10 SKUs, including the 100-watt equivalent and three-way bulbs. New in lawn care from Toro is the first-ever gas

powered mower that can be folded and stored upright in your garage, using 70% less space with virtually no fear of oil
or gas leaks.
For our professional customers, we're introducing a brand-new Glidden Pro Paint program at an outstanding value. The
lineup offers four different types of paint with both the features and price that our Pros are looking for. I'm also pleased
to announce that we are adding KitchenAid to our appliance assortment and it will be available in select stores and
online by the end of the second quarter. These events along with the continued productivity gains and our superior
execution in the stores will generate a lot of excitement in the second quarter.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.
Carol B. Tomé
Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $19.7 billion, a 2.9% increase from last year. Our
total company costs or same-store sales were positive 2.6% for the quarter, with positive comps of 2.2% in February,
3.8% in March, and 2% in April; versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total company comps by
approximately 70 basis points. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 3.3% for the quarter, with positive comps of 2.8%
in February, 4.6% in March, and 2.8% in April. March and April comps were impacted by the timing of Easter. On a
like-for-like basis, April comps would have been 200 basis points higher.
Our total company gross margin was 35% for the quarter, an increase of five basis points from last year. Our gross
margin expansion was driven primarily by a lower penetration of lower-margin categories like lumber and outdoor
garden.
One other comment on gross margin. The harsh winter weather placed a number of challenges on our supply chain. The
team did a great job of managing these challenges and, at the same time, continued to build out our direct fulfillment
capability. While some companies experienced deleverage from their supply chain costs in the first quarter, we did not.
For fiscal 2014, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2013. In
the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 57 basis points to 23.4%. Our expense leverage
reflects the impact of positive comp sales growth as well as a reduction in certain other expense items like management
bonuses. For the year, we are expecting our expenses to grow at approximately 33% of our sales growth rate.
Moving to interest and investment income. At the end of fiscal 2013, we owned 16.25 million shares of HD Supply
common stock, or about 8% percent of outstanding shares. Our initial investment was worth $325 million, but we
impaired and wrote-off the carrying value several years ago. In April, HD Supply completed a secondary offering, and
we participated by exercising our piggyback right. As a result, in the first quarter, we recognized a gain on sale of $97
million, which is reflected in interest and investment income. The net after-tax gain was $61 million, or $0.04 of
diluted earnings per share. Following the sale, our equity stake in HD Supply is now approximately 12.4 million shares,
or 6.3% of outstanding shares.
Our income tax provision rate was 36.9% in the first quarter, and we expect our income tax provision rate to be
approximately 37% for the year. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.00, an increase of 20.5%
from last year. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter included a $0.04 benefit from the gain on sale of HD
Supply shares. During the first quarter, we did not open any new stores. We ended the quarter with 2,263 stores and
selling square footage of 236 million. Total sales per square foot for the first quarter were $334, up 1.8% from last year.
Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $12.3 billion, up approximately $518 million
from a year ago. Inventory turns were 4.4 times, flat to last year. We ended the quarter with $42.6 billion in assets,
including $2.5 billion in cash. In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 15.8 million shares of
outstanding stock. For the remainder of the year, we intend to repurchase approximately $3.75 billion of outstanding
stock using excess cash, bringing total 2014 share repurchases to $5 billion. Computed on the average of beginning and
ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 21.2%, 350 basis points
higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2013.

When we built our 2014 sales plan, it was based on U.S. GDP growth forecasts of approximately 3% and about 200
basis points of growth coming from continued recovery in the housing market. It also assumed that we would have a
normal winter and that commodity prices would remain fairly stable. So what's changed? Well, we didn't have a normal
winter. But as Craig detailed, we believe that most of the sales lost to snow on the ground in the first quarter will be
realized in the second quarter. While U.S. GDP growth in the first quarter was weak, consensus forecasts for the year
are still in the 3% area. Housing statistics are not as robust as they were last year, but they aren't materially different
than the assumptions we used to build our plan.
Finally, while we experienced commodity price deflation in the first quarter, commodity prices appear to be stabilizing.
As we look at our U.S. comp performance in the first quarter, we estimate that the harsh winter weather negatively
impacted our comp sales by about 100 basis points and that commodity deflation negatively impacted our comp sales
by about 30 basis points. Additionally, as Craig mentioned, in the first quarter, we had $145 million of sales pressure
coming from Superstorm Sandy sales last year. Considering these factors, the run rate for our U.S. business in the first
quarter was in line with our expectations.
Further, May sales are robust. So, today, we are reaffirming the sales guidance we laid out on our fourth quarter
earnings call and we expect fiscal 2014 sales to increase by approximately 4.8% with positive comps of approximately
4.6%. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We are lifting fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per
share growth guidance to reflect the gain on sale of HD Supply stock and now expect diluted earnings per share to
grow by approximately 17.6% to $4.42.
We thank you for your participation in today's call, and, Levi, we're now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to our first question from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Carol, I think you got some people excited with that word, robust.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Good morning, Dennis.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Good morning. I guess the financial question is just maybe elaborating on that if you can
especially I'm sure the question will be asked against the tough comps from last year which I think were among the
strongest of the entire year, and how you think about maybe where you're seeing that category-wise.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, you're right; we're up against very tough comps. Our comp in May last year was
double-digit, but we're very pleased with our results thus far. And maybe, Craig, you want to give a little color?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yeah, we continue to see strength across the store as we did in the quarter, and as the weather
improves, we're seeing an improvement obviously in our seasonal businesses in exterior categories.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Okay. And then secondarily, on the inventory side, I think with that being up maybe this ties
into the trend, but how would you describe what you're – what you'd expect from inventory turns in inventory through
the year? And maybe just address anywhere where there's elevated inventory relative to expectations and how that
might impact margin as we move forward?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Inventory is up year-on-year a little over $500 million. That's really a reflection of the sales
environment in Q1. We're starting to see the inventory come down in line with the robust sales that we're seeing in
May. We would expect to have inventory turn year-over-year improvement by the end of the year.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Okay, great. Thank you.

And we'll go to our next question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Good morning.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: I, too, wanted to just quickly address the recent sales commentary. So obviously, robust is a
strong word here and the markets reacted favorably to that, but as you look at as the weather is turning here – and
maybe more of a qualitative type question – but as the weather's turning, how would you characterize the products that
consumers are buying now? Is there – are you seeing clear evidence that there's a lot of repair type items they're buying
and that maybe the typical spring type products are still to come or is there just – now it's a catch-up to spring?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yeah, we are seeing obviously the spring categories begin to take off. We know that
landscape products need to be replaced. We're seeing sales improve in those areas. We know that in the harsh winter
areas, for example, concrete cracked, so we're seeing sales in categories like concrete as a result of the repairs needed.
Same thing in gutters.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Okay. And then a follow up question and a comment or a question, Frank, your opening
comments about the overall housing environment, there's a lot being talked or written about now just about slower
housing turn and maybe some of the reasons behind that are supply-driven. But do you see – as you look at The Home
Depot business, do you think slower housing turn right now is a significant drag upon the business? Or other factors
more than making up for that?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Brian, we believe as we set out before that home price appreciation is one of the important
drivers of our business – that as homeowners get more comfortable that the spend on their houses that they'll be able to
recoup that investment that, that's a big tailwind for us and we've seen continued home price appreciation even during
some softening of other housing indicators. That's not to say that the other indicators aren't important to us. Housing
turnover – existing housing turnover obviously does drive sales for us, but it's always worth remembering that, that's a
relatively small percentage of the overall homeowners, it's around between 4% to 6%, depending on the year.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And to put it in perspective, housing turnover is at 4% of units today and that's what we use
when we built our plan.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Okay. Okay, well, thank you very much.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Thank you.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Thanks, Brian.
Operator
And we'll go to our next question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning. So I'll try to sharpen the robust pencil point as well. So as
you think about May, is sort of the bounce in the landscape business is – the comparison in April and May were pretty
similar overall last year so does that acceleration mean more than sequential? I.e., is it accelerating on the outdoor
business – out, accelerating on a year-over-year basis May relative to April?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: It does. And when I answer your question positively, I'm referring to the adjusted April which
was a little over 4%. So May is higher than the adjusted April.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: Perfect. And then as you think about sort of the underlying tenor of the business, the
Pro was in line overall obviously stronger in the West. Do you think that the weather did have an impact on the Pro
business during the quarter in the Northern Divisions? And is that sort of seeing a similar bounce as you look at May?

<A - Francis S. Blake>: Yeah, Chris, you could see that in our numbers that there's a difference with the Pro in the
South and West versus the North. I don't know, Marvin, you might want to comment on that?
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: Yeah, Chris, I think that's exactly right. Craig mentioned that our large Pro, which we
defined as spending in excess of $10,000 plus per year, was very strong in the quarter. We actually saw some strength
in the Northern Division, specifically the Midwest central part of the region. So we're excited about the Pro business.
We put a lot of emphasis on service in the store. We have outside sales reps that are managing those larger accounts
and we're seeing a lot of positive growth and we're excited about initiatives like Pro Xtra which is our loyalty program
which we have 1.5 million Pros signed up. So we're excited that we have a lot of work to do, but we have good
momentum going.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: And then the final question in terms of the commentary around the deflation in the
quarter. Do you think that – do you expect that to flatten out for the rest of the year? Or will that – what's the shape of
that curve look like going forward?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, the good news is that lumber's actually anniversaried and is now ahead of last year.
Structural panel is down, but it's heading in the right direction. Copper yesterday was up, so it's our point of view that
it'll normalize – flatten out.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: Perfect. Thanks very much.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: You're welcome.
Operator
And we'll go to our next question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot, and good morning.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Morning.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: My first question relates to the sequential sales trends in the South and West in the first
quarter relative to the fourth quarter. Presumably those are regions that weren't really impacted by the inclement
weather. You should tell us if there was some impact perhaps from the drought out on the West Coast. How did the
comp trend in Q1 compare to what you'd see in Q4 in the second half of last year?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well...
<A - Francis S. Blake>: I got to pull-up from memory where we were. What I would tell you, Matt, is as I said in the
commentary that both the South and the West were ahead of what we had planned for on a sequential comp basis.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. And then my second...
<A - Francis S. Blake>: I would also note...
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Sorry...
<A - Francis S. Blake>: I would also note that, that was even with some weakness in the garden areas because of...
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Drought.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Well, and also in Texas we had a slower spring so that was true even with that. So slight – it
went down slightly from Q4 but again ahead of our expectations.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. And then my second question I think is for Craig. Flooring is a category that you
cited is tracking I believe a bit below positive, but a bit below the chain average and that's a business that I guess is
indoor-driven and I wouldn't be sure if there's a weather impact. So can you talk about what's going on in that category,

please?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yeah, what we saw was softness in the soft side of flooring. It's really difficult to lay carpet
when you have snow on the driveway because generally as they come in and do those projects that carpet gets laid out
and cut in the customer's driveway. So we saw it there but we were very pleased with the hard surface flooring sales.

And we'll go to our next question from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Good morning, and thank you for answering my question and taking my question. You talked
about the dot-com being up 40% year-over-year. I don't remember if you gave us our comp store sales impact, Carol, if
you might do that?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yeah, I'd be happy to give you just a little bit more color on dot-com sales. The sales growth for
dot-com year-on-year was $232 million, now making up 4.2% of our total penetration. And for the U.S., the comp
contribution is a little over 100 basis points.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Okay. And was there much difference regionally? Could you see any weather impact on that?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: So we have Kevin Hofmann here. Kevin's our – President of our Online business. Kevin, if
you want to respond to that?
<A - Kevin Hofmann>: Yeah, thanks, Budd. Very, very little difference regionally. Of course, we saw in the South
and West a bigger pickup of seasonally-related categories. And certainly in the North, people weren't buying a lot of
patio sets and lawnmowers, but not as big of a regional difference as you would see in the physical stores.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Okay. And my second question really goes to gross margin. I think your guidance for the year is
flat gross margin. I think you restated that this morning. You had up 5 basis points, but you had some challenges in the
first quarter that you referred to from the weather so maybe that gross margin is going to be a little bit better than you
originally thought?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, Budd, we plan for our gross margin to be down in the first quarter because we thought we
would have a higher penetration of lumber and garden than we experienced. So we were pleased with the performance,
of course, but it was really a function of sales. So as you think about the second quarter then as we recover in those
categories, you should plan on the gross margin in the second quarter to be down year-on-year. For the full-year, would
expect the margin be flat.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Okay. As always, Carol, thank you very much for that color. Good luck on the quarter and the
rest of the year.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Thank you.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Thanks, Budd.

<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, thank you. A few things about the expense performance in the first quarter. We called out
lower expense items and one big one would be management bonuses. A year ago, we were accruing bonuses with a
beat to plan. We're now accruing that we will make plan and that delta is about $27 million. So that was one of the
ways that we drove expense leverage just a function of last year we were beating, this year we think we'll make our
plan.
We did – and Marvin did an excellent job and Craig managing payroll in the stores in a very difficult environment as
you can appreciate. We did leverage hourly payroll as we expected in the stores. We looked at expense items and where
we could push some expense into the second quarter, we did. For example, advertising was under our plan because we
thought why advertise into a snowstorm? So we pushed some of that spending to the second quarter. For the full-year,
we expect our expenses to grow at about 33% of our sales growth rate. As you're building your model, expect the first
quarter and the fourth quarter to be under our guidance and the second and third quarter to be over our guidance, it's
just a function of year-over-year items, and for the full-year, growth of 33% of sales growth.

And we'll go to our next question from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. Two things. Hoping, first, you can add
some clarity on how we should interpret the spring Black Friday promotions? I know in the past the industry has kind
of moved more to everyday low price. What's the internal debate about whether or not we're moving away from that at
the margin? And how should we think about that?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: So as it relates to spring Black Friday or any of our key promotional activities, heavily
centered around special buys, that's kind of been a strategy that our company has had from its inception, to go out work
deals with our suppliers, drive productivity in their factories. We get a savings, we pass that savings along to the
customer. So, not a real big change.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: Okay. So that's not kind of a slippery slope that we're starting to climb onto?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: No.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: No.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: And if you could talk a little bit about space allocation in the stores now that you're
realizing online can be a great place. I know your patio furniture is one area where you guys have pushed kind of a
showroom type of philosophy. What other areas of the store are you kind of deploying the showroom philosophy?
Where are you surprised that customers are taking product with? And where can you steer them towards that more
showroom mentality? And how much space might that ultimately be able to free up in your store?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Actually, I'd start with – we've added space to our appliance business. That was a result of a
change in how the customer begins the purchase process in kitchens, where they're leveraging digital technology to do
research upfront. So in many of the spaces where we expanded our appliance showroom, we actually took that from our
kitchen showroom business. As you referenced, in patio, we see strong sales transitioning to the customer looking for
choice online. So we obviously are using that to expand as well. We also are working pilots in lighting to have a similar
type effect, where we can show product, a broader breadth of assortment in lighting and sell it through the digital
channel.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: And just the last thing, is there a way to use technology, like big LED screens or something
like that instead of these large vignettes, whether it's for kitchens and lighting and things like that to save space and
maybe just use kind of an interactive display? And then I'll leave you be.

<A - Craig A. Menear>: What I would say there is we have put an appliance kiosk, a larger screen, into our stores.
What we have found is that it is a great selling tool for our associates and for the customer to be able to do comparisons
on product. Our experience has been that not a lot of engagement with the customer by themselves, more of an assisted
sale.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: So, Aram, in total, 450 additional stores this year will have some sort of an appliance change
made to them, either more square footage or another kiosk. So, yes, technology is a way that we can help drive sales.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: Thank you, guys.

Operator
And we'll go to our next question from Greg Melich with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the appliance point, then I had another question. Given
the added stores that you have on appliances, I know that the jumbo set helped last year. Can you help us with how
much it helped comp or ticket this year?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: For the total company, it contributed about 10 basis points of comp growth.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: A lot less. Okay, great. And then I think the second question was more of a technical one,
Carol. If the fourth quarter has an extra week, how come the SG&A doesn't grow as much in that quarter?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: It's just the year-over-year expense items.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: So it's just sort of the end of the year stuff coming together, it's just you expect less in the
fourth quarter?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Exactly.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay. I did want to ask Craig one thing. You mentioned COMS, the customer order
management system, you're finally rolling out. Could you just explain that from a customer perspective, what's
different about that when I come in and what your early results have shown?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Well, we've just begun the pilot in the first store. But what we're trying to do is give greater
visibility to the consumer and our associates to special orders throughout the process. So when they actually place an
order, to understand the status of that order, where it is in the process of manufacturing, and then obviously arrival to
our stores. And we want to be able to give that visibility to our associates in the stores, so they can better answer
questions, as well, for our consumers during that process. And it's a coordinating effort that drives back into our
manufacturers, our suppliers, to be able to coordinate all the way through the supply chain.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: If I could just pile on, each store is like a brain. And we had these customer orders were central
to the store. So if you shopped in a store in Manhattan and then were visiting a store in Chicago, you couldn't see your
order in Chicago. But now, because we have a common order management, you'll be able to see the order wherever you
shop. So that's good for the customer and good for the associates.
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: Greg, this is Marvin. In the past, your greatest visibility was a phone call to an associate in
the store for a status update, and we want to give the information to the customer at their convenience, mobile device,
PC, text, allow the customer to choose how they want to receive that information.
<A - Matthew A. Carey>: And Greg, this is Matt Carey. I would also add that, believe it or not, a lot of these orders
used to be faxed to the vendors. And, obviously, a lot of opportunity for error. So we've eliminated those faxes, put it
on EDI, and really kind of started to streamline how those orders flow.

<A - Craig A. Menear>: It is. All of our large suppliers have that capability, and we're working with some of our
smaller suppliers to bring them up.

And we'll go to our next question from David Strasser with Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - David S. Strasser>: Thank you very much. I had two questions. The first one, in the first quarter, you saw the big
ticket decelerate. I mean, obviously I'm sure some of it had to do with weather. Can you quantify how much of that
deceleration came from weather? And then as things kind of rebounded again in May, if you saw that number bounce,
the bigger ticket bounce, along with the rest of the business back into sort of the range of the 5% plus that you had been
seeing the last couple of quarters?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: David, it's a little difficult to quantify the weather impact. But what I can tell you is categories
like roofing, categories like riders, which are significant drivers to the larger ticket, were clearly softer in the first
quarter. We can assume that that's weather-related.
<Q - David S. Strasser>: I mean, do you think that the numbers are holding up relatively? Like if you, if there is any
sort of sense of normalization – as you looked at May, I guess, did those bigger ticket things bounce back as rapidly as
sort of the live stuff in the rest of lawn and garden?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We haven't parsed the data in that kind of detail, but we will now. And so we'll talk to you
about it at the end of the quarter.
<Q - David S. Strasser>: All right, thanks. One other – a follow up question, as you look at May and the robust sales
that you saw, how do you guys adjust the infrastructure of the business to be able to add to that? The difficulties of bad
weather, good weather, bad weather, good weather, how do you adjust that, delivery systems and your systems and
your ability to deliver to the customer with inventory in-stocks and deliveries and everything, in such a volatile
environment, I guess?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: David, just two comments on that. You hit two big points of variability in our business: our
labor force and our supply chain, and then also our vendor responsiveness. And what you saw in the first quarter of this
year, as well as the first quarter and second quarter last year, was the ability of our teams to be very flexible in terms of
responding both to lower demand and significantly increased demand. And we have Mark Holifield here, who leads our
supply chain effort. Mark, you might want to comment on the supply chain side of that, and Marvin, on the payroll side
of it.
<A - Mark Holifield>: Yeah, it was a very challenging quarter from a supply chain perspective with transportation
rates and the weather led to a lot of issues there. But the RDC network really gives us the capability to respond along
with our stock in D.C. So the team worked very hard and used the infrastructure that we built which is quite flexible
and we were able to respond to the weather.
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: David, the only thing I'll add in the stores is that we partner very closely with the supply
chain. As you know, our payroll model is activity-based and so we flex up and flex down based on our forecasted sales.
It's a challenge when you are forecasting or planning sales to be higher than the weather is permitting, but very proud

And we'll go to our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions, actually. First, we can see the
relationship between home improvement comps and housing turnover, but I guess when you look at it and parse it more
on a category level, what categories and what product areas have exhibited the tightest relationship with that metric in
the past? So is it flooring, is it appliances? What typically are consumers doing when they're moving into a home or
moving out of a home? And the obvious question is will that allow us to observe those areas and see some sense if the
sector's going to become re-coupled with that metric over the next couple of quarters?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Michael, one comment I'd make is it depends a bit on the nature of the turnover. So if you go
back to 2005 and 2006, one of the categories that was really a hallmark of turns and sales were special order kitchens.
People would buy homes, they'd invest in the kitchen, they'd do upgrades and then they'd turn the home. That's actually
the category for us that got hit the hardest over the housing crash. Don't expect with the housing turnover that we think
is going to grow as we go through this recovery – don't expect to get that same kind of response on turnover. Expect
more the upgrades around you've got to make sure the infrastructure of your home is right, you may paint, you may do
some gardening, so I think it's going to be different as we go through this housing recovery than what we saw at the
height of the housing market. And I don't know, Carol or Craig, if you want to add some commentary to that?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: I would agree, of course, and also suggest that we should look at home price appreciation
harder than we do turnover because turnover is only 4% of units. Home price appreciation really impacts the way
people spend money on their homes. We saw last year – if you think about pricing along a good, better, best premium
array, we saw growth in premium price categories in every quarter of last year and that continued into the first quarter
of this year.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay, that's helpful. And, Frank, just to follow up on some your comments, there's probably no
other senior executive in the country who's got a better vantage point into what's happening in just the housing market
based on what you see in your stores and your conversations with your vendor partners. Do you have a working
hypothesis on why turnover has slowed?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Well, I'd say first look for the obvious explanations first. And the obvious explanation is
mortgage rate increases. And you could look – mortgage rates took a pretty significant jump up in the summer of 2013
and you saw a not surprising response to that in the housing market. I would say and just to emphasize Carol's point, I
would say actually the surprising part has been how strong housing price appreciation is notwithstanding that. So the
way we look at it obviously we think the mortgage rate increases had some pressure on housing turnover – credit
availability is still a bit of an issue. It's good – the recent announcements from the government on how they're
approaching Fannie and Freddie are interesting and may be helpful there, but between mortgage rates and credit
constraints, we think that that is what's put a bit of a damper on some of the variables in the housing market.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay. Let me ask one final question on the e-commerce business, 40%, nearly 40% growth in
the first quarter, another good outcome. Albeit a little slower than the nearly 50% growth that you saw in the fourth
quarter last year. Is it becoming harder to sustain the growth as the business becomes a bigger piece of the total? Or is
there – was there some other dynamic that's going on there to explain the slight deceleration? Thank you very much.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, I would say, first of all, our dot-com business grew faster than what we planned. So we
were very pleased by this. Remember, we are anniversarying the launch of Buy Online, Ship to Store. So we had

expected growth rates to slow down, it was better than we thought. And in fact, if you look at the $232 million of
growth that we saw the first quarter, almost $100 million of that came from BOSS related sales. So this is a business
that's growthy. It's a business that we continue to invest into because it's part of our interconnected retail strategy.

And we'll take our next question from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Good morning.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Good morning.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Good morning.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: You talked about the Pro loyalty effort, and I know there's a couple of other things you're
piloting within Pro. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that and how you might think that would start to show
up in the numbers as we work our way through 2014?
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: So, Eric, this is Marvin. I'll give you an overview of the program. We call it Pro Xtra. And
as Craig mentioned, we've signed up roughly 1.5 million Pros. It's a very basic program. We're trying to do three
things. We want to make sure that we get our Pro signed up so we can give them some exclusive offers, things like
e-receipts which will give them a more seamless return process. You know Pros tend to buy more than they need when
they're working on projects and jobs and we want to make sure that that returns process is seamless and easy.
We give them discounted business tools. As an example, if you're a roofer, it's very difficult for you to get a contract to
get satellite imaging. If you sign on to Pro Xtra, we give you discounted fees for that, because we have a company
contract. We also give them discounts on things like background checks. So just business tools to help them run a better
business and an opportunity to tie-in to things they can't afford as a small business person. And also, exclusive offers. If
you signup, we work with Craig and his merchandising team, and we have exclusive offers that we will make available
only to Pros that are in this club, in this loyalty program.
We've seen very positive results. We've seen frequency in shopping increase. We've seen ticket increase and size of
basket increase. It's very early, so we're not proclaiming victory. We just think we're onto something that we can build
on, and we're looking forward to the future benefits of it.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Perfect. And then secondly, in terms of promotions, I know you commented earlier about spring
Black Friday, but as you think about the delayed spring, how you're thinking about managing promotions and
managing inventory inflow and out from here and what risks or challenge that might create to gross margins as we
work our way through 2Q?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Eric, obviously, we establish our event cadence and work our special buys long in advance
and those are set and ready to go for the second quarter. We're very comfortable with our inventory positions in terms
of beginning the quarter and how we feel we'll come out. As Carol mentioned, we're already seeing the inventory come
down at this point as we've seen the pickup in the business as a result of improved weather.

quarterly cadence, would you expect Q2 to be your best quarter or Q4 given the easy comparison? Any thoughts on
how evenly spread or unevenly spread the business might look?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: So our forecast is that Q4 would be slightly stronger the Q2. But let me just say that that band,
Q2, Q3, Q4, is pretty narrow.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Okay. And then I know in the past when you've had flexibility to take the buyback up, you
have taken on some debt. Just curious, I know you outlined your plan for the balance of the year. Does that mean that
you've eliminated the possibility of doing more? Or is it just too early to say?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, Dan, as you know, we have an adjusted debt to EBITDAR target, if you will, of 2 times.
Today, the ratio stands at 1.8 times. It is not our intent to let that ratio continue to decline which it will as we continue
to earn unless we borrow back up. So certainly haven't taken anything off the table. As you recall, last year, we said at
the beginning of the year, we'd do $4.5 billion of share repurchases. We ended up doing $8.5 billion.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Right. And then finally, just on HD Supply, just curious what drove the decision behind
selling a part of the stake versus the whole stake?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We have piggyback rights, so we followed along with the selling shareholders on a pro rata
basis. And it was really – it's a passive investment for us, so it made a lot of sense. If the selling shareholders go back to
the market again, we'll follow along in a pro rata basis and just liquidate our position in an orderly fashion.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Great. Thank you.

And we'll go to our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Good morning, guys. Two questions. First, given the correlation of your sales trends and home
price changes, have you seen any change in sales trends in areas where home price gains may have slowed a bit?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, we look at Phoenix, for example, because there's been a bit of a slowdown in home price
appreciation in Phoenix. And no, not seeing anything materially changed.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Okay. So how do you explain that just given the correlation that we've seen? As long as we're
kind of moving in – staying in positive territory, people are more willing to spend? Is that the right way to kind of
interpret it?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: That's what we – it's part of the overall recovery.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Okay. And then second, how are you guys thinking about the damage that's likely been done to
housing infrastructure in a lot of these weather-affected markets? In other words, when you think about your 2Q
outlook, are you simply thinking about your preplanned promos in outdoor gardening kind of spring-like product
categories? Or are you also factoring in any kind of increase from extra repair work to housing infrastructure? Because
I would suspect that could be a driver in the near- to mid-term as well.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: There's certainly landscape repair that has to happen. We know that there's roof patch that
will take place in certain areas based on ice damage. So we've tried to look at, in general, what's the planning for the
seasonal categories, how does that fit in and then look at categories that you would think naturally would potentially
rise, like gutters and so on, and appropriately adjust our inventory to capture those sales.
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: Scot, this is Marvin. We have a roofing, siding, and windows services business and the only
thing I'd piggyback on to Craig's comments is we have to staff up. So as we forecast increased activity, we just have to
make sure we're staffed so that we can meet the demands of the customers and we'll see where we land from a revenue

<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hey. Thanks, guys. Just one question for Craig, just on the windows business, you talked
about window installation being strong. Can you give us some perspective on that business, where that sits today versus
maybe the historical cycle? Is that telling you something about the remodel activity going on? What can you tell us
about the window trends?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: As Frank had mentioned, one of the categories that we got hit hard in was kitchens. Likewise,
the window business went through a pretty significant downturn as well in the 2008-2009 area. We're seeing a nice
improvement in the millwork business in total and in the window business. So we're very pleased with the current
trends in that business.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: And is it widespread across the country or is it concentrated in any specific area?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: No, it's fairly widespread.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, thanks very much.
<A - Diane Dayhoff>: And we have time for one more question.

And we'll go to our next question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Peter J. Keith>: Hey. Thanks, everyone, for squeezing me in. I think I just have one last question for you. When
you're talking about the importance of home price appreciation, we certainly agree with that. I was hoping you could
put on your economist hat, though, and maybe even looking out beyond this year, do you see a couple years of home
price appreciation? Do you think it's going to slow down to 1%, 2% after 2014? I'm curious on how you view sort of
the multi-year outlook on that metric.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Peter, I would say one of the underlying questions on that is the basic supply and demand
equation. And you see a lot of wrestling with the question on household formation now. What happened definitely
during the housing downturn was a dramatic drop in household formation. We know that there has been a substantial
increase of folks between the ages of 18 and 35 who are still living at home. That creates a potential pent-up demand,
assuming that they eventually form their own household and their own household units that would allow for continuing
gains in price appreciation, recognizing that always you're looking at overall affordability as a key part of the equation.
But for right now, houses are very affordable. We're at really – within the last 20 years, this is probably one of the most
affordable readings on housing you're going to see. So supply and demand equation, what's going to happen with
household formation would be the real question to ask over the next several years. And we think it's going to be a
positive dynamic.
<Q - Peter J. Keith>: Okay. I appreciate that, Frank, and congratulations to everyone on operating in a tough weather
environment.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Thank you.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Thanks very much, Peter.
