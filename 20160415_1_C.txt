factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC
filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K.
With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.
Mike L. Corbat
Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone.
Earlier today we reported earnings of $3.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016 or $1.10 per share. These results reflected
difficult macro environment, which was more challenging than we anticipated when we entered the year. That said, we
continued to make progress in key areas. We grew loans and deposits in our core businesses, utilized deferred tax
assets, generated and returned capital to shareholders, and reduced our expenses while absorbing a significant
repositioning charge.
In our institutional businesses, market-sensitive products clearly suffered from weak investor sentiment during the
quarter. This primarily impacted our trading and Investment Banking revenues. However, our accrual and transaction
service businesses posted 7% year-on-year growth, consistent with recent quarters. These businesses are gaining market
share and now contribute almost half of our institutional revenues.
Investor sentiment was also impacted our consumer business, including wealth management and, especially, in Asia.
And while U.S. Branded Cards showed stronger performance across key indicators, both top and bottom line results
remained lower due the investments we're making in that business.
Overall, credit trends remained very stable in our consumer portfolios as we continued to focus on our targeted
segments. Our Global Consumer Bank is now entirely focused on our priority markets of the U.S., Mexico and Asia,
and we see real path for growing our franchise. We've been optimizing our footprint in terms of countries and branches
to make sure we're allocating our resources to areas where they can generate the best returns.
In the last three years, we've exited or are in the process of exiting from 19 consumer markets. And in February, we
announced we would sell our consumer businesses in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia and focus solely on growing our
institutional business in South America. During the quarter, we also reduced our branch footprint by 82, while
increasing our average deposits in our nearly 2,700 branches globally.
We also took a repositioning charge in the quarter. The repositioning is part of our effort to make sure Citi's
appropriately sized and structured for the current environment. We've identified opportunities for greater efficiencies in
our regional models, including additional de-layering and shifting staff to our service centers, which now host more
than half of our people. That'll drive an additional reduction of head count, which was down 3% during the quarter, to
225,000, almost 40,000 fewer than when I became CEO.
We also drove another significant reduction of assets in Citi Holdings, which were down 10% from the end of last year
and down 44% from one year ago. For the seventh quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable. And while our work isn't
done, with Holdings' assets now accounting for just 4% of our balance sheet, we won't report Holdings separately after
this year.
I think being able to do this is a testament to the excellent work of the Holdings team, which we expect to remain
intact, and continue to unwind the remaining assets. The wind-down of Citi Holdings is a significant milestone for our
institution and has been a long time goal. We said we'd take Citi Holdings to a point where its assets weren't
meaningful enough to merit separate reporting and that's what we're doing.
Another area we focused on is shrinking our deferred tax assets. In the first quarter, we utilized an additional $1.6
billion in DTAs which contributed to a net increase of $6 billion in regulatory capital and our CET1 ratio increasing to
12.3%. We continued to return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing 31 million common shares during the quarter,
bringing the net reduction of outstanding shares to just under 100 million over the last four quarters. Our Tangible
Book Value per share increased almost $2 to $62.58 in the quarter.

We continue to make progress in our efforts to be a safer and stronger institution. And earlier this week, we learned that
neither the Fed nor the FDIC found any deficiencies in our 2015 Resolution Plan. And last week, we submitted our
capital plan to the Federal Reserve. We believe that the combination of an even stronger capital position and the
improvements we've made in our capital planning process as well as in our risk management, compliance and control
functions have allowed us to make a strong submission.
While 2016 didn't get off to the start we hoped for, the environment stabilized in the second half of the quarter.
Volatility decreased as some of the more pessimistic scenarios failed to materialize. However, the outlook is still ripe
with risk from political elections to interest rates. I think as we've shown in this quarter, we can manage through
challenging times. We think we have – where we have too much capacity, we'll reduce it while still serving our clients.
We think certain sectors are showing signs of weakness. We'll manage our exposures even more tightly.
John will now go through the presentation, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. John?
John C. Gerspach
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide three, we highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our
prior period results. Beginning this quarter, we adopted FASB's new accounting standard on the reporting of DVA or
debt valuation adjustments. Under the new rule, changes in DVA that relate to Citi's own credit spreads are no longer
recognized in earnings, but instead are reflected in OCI. So we no longer need to adjust our reported revenues and net
income to exclude this item. Going forward, therefore, we will speak to reported results in our earnings presentation,
which should be largely comparable to the historical results excluding CVA/DVA.
On slide four, we show total Citigroup results. In the first quarter, we earned $3.5 billion. Revenues of $17.6 billion
declined 11% from last year, mostly driven by lower industry-wide activity in Markets and Investment Banking, the
continued wind-down of Citi Holdings and the impact of FX translation. In constant dollars, revenues were down 9%,
including a 6% decline in our core Citicorp businesses.
Expenses decreased 3% year over year, driven by the wind-down of Citi Holdings, lower legal expenses and a benefit
from FX translation, partially offset by higher repositioning costs and ongoing investments in the franchise. And net
credit losses continued to improve, offset by a loan loss reserve build this quarter compared to a net release in the prior
year.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 1% year over year to $619 billion, as 5% growth in Citicorp
was partially offset by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings. And deposits grew 5% to $935 billion.
On slide five, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp revenues of $16.1 billion were down 9%
from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, as I mentioned, revenues were down 6% from last year, mostly
driven by capital markets related businesses, Fixed Income, Equities, Investment Banking and Asia wealth
management as well as the impact of our continued investments in U.S. Branded Cards.
Citicorp expenses increased 2%, reflecting the higher repositioning charges and ongoing investments in our franchise,
partially offset by efficiency savings and a benefit from FX translation. And cost of credit grew 29% from the first
quarter of last year, almost entirely driven by the energy sector. Otherwise, credit quality remained favorable.
In ICG, we saw very little net cost of credit outside of energy this quarter. And in consumer, our NCL and delinquency
rates both continued to improve, although, we are not benefiting from reserve releases as we had in the prior year.
Citi Holdings contributed pre-tax earnings of $477 million this quarter, mostly driven by gains on asset sales. For the
remainder of the year, we expect Citi Holdings to be closer to break-even. We reduced Citi Holdings' assets by $8
billion this quarter, ending the period with $73 billion of assets or just 4% of total Citigroup, with signed agreements in
place to sell $10 billion of this remaining amount. And, as Mike noted earlier, 2016 is the last year we will report Citi
Holdings as a separate segment.

Turning now to each business, on slide six, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In
total, International Consumer Banking revenues declined 2% year over year. In Latin America consumer, which is now
comprised solely of our Mexico franchise, revenues grew 2%, as growth in retail banking continued to be partially
offset by pressure in cards.
We saw good momentum in retail banking drivers, including 11% growth in average deposits and 9% growth in
average retail loans. However, card balances remained under pressure in Mexico as continued growth in purchase sales
was offset by higher payment rates, reflecting our focus on higher credit quality segments of the market.
Turning to Asia, consumer revenues declined 4% year over year, driven by weak investment sales revenues as well as
continued but abating regulatory pressures in cards. Outside of wealth management, retail banking revenues continued
to grow year over year. And in cards, we believe we are through the most significant regulatory headwinds, which I'll
discuss more in a moment.
In total, average international loans grew 1% from last year. Card purchase sales grew 4% and average deposits grew
5%. Operating expenses grew 4%, driven by higher repositioning charges and an increase in technology investments
primarily in Mexico, while core expenses in Asia were roughly flat. And finally, total international consumer credit
costs increased 7% from last year, reflecting the impact of reserve releases in the prior period. Net credit losses
declined and the NCL rate improved to 1.6%.
On slide seven, we show Asia Consumer in more detail. The first quarter is historically a strong period for wealth
management in Asia with higher transaction activity driving strong investment sales revenues. Given weak investor
sentiment during the quarter, we didn't see the typical rebound in transaction activity and, therefore, our wealth
management revenues declined significantly from last year.
However, we have seen consistent net inflows in our assets under management as you can see on the slide with the
declining year-over-year trend in AUMs driven by the impact of lower equity market values. Therefore, we remain
well-positioned to serve these clients as market confidence improves in the future.
Turning to cards, card purchase sales have slowed in the current environment, but payment rates have stabilized. And
as a result, our average card loans have continued to grow. As we begin to cycle past the most significant regulatory
headwinds, this loan growth is starting to have a positive impact on revenues. So, while card revenues still declined
year over year, the trends continued to improve and we believe we are on a path to achieve revenue growth in cards by
the second half of the year and credit trends remain favorable across the entire consumer business in Asia.
Slide eight shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues declined 4% year over year. Retail
Banking revenues of $1.3 billion were roughly flat, excluding $110 million gain on the sale of our Texas branches last
year, as continued growth in loans and deposit spreads was offset by lower mortgage gain on sale revenues.
In Branded Cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 6% from last year, driven by higher acquisition and rewards
costs, as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products. I'll talk more about Branded
Cards in a moment, but we continue to feel good about the investments we are making. And in fact, we saw
year-over-year growth in our average loans this quarter for the first time since 2008.
And turning to retail services, revenues of $1.7 billion increased 3% from last year, mostly reflecting gains on the sale
of two small portfolios. Even including the impact of these asset sales, average loans were flat year over year and
purchase sales increased 2%.
Total expenses of $2.5 billion in North America increased 7%, driven by higher repositioning costs and marketing
investments, partially offset by efficiency savings as we continued to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our
branch footprint. As previously announced we exited over 50 branches this quarter as we continue to concentrate on
our key markets and adapt to its significant shift in customer behavior to digital channels.
And finally, credit costs in North America increased 17% from last year, driven by our reserve build of approximately
$80 million this quarter in our commercial portfolio related to energy credits. Our energy exposure in the commercial
business is significantly smaller than the corporate portfolio we report in the ICG.

On a global basis, we have energy exposure of $2.1 billion in the commercial business with $1.4 billion funded, 90% of
which is in North America. The credits are mostly in the E&P and services and drilling segments and are
predominantly non-investment-grade. We have no exposure in the commercial portfolio to junior or second-lien
positions, and our funded reserve ratio is roughly 9%. We provide more details on this portfolio in the appendix to our
earnings presentation.
On slide nine we show some key performance indicators for North America Branded Cards, including year-over-year
growth in average active accounts, average card loans, and purchase sales for our total portfolio. In the second half of
last year, we began to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products, and these investments are beginning to
have a significant impact.
Growth in average active accounts and purchase sales began to accelerate late last year, and these trends are now
driving total loan growth as well, even as our legacy portfolios continue to shrink. Card revenues were still down year
over year this quarter, but we believe we can return to growth sometime in the latter part of 2016, not including the
benefit of acquiring the Costco portfolio.
Slide 10 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter,
with stable to improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region.
So as we look at our Consumer franchise globally, there are a few themes to highlight on slide 11. First is the impact of
the current environment on market-sensitive businesses, including wealth management as well as mortgage, which
together drove our year-over-year decline in revenues of nearly $150 million. Second is our continued investment in
U.S. cards, which is putting pressure on revenues today, but is also starting to drive real underlying performance
improvement. And third is the impact of regulatory changes in our business, particularly in Asia, which we believe is
abating.
When you pull back these drivers, you can see we are achieving growth, although muted, driven by overall growth in
personal loans, card volumes, and deposits. And we've achieved this growth with very little change in our core
expenses. In fact, year over year, the entire increase in our consumer operating expenses was driven by the combination
of investments and higher repositioning costs.
As we move forward, we believe we are making the right investments to grow the higher return markets and products
in our franchise, and that as these investments mature and we cycle past the remaining regulatory headwinds, we will
be well positioned to drive higher returns to something in the range of 20% RoTCE in a more normal rate environment.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide 12, revenues of $8 billion in the first quarter declined 12% from
last year, driven by market-sensitive businesses, Fixed Income, Equities, and Investment Banking. Total banking
revenues of $4 billion, excluding the impact of loan hedges, declined 6%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2
billion grew 8% last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing
clients as well as improved deposit spreads.
Investment Banking revenues of $875 million were down 27% from last year, driven by an industry-wide slowdown in
activity levels as well as our strong performance in M&A the prior year. Private Bank revenues of $746 million grew
5% year over year, driven by higher loan and deposit balances. And Corporate Lending revenues of $455 million were
down 4% on a reported basis. In constant dollars, lending revenue declined 2% from last year, as higher volumes were
more than offset by the impact of positive fair value marks in the prior period.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.1 billion declined 15% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of
$3.1 billion were down 11% from last year. Rates and currencies grew 5% year over year, with particular strength in
March, as market conditions improved versus the start of the year. However, this growth was more than offset by lower
activity levels and a less favorable environment in both securitized products and commodities.
Equities revenues declined 19%, reflecting the impact of lower volumes and cash equities as well as weaker
performance in derivatives. In Securities Services, revenues grew 3%, reflecting a modest gain on the sale of our
private equity fund services business. And Other included a charge of approximately $180 million, reflecting the

write-down of virtually all of our investment in Venezuela as a result of changes in the exchange rate.
Total operating expenses of $4.9 billion were up 5% year over year, driven by higher legal and repositioning costs.
Core expenses were down 1%, as higher regulatory and compliance costs and investments were more than offset by
lower compensation expense and the impact of FX translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of
severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%.
Total credit costs of $390 million were down from the fourth quarter, but up significantly from last year. Nearly all of
the ICG credit costs this quarter were related to energy. We've built roughly $260 million of additional reserves and
recognized losses of roughly $115 million in the energy sector. The reserve builds were concentrated in the E&P and
services and drilling segments, driven by ratings migration due to sustained low oil prices as well as the impact of
regulatory guidance.
At quarter end, our total energy exposure in ICG was $57 billion, of which approximately $22 billion was funded. The
funded reserve ratio was 4.2%, including a funded reserve ratio of over 10% on the non-investment-grade portion. We
have very little second-lien exposure in the corporate portfolio, with $85 million of total exposure and reserves against
roughly a third of this amount. We provide more details on the corporate portfolio as well as the nature of our unfunded
exposures in the appendix to our earnings presentation.
As we look at the potential for additional energy and non-energy provisions for the rest of 2016, if oil prices were in the
range of around $30 per barrel, we now estimate our full-year ICG cost of credit would be roughly $1.4 billion. Now
this is higher than our previous estimate of roughly $1 billion, with about two-thirds of the increase related to the
potential impact of regulatory guidance, and the remainder reflecting our revised view on the portfolio.
If you look across both the commercial and corporate portfolios, our total exposure to reserve-based lending in North
America is roughly $4 billion, of which $2 billion is funded, and we have a 9% funded reserve ratio against these loans.
We estimate that our total RBL exposure could be reduced by roughly $500 million as a result of the upcoming spring
redeterminations. And year to date, we have seen no material drawdowns against these facilities.
Turning back to ICG, we saw a significant increase in corporate non-accrual loans this quarter, up by $730 million
sequentially, with roughly $500 million related to energy and $90 million related to metals and mining. Our total metals
and mining exposure was $13 billion at the end of the first quarter, with roughly $5 billion funded, and we did not incur
any cost of credit on the portfolio in the first quarter.
The increase in non-accrual loans in metals and mining as well as other sectors outside of energy did not result in a
material cost of credit, as we have significant collateral against many of the loans. Nearly two-thirds of both the total
additions as well as the energy-related additions to non-accrual loans this quarter remain performing.
On slide 13 we show the year-over-year EBT walks for ICG, highlighting several themes. First, despite the challenging
market conditions this quarter, we continued to see growth in several of our accrual and transaction services businesses,
including Treasury and Trade Solutions, Private Bank, and Securities Services. The market environment had the
biggest impact on Fixed Income, Equities, and Investment Banking, which together were down 16% year over year. To
offset these pressures, we continue to actively address our structure, reducing capacity in areas where revenues are
likely to remain muted while preserving our client-facing capabilities, and these actions drove much of the
repositioning charge in ICG this quarter.
The remaining EBT drivers were the write-down of our investment in Venezuela, mark-to-market losses on loan
hedges driven by spread movements, and of course, the higher credit costs in energy.
Turning to the next slide, as I noted, we saw continued growth this quarter in many of our ICG businesses. Together,
TTS, Corporate Lending, Private Bank and Securities Services account for nearly half of total ICG revenues and they
grew 7% year over year this quarter in constant dollars. This growth trend has been consistent over time as we have
deepened our relationships with our target clients and gained market share, particularly as some peers have retrenched
and reduced their global presence.

Our strategy focused on providing integrated solutions to a targeted set of clients on a global basis is clearly yielding
positive results. It does not mean that we will be immune to revenue swings in more market-sensitive businesses like
Markets and Investment Banking, but our mix of traditional banking and transaction services does provide a stable
growing base of revenues in more efficient higher return businesses.
Where we believe revenues are likely to remain muted, we are taking appropriate measures to optimize our capacity
without diminishing our client capabilities. And we are remaining disciplined on credit. So while we will not be
immune to credit cycles, we strongly believe that our focus on larger multinational clients should result in better
performance through a cycle. All of these reasons are why we are still confident that our ICG business is capable of
producing an ROTCE in the range of 14% in a more normal environment.
Slide 15 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased year over year mostly reflecting higher investment
income. And expenses were down mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs.
On slide 16 we showed Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per
day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year over year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has
continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 292 basis points this quarter; flat to the fourth quarter as the sale of
OneMain was fully offset by the impact of higher rates. Our NIM should be fairly stable at this level in the second
quarter as we continue to offset the impact of the wind down of Citi Holdings with improvements in the core franchise.
And we expect the acquisition of the Costco portfolio to provide a benefit of about 3 basis points resulting in a NIM of
roughly 295 basis points in the second half of the year.
On slide 17 we show our key regulatory capital metrics on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter our CET1
capital ratio increased to 12.3% driven by net income, OCI movements and approximately $1.6 billion of DTA
utilization, partially offset by $1.5 billion of common share buybacks and dividends. Our Supplementary Leverage
Ratio improved to 7.4%. And our Tangible Book Value per share grew by 9% year over year to $62.58.
Before we turn it over to questions, I'd like to make a few comments regarding our expectations for full year 2016.
Clearly, this year started with a more challenging environment than we had anticipated, resulting in lower revenues and
a higher operating efficiency ratio than we had planned even before the pull forward of certain repositioning actions
into the quarter. While the expense saves resulting from these repositioning actions will help offset some of this
pressure, we still expect our full year operating efficiency ratio to be higher than we had anticipated, in the range of
around 58%.
This outlook assumes that Equity and Fixed Income Market revenues will be roughly flat sequentially in the second
quarter, and then exhibit a normal seasonal decline into the third and fourth quarters. We believe Investment Banking
revenues should recover from first quarter levels if the environment is favorable, based on the significant backlog of
deals we have pending with our clients. And we should be able to continue growing the accrual and transaction services
businesses year over year in IGC as I described earlier.
On the consumer side, we continue to believe we can achieve year-over-year revenue growth in our existing U.S.
branded cards and Asia cards businesses in the latter half of 2016, and of course, we will benefit from the acquisition
on the Costco portfolio in June.
Turning to Citicorp expenses, there are a few things to consider. First, we believe that regulatory and compliance costs
have started to plateau. And we expect the repositioning actions we took in the first quarter to pay back with roughly
$400 million of total savings during the remainder of the year. So, even though we expect to incur significant additional
expenses related to Costco in the second-half, we believe our core operating expenses in Citicorp can remain roughly
flat sequentially going into the second quarter, and then decline somewhat thereafter. Repositioning cost should be
significantly lower through the remainder of the year. And in total, legal and repositioning costs should run in the range
of about 225 basis points of Citicorp revenues this year; higher than our original estimate of 200 basis points, again,
due to the low revenue assumptions.
While this quarter's results were disappointing, we believe we are taking the right actions to address our cost base while
at the same time continuing to invest in those areas where we have a competitive advantage and can achieve strong

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go
ahead.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey, good morning.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Jim.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hi, John, a question on energy. I appreciate the update, but that's at $30 oil. We're at $40
now. Obviously, that can move. But do you think that if we stay above $40 that the pressure would be a little less?
Should we think – but how do we frame, I guess, oil prices if they remain higher?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I think a little bit of that is going to be determined based upon where its sentiment plays out.
So, clearly, when we set out this guidance figure, and what we're looking at is the expectation of, let's say, oil in a band
of $30 to $35. If oil consistently stays above $40 and, especially on a forward curve, if you see continued price
increases, then, yeah, the credit costs that I quoted should be somewhat less.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay, but not dramatically so?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, they'll be...
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Even if it's materially higher?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: They'll be somewhat less.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right. Fair enough. And just maybe a follow-up on the Costco acquisition. I appreciate the
color on expenses. Should we expect that, overall, with all the puts and takes to be – I think you initially were hoping it
would be modestly accretive. Is that still the expectation?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Very modestly accretive. That's to net income. Think – it's really going be roughly flat, Jim.
That's, I think, the best way to think about it. Will it generate a $1 or $2 of net income? Yeah. But, really, the way to
think about it is flat.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. That's great. Thanks.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Hi. Thanks a lot.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hey, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: I just want to make sure I got all the moving parts, and I appreciate all that guidance. I
think it's fair to assume we're not going model loan hedges, the hit that you took this quarter, the write-down in
Venezuela that happened this quarter. It sounds like with your new guidance, energy reserving could stay about this
level, given your past comments with Jim's question. So the big deltas from here over the next couple of quarters would

be if trading gets better and your comment about legal and repositioning being a lot lower. Did I get all of the big
moving pieces right?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, I'd also – don't forget, we do believe that in the second half of the year we are going
to get year-over-year revenue growth coming out of the U.S. Branded Cards business as well as the Asia cards
business. One, as we see those investments begin to really kick in on the final piece of the puzzle. We've gotten the
account acquisition. Now, we're seeing the receivable balances build so that revenue growth now should be clearly
visible in the latter part of 2016.
And in Asia, again, credit cards, we believe that we're working our way through the last of the regulatory pressure, and
therefore, we should get growth out of that business. But, yeah, I'd say it's those things and then the continued growth
of the accrual businesses and ICG, and the big wild card is going be what happens with market sentiment.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Yeah. And then if we could drill down on the comments about markets, obviously, January
and February had a lot thrown at it and we also – the weakness. Your comments for flattish markets revenues in the
second quarter, I think, a lot of us were thinking like it's not great, but it's better than where we were in January and
February. I'm curious if there's more behind that conservatism besides just that we're not far out of the woods just yet?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: So, I'd say that March was clearly better than January and February, and April is kind of
following along March's path. But I wouldn't call either March or early April robust. It's good. It's better than it was in
January and February, but it's still not a robust market. So, maybe I'm being a bit cautious, but I'd rather be a little
cautious and plan that way than tell you that everything is bounding back and it's all going to be a great and glorious
second quarter.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Fair enough. Last little one is the proxy came out and I was curious to see the elimination
of the ROA target in the LTIP and go all-in on total stockholder return. I think shareholders would like that piece, but
I'm curious on what brought the change?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Glenn, its Mike. When you – your last comment, if shareholders would like what?
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: The fact that 100% of management's long-term incentive plan is now driven by total
shareholder return. But I was curious on why the drop of the ROA component of it.
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Well, as John referenced in his comments, we're not walking away from targets and the
disciplines in the firm haven't changed. So, John laid out the path of getting to 57% for the remaining three quarters
bringing us in somewhere around 58% in a reasonable environment for the year. The firm is still ROA focused in all
those, but, realistically, we thought we would be transitioning here to much more of a return on equity set of targets.
John spoke about some of the targets that we're putting into the businesses.
And at the end of the day, really, what you're looking at is the pathway to how we can get our firm to getting to the
returns that you want and expect. And so maybe we were overly simplistic in the plan this year of really just focusing
on that. Again, these plans are year-to-year. We'll continue to take feedback, and if that feedback is consistent out there,
we'll think of those things as we go into the future.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks.

around what normal is, John? And then, in ICG, it was a bit more broad on normal. So if you could maybe just help us
understand what you mean by normal in ICG, too.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, I'd say that we think in terms of what we would consider to be a normal environment.
I'd say you'd start with certainly having a U.S. GDP growth of something closer to 3% than the 2% that we're now
looking at. And you certainly would have a higher GDP growth then coming out of the emerging markets. You'd expect
market sentiment, a little less volatility, less fear driving improvements in markets as well as Investment Banking
activity, and none of that was clearly visible in the first quarter.
And I'd say a more conducive rate environment with a, let's just say, a Fed funds rate of about 200 basis points or so
higher than where it is today. I think that would be a good start as far as trying to defining a more normal environment.
And I don't think that's beyond the realm of possibility.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay, great. Thanks for helping us frame that. And then next one, I'm not sure
what you can say, but you guys got a very, very favorable living will outcome here this week, and some investors
pointed to the fact that you highlighted a commitment to increasing capital returns in your deck upfront. And while,
certainly, that's not a new goal for you, thinking about CCAR right around the corner, is there anything that you can
add on those fronts and on the regulatory front and how those discussions are going?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Well, I think the result we got in terms of the resolution planning was one where the whole
firm came together to submit the plan and we were obviously very pleased with the outcome. And in many ways, it's
the same way we've refocused the firm around our CCAR submissions. It's what we've really tried to build into the
fabric of the place.
So our investments that we've put forward, we think, on the qualitative side, hopefully, will show themselves. And
again, in this kind of environment, we've been producing lots of capital and we know we've got to be in the position for
meaningful capital return and we want to be on that path. So, we think that the submission we put in on CCAR was a
strong one, and we'll see in June the results.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Great. Self-imposed two question limit. Thanks for the color.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi. You highlighted your progress, which is good. Reducing head count, branches, consumer
markets, Holdings, expenses and DTAs, but the ROE – tangible ROE is still only 7%. Now, you did say that the results
were disappointing and that you'll get better returns with a "more normal environment", but, from my standpoint,
having covered the company for a long time, the market's not buying it. The stock is at 72% of Tangible Book Value.
Looks like this year will be the 10th in a row with returns below the cost of capital and, note, some large U.S. peers
manage to have much higher returns.
So, the question is why not do more? So, the tactical question, which I think is an easy one, if you – the efficiency ratio
this quarter was 60%, you're guiding this year for 58%, that implies the next third quarters should be much better than
60%. If you could just clarify why that's the case? And the tougher one is the strategic question. Can you accelerate
restructuring more than what you've already done? You highlighted what you've done, but with the stock at 72% of
Tangible Book Value, you should be selling the silverware in the dining rooms or the paper clips in the desk or the desk
chairs or the whole desk to free up capital to buy back stock here.
And the one area in particular, I know we brought it up before, but why not sell Banamex? Why not sell the Mexican
bank? Monetize that gain, use the DTAs to avoid paying taxes, avoid integrating it for Project Rainbow, and use the

proceeds to buy back stock? What else can you do? And can you give us a sense of additional urgency? Because, with
the 7% ROE and 72% of Tangible Book Value of the stock price, it seems like you guys should be doing more.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, I'm glad that Brennan had a two question limit. The – let's see, where to start? Mike,
maybe I'll...
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: You go and then I'll jump in.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: So, let's talk about efficiency ratio. So the comments that we made on the 58%, what we
said is that the expectation would be that the repositioning actions that we took this quarter should begin to drive down
expenses in the second half. And I think if you follow the revenue guidance that we gave, Mike, and the expense
guidance that we gave, that should get you to a point of about a 57% efficiency ratio for the balance of the year.
That had been our guidance for the full year. Tough to recover from the first quarter that we had, but we felt it was
important to get the balance of the year back on the target that we had originally set. And we think that, again, with the
outlook that we put forward, by and large, we're there. So that's on the efficiency aspect of it.
As far as how we improve the returns and everything, one of the things that you need to focus on is the fact that we do
have $29 billion of capital, tangible common equity, tied up in DTA. It's hard for us, in fact, impossible for us to get a
return on that capital. What we do in the back of the deck is we do show you that, adjusting for that DTA capital, even
our current business over the last four quarters in the environment that it is, whether you look at Citicorp or Citi
Holdings, we're generating a 10% return on the capital excluding that capital tied up in DTA.
That's not making an excuse. It's just showing you where we have the issue, which means that we're really focused on
driving down the DTA, utilizing the DTA, which should add to the capital strength and which should then give us the
ability over time to return more capital to our shareholders. So that is definitely consistent with what we have been
talking about.
There's another element. We'll continue to drive down Citi Holdings. We've driven it down to where it's now at the
level that it is. We've got still more assets to do. That's capital tied up in Citi Holdings that is not really earning an
adequate return. We'll free that capital up. We'll return that capital to the shareholders. So those are elements of the path
forward.
And then the final is, as we've put out, we still believe that our consumer business is capable of generating a 20%
RoTCE in a normal environment and the ICG of 14%. In consumer, we've told you where we're focused. We're focused
on cards and wealth management. We think that that's the right path forward. We think that's the right way to grow
revenue. We think that those are both good efficiency and high-return businesses. We've got to focus on moving more
of our account acquisition to digital channels that will really benefit the efficiency ratio as well.
In the ICG, we've got a nice base going in those accrual and transaction services business, 7% compound annual
growth rate even in the somewhat challenging environment that we've all been operating in the last two years.
Investment Banking, we feel really good about that franchise. It's a bad quarter. There wasn't much deal volume. But
we've got a very high backlog in Investment Banking, and that's why we feel that those revenues should improve in the
balance of the year.
When it comes to our Fixed Income franchise, I don't think anybody can top our rates and currencies franchise. Now
even in this environment, rates and currencies revenue is up 5% year over year, and those are good performing
businesses. I think our rates business really outperformed because basically foreign exchange was somewhat flat year
over year. Our real outperformance was in rates. We've got a great franchise in rates, and our customers recognize that.
We've got some work to do as far as adjusting capacity in spread products. We're taking care of that. And finally, we
are continuing to make investments in Equities. Equities should help us over time. It did not help us in this quarter. But
that's the path forward, Mike. We don't think it's the time to start selling the furniture. Mike, I don't know if you've got
a comment.

<A - Mike L. Corbat>: I'll just close it with a conversation on Mexico because you specifically mentioned Mexico.
Mexico for us is an important franchise. And as John talks about the pathway to a 20% return in the consumer
businesses, Mexico plays an important role in there. We look at the business in every sense of the word. It's accretive to
the company and to its shareholders.
The second piece around it is, as we look at the growth prospects for Mexico and where we think Mexico as an
economy is headed, we like what we see, and Banamex plays an important role in the Mexican economy around that.
Third and final piece is, is if we were to take some type of action against Banamex based on capital planning and
submission processes, you actually don't know how much of that capital would actually be liberated or entitled to go
back to investors. So it's a good business. It's a growing business. We think it's a strategically important business. And
simply selling the furniture to liberate some capital here we don't think is the right long-term or intermediate-term
decision.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning, John.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hey, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: A question, you touched on a couple of times your backlog in Investment Banking. Can you
give us a little more color? Is it more North America or is it Asia? And then second, how does it compare to the end of
December? Has the backlog picked up from there, or is it about the same?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: The backlog is up. We've probably got one of our best backlogs we've had in several years.
And if you think of the markets and just to put it in context, yesterday was April 14, and realistically that was the
opening of the IPO market here in the U.S. So as you can imagine, there are a fair number of things to do. And so when
you think about M&A, when you think about the equity calendar, if we can get some kind of reasonable environment, I
think you could see a lot of transactions coming through the pipe there.
From our own perspective, I think there's good balance around the globe, U.S., Europe, Asia, in terms of the backlog.
So again, if we can get any kind of reasonable environment, we think we're going be quite active.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Great. And then in terms of what's going on in the UK with Britain thinking of leaving the EU,
can you guys frame out, if that happens, what the risks could be to Citigroup?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: From a Citi perspective but more importantly from a Citi client perspective, we think that
the EU staying together as it is, is the best outcome. But we'll leave that to the UK voters to decide.
From our own perspective, as probably you know, we operate in most of the 28 EU countries, and so we have a lot of
flexibility in terms of what we could do. We run a significant bank out of Ireland. We have trading. We've got people in
a number of the countries. So we would have options in terms of where we would choose to headquarter a European
trading business or where we would put. But clearly, around the UK, we would still have significant resources there. So
we've got contingency planning, but we've got a lot of potential options if that's the path it goes down.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Great, and then just one last question on credit. I know you've given us good detail on energy.
In the non-energy area, there was some deterioration in credit. Granted, it wasn't as significant as energy. What type of
industries was that deterioration in?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I mentioned the fact that some of the non-accrual loan adds were in metals and mining. And
the rest were small bits in other industries, no particular concentration, and no particular geographic that I'm aware of.
So, it's just spread around.

<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay, good. And actually to continue on that, you had nice improvement in charge-offs in the
consumer outside the United States. Do you expect that to continue, especially in Asia and Latin America?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We don't see it getting any worse. As we look at the delinquencies statistics, it's running
pretty well. You have a total NCL rate outside the U.S. of 1.6%. That's probably close to 70 basis points lower than the
loss rate that we have in the U.S. And that's all-in, including Mexico. So I don't want to say it's going to get much
better. I'm not quite sure how much better it can get, but I don't see it getting worse.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Looking at the Global Consumer Bank, in the last couple of years you've given us guidance on
positive operating leverage. And maybe not on a quarterly basis, but on an annual basis, we saw that you delivered that
in both 2014 and 2015. And this year, I guess the first quarter doesn't look good, and then you've got all these moving
parts with Costco coming in and other jurisdictions being shut down. Can you give us an idea of what kind of the
underlying same-store sales operating efficiency or leverage? Is there positive operating leverage, or is it just that the
card business revenue give-ups are too much?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's going to be tough to overcome for this year, especially with the large amount of
repositioning then that we did in the first quarter. So I think it's going to be hard to generate that type of story for 2016.
But we do think then that, again, the business that we're growing and the business that we're investing in is one that is
going to be capable of generating on a consistent basis positive operating leverage and higher returns. So that's what
we're trying to do, Chris.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And that's where we believe we're headed.
<Q - Chris Kotowski>: And then secondly, kind of unrelated, just if you can say – on something like Venezuela,
where I guess you've written an investment there essentially down to zero, is there still an operating business there with
optionality in case the situation – business and economic and political situation there ever turns around, or is it just
basically more or less shut down?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, we still have a good business serving our ICG clients that have, particularly
subsidiaries, in that country. So there's a – if the country improves, we should see a benefit coming out of that. And
you're quite right, with the $180 million write-down that we took, our remaining investments in that country is $4
million. So, it looks like it's headed for some really good ROE if and when the business can come back.

million coming entirely through by the end of this year?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, we'll get about $400 million of that in the last three quarters of the year, so that the
repositioning that we took in first quarter, largely, will repay itself in the 2016 results. And that's exactly what Mike
wanted us to achieve. So that's the way we've really looked at that.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. And so then – right, so we have a little bit of a benefit to piece in 2017, and
then this quarter's results reflected some of the benefit of the restructuring you took last year. Is that accurate?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: That is correct.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Right. Okay. And so with that restructuring, do you feel that within maybe a better
market, not a normal market, given how you define normal, do you think you're at a good spot in the expense ratio that
getting to that 57%, 56% is something you can achieve in 2017?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I don't want to get into setting 2017 targets, because, again, I'm still trying to figure out what
the market environment is going be for the balance of this year. But we do think that, again, everything that we're doing
now is positioned to improve that operating efficiency and getting us close to that mid-50% that we're still targeting for
Citicorp.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Right. I guess...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: So – go ahead.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: My basic question is just that given in a more stabilized revenue environment, the
restructuring that you took this quarter feels like it's the last one you need to take of this magnitude. Is that reasonable
or...?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I think it's reasonable as long as market conditions stay where they are. As we've said, if
market conditions weaken, then there may be other actions that we need to take. We're not – we're not deaf to the need
to do things in order to improve returns. We think that's the right way to run a business. So, we've got a model in place.
We've set the businesses with their goals, but if market conditions look as though those revenue environments are not
going come around, then we'll need to take some additional actions. Hopefully, as you said, we're finished with large
repositioning actions.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Right, okay, and then just a couple of other ticky-tackies. One is on the card
portfolio. You highlighted the fact that you've got two positive growth in the card portfolio this quarter, which is great,
and that's in spite of the legacy card portfolio. Could you just remind us the size of the legacy card portfolio and over
what kind of timeframe you expect that's going to be rolling off?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, I don't want to split the portfolio like that. I will tell you that the core portfolio that,
again, where we've been making the investments, those – obviously, the performance that we're getting out of that
portfolio is even better than what you see on slide nine. So, the purchase sales growth in the core portfolio where we're
making the investments, the core products is 16%. The average open accounts is up 9%. The average card loans is up, I
think, it's 4%. So you can see that, again, that's having – that is really driving the growth, which is exactly what we
would expect it to be.
And that's why we believe that by the second half of the year, we're going to get the entire card portfolio to the point
where we'll have year-over-year growth. But, again, we're not finished then, because we would expect even more
growth coming out of that core portfolio in 2017 and 2018. And again, that's before we even talk about adding in
Costco. And Costco, first year we have it Costco will not be contributing much just because of the way the accounting
works. But we think that's a really good business and looking forward to the contributions that that'll make in the
second half of 2017 and then into 2018.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Yes, okay. No, that's very helpful. Last question is just on the reserving that – not
reserving, but the outlook for what could be a $1.4 billion if oil stayed at $30, a lot of caveats there. And you

mentioned that's $400 million above what you had previously indicated, two-thirds of which coming from regulatory
guidance. Could you just give us a little bit of color around what you think that regulatory guidance is? Why it might be
different from what your views are? You had the other one-third of revisions of your views versus two-thirds from
them.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Earlier this year, the OCC, in particular, came out to the industry with some guidance, first
verbally and then in writing, largely centered as to how you should be treating some of the reserve-based lending debt.
And we still have some questions about how we are interpreting that guidance. We think that in that $1.4 billion figure
that I've put out, we've taken the most conservative view as to how to interpret that guidance. But, again, we're still
waiting to make sure that we've thought it – we've interpreted that proper way.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Great, thanks. I just had two quick questions. One on...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Sure.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: ...transferring Citi Holdings back into Citicorp now, does that mean that we could expect
really no announcements for future sales of businesses, that you've kind of finally reached this end state where you're
happy with all your businesses?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We still have the consumer businesses in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia that are in
Holdings. They may or may not be sold this year. If they're sold next year, we'll probably tell you about it. So, I don't
think that you've heard the last of some of the business sales. But, again, Holdings is just becoming – it's just the
normal way of doing business right now. Almost everybody has got some things that they're selling, whether it's a
portfolio or whatever.
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: And what you talked about, John, as we finished the quarter at $73 billion, we've got
commitments already in place for $10 billion. And so, as John mentioned, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, you've got an
operating business, the OneMain version for Citifinance Canada. But, away from those, it is largely an asset portfolio.
And so you'll be able to see assets in Corp/Other move up or down, and we can provide color inside around those. But,
we're going to keep the focus to get the transactions closed and out the door. But, again, I just don't think it's all that
meaningful to the finances of the company anymore.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Right. I guess what I'm referring to is new announcements. From here on out, there shouldn't
be new announcements about country exits in that.
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: So, we will put out press releases as we sign and as we close the transactions.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I think he's asking, Mike, is that are we going have any more sales, and that's going be
dependent upon how we continue to assess the environment. If the environment says that we need to scale back in some
places, we'll be active in response to that.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Okay. Great. And then there's the one question on Costco. It's getting close to the close now.
Can you provide any update on portfolio size? Anything besides the accretion numbers you just gave?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, the portfolio will close on or about June 20. It should be June 20 when the portfolio
closes and everything moves over. As we get closer to that date, we may give you some more. But, for now, we're just
focused on the June date.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Hi. Just to follow up on the Costco deal about neutral to earnings this year, as we
think next year and beyond, obviously, there are some upfront marketing investments and system investments, but any
thoughts on how profitable it could be longer term?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We haven't commented on the profitability of the individual portfolio. And we won't do that.
We will say, and we have said, that the return characteristics of that portfolio fits perfectly into the cards business that
we're trying to grow. So I've said on a number of occasions that our U.S. Branded Cards business should be one that,
when we're finished with the investments and adding in Costco and everything else, we think that it's a business that
should earn an ROA somewhere in the 2.25%, 2.35% range, and Costco will be an important part of that.
The key to our U.S. cards business is to have a balanced portfolio; balance between our core proprietary products as
well as the card portfolios where we've got our partner cards. So, we think that that's the right way to grow that
business and that's the way that we're moving forward and, overall, that business, again, 2.25% thereabouts ROA in the
future.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Got it. And then circling back on expenses, the improvement in the efficiency ratio
rest of the year and it sounds like it's mostly revenue dependent. I guess the question is if revenues are weaker how
quickly can you adjust to that environment? I guess I'm trying to get a sense of how variable is the cost structure? We
didn't see much variableness at the quarter, but it's also just one quarter. As you think over the next several quarters, if
revenue comes in a little bit lighter, do you have flexibility to bring those costs lower than flat?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: What I actually tried to guide you to is the fact that we think the core expenses will be
actually coming down, especially, in the second part of the year. We don't anticipate having anywhere near the level of
legal and repositioning charges that we had in the first quarter either. So, we think that expense reductions in the
balance of the year is an important element of getting to that 57% efficiency ratio.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay, so you're right. I understand. But if – how much variableness – just coming
back to the variableness question, how much flexibility is there to further bring down? I guess I was a little surprised
the first quarter we didn't see much variability in the expenses given how weak revenue was. Obviously, you took the
repositioning. It's just one quarter. But if the revenue is less than what you laid out today, how much kind of real-time
flexibility is there to bring down costs?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We'll address that as we see with the revenue. I'm not going to give you a figure that X
percent of the expense base is variable, because, on a longer term basis, everything is variable. On a shorter term basis,
it's not going be as variable as you would like it to be.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay, all right. Fair enough, thank you.

<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Just one question for you, Mike. I appreciate the color that you gave during the prepared
remarks on CCAR. And just a follow-up to that, are you confident enough or how confident are you in terms of
checking off the regulators qualitative to-do list in terms of moving closer to your peers over the next few years in

<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Yeah, that's exactly, Erika, what we're committed to. We fully understand that capital
generation and capital return is a big part of the investment thesis and story, and if you go back and look over the past
couple of years, capital generation hasn't been our issue. Over the last three years, we've generated over $50 billion of
regulatory capital.
In the last quarter, we generated $6 billion of regulatory capital. So ours is the normalization around the process and the
credibility to make sure that we can get that capital back to our investors, and that's exactly what we're working at. And
that's why so much time and energy has been put in on the qualitative side of things to be able to get to that point as
quickly as possible.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Okay. And just my follow-up is, John, did I look at the headlines right during your call with
the media that the same group that was in charge of resolution planning is also in charge of CCAR?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'm sorry, Erika.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: So I thought I saw headlines on Bloomberg when you held your call with the media this
morning that I think it said you mentioned the same group that was in charge of resolution planning is also in charge of
CCAR?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: You can't believe everything that you read online or in the headlines. No. What I said was,
during my prepared remarks – during the Q&A that I had with the media, the question came up as far as resolution
planning. And I said, look, we put a lot of hard work into developing the Resolution Plan and that we've really carefully
incorporated all the feedback that we received in late 2014 on the earlier submissions, and we've embedded resolution
planning into our day-to-day management of Citi.
And I said that's very similar to what we done with CCAR. So, rather than think of CCAR and resolution planning as
separate initiatives performed by isolated teams of people, we consider both as integrated parts of our capital planning
process. And I said, just as we have a continuous budgeting and forecasting process that is owned by our business
managers, well, the business managers also own the CCAR process and the resolution planning process. So, that's what
I said.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: I see. Thanks for the clarification, John. I appreciate it.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: That's okay. It's not that we suddenly have got a new management. That's the wrong way to
run CCAR and resolution to have somebody separate – Barbara guides CCAR, I guide resolution, but it's the business
managers that ultimately own it.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. John, maybe just one...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hey, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: ...one more quick one on energy. I presume you're at least part of the way through the
spring redetermination. I'm curious what your expectations are in terms of the potential reduction in the borrowing
bases across your borrowers when that process is complete?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, we think that our reserve-based lending exposure could be reduced by about $500
million. That would be combined the ICG as well as the consumer book. And it's probably $300 million/$200 million,
$350 million/$150 million with the ICG being the slightly bigger piece of that.

<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay. That seems a smaller percentage than what we've heard from a couple of other
lenders.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's got to be the books.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Just if I can follow up just on a separate topic, the 200 basis points to now I guess 225
basis points of revenue that you're suggesting we should think about in terms of repositioning and legal costs, how far
does that guidance go out? I mean, it sounds like with legal now sort of ramping down, certainly never going to go
away, but ramping down and the repositioning costs presumably are going down over time, should we think about that
ratio in 2017 and 2018 and on out? Are you going to be continuing to reposition and invest in places like wealth
management?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, I would say that, again, we do think that 200 basis points and certainly 225 basis
points is a very high charge on the revenues for legal and repositioning. And it's relevant in the near-term, 2016. We'll
assess 2017 when we get there, but that would not be my view as to where we would expect legal and repositioning to
be certainly beyond 2017. So, we should be looking at something which is a lot smaller, but I'll give you more guidance
as we get closer to the end of 2016.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay. And then just finally for me, maybe a ticky-tack little question. There was a
substantial jump in the, other than temporary impairment losses, on the income statement this quarter to $465 million.
Is there anything you would like to call out there?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Venezuela is in there, the Venezuela charge of $180 million, so that's a big piece of that.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay. Thanks very much, John.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi. I had a quick question on capital. John, in the past, I know you've highlighted
operational risk declines as a meaningful source of future capital relief. And at the same time, you've also talked about
CCAR as being your binding constraint on capital, and it's something that a lot of clients have mentioned as well as a
potential source of relief. And what I'm wondering is because the stress test exam only evaluates capital ratios under
the standardized approach, which excludes op risk from the denominator, I'm wondering whether that renders any
potential benefit tied to op risk relief moot going forward. I just want to get a sense as to whether we should still be
crediting that as a future source of relief given that it's not contemplated explicitly within the capital ratios within
CCAR.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Actually, Steven, I don't know whether I misspoke or you misheard, but it's probably my
fault. But I certainly didn't intend to indicate that op risk would be a source of capital relief. As a matter of fact, if
anything, I think that the op risk portion of the advanced approach RWA is very sticky right now. There just isn't a
clear-cut agreement either amongst us or even the regulatory bodies really as to how you reduce op risk. So that's one
of the reasons why when we've given you the Holdings RWA in the past – this quarter, for instance, the Holdings RWA
is like $130 billion. And of that $130 billion, $49 billion is op risk. That's the same $49 billion that was there in the
fourth quarter. That's the same $49 billion that was there in the third quarter.
So we really – we tend to think, overall, if you take a look at the 10-Ks and the 10-Qs, I believe that our op risk RWA
is like $325 billion. And I'd consider that to be fairly sticky for now because I just don't have a good methodology in
place to figure out how we drive that down. It's one of the very – it frustrates me, I think it frustrates probably every
CFO and Chief Risk Officer that you would talk to at a major bank right now, but that's where we are.

<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Sure, thank you for clarifying that, John. And it certainly frustrates investors and analysts as
well.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Just one question on the profitability targets. I know we've spent quite a bit of time on it this
morning. But taking the challenging revenue environment we saw in 1Q, the 100 basis point increase in the efficiency
target, and then the breakeven guidance for Holdings for the remainder of the year, are you still committed to deliver on
the 90 basis point ROA target that you had laid out and I think reaffirmed maybe as little as just one month ago?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I would say that given all of that math, the 90 basis points, again, given where we ended up
in the first quarter, it's going to be tough for us to come in at 90 basis points.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: All right, and just one more quick piggyback question for me. I was wondering what the
source of RWA growth was in the quarter. I did see that the balance sheet grew as well, but didn't know if you could
clarify that.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's a little bit of the balance sheet growth, and that's also being fueled also by foreign
exchange movements. Don't forget these are one day as opposed to being averages. And so if you actually take a look
at what happened at the end of March compared to where we were at the absolute end of December, in certain
currencies the dollar actually weakened, particularly against the euro, so that added $4 billion or $5 billion worth of
RWA to us. We had some model changes; that was like another $8 billion or $9 billion. We had I think $15 billion
worth of just volume as the balance sheet grew. And then there was a $5 billion increase in market risk, which we're
still looking at. That's why these are estimated numbers at this point in time, don't forget. We'll lock down the RWA
calculations as we file the 10-Q in a couple weeks.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Got it. Thanks, John, for taking my questions.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Thanks, just a question on total cost of credit. You talked a little earlier about losses. We talked a
little bit about the energy outlook for the rest of the year. But, John, relative to a $2 billion all-in cost of credit for the
WholeCo, how should we just understand how that goes, especially with not really knowing what Costco will add to
that?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Any number that I gave you is ex-Costco, and I didn't give you a view towards what
Consumer would be. But don't forget Costco overall as I think I mentioned earlier, you've got to think in terms of
Costco revenue, expense, cost of credit being basically breakeven for the balance of this year. And that's just due to the
fact that the way the accounting works, you're forced to build loan loss reserves basically over the first year that you
have the portfolio. So think about Costco as it will impact all the ratios, but from a net income point of view right now,
it's basically breakeven. So that's not in there. The $1.4 billion that I gave you as far as the forward look on ICG, that
was all-in. That was not just energy, that's all-in ICG.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Okay, so that's all-in including reserve builds? That's all-in, okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: All-in.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: And then do you think, I guess the last piece is just do you think you'll continue to have any releases
underneath in card, or is it more just how the losses traject from here?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: As we continue to build the card portfolio, you're likely to see small reserve increases, but it
would be volume-driven as opposed to being driven by a weakening in credit performance. So as you build portfolios,

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Hi, John, a question on the Treasury and Trade Solutions outlook. Obviously, one area that's
been weak globally has been trade finance, particularly trade finance related to various commodities, which is a big
portion of that – of the global total. So how do we think about that pressure relative to the pretty positive guidance and
recent trend that you've indicated?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: All of the trade performance is in that number that you see reported on whatever the slide
number is, 14 or 13, that is in the deck. So that's pretty much how we're operating today. One of the things that we've
done over time is we've moved a lot more of our trade business into being less balance sheet intensive. So we do a
higher percentage of our business now on originate to sell. And what that given us is the balance sheet then to expand
into the supplier finance aspects of trade. That has got better spreads, and it really deepens the relationship then that we
have with our client customers. So recognizing everything you said, trade is not what I would call a tremendous growth
business at this point in time, but it's got the relationship qualities to it, and it's really adding to the overall franchise in a
very positive way.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Got it. So it sounds as if the volume pressures have been offset by basically moving down
the ecosystem in terms of client opportunity. Is that more or less correct?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I wouldn't say it's moving down the ecosystem. I'd say that we're expanding the business
that we can do with our target market clients by helping them in working capital management. And what we've done is
we've gotten out of a lot of the FI sponsored business, which is episodic, it's very low spreads. We'll still originate those
things, but then we tend to syndicate and sell the trade finance receivable. What we really want to do is we want to use
trade. As we do in almost every one of our product areas, we want to use our trade capabilities to help our clients
manage their business.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Got it, great. Thanks very much for the clarity.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Not a problem.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Hi, thanks, a couple of questions. Firstly, John, you'd given guidance last quarter for net interest
margin at 2.85% to 2.90% for the first half. You came in a little bit above that, but was flat linked quarter. Are you still
expecting to go to 2.85% to 2.90% for the first half? And if so, what would drive that down?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No. Actually, Vivek, what we've revised our guidance to is we think the 2.92% kind of
holds flat in the second quarter. Again, as we continue to offset the impact of Holdings runoff by better spreads on our
loan business largely due to the interest rate lift that we got coming out of December and by the tail end of the year as
we get the Costco business on our books, that should be another boon to our NIM. And we're expecting somewhere in
the order of a 3 basis point improvement from Costco. So we should end the year, the second half of the year with a

<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. And Mike, a question for you. The Equities business, you had trading issues several times
over the last couple of years. What are your plans to fix that?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: So as you look at this quarter, this quarter wasn't a quarter where the revenue performance was
a result of trading issues. This was really from our perspective, and I think you saw it across the industry, but certainly
for us, the client volume, client flow challenges. And John and I talked historically about the run rate we'd like to see
the business at and the opportunity. And again, going back, there's no reason why, as a firm, we should be in the eight,
nine area. We should be in the five, six area, and we think there's an incremental couple of hundred million dollars a
quarter over time that we can add with just some reasonable investments. And the investments come in a couple ways.
It comes in terms of people, and it comes in terms of balance sheet. Given where our capital ratios are, given where our
leverage ratios are, prime finance as an example, we think we've got opportunities to go in and take share. And that's
what we're trying to execute on.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. The only thing I'd say is of the peers who reported so far, your equity trading revenues
year-on-year were weaker than those.
