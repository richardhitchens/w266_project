David E. Simon
Good morning. We had a strong start to the year. Results in the quarter were led by FFO $2.38 per share, up 16.1%
from the 1% from the first quarter of 2013. Once again, our FFO significantly exceeded the First Call consensus
estimate. Our growth strategy continues to generate significant value for our business; overall business conditions are
positive; demand for space in our portfolio remained strong; leasing activity is healthy. We had occupancy growth of
80 basis points compared to Q1 2013 to end the quarter at 95.5%, accelerating releasing spreads to $9.90 per square
foot.
Our comp NOI growth for Malls and Outlets was 3.7% despite higher costs from utilities and snow removal. If we
normalize this, this affected our comp by roughly 90 basis points, and as a point of reference, comp NOI including The
Mills and excluding the malls to be spun off as part of WP was 5.3% for the quarter, including the high cost of snow
and utility removal.
Now, as reported, our retail sales were essentially flat, and I would encourage you to look at our revenues as opposed to
our retailer sales. As you know, if we have underperforming retailers, we have the ability to replace them with better
retailers at generally higher rents, which generates higher SPG revenues. And as I've said repeatedly, current retail sales
does not correlate to our ability to grow our cash flow. And as a reminder, our consolidated revenues, the revenues that
I focus on, grew by 8.2% for the year. These results are a testament to the strength of our assets and the desirability of
our locations.
Now, development construction continues on new premium outlets in Charlotte, Minneapolis, Montreal, and
Vancouver – all high-quality major markets, and that remains our only focus in new development is in those kind of
markets.
Other new outlet projects in our development pipeline are moving forward. We have up to six additional new outlets
expected to start construction in 2014 and 2015. Redevelopment and expansion projects are ongoing at 29 properties in
the U.S., Asia, and Mexico.
We started construction on two important redevelopment projects in our portfolio. They include the relocation of
Bloomingdale's at Stanford Mall in Palo Alto, and the redevelopment of its former location to add 120,000 new square
feet of space for small shops and restaurants. And the relocation of Saks Fifth Avenue at Houston Galleria to a new
prototype store, plus the redevelopment of that existing Saks and an expansion adding 105,000 square feet of luxury
retail and restaurants.
We also started construction on the expansion of Yeoju Premium Outlets in Seoul, Korea. That will add approximately
259,000 square feet. And we have a healthy pipeline of other Premium Outlets expansion projects in the works.
Desert Hills Premium Outlets is celebrating the opening of its expansion beginning this Thursday, adding 147,000
square feet and it is fully leased. As an example, the annualized NOI from this expansion will add $17 million to SPG's
NOI as it's a wholly-owned asset. Construction is ongoing to expand and enhance some of our most productive
properties including Roosevelt Field, Woodbury Common, the Lenox Square and Del Amo, to name a few.
Overall, we continue to expect redevelop investments of at least $1 billion annually through 2016 that will contribute
incremental growth in NOI and strengthen the position of our assets in the respective geographic areas.

On Klépierre, the transformative Carrefour deal selling 126 smaller assets for nearly €2 billion closed last week; and
McArthurGlen, our new investment in the outlet business in Europe, is performing well.
Our deal side transactions during the first quarter included our acquisition of the remaining interest in Kravco Simon,
which held interest in a portfolio of 10 assets including King of Prussia Mall, which we now own 100%, and the
acquisition and the remainder – the acquisition of Arizona Mills bringing our interest to that center of 100%, as well as
development land in Oyster Bay, Long Island from the Taubman Centers.
Just an update on Washington Prime Group, WP's spin-off of 98 assets including our strip center business is expected
to be completed in the second quarter. Recent activities include announced members of senior management team and
independent board of directors, including Mark Ordan as CEO. We're pleased also today to announce that Marc
Richards will be joining WP as CFO. He's well respected and has worked with Mark successfully at Sunrise Senior
Living.
We've received indicative investment grade ratings from three major credit agencies as follows: S&P BBB, Moody's
Baa2, Fitch BBB. All three agencies provided a stable outlook, very strong ratings out-of-the-box and comparable to
many REITs that have been rated for a long time. The balance sheet will be ready to enable the company in its pursuit
of cash flow growth. Completed financing activities on WP, nine mortgages were closed and two unsecured facility
comprised of a $900 million revolving credit facility and a $500 million term loan were completed.
And now, let me turn to the SPG Capital Markets update. We completed a $1.2 billion senior unsecured notes offering
in January with a weighted average duration of 7.5 years, at an average coupon rate of 2.975%. The 65 basis points
spread over Treasurys for the five-year tranche is the tightest five-year spread ever for a REIT.
On March 14, Fitch upgraded our credit ratings to A. We are now at the mid A-level with all three of the agencies,
leading the REIT industry. We closed or locked rates on four new secured loans in the quarter, totaling $860 million, of
which our share was $491 million and we expect to generate $1 billion of cash proceeds from the WP spin upon its
completion.
Early in April, we amended and extended our $4 billion unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility to a June
2019 final maturity, and were able to reduce the interest rate to LIBOR plus 80 basis points from LIBOR plus 95 basis
points, again the best in the market.
We raised the dividend again this quarter to $1.30 per share; that's an increase of $0.05 per share from last quarter and a
year-over-year increase of 13%. We will pay at SPG at least $5.15 per common share in 2014 not including the WP
expected dividend. As we said to you originally, the WP expected dividend will create an overall effective dividend of
$5.65 or another at least $0.50 on a one-for-one basis for WP's spin.
Now, let's go to guidance. We revised our 2014 guidance upwards to $9.60 to $9.70 of FFO per share. This
incorporates our strong performance in the first quarter. It raises both the top and the bottom by $0.10. It's based upon
an annual comp NOI growth of at least 4% for our combined mall and outlet portfolio.
This FFO guidance is comparable basis with our 2013 results and ignores any potential impact of the WP spin. Once
the spinoff is completed, we will provide updated guidance through a press release reflecting what the impact of SPG
will be for the balance of the year.
So overall, we had a strong start to the year. We are absolutely focused on creating value for our properties and for our
tenants and for our shareholders.
And now, we're ready for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Hey, David. I can appreciate your comment about the tenant sales and how that doesn't directly
impact your business kind of short term, but I was wondering if you guys could maybe try and isolate what the weather
impact was. And if you or Rick could maybe talk about regional sales performance, and did you see any differences in
places like Florida, Texas, and California versus kind of the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest?
<A - David E. Simon>: I would refute your first statement, Steve, and I would suggest to you that the most important
things in terms of growing our cash flow is in fact what the market rents of our space are, which are not determinative
of – by what current retailers are producing out of that space and what our rollover schedule looks like. And, in fact, if
you see our rent spreads of nearly $10 per foot, that would indicate exactly – sure, we do have some risk to overage
rent as sales ebb and flow, but the fact of the matter is that recurrent retail sales generally don't have an impact.
And take an example; there are a number of key retailers that are really not performing that well; each one have a
variety of reason. That's in our sales numbers for our retailers, yet that has nothing to do with what the market value of
that space can be.
And so, again, the obsession – you should be obsessed with our sales. I'm obsessed with our revenues, the SPG
revenues. Retailers come and go. If we were worried about retail sales – this company was originally built – we had
Kmart as our anchors. And if we had looked at Kmart sales, we would have suggested that our sales – our revenues
could never grow. But, in fact, what we do here is we're able to replace underperforming retailers with better retailers,
and we're able to garner the market rent of what our space should be, and that continues to go up.
So, it's not a short-term – this is not a short-term issue. This is an issue that's existed for the balance of this 50-year
history of this company. So, now, Rick mentioned regional. The fact of the matter is, sure, the weather – this company
will never use weather as an excuse. It certainly affected our comp NOI by 90 basis points because of high utility,
snow, we all can talk about the winter; that's in our rearview mirror.
It certainly had an impact on our retailers that exist in our buildings, but it doesn't change the fundamentals of the fact
that our business is solid, has the ability to grow its cash flow, we have a long demonstrated track record of being able
to do that, and we'll continue to do that. But the markets that didn't have snow, et cetera, I mean, they were not as
affected in terms of those retailers that report. And I do remind you that the strip center REITs don't even report tenant
sales. So – but, Rick, I don't know if you want to add anything to it.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I've one thing. Not only we do not use weather as an excuse with you, we do not allow our
operating teams and any of our platforms to use weather as an excuse, and we expect those results to be delivered. You
will not be surprised to hear that the better markets were the Pacific, Florida, the Southwest, and Las Vegas. And the
markets that were most impacted by the weather were the Plains, the Great Lakes, and the Mid-Atlantic. No great
insights there, but as David said, we're managing through.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. Thanks. And then just on the leasing front, I know most of the leasing is done for this year,
but, Rick, can you give us some insight as to what kind of leasing is kind of done for next year?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: We're right on track with our leasing renewals and leasing the space this year, and as we sit
here today, we're right where we were last year this time for this year, but there is increasing demand. As David said,
our job is to curate our properties and bring in the most productive and the growing tenants and eliminate or downsize
the tenants that are least productive, And that's what we do on an ongoing basis.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. Thanks.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Bilerman>: Yes, actually, it's Michael Bilerman here for Christy. David, I just had one question just in
terms of global expansion, and I wasn't sure if your British conference call coordinator was on purpose or not. But
we're sort of – the outlets business is clearly global, you've moved that global in all the regions. How do you sort of feel
about traditional retail, and where your thoughts are about that side of the business and pursuing more global
expansion?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I mean, we always – we have a great outlet platform in Asia. In fact, Stanley is
over in Asia I guess tomorrow. It's tomorrow, right? So, technically, he's a day ahead of us. So, we are looking at other
Southeast Asia markets to expand our platform. We've been really successful everywhere in Asia in the outlet business.
Japan, Korea, Malaysia, there's a number of southeastern markets, not China, that are very interesting to us. So, I would
expect, Michael, to hopefully be able to build some new centers there.
We have a good outlet potential in Mexico where we've got a couple of new sites that we're pursuing aggressively,
including the expansion of our one outlet there. The Brazilian outlet opportunity is somewhat dormant at this point.
Couldn't find the right sites and the market – we were fortuitous in that the market obviously is correcting there, so we
had no capital at risk, and we have nothing necessarily planned there.
And then, we've got McArthurGlen which we're very excited about, not just the assets that we had interests in, but also
the development and management platform as well as some of their new expansion opportunities and new
development. I was over there a couple of weeks ago, looking at one of their opportunities. So, we think that that
business will become more important to us over time.
And turning to the full price in there, I think our model will continue to be opportunistic. We love, in retrospect, what
happened with Klépierre. We went in there before anybody thought about investing in European real estate based upon
two fundamental beliefs: one is that the cash flow is very sticky, so far so good, ex-Spain, which in fact was not very
sticky. But it means less and less to us now that we sold this huge portfolio to Carrefour. And we could help the
company from a strategic point of view and get them retail focused and all the other things that we've been doing, help
them become better operators, all of which have, in fact, scarily have gone according to plan.
So, we want to be opportunistic. There's a lot of capital now in Europe. The UK is not a real focus for us. Prices are not
necessarily cheap and they're not opportunistic, and we've had – we had a disappointing experience there. In retrospect,
the shareholders and the board should have thought why – the shareholders technically never got an opportunity, but
the board should have probably thought about its response a little bit more thoroughly than it did.
But that's it. We're going to continue to be opportunistic. We're not doing – this is not glamorous and it's primarily the
focus is if we can add and export our ability, and the number-one goal is to make money. I have no interest in building
monuments.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: Hi, David. It's Christy here. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about your new
Simon Venture Group. Are you spending any time on this personally? How much capital would you anticipate
investing over time? What sort of returns are you looking at? And can you give us some examples of the types of
companies you're looking at?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, sure. We have just hired Skyler Fernandes, who has early-stage DC experience. We've
made a couple of small investments before Skyler's involvement with Jifiti and – I'm sorry – Shopkick. I almost said
Shop and Track, which – it's been small investments.
And it's really – the primary focus is in areas where we think it's going to apply the investment and the business model
or apply to our physical environment. It could be a new retailer, it could be a new restaurant, can be a new technology
that is important to our consumer and our retailer. And I think over time, we could invest anywhere from $25 million to
$50 million. We're going to do it very small; we don't want to have a big staff.
If Skyler is listening, Skyler, you're going to have to do most of this on your own. I'm involved; he and I met a couple
of hours yesterday, we've got a couple of – these are $1 million up to $5 million investments a piece. But it's really

trying to focus on bettering our product. And we can do that through new retailers, restaurants, we can do that through
new technology, we can do it through new services, and we can do it in a way that can help our retailers like Deliv
which, in fact, is on the forefront of ultimately providing same-day delivery services to our consumers, which seems to
resonate with a number of our consumers.
So, that's the theory it's going to morph. The good news is we've only had really two investment mistakes over time that
I call material – not material, but in China, we only got $0.75 on our dollar, but we learned that in China, you have to
be very careful.
We also invested in technology in the late 1990s. We learned a lot from that. The whole model has changed now
because that actually read great ideas there, but investing in building the stuff, this was before the cloud, this is when
you had to buy the routers, the servers, you had to build everything; now you can essentially rent it all out.
The economics are such that you're never going to have that kind of capital at risk to see whether or not a new idea or
new technology can germinate to something that's meaningful to our portfolio.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dan M. Oppenheim>: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can talk about the issue with the tenant sales,
talking about previously the – the tenant sales don't really matter, but it's really the cash flow. Presumably, the cost of
occupancy over time does matter. You'd highlighted the teen retailers. Should we assume that given the comment to the
teen retailers that ex that, you're feeling quite good and confident about the cost of occupancy overall?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, yeah. Look, our business has, over its 50-year history and 20 years as a public company
where we produced unbelievable results – always has retailers that get hot, get cold, new concept, old concept. It's just
the nature of our business. And again, occupancy costs are determined at a particular point in time, but it doesn't
necessarily equate to what the market value of that rent is or that space is because again, that sale that's being generated
out of that space is that particular retailer. And that particular retailer could not be generating the sales that that
particular space should be generating. That's where it relies on us to either relocate them or replace them with a newer,
better retailer.
So, again, if you looked at our ability to – if you looked at our Top-10 tenants 20 years ago versus today, and if you
looked at our cash flow growth 20 years ago to today, despite all of the noise about particular retailers here and there,
there is such strong evidence to support my statement.
So, occupancy cost is interesting, but it's not a factor in what our ability to generate cash flow growth is. You have to
look at the rollover schedule and how that equates to market rents, and market rents are determined based upon supply
and demand.
So, in the office sector, you do the same thing; in the strip center sector, you do the same thing; in the industrial sector,
you do the same thing. But here, for whatever reason, the mall industry has gotten away from cash flow growth as the
important determinant in what the value of our company is and more what are the existing retailer sales. I don't buy
that, and I've never run this company based upon that and our track record is evidence of that. I don't know what else to
tell you.
<Q - Dan M. Oppenheim>: Thank you.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: The only thing that I would add is that underlying David's point about supply and demand,
there is virtually no new supply. If you look over the last six years, supply has been growing 50 bps a year lower than
the rate of our population growth. So, we're in a very good supply dynamic for the foreseeable future.

<A - David E. Simon>: And again--
<Q - Dan M. Oppenheim>: Great.
<A - David E. Simon>: Retailers – some – and it ebbs and it flows, sometimes there's more retailers that are under
pressure than sometimes not. But you cannot replicate our buildings, you cannot build it, there is no new supply, and
supply and demand is in our favor. Otherwise, we couldn't grow our cash flow. It's that simple.
And I encourage everybody – I hope this doesn't sound offensive, but I encourage everybody to understand how we run
the business. We run it over a long period of time. We're always replacing retailers, some of the toughest calls that Rick
and I get are the ones when we move an underperforming retailer out for a better-performing retailer. And the retailers
that are underperforming, fact is they could be there for 5, 10 years and their rents are way under market. And it may
look bad in their sales, but the fact is it's welcome from us because we can replace them with a better tenant.
Let's take resettlement income as part of that discussion. The fact is that if somebody – like we had some recent
settlement income. Sony is exiting the mall business. Sony is in A malls. If they pay me the present value of being in
that space and I get that space back, and I can lease it for current market value, you and me as is – you're not maybe a
shareholder, you're an analyst, but you in a sense represent shareholders – you and me have just done a good deed.
We now get the present value of that space obligation, I get the space back, I can lease it for market rent, that's a win
for us. And again, you've seen that over a period of time with retailers. And the resettlement income is being generated
by our top centers. For whatever reason, certain retailers are not – not wanting to get out of the business or not
performing well at this center has nothing to do with that center.
<Q - Dan M. Oppenheim>: Thank you. And I guess one question in terms of the cash flow. There's a comment in
terms of the NOI growth ex WP being 5.3%. Should we compare that 5.3% with 3.7%? And I guess, it would seem
then that WP had much lower NOI growth, but presumably a lot of the assets being in the Midwest and some
Mid-Atlantic would have had some impact there.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, the other – the real important thing we did was we put in The Mills there, which
generated – one of the things we're thinking about, comments are welcome, is that we have not historically put The
Mills comp NOI growth in our overall comp NOI, but as we're – once this spin is done, it's likely – we're happy to get
input on this – it's likely that we will then put that in our comp NOI, because these are big cash-flow-generating assets.
And it's probably – they're the bigger assets which is consistent with what SPG is doing going forward, focused on the
bigger assets, and it'll probably be in our comp NOI pool.
So, we wanted to give you a flavor of what that comp NOI growth would be including The Mills. And there is some
marginal benefit of the fact that if you were taking out the WP assets, but it's marginal. And you are correct in saying
that because of the snow and utility costs and a lot of those centers are located in the areas that got whacked in the first
quarter, you are correct in saying that that had some impact on that comp NOI as it did for SPG as a whole.
<Q - Dan M. Oppenheim>: Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan of MLV. Please proceed.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Hi. Good morning. I mean, David, I think your comment about market rents for space not
being related to what the existing retailer is doing, I mean, I think one of those – a great example of that might be just
replacing department store space with small shops and the upside you see there kind of like what you're doing at
Stanford.

But do you have a sense of – could you give us any sense of kind of how many of those opportunities are in your
pipeline? I mean, you announced a couple of projects, the Phipps and Pentagon City. But, I mean, is it something you're
having discussions with department stores increasingly where they can maybe downsize and you can recapture space at
much, much higher rents or any color?
<A - David E. Simon>: We're always looking for that, and I'll let Rick comment on that. It's interesting though while
that – neither one of those guys are leaving. They're actually getting new stores in that process, but we're able to make
the economics work because of the supply and demand of those particular assets; they're both in antiquated physical
plans.
So, we're able to make kind of a win-win out of it in that we reclaim, redemise their existing space, turn it over to small
shops, they get a new brand new prototype store and it's a win-win. But part of the lease settlement income that we
generated in the first quarter was the full present value of the tax obligation for the mall where they paid us – they're
leaving shortly, right, Rick?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Under construction.
<A - David E. Simon>: And we're going to reclaim that for small shops. That's a mall that does close to $1,000 a foot,
something like that, and – but there's a handful of those. Rick, you want to add, I mean, a handful of those kind of
opportunities?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: And we are constantly mining the portfolio, and we just announced literally an expansion
at Pentagon. We've announced – David just talked about Florida Mall, and both of those are just in addition to all the
things we've completed over the last year. And obviously, we're always talking with our department stores about where
they've got space that we believe can be better deployed. And we're in constant conversations about whether we can put
it to better use.
And sometimes, it happens independent of us. A great example of that is the Dick's that is being added in one level of
Sears at King of Prussia, that was basically done inside the Sears store, but that's going to make that property
substantially more productive by having Dick's anchor one level and Sears consolidating to a more productive box on
one level.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: My other question is related, but, I mean, I think there's obviously been a lot of headlines
about not just sales, but mall traffic, and then we've had a tick-up in bankruptcies and store closing announcements.
And so, what you don't hear as much about is kind of the back – the retailers who are looking to backfill that space a
and maybe, I don't know, Rick, if you have some color about people who, for example, would be looking to take the
Coldwater Creek stores that are liquidating or folks like that who are – have upped their store opening targets?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: David always makes fun of me when I rattle off the list of the tenants, but the good news is
that there is a very vibrant group of tenants that are looking to expand. LEGO, ATHLETA, H&M, Zara, UNIQLO, just
a few, and I'll add Topshop, we're adding Topshops in three places in the portfolio. There are – to David's point,
historically, there have always been tenants that are looking to do business in productive properties. And to the extent
the space we're getting back is in productive properties, and happily that's the vast majority of our portfolio, we have
users and we have demand at better rents and the opportunity to right-size the space.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Great. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. And just a comment on traffic, I would suggest to you that when a retailer talks about
traffic, that may be their particular stores and may not be endemic of the mall's traffic, and I would also caution, throw
significant caution to the wind, that there are a couple of – one company in particular that holds themselves out as the
barometer of traffic in the mall industry and their data does not include any common area or entrance data from the
Simon Property Group and many other mall owners of quality real estate, and we don't know how and in fact, what that
traffic is that they report.
So I just want you to – I want to throw caution to the wind when you hear these general statements about traffic. Now
was traffic affected by the winter? And the fact is that malls – we have some statistics, which I don't even remember,

but how many days our malls were closed compared to last year, it was 10x of what it was. But – so that can happen, it
happened. I just want you to throw caution to the wind. When the media quotes traffic numbers, understand the source
of that and its accuracy.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: So you are saying your portfolio is doing better than what they are saying for the industry?
<A - David E. Simon>: I'm saying, our traffic was affected by the weather, and I'm saying, you look at our results and
that gives you an indication of what's going on with our portfolio.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Thanks.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of David Harris of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Hey, good morning, everybody. The Carrefour sale by Klépierre, does that prompt any
consideration for special dividend under the French REIT rules, David?
<A - David E. Simon>: No. The answer is no because they had the ability to straddle years a little bit like this as well
and they have – they're also unwinding some hedges as part of that because they were over-hedged, so there's some
losses associated with that. And the fact is it will not end up in a situation where there's an unusual dividend spike. I
mean the dividend's been growing. Expect that to probably continue, but there won't be something extraordinary
associated with that sale.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: So the proceeds will be essentially used to de-lever the company and at least the initial
thought?
<A - David E. Simon>: Correct. That's correct.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Okay, does that leave you looking for acquisitions in that company now as we go
forward, or are you happy with a lower level of leverage?
<A - David E. Simon>: I think the company is now in a position that it can look for opportunities, whether new
development, expansions, some acquisitions here and there. But they are clearly focused on – given the significant
change, they're very focused on growing the business now, which two years ago when we got there, I would say, it was
a different scenario. So, thankfully, they've executed extremely well and they are looking for growth, similar to what all
major retail owners do, did some development, some expansion, some potential acquisitions here and there.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Now your estimable CFO has not been yet given a speaking part, but I just wondered if
there is any update on his replacement.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I don't think he – unfortunately, you've asked a question where he can't respond to that
either. So...
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Well, I don't do great quarter, guys, but I wanted to throw in a compliment.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thank you. Sometimes a pat on the back never hurts from anybody.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Right.
<A - David E. Simon>: So in any event, as you know, we have been – it's very interesting, this company again, it gets
– there's a lot that gets lost in the sauce. On one hand, this week, we're going to open Desert Hills. It's going to be 100%
leased and it's going to add $17 million of cash flow to the company.
At the same time, we hired a new venture guy. Europe's doing well; you've got all the redevelopment. We're doing the
WP deal, right, and then obviously, I've got to focus on Steve's replacement. So just from a – my point of view here,
and this is just probably – I'm telling the people here, they're probably looking for me then say, what am I going to say?

So, I have been thinking long and hard about this.
And as you know, the biggest focus we've had over the last two or three months has been WP. That management team
is basically set, done, which is very good news, and it's a great team. They're young, energetic. It's got a mix of
Simon-trained folks.
It's got our strip center, entrepreneurial group. And then it's got the outsider and a couple of his colleagues that I think
ultimately will create very unique dynamic company that's really going to be hustling for growth.
Now, that that's said and it looks like the spend is, again, subject to board approval, winding around the last corner, I've
been thinking more and more about this, and I'll probably have an opinion in a month or two. But right now, I am
seriously considering internal candidates as the first line of defense. And the good news is, we've got a great bench.
We've got guys that are savvy veterans, younger people that want to move up. We have a great culture here. And I
think we can do it internally, but I want to – I just want – I don't want to rush to judgment. I want WP to get done. And
then I think once that gets done, I think something could happen in the next four to eight weeks.
That's probably news to everybody in this room, but therein lies my thinking. So, I hope you appreciate the honesty of
my response.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Yeah, very good. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ki Bin of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Thanks, just a couple of follow-ups. In terms of traffic data and your tenant replacement
commentary, could you just talk a little bit about this – we are midway through April, almost May now, and I wouldn't
say it's been very warm, but have you seen some kind of catch up in the past couple of months in terms of tenant traffic
or sales or anything like that that might be a better indicator going forward?
<A - David E. Simon>: I think we can say that April is off to a much better start. We obviously had Easter moving
from March into April. March was better than February, February was better than January and that trend is continuing
into April. And we certainly anticipate that we will have some catch-up.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay, and the second question. I'm sure you guys get this all the time, but if you had to estimate,
how many more outlets do you think in the U.S. that we absolutely could use? And how does that number compare to
some of your – like in Europe where you are trying to expand?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well. Again, I don't – there's a – if you look at some of the general industry publications,
there's a pipeline of 50. And I would just say, I don't believe that that whole pipeline will be built. I do think you're
going to – last year 2013, 2014 was – it's going to be an active year, so I think you'll see five or six or so in the next
two, three, four, five years. So if I had to guess, I think you're going to see probably 20 or so added over the next three,
four, five years. I don't think it's going to be quite as frenzied as everybody thinks.
I think we have a really good handle as you might imagine on this industry. So, that's my own personal view. But I
don't control – I mean developers are always pushing their limit, whether four, five or six bad outlets get built. It
doesn't impact our outlet business and what we do. And as you know, we're looking to only build in major markets
where there really is unquestionable demand for the premium outlet product and if it's a marginal market, we're just
going to – we're going to pass and we have passed on a number of sites. Rick, you can add anything.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: The one thing that I would emphasize and David talked about in the context of the Desert
Hills, we're spending as much time and money expanding our existing great premium outlets as we are trying to build
new ones. Desert Hills opens Thursday, we opened an expansion in Orlando, opened an expansion at Seattle. We're
under construction in Las Vegas North Downtown, 147,000 feet. We're expanding Woodbury. We're expanding

Chicago. And these are all among the best outlets in the United States. We're expanding Livermore. And all of the
expansions taken together are probably two or three new projects, but they'll be dramatically more productive,
dramatically better returns, and they have the benefit of enhancing what we already have.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: And similar question, but how about for Europe? Do you see that potential of it being just a lot
bigger?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. I think, Europe, the right to build there is much more difficult. But there is a pipeline
that we have with MGE that we're going to pursue, but it's a lot tougher. It's a lot harder to get done. There's a lot more
restrictions in terms of how outlets get viewed in Europe in terms of laws there. But if you do get the right to build
there, it's a terrific, terrific opportunity. So there'll be more, but I think it'll be measured. And we'll have our fair share
of that, but there's definitely – part of what we wanted to do with MGE was, in fact, build some new centers in Europe.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. Thank you, guys.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Hi. It's Craig Schmidt for Jeff Spector. I was just wondering if you could spend a little
time talking about The Mills. It seems like it has the highest return on redevelopments. Its minimum rents are growing
well and it also seemed to have done the best in terms of sales per square foot productivity since 4Q 2009 in terms of its
lift. I know you are doing a lot of things at a lot of different Mills, but what's meeting with the biggest success to sort of
drive this?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I think that – Craig, it's Rick. The Mills have been performing great and I think that – some
of it, hopefully, a lot of it is attributable to us being able to broaden their appeal. What we've been able to do through
our relationships is bring tenants that have been successful in Premium Outlets in The Mills to operate off-price
concepts and bring tenants into The Mills from the mall business to operate full-price concepts, and that combination
has been very compelling.
So, tenants like Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works are operating full-priced concepts, and tenants like Michael
Kors, Coach, Express are operating off-price concepts. And that combination has created, as David said, properties that
are 1.5 million to 2 million square feet, doing hundreds of millions of dollars of sales, and providing unique franchise
in each of the markets where they operate. So, we've been very pleased with it and we're growing. And we've got
expansions under way at Sawgrass. We're working on redevelopments at Great Mall. We are working on an expansion
at Orange. And there's a lot of growth runway built in that platform.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Is there any potential for a ground-up development of a Mills project at this point?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I think that's going to be more difficult. Frankly, there are not many markets left in the
United States that can support a 2 million square foot ground-up development that does $500 million to $700 million
from day one. So, I would not look for that.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Okay. Then the Yeoju expansion, the premium outlet, is there any direction that you
want to take the new tenants that you are bringing into that project?
<A - David E. Simon>: It will continue to be the high-end tenants there. I mean, we – the exiting center has a great
tenant mix, so it will continue to be kind of all the American as well as European brands and the international
companies. It is an international retail mix, and there some Korean retailers. But by and large, it's all the brands that
you're familiar with.

<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Okay. Then hopefully this is a Steve Sterrett question. The pickup in other income,
will we see that going forward? Will we have as active of land sales and/or the lease settlement, or should we assume
that that starts to resemble 2013?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: No, Craig. Rick and David talked a lot about the lease settlement income. And I think we
did have a fair bit of activity in the first quarter. I wouldn't expect that level of activity to go through the rest of the
year. And land sales, as you know, were pretty lumpy. But I certainly wouldn't expect that level of activity for the rest
of the year.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Hi.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Hey. Just two questions here. First up, on the line of credit, you guys now have I think
almost $7 billion if you include the accordions of capacity. So – which seems like an awful lot just given that if you
guys wanted to do anything I would assume that you'd have a line of bankers outside of Indy and 399 Park in less than
an hour. How much capacity – is more of this insurance? Like as you guys pay the facility fee is more of this just the
comfort of knowing that you have that? Or is there something else, like just preparing for the next credit crisis or
something, just to know that, God forbid, you had to put on major mortgages or re-financings that you just had that
available?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, I mean, Alex, it's Steve. I do think if you look at our debt maturity schedule, we do
have $2 billion to $3 billion of debt maturing a year. We're a large company. We did have – people tend to forget that
we did have an instance not a lot long ago in this country where the capital markets were pretty dysfunctional for an
extended period of time. So we've been operating under a philosophy that we want $5 billion to $6 billion of liquidity
kind of at all times. And call it insurance, call it what you want, but I think that's prudent for a company of our size.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. And then, yes. And then just a second question is what are the next steps or
what else needs to be done before the board can declare Washington Prime good to go?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we just have to become effective with the SEC, which we're getting closer and closer.
The board's got to review all the final things and then we make an announcement. And so we're – it's moving quickly
and so it's just a process of essentially just becoming effective with the SEC and then board approval and then we're off
to the races.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: And you saw, Alex, we filed another amendment to the Form 10 yesterday, the amendment
number three, so we are, as David mentioned, kind of getting down to the short strokes.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay, so this is just all the back and forth where they give you comments and
hopefully that list of comments is getting smaller and smaller and then it's good?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yes, sir.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay, perfect.
<A - David E. Simon>: If you are excited, you can read the 600 pages of total documents. You have nothing to do this
weekend.

<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: You know, my kids were saying, daddy, we like you doing boring daddy work. We
don't like playing with you. So I will do that. Listen, thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: All right, no worries. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Daniel Busch of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
<Q - Daniel J. Busch>: Thank you. David, following WP spinoff of the smaller opportunity malls and strip centers,
will there be any other remaining malls in the portfolio that you would consider non-core and could be potential
candidates for disposition?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, there certainly always – we're always going to portfolio manage our assets. So the
answer to that is, sure. I mean, there's – we had partners in some assets. Partners may want to sell. We may agree with
them. So, yes, sure, we're always going to portfolio manage our asset base.
<Q - Daniel J. Busch>: Okay and it appears like there's a growing number of B and C malls coming to the market. Do
you have a sense of what the demand is for that type of quality? Is it similar to the quality that WP is?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I don't want to – look, the – again, WP's malls are – I see all sorts of references from the
analytic community. My view of WP's malls is there's – the one overriding point is that they're smaller. They're just not
big malls. And I'll let you decide whether that's a B mall or C mall, an A mall. I don't think about it like that. I look at
the cash flow, what's the sustainability of the cash flow. Is that a market where you can grow the cash flow?
And the one thing that I will agree with is that they're smaller than our average mall, and we think those assets, because
as we've gotten bigger over time and focused on the bigger assets, they tend to lose the day-in and day-out focus that
they deserve. So, with that preamble said, I mean, look, there's a lot of capital in the real estate industry generally for all
sorts of assets, and money wants to be put to work in the top-quality assets, in redevelopment assets, new development
across the specter (sic) [spectrum] in hotels, retail, office, et cetera.
And I think WP will be able to take advantage of whatever strategy ultimately they put together. But there are buyers
for everything right now in any assets. I mean, the – I looked at your NAV analysis, and I can tell you, our partner is
selling a mall and the cap rate is blowing me away in terms of what – in terms of how low it is. So, there is a lot of
capital for retail real estate in every bucket. And to some extent, there's product available. And to some extent, there's
less product available, but I expect a lot of trades to happen.
<Q - Daniel J. Busch>: Great. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Hey. Good morning or afternoon to you guys. I just want to go back to the re-leasing spreads.
On a percentage basis they have been improving for quite a few quarters here now in a row. I'm just curious if you
could break that down between sort of what's driving that. Is it more market rent increases or is it just the base of the
malls or the spaces that are closing? Is it maybe not growing or is going the other way?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Fundamentally, we just have a very good supply-demand dynamic. I would tell you that
when you look at our spread calculations, they include almost 8 million square feet of space, so it is less susceptible to
specific project influences and much more representative of overall trends throughout our business. And we're just able
to lease our product at higher rents because, frankly, I do believe our properties are taking market share and we're

having a more desirable portfolio for the retailers to want to operate in.
<A - David E. Simon>: But it's simple. Simply put, the expiring rent is just lower than the market rents. And so, that's
got a lot – there's a lot of reasons for that. But I mean, that's the simple answer. So if you look at our expiring rent
schedule and you see where our market rents are, therein lies why we have the spread, which therein lies why we have
the ability to increase our cash flow year after year after year.
I mean, again, Steve, you may know this, I believe Q1 comp last year was 5%, something like that.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yeah.
<A - David E. Simon>: So our 3.7% was off of a base of 5% and that 3.7% as I mentioned was hurt 90 basis points by
extraordinary costs associated with the harsh winter. So you can normalize, you can do whatever you want with it, but
that's just how we would look at it. And – but it's that simple, okay? Now notice I didn't talk about retail sales. I talked
about market rent.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Right and that's what I'm trying to get at. I guess maybe asked another way is how market rents
for your portfolio have gone up, let's say, over the last year or so as opposed to the spread, which...
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. I mean, the good news is that – it's clearly gone up because you've seen the spread
accelerate.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Okay. And then maybe just another topic. I know it's early days in your ownership there on the
Oyster Bay development, but is there any update on how the development planning process is going over there?
<A - David E. Simon>: It's very early days, so really nothing to add there other than we're excited about the
opportunity. Our partners are excited about the opportunity. We very much look forward to working with the town to
find a win-win, so we're – we think it's a great opportunity for us and will be a high priority for us over the next year or
so as we go through the process.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Yes, good afternoon. Going back to development and redevelopment yields, also noticed
that you took up the yield on the outlet development to 10% from 9% last quarter. Just wondering what was driving
that.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Two things, one, we've been able to bring in our costs at a little below budget. And two,
we've had a lot of demand and we've been able to lease it at higher rents and so we got higher returns.
<A - David E. Simon>: I would say it differently, I would say, typically, they sandbag us on the rents they charge. But
we let it get approved in any event. So it's all about setting expectations, isn't it?
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Very much so. Were there any particular assets that kind of drove the average up or was it –
is this kind of happening across the entire development portfolio?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Pretty much across the board we're seeing those trends.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just staying on the outlet side, and then there was some news
out there a few days ago about Charlotte, North Carolina, and the whole process of your development there, some
pushback from local residents. Just kind of curious if you could opine on that.

<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: It's opening on July 31 of this year. And it's very well leased and we're in very good shape
there.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Okay, that is helpful. And then last one for me; this one to Steve. Credit provisioning levels
also went up during the quarter. Just kind of curious what you are seeing from that perspective and what we should be
modeling going forward.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Tayo, we've talked a lot over the last few years about bad debt expense being really low. I
think what you saw this quarter is just a bit of a reversion to the mean. If you look at the – in the context of $5 billion
plus of consolidated revenues, I think we bill north of $7 billion a year to tenants. Having $5 million of bad debt
expense a quarter is still pretty de minimis. But I think that's probably more reflective of the run rate that we're going to
see this year.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Is that reflective just – you're just updating your estimates or are you actually seeing more
issues with the tenants themselves that's actually causing an actual increase in that number?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: No. It's a bit of a combination of both. Our overall receivable level is still pretty low. But
interestingly enough, our bad debt reserve is pretty much formulaic-driven. And because you have had more tenants
either announce store closings or, in a couple of cases, go into bankruptcy, we reserve a higher percentage of
outstandings against those types of tenants and it generated a slightly higher bad debt expense this quarter.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Great, thank you very much.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Ben Yang of Evercore. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: Yeah, hi, thanks. Maybe just building on the earlier lease spread question, I believe your spreads
are based on openings and closings, so I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about spreads based on signed
leases, maybe what that trend has been and also maybe how that compares with that 19.5% that you report in your
supplemental.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Ben, you're right in that the spread is based on cash closing rent compared to cash opening
rent. But because the population, as Rick mentioned, is so large, I mean it's 8 million square feet kind of at any one
point in time. Looking at it on a signed basis relative to the actual openings isn't going to move the number a lot. But
I'll echo what Rick said earlier that demand for space is good. Yield quality continues to improve overall. We've been
pleased to see the continued acceleration in the leasing spreads, but looking at it from a signed basis to an actual
opening basis isn't going to materially move the number.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then also you talked a little bit about the lease termination
income. Was that all Sony or were there other retailers in that mix? And maybe also, since it's a lot higher, can you
offer what your guidance is for the full year on that line item?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, we don't like to do that but we had Sony and then I mentioned to you about the
department store scenario so, but that gives you the bulk of it more or less.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yeah, in commenting, Ben, on the volume of it, if you look back over our last several
years, we have averaged $20 million to $25 million a year of lease settlement income. We just happen to have a larger
chunk of that in the first quarter. Could it be more significant in 2014 than it's been the last couple of years? Well, we're
certainly off to a start and as David and Rick mentioned, because of a couple of the lumpy things that have occurred in
the first quarter, it could trend a little higher, but it certainly not going to trend at the same level we saw in the first
quarter.

<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. And again, to emphasize, this is a...
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: It's a good thing.
<A - David E. Simon>: It's a good thing because, again, I don't lose the space, I just get a present value of the lease
obligation or very close to it and then I have the ability to lease the space up. So, it is not something – we've got to get
the right values. We do lots of analysis. As you might imagine, we're very sophisticated on this front.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Typically, we don't execute it until we've got a replacement center in place.
<A - David E. Simon>: So – but this is not a bad thing at all.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: I totally get it's not bad, but I mean could it hit higher to that $20 million to $25 million that you
have historically reported in the past?
<A - David E. Simon>: It has a chance this year primarily because we did the one big deal with the department store,
which I would say is kind of somewhat out of the ordinary.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: I mean, was that big deal, was that kind of baked into your earlier guidance? I'm just kind of
wondering...
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: ...if that was the – okay, got it. And then...
<A - David E. Simon>: Absolutely. That's been in the works for two, three years.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: Okay. Okay, helpful. Maybe final question; you talked a little bit about the other income in your
consolidated. Why exactly did the other income in your joint venture also go higher?
<A - David E. Simon>: Because part of that lease settlement, the big lease settlement that I mentioned was in – it's a
JV property.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yeah. The biggest driver of the movement in that number though, Ben, is the nature of
some of the income that flows through from a McArthurGlen. A lot of it is service-related income. As you know, we
own half of the economics of the development and management business. And so, that's the primary driver of the delta.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Thanks a lot.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Please, go ahead.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Yeah. Hey. Thanks. Just following up on that real quick, so the $11 million is
consolidated. What is the overall pro rata number for lease term this quarter? And when you talked about $20 million to
$25 million normally, is that a consolidated number or is that the pro rata number?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: The $20 million to $25 million number would be the annual run rate kind of on a pro-rata
basis, Mike.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Got it. And what was the full pro rata in Q1 then?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: It was high-teens.

<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Got it, okay. And then last question. I guess historically you've talked about development
spend having at least about $1 billion a year for the next few years. As you look out from this standpoint, how many
years out does that generally account for at this point?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we had said through 2016. But we'll – it's not set in stone.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Got it. Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: All right. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan of Cowen Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: Yes, thank you. Just one quick question I guess for David and Rick. The so-called fast
retailing tenants have been growing pretty dramatically in your properties for a number of years now. And I think it
shows up with Forever 21 being now a top 10 tenant and an average store size, just looking at the metrics in the setup,
of more than 10,000 square feet. Historically, of course, you have excluded stores of more than 10,000 square feet in
the sales productivity number. And I just wonder if, given the ambitious plans of cohorts like H&M and Uniqlo,
whether you've given any consideration to perhaps including the fast retailing productivity and the reported
productivity, given how important they seem to be and look like it's going to increase in importance.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, Jim, if you've listened to my...
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: I heard every word.
<A - David E. Simon>: If you've listened to my discussion on tenant sales, I would suggest to you – I mean, it's an
interesting derivative. There's no correlation and the fact is there's no other industry that I know that is focused on retail
sales. Therefore, this is what's going on with your property. I before saying look at our cash flow and measure us on
that basis.
So – and I think, somehow, the industry has gotten off track here by being the most important metric. I look at the
analyst reports that came out today, even though we beat consensus by $0.14 or something like that. We've had
unbelievable historical growth. Our comp NOI has grown year after year. It was up marginally in the great recession.
The balance sheet's AAA. We're adding all this new development. The one constant dialogue I got was the tenant sales,
right? And I'm – so you want more of that so I can read more of that. So I somehow – I'm happy to have this discussion
with you and other shareholders. But somehow, we're losing track that retailers come and go. We used to – this
company was built based upon Kmart leases, okay?
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: No, I understand all that. I just think the point is that fast retailing as a format does seem to
be, in terms of its size – Forever 21 is an in-line tenant and I have no idea, by the way, what their productivity is. It's
simply that they are now a top 10 tenant and H&M and Uniqlo have pretty ambitious expansion plans as well. and I
was just – all I'm doing is suggesting that the original reason for excluding tenants of over 10,000 square feet, I just
wonder if it still applies when we think about that type of retailer?
<A - David E. Simon>: I don't think – as the mix has broadened in these centers, that metric is probably less and less
important. What happens if we bring in service tenants or we take a department store down and put in an office
building or an apartment complex, I don't think – I think we're losing sight of its real estate, and it's about organic cash
flow growth. And it's not about what particular person is doing in a particular space, because again, we own the real
estate. They don't perform. We get it back. And then the next question is what can we do with that real estate? So I'll
tell you what, I'll put it in there if you talk about it on page 10 and not on page one, okay?
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: Well, I will just say for my note, by the way, I stressed if people want more space and are
willing to pay more for it that's the key driver. So, not guilty as charged here, at least in that respect. Just one other

question I had for you, and this maybe is a Rick question. The development activity number went up close to $300
million at the end of the first quarter versus the end of the year. Am I correct in assuming, Rick, that as far as the mall
category, which is where it all took place, that that number didn't include your announcements on Pentagon and Phipps,
number one and number two, that it would be virtually all the Simon post-spin malls that we are talking about there?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, you shouldn't presume the latter because we're reporting everything on a combined
basis so far. So, in that regard, there is capital attributable to those post-spin assets and we're doing things.
<A - David E. Simon>: Houston Galleria.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yes. Houston Galleria has started. We've also started on Florida malls. So a number of new
ones have come into that mix, but it is not a function of a spin or – post-spin or pre-spin, and it does not yet include
Pentagon or Phipps. We just announced those will be starting construction this quarter.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah.
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: So the – sorry.
<A - David E. Simon>: Go ahead, Jim.
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: Sorry, go ahead. Yeah, I was just going to say post-spin – I just want to make sure I
understood the comments you made earlier regarding the level of development activity that we should expect from
Simon post-spin. Obviously, it sounds like it's going to be the same kind of number as we have been thinking about
historically for the company. Obviously, the contribution should be relatively greater given that the post-spin company
base is going to be a little bit smaller. But is there an opportunity in these malls that there could be an accelerated, an
increased level of major expansion spending given that where you are spending the money and the big money seems to
be on the biggest, strongest assets where the demand is really very strong?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Certainly, that is going to come about and where – we've got several other projects that
we're working on, that we hope to announce. We've already talked about the connection to King of Prussia. So there are
other nine major projects coming down the road, including Copley, that are going to certainly continue that level of
spend in the post-spin Simon.
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: Okay, very good. Thank you, guys.
<A - David E. Simon>: And I was just going to add, Jim, just to make sure everyone that's still on the call, all of our
numbers that we reported are all include the WP assets, occupancy, sales...
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Comp NOI.
<A - David E. Simon>: Comp NOI. All of the 8-K stuff is all including WP, so all of that. Just to make sure everybody
understands that.
Operator
Thank you. I would now like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.
