MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Greetings and welcome to Microsoft's fiscal year first quarter 2014 earnings. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder,
this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure and now I'll introduce and turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager, Investor Relations
for Microsoft. Thank you, Chris, you may begin.
Chris Suh

During this call we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements
about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and
uncertainty. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the
comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other
reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any
forward-looking statement.
Before I hand the call over to Amy, I'd like to remind you that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will
relate to the corresponding period of last year. Also, please keep in mind that with our new segment reporting structure,
adjustments for items such as upgrade offers, tech guarantees, and presales are consolidated into Corporate/Other to
provide better comparison of operating results. Unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current quarter
have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of last year's revenue deferrals related to the Windows upgrade offer,
Windows 8 presales, the Office offer, and a $113 million revenue deferral in the current quarter primarily related to
Windows 8.1 presales. You can find details of the adjustments and reconciliation of differences between GAAP and
non-GAAP financial measures in our financial summary slide deck.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Amy.
Amy Hood
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.
By now you've had a chance to look at our press release, earnings slide deck, key performance indicators, and our
10-Q. Our results have been reported using the new reporting framework I first discussed at our financial analyst
meeting in September. Since this is new way to think about our business, I'm sure you'll have a lot of questions. So
after our prepared remarks, we'll allow a little more time than usual for Q&A. And with that, let me dive right in.
This quarter, we delivered record first quarter revenue. We did it while working through a significant transformation of
our organization and while making significant moves to implement our new strategies. Our company is focused and
delivering. Our enterprise business remains strong despite a macro environment that some have characterized as tough.
We are driving our business forward with industry-leading solutions in key areas like collaboration, unified
communications, and cloud services. And high customer satisfaction is driving high enterprise agreement renewal rates.
At the same time, we are making meaningful progress in our consumer business. We saw growing engagement and
adoption across our major consumer services, including Office 365 Home Premium, Skype, Bing, and SkyDrive. And
with the new Windows, we're building high-value experiences for our consumers that allow people to use our devices
and services all day long, whether at work or at home.
From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based revenue growth. Overall, both developed and emerging markets
showed strength. The U.S. and parts of Western Europe were particularly strong, while China was weak.
Now let me share some quick thoughts on the PC market, which turned out better than we had expected. We're seeing
signs of stabilization in the business segment, with two consecutive quarters of growth and a relatively stable outlook
for the next couple of quarters. While the consumer segment is more volatile, with increasing competition for share of
wallet, it also performed better than expected, particularly in developed markets.
With that backdrop, let's move on to Windows. We're seeing favorable reviews and customer enthusiasm for Windows
8.1, which became available last week. Windows 8.1 delivers on Microsoft's promise of a quick innovation cadence,
launching less than one year after Windows 8. Based on extensive customer feedback, we added more customization
capabilities, made the UI simpler and easier to use, added new and smart ways to search, improved power management,
and allowed multitasking, even on a tablet.
Combined with the progress our OEM partners are making, we are collectively increasing the selection of compelling
Windows devices available to meet the dynamic needs of all segments of the market. This holiday, we'll see

competitive opening price points on tablets and laptops, such as the Dell Inspiron 15 for less than $300.
We'll also see exciting mobile devices, from six-inch phones to ten-inch tablets, many with Microsoft Office. In the
six-inch category, we're incredibly excited by the Nokia Lumina 1520 tablet, announced this past Tuesday. For
eight-inch tablets, Toshiba, Dell, and Lenovo will have devices available for less than $300. And for 10-inch tablets,
we of course like the Nokia Lumia 2520 with LTE.
In addition to third-party devices, we're also excited about our first-party lineup. With Surface, we're making progress
with better in-market execution. As a result, we more than doubled the number of units we sold over the prior quarter.
In terms of mix, Surface RT did better than expected. With Surface Pro, we saw some customers delay purchase in
anticipation of Surface Pro 2, which delivers significantly improved battery and processor performance.
Moving on to the enterprise, where demand for our solutions continues to be strong, earlier this month we announced
our fall wave of enterprise products and services, which touches nearly every aspect of IT. We're seeing solid growth.
We're outperforming our competitors, and we are taking share in areas like virtualization and the data platform.
Our hybrid infrastructure and management offerings continue to be top choices for CIOs, with Windows Server
Premium and System Center growing double digits again this quarter. The latest versions of Windows Server, System
Center, and Windows Intune deliver enhancements in networking, storage, and device management for Windows and
alternative platforms. These enhancements will help customers realize the promise of hybrid cloud computing across
their data centers, hosted clouds, and Windows Azure.
In the data platform, SQL Server continues to outpace the market. The next version, SQL Server 2014, will offer new
in-memory and cloud capabilities that will increase performance and unlock new hybrid scenarios. Later this month, we
will make Windows Azure HDInsight, our Hadoop-based big data solution, generally available. We continue to bring
additional value to Windows Azure platform. This quarter, we delivered a number of updates that enable faster
connectivity, improve security, and integrate access and identity across on-premise and cloud applications. With all of
the innovation we're delivering to our enterprise customers, we continue to be uniquely positioned to capture more and
more of the addressable market.
Before handing it off to Chris, I'd like to say a couple of additional things. As part of our new reporting framework,
we've disclosed segment gross margin. The segment breakout is important in understanding our performance because
each of our businesses are impacted by different dynamics and have different margin profiles. In Devices & Consumer,
the sequential change in gross margin dollars reflects the progress we are making towards our strategy of delivering a
compelling family of devices and services.
While we feel good about the increased traction we saw with Surface this quarter, we know there is more to do. We are
intensely focused on improving our capabilities in key areas like demand planning and supply chain management and
on achieving scale as quickly as possible. And in Commercial, we're already seeing the benefits of the investments
we've made to transform our business model from perpetual software licensing to services. In our commercial cloud
business, which includes Office 365, Azure, and other Microsoft services, we saw year-over-year gross margin
expansion.
With regards to our pending acquisition of substantially all of Nokia's Devices and Services business, we still expect
the transaction to close in the first quarter of calendar 2014. We will provide an update to the EPS impact, if any,
post-closing.
So in summary, we are executing better, getting our customers what they want, and making meaningful progress
through the early stages of our transformation. And we've accomplished all of this while also working through the One
Microsoft realignment and several significant announcements. We are committed to executing and delivering. And so
far, that's what we've done.
With that backdrop for the quarter, I'll hand it over to Chris to give more details about our performance before I come
back and share thoughts on the outlook.

Thanks, Amy. First, I'll review our overall results, and then I'll move on to the details by business segment.
Total revenue was up 7% to $18.6 billion and came in about $700 million better than our expectations. And without the
impact from foreign exchange, revenue would have been $200 million or one percentage point better. Annuity revenue
was particularly strong and grew 11%, driven by Commercial performance.
Cost of goods sold increased 23%, which was in line with our expectation of over 20% growth. This increase was
primarily due to Surface costs and also higher depreciation related to the CapEx investments we've made to support our
cloud services strategy. As a result, gross margin grew 3% to $13.5 billion, reflecting the changing mix of our revenue.
All up, operating expenses grew 8%, which was generally in line with our expectations with the exception of G&A,
which declined due to lower legal expenses.
We continue to be thoughtful and diligent in how and where we focus our resources. In advertising, the team has
embraced One Microsoft, and the benefits are already accruing with improved messaging and results. And in R&D,
we're continuing to focus our resources while accelerating our cadence.
Operating income and earnings per share both declined 3% to $6.4 billion and $0.63 respectively. Unearned revenue
grew a healthy 14% to $20.1 billion. And our contracted-not-built balance grew to over $21 billion, driven by
Commercial strength.
Our inventory balance sequentially increased by $675 million, mostly due to builds of Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Ahead
of the holiday selling season, Xbox represents over half of our inventory balance. Inventory for Surface products
declined sequentially, even as we built levels ahead of this week's Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 launches.
This quarter we announced a 22% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share, and also announced a $40
billion share repurchase program. We returned $3.8 billion of cash to shareholders, our highest quarterly amount since
the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
I'm now going to talk about the performance in each of our reporting segments. Our Devices & Consumer Licensing
segment is comprised principally of Windows OEM, Consumer Office, and Windows Phone, including related patent
licensing.
Our Windows OEM business performed better than expected, declining 7% versus our expectation of a mid-teens
decline. As Amy noted, we believe we are seeing stabilization in business PCs, which grew again this quarter and drove
Pro revenue growth of 6%. We also saw better than expected performance in the Consumer part of our business.
Non-Pro revenue declined 22% but was several points better than expected. Excluding the impact of China, which
continues to have a different dynamic than other emerging markets, non-Pro revenue declined 17%.
Together with our OEM and retail partners, we brought an incredible breadth of Windows devices to market. We've
also made meaningful improvements to our advertising campaigns, which now clearly highlight the value proposition
of our devices. As we head into holiday, we're excited by the opportunities to bring the new Windows experience to
even more users around the globe.
Consumer Office licensing revenue declined this quarter. The financial impact of the shift to Office 365 Home
Premium was generally in line with our expectations. Office 365 subscribers benefit from the natural integration of
services, such as SkyDrive and Skype, and have the flexibility to access the service from numerous endpoints. Whether
via traditional licensing or subscription, customers continue to see the value in Office, as overall attach of Office
increased this quarter.
The Windows Phone ecosystem is seeing sustained growth. While we have work to do, our share is growing in many
geographies. The device portfolio is expanding, and the number of apps available in the marketplace is increasing.

I'll now move on to our Devices & Consumer hardware segment, where revenue grew $401 million, driven almost
entirely by Surface. With improved sales and marketing efforts, combined with pricing and promotional activities, we
saw Surface units and revenue grow sequentially from Q4, with the mix of sales shifting towards the 32-gigabyte RT
device. Demand increased for this device both in retail and in education.
From a gross margin perspective, in addition to product costs, which grew as a result of increased Surface sales, we
also incurred non-product expenses as we readied inventory lines with the new Surface lineup in the holiday sales
cycle.
Moving to Devices & Consumer Other, as a reminder, this segment includes our online marketplaces, advertising,
Xbox Studios, Office 365 Home Premium, and other consumer products and services. This quarter, revenue growth in
this segment was driven by both an increase in advertising revenue and also volumes in our online marketplaces.
Search advertising revenue grew 47%, driven by continued revenue per search improvement and query volume growth.
Bing has now grown its share of search queries in the U.S. to 18%. Gross margin declined slightly due to higher royalty
costs and also infrastructure cost growth as we expand the geographic footprint of our services.
Turning now to our Commercial business, where all-up Commercial revenue across both on-prem and cloud services
grew 10% this quarter; notably, even as we invest for growth, we saw gross margin expansion in our Commercial cloud
business. Across our Commercial portfolio, we saw healthy renewals, a continued shift to premium products, and
strong adoption of our cloud services. Our enterprise cloud strategy is resonating with customers, and Server product
revenue grew 12%. SQL Server revenue grew double digits, with SQL Server Premium revenue growing over 30%.
Our Commercial Office products also remained strong and grew 11%. Within this, SharePoint, Exchange, and Lync
collectively grew double digits, with Lync growing nearly 30%.
Helping to drive this demand for our Server and Office products is deployment of hybrid cloud solutions. This quarter,
revenue for our commercial cloud services grew over 100%, as services such as Office 365 are integrated with Azure
services for comprehensive cloud solutions. Importantly, we are seeing strong customer adoption, with Office 365 seats
and Azure customers both growing triple digits. Dynamics CRM Online is also expanding its space, with two-thirds of
new Dynamics CRM customers opting for the cloud.
With that overview of our Commercial business, let me share the financial performance each of our Commercial
reporting segments. Revenue in the Commercial Licensing segment grew 7%. And in our Commercial Other segment,
revenue grew 28% to $1.6 billion.
As a reminder, Corporate and Other is where we consolidate adjustments for tech guarantees, presales, and the like. In
the comparable quarter of last year, we had aggregate deferrals of $1.4 billion for Windows and Office. And this
quarter, we deferred $113 million, primarily related to Windows 8.1 presales.
Having now talked to our results for the past quarter, let me turn it over to Amy to discuss our forward-looking
guidance.
Amy Hood
Thanks, Chris.
As we look towards the second quarter, we are assuming the macro environment will remain generally the same. With
this, we expect many of the dynamics we saw in the first quarter to continue, with strong performance in our
Commercial business and ongoing improvement in our Consumer business.
Importantly, we're set up for a terrific holiday season. We have a wide variety of Windows-based devices in market.
Earlier this week, we launched Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2. And in November, we'll launch our next-generation
console, Xbox One. Building on the performance and unique experiences that gamers love, it will also deliver an
innovative entertainment experience by bringing movies, music, sports, and live TV together in one place.

With that, let's get into the outlook, starting with Devices & Consumer. In licensing, we expect revenue to be $5.2
billion to $5.4 billion. This range reflects similar dynamics to what we saw in the first quarter. As I noted earlier, we
expect the business PC market to be stable. However, the consumer PC market is subject to more volatility.
In hardware, we expect revenue to grow 35% to 45% to $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion, reflecting the expanded Surface
lineup and the much anticipated Xbox One launch. The ten percentage point range reflects variability in device unit
volumes. In the consumer hardware business, such variability is not uncommon, especially during launches and the
holiday season.
And in Devices & Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Search revenue should
continue to grow, reflecting improved revenue per search and query volume. As a reminder, in Q2 of the prior year, we
launched Halo 4, which contributed $380 million of revenue to this segment.
Now moving on to Commercial, we expect revenue to grow 9% to 11%, in line with the first quarter. As we think about
this part of the business, we're confident in our ability to continue to add value to our products while providing low
total cost of ownership for our customers. In Commercial Licensing, we expect revenue to be $10.7 billion to $10.9
billion, with similar dynamics to what we saw in the first quarter. This includes healthy renewals and strong annuity
revenue growth from volume licensing with Software Assurance.
In Commercial Other, we expect revenue to be $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, reflecting ongoing momentum in our
Commercial Cloud business and Enterprise Services. As CIOs increasingly look to capitalize on the opportunities of
cloud computing, we are confident they will continue to look to Microsoft for their IT solutions.
Moving on to cost of revenue, which we expect to be $7.9 billion to $8.3 billion next quarter, this range primarily
relates to the unit variability assumed in the hardware revenue. In Surface, we are still in the early stages of the life
cycle. As you know, there are many things that go into bringing hardware to market, including both variable and fixed
costs. We are focused on building volumes and achieving scale to cover these costs and get to profitability.
As you think about the economic model for Xbox, you should keep in mind that console margins are just one aspect of
the overall platform's financial performance. Attach of games, accessories, Xbox LIVE services also contribute to the
economic model. We expect the launch of Xbox One to be the biggest in Xbox history, and we feel great about our
ability to continue our leadership position in the living room.
Moving on to operating expenses, we expect OpEx to grow 6% to 8% to $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion. We also reaffirm
our full-year guidance of $31.3 billion to $31.9 billion. We continue to invest in innovative experiences for our
customers while remaining focused on expense.
We still expect full-year capital expenditures to be about $6.5 billion, even though we only spent $1.2 billion in the first
quarter. Given the nature of the investment, there is variability from quarter to quarter due to our success-based
approach as well as the timing of delivery and completions.
We expect our tax rate for the full year to be between 18% and 20%, depending on our geographical mix of earnings.
When adjusting for tech guarantees and product deferrals, we expect unearned revenue to be roughly in line with
historical trends.
So in summary, I'm really pleased with our results this quarter. It was a great start to the fiscal year as we executed and
delivered across all of our businesses. We are on track with implementing the transformation of the company around
the One Microsoft strategy, and at the same time are not missing a beat and executing faster. And as we look forward to
the second quarter, our enterprise business will remain strong and we're also set up fantastic holiday season, with
Surface, Xbox One, and a host of devices from our partners, which will allow us to reach new customers and drive
increased engagement.
With that, I'll turn it to Chris, and then we'll take your questions.

Thanks Amy. With that, we're going to move on to the Q&A. Operator, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Good afternoon. Amy and Chris, thanks for the additional details. I know everyone appreciates the
forward-looking details. My question is on the Commercial revenue, obviously an impressive number in a seasonally
soft Q1. Your guidance assumes also continued good trajectory. Maybe if you can walk through why you think you're
outgrowing your peers; what has led to this double digit number?
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Brent, for that question. I do think when I think about the Commercial business and focus
on our unearned revenue growth of 14% plus our bookings growth, which was quite strong as well at 6%, I think about
the roadmap. The strength of the commitments that customers are making is really forward looking. It's a three-year
commitment to the Microsoft platform, both to our cloud and on-prem solutions, the breadth and strength of that
roadmap in our offerings. And I think in many ways that's what gives us the confidence that we're outperforming our
peers. And also, I think it speaks a lot to the innovation in the roadmap we've shown. Whether it's for Azure, Office
365, or our broader Server portfolio, I do feel quite good about both our competitive position and our ability to execute.
I think we did a great job in the field this quarter remaining focused on delivering what we needed to deliver to our
customers, and we were quite pleased.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Great, thank you.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Brent; next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Hi. Thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on Xbox and the
Xbox platform. Amy, I'm wondering if you can give us maybe some color on how it performed this quarter. But in
particular as you look into the December quarter here, you obviously gave gross margin guidance. But I was wondering
if you could talk high level about how you're approaching the Xbox One launch today versus Xbox 360 from the
perspective of how you're pricing it relative to COGS and just how the build of Xbox One looks versus Xbox 360.
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Phil. I think it's a great question that gives me the opportunity to talk about the breadth of
the portfolio that we'll have to offer at holiday, and then talk a little bit about the gross margin profile and philosophy
we have amongst those products.
We are excited that we'll have a great value offer at holiday with Xbox 360. And we'll also have a great choice with our
innovative Xbox One platform to really give us a good breadth rolling into holiday of selections across price points. We
did with Xbox One make a decision to really enable a first-class experience out of the box. There's Kinect. There's a
headset, and there's the console. And depending on where you are around the globe, there may be a game included as
part of bundles for geographic interest.
As I've said, the best way always to think about the life value of the Xbox plan is over its life cycle. I'm excited about
the increased opportunity Xbox One allows us to attach more and different services beyond what we've historically

thought of as simply a gaming platform. And when I think about the opportunity going forward, it is important in Q2 to
realize that will impact our gross margin in the short term. But winning the platform at holiday and our positioning to
do that allows us to grow profitability in a far different way over the life cycle. So hopefully that helps.
<A - Chris Suh>: Great, Phil. Thank you. Let's move on to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with JPMorgan Chase. Thank you, please proceed
with your question.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Thanks. Amy, billings were about what we modeled for the quarter, but deferred revenue was
about $700 million less than we expected anyway, which was equal to the upside in revenue, and so I'm just curious:
did you end up recognizing a greater portion of revenue up front this quarter than you normally would? Because I
realize given how you recognize revenue, I guess the question could be said. Was the transactional portion of the
revenue in the Commercial segment greater than it is typically this quarter?
<A - Chris Suh>: Hi, John. This is Chris. I'm going to jump in a little bit and I'll let Amy add on. I think the way we
think about it is we did see growth across annuity and non-annuity in the business. But also the changing dynamic is the
mix of the dollars that are going into unearned revenue. As we bill more contracts in some of our subscription
offerings, that also changes the nature of the term. If you think about one-year subscription offerings and things like
this, that has a little bit of an effect on the unearned revenue balance as well.
<A - Amy Hood>: Let me add a little bit because I would have said, John, both of the things you said are true and both
are good, which is I do think our unearned balance growing 14% year over year was better than we actually had
expected from our perspective. And we also saw very good non-annuity performance within the quarter, particularly in
Office and in SQL, which I think are very good signs we believe to see the strength as broad-based. As you know, the
annuity portion tends to be related to large customers making long-term commitments. Some of the non-annuity is
exciting because it tends to be smaller customers who have decided to go ahead and upgrade to the most recent version
of Office, which is also encouraging.

Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Kenneth Wong>: Hi, guys. This is Ken Wong for Walter. I guess we wanted to focus a bit on Windows. The
OEM business was down just 7% this quarter versus down 15% last quarter in what seemed like a really – you guys
had a lot of pressure on ASPs and whatnot. I guess what drove the quick turnaround from quarter to quarter, maybe if
you could just dig in a little bit there?
<A - Amy Hood>: Let me try to break it up a little bit, Ken, to make sure I understand and get a chance to talk about
the overall performance. Business was better than we expected, so actually ASPs were probably higher than many
people had modeled and than we had expected due to mix. Growing 6% in the Pro segment was both better than we
expected and probably better than many people had considered.
Now in the Consumer segment, the minus 22% – and taking out China, it's a minus 17% – I think it's generally overall,
when you take those two numbers, probably in line with most of the device level estimates for PCs we've seen across
the industry and from some of our peers reporting in the system. I do think we were impacted by some inventory levels
that did come down a bit actually this quarter as well. So I think overall, we do think that things are probably more

<Q - Keith Weiss>: Excellent, thank you, guys, for taking the question. You saw a real market uptick in the search
advertising revenue. Any particular catalyst you can point us to in terms of what really catalyzed that part of the
business and how sustainable that's going be on a go-forward basis?
<A - Amy Hood>: Sure. Thanks, Keith, a couple things. It was driven, as you noted, both by RPS improvements and
volume improvements, which is encouraging. I also think underlying that are some real technical improvements we've
made within the search engine. Algos [Algorithms] are better, and the investments we're making are really allowing us
to monetize at a higher level. We also saw some strength in a few other geos, which helped increase the performance
there. So I do believe that trend we expect to continue into Q2.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Hi, great. Thank you, Amy and Chris. I just was wondering. You talked about the entry of a
lot of new SKUs that are coming out for the holiday season. As we start thinking about building our OEM models, how
do we think about ASPs for this eight-inch and below category that you referenced there's a lot of product coming out
with?
<A - Amy Hood>: Good question, Heather. Let me talk about first the importance of the breadth of the offers that
we're putting into market. With Windows 8.1, one of the focuses we had was to expand both the opportunity for screen
sizes and to reach new price points and to cover really from the smallest to the largest with touch and non-touch. And I
think our ability to work with partners and some of the sales execution we've seen in the field has led to have a broad
opportunity at retail for holiday for devices.
It is important. I do hope in some ways – this is a question that's a bit awkward. You always want to say it's good to
have ASPs go up. Transparently going forward, as we make more progress, especially in the smaller screen sizes, we
should expect units to go up and be very excited about that in terms of share, but ASPs would trend down. I don't think
that will have a material – our guidance does not assume a material impact to ASPs in Q2. But over the long term, I
actually do understand the question and would expect ASPs to be on that trend line, assuming we are successful in

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Thank you. And, Amy, thank you for giving so much more data and guidance. We
appreciate it. A couple quick attach questions, you had said that the Consumer Office last quarter was going be down
roughly 5%, lower than the PCs due to the move to subscription. You said the attach was higher this quarter. Should we
think that the dip was roughly in line with that?
<A - Chris Suh>: Hi, Mark. This is Chris.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Hi.
<A - Chris Suh>: Let me try to clarify the numbers just so we're all on the same page. So we did say Consumer Office
did decline this quarter. Last quarter, you're right; we said about five points of impact. And so the impact indeed was
about what we expected. But with the increase in attach, they tended to offset each other in the end. And so the
numbers came in pretty much as expected. So I think that's the right way to think about it.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Okay, perfect.
<A - Amy Hood>: Of course, I can't let Chris – I'm going add a little to the answer, sorry. Mark, I do think it's
important for us to continue to reiterate the importance of the success of the Office 365 Home Premium SKU from a
strategic standpoint. We have done a very good job, and I would say as a mix percentage of the SKU it continues to do
even a little better than we had hoped in terms of execution at the endpoint in driving value. And while that does have
an impact on the initial ASP of the SKU, the long-term lifetime value of that product, in my belief, given the always
up-to-date, first-to-see innovation, use across multi-endpoints, inclusion of Skype, inclusion of SkyDrive really does
allow for a higher lifetime value and ultimately a happy customer. And so I really am encouraged by our progress and
our execution there.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Beautiful, one other quick question. Any sense for what commercial licensing would have
been if not for the move to cloud and subscription, does it make a material change yet at this point?
<A - Chris Suh>: No, the best way to think about that, Mark, is if you look at – it's not an exact offset. But when I
talked about the Commercial business all up, I gave the cost structure around products like Commercial Office,
Commercial Server as all up across both on-prem and Commercial. So we talked about Office growing 11% across
both Commercial Licensing and Commercial Other in aggregate. If you look at the specific segment, you'll see that
Office in the Commercial Licensing segment, actually grew 6%. So you can see that we're having outsized growth in
the Commercial Other segment, which is Office 365, so that maybe helps at least dimensionalize the size of the growth
in relative terms.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Perfect, I do appreciate it. Thank you both.
<A - Amy Hood>: Sure.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Rick G. Sherlund>: Thanks. Just to follow up on Mark's question, I believe there was a slide at [ph] STAM
(37:20) that showed about $150 million of negative impact in the quarter from the move to the cloud, which in and of
itself is about 1% of revenue, so it's not a very big deal. And I think most of that was from Office versus Server &
Tools. So if you say it's about as expected, I guess I was just looking for some clarification here. Is really the only
impact we're seeing in the Office segment versus Server & Tools, or was there much impact in that part of the business
from the move to subscription?
<A - Amy Hood>: Rick, let me clarify. The $150 million, you're right, was actually just related to the Consumer Office
segments and had no broader connotation beyond that. So that $150 million in a quarter on Consumer Office actually
does have a meaningful impact to the growth of that, especially versus PCs. So that being said, obviously, if we've
talked about the momentum in our broad Office 365 revenue, it is a bigger impact across not just Office because I think
that's actually not the way we're thinking about Office 365's impact. There it's really around Exchange, Lync,
SharePoint, and the broad Server impact there is actually more meaningful than its impact on maybe Office Client on
the Commercial side.
<A - Chris Suh>: Great. Thanks, Rick; next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Ross MacMillan>: Thanks a lot. I have two questions. Just first on the Device and Consumer Licensing business,
your forecast for Q2 suggests a moderating decline. And I was curious as to whether on the corporate OEM side, if you
will, that's just a reflection of the ongoing stabilization trend. Or do you also expect to see improvement on the
Consumer OEM side? And related to that, how do you think about the impact of the end of life of Windows XP on the
corporate OEM side? Do you think that the improvement is completely unrelated to that end of life forthcoming, or do
you think there could be some impact related to that? Thanks.
<A - Amy Hood>: Great. Let me divide up that question, I think, because as you said, it's two parts. Our Q2 guidance
for Devices and Consumer Licensing really says that the trends we saw in Q1 on both sides continue in Q2. So I think
that's an important distinction, as you noted and asked for clarification on. So I hope that's helpful in that component.
And when it comes to end of life of Windows XP, I tend to think about that more on the VL [Volume License] side as
well and the strength there, which will be in the Commercial reporting segments. We continue to make progress on the
Windows XP install base, and now a little over 75% of the PCs are running Windows 7. And so I do think as we
continue to get to end of life of Windows XP, you'll see the impact more on the VL side of the business than you would
in the Device and Consumer Licensing segment.
<Q - Ross MacMillan>: Thank you very much. That's helpful, and maybe one quick follow-up. Just on the Office
business overall in the Commercial segment, if you think about units, whether licensed or Office 365, when you just
think of the aggregate pool of units, you alluded to it before. But did that perform in line with your expectation, or was
it actually slightly better on a unit basis? Thank you.
<A - Amy Hood>: It was slightly better, Ross, is the best way of thinking about that from a unit perspective.
<Q - Ross MacMillan>: Thank you very much, congratulations.

Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Edward E. Maguire>: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could address the conditions in
China in a little bit more detail, not just on the consumer but also in the commercial as well as what your expectations
might be given the lifting of the ban on game consoles for Xbox there, and also if you could just address some of what
you're seeing in terms of your commercial cloud adoption outside of the U.S. Thank you.
<A - Chris Suh>: I'll take the first part of the question, Ed. So yes, as I said on the call, the macro conditions in China,
which I think is consistent with what some of the other companies have reported as well, have been challenging. Our
total revenue across all of our business, including the PC-related businesses, were down year over year, and I think that
overall impacting our results in China all up. I think the second part of your question was related to commercial cloud.
I'm sorry; can you repeat your second question?
<Q - Edward E. Maguire>: Sure, I was wondering about Xbox expectations there, but also the trends of commercial
cloud adoption in areas outside of the U.S.
<A - Amy Hood>: We haven't really talked specifically about our expectations for China on the Xbox, but let me take
the second half of that question. Our performance in both Office 365 and Azure has actually been quite good both in
the U.S., to your question, and outside the U.S. Part of the reason that you've seen us investing on the capital expense
side is to continue to build out the opportunity set because we are seeing good demand outside the U.S. And I do think
our ability to be competitive there is just as high as it is here, so we've already seen that growth.
<Q - Edward E. Maguire>: Thank you.
<A - Chris Suh>: Great. Thanks, Ed; next question, please.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I wanted to drill a little bit into how you're thinking about
holiday on the Consumer hardware side, and specifically just expectations around Surface, and then also any insight or
color you think in terms of what your expectations are with RT versus Pro. Thank you.
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Jason. I think overall for holiday, given our guidance, we clearly do expect a healthy
holiday performance across the portfolio. I say that because we do have offerings that provide great value. From having
Surface V1 RT still in market, Surface 2, Surface 2 Pro, plus Xbox 360 plus Xbox One, it really does provide both a
value portfolio and those who want the latest and greatest experience have something covered. The guidance does
include good performance across all of those product lines. We did see, I think as Chris and I both talked about, a lot of
progress in sales execution on Surface in particular this quarter, and that does give us more confidence about our ability
to execute again well in Q2. In particular, as you noted, RT did do quite well this quarter, and I look forward to seeing
that continue with the Surface 2 device as well at holiday.

<Q - Kash Gopalan Rangan>: Hi, thank you very much for all the details as well. Maybe my math skills have gotten
horribly weak, but I just took the midpoint, Amy, of your revenue guidance for the different line items and also the
midpoint of your cost of revenue inputs and the midpoint of your OpEx, and I come up with what looks to be about a
10% reduction to where I think most sell-side models – or maybe I'm doing – I'm hoping that I did something wrong
here. But if that's the case, I get about 29% op margin relative to the 33% or so that you did last year. So can you just
walk us through what are the items that you are assuming in your cost structure which effectively makes the op income
flat, although you are getting a good revenue growth rate? I just wonder if are there any one-time items, or if it's just
emblematic of a shift in your business model to Devices & Consumer, especially with Nokia going forward. I wonder if
we should not be thinking about op margin but really op income growth rate. Thank you.
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Kash. I think the one thing I would urge you to do as you think about the guidance we gave
is looking specifically at the D&C hardware guidance as well as making sure you're mapping the COGS very
specifically to whatever assumption you're making in D&C hardware. Given the business model of Xbox, that can and
will have an impact in Q2 to the overall gross margin structure. So as you think through that, I think that's probably one
of the assumptions that it may sound like using the midpoint could lead you a bit off of where I would have expected.
<Q - Kash Gopalan Rangan>: Got it, thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Thank you. I just wanted to follow on from Jason's question earlier on. Can you talk a little
bit about where you see the improved success and the sales execution success on the Surface? Is it Commercial? Is it
Consumer? What's driving the improvement there? And how much is the improved revenue run rate also driven by the
fact that the channel needed to be ready for the holiday season? Thank you.
<A - Chris Suh>: Hi, Raimo. Thanks for the question. As we talked about, especially for this last quarter of Surface,
we saw two things I'll mention, which is popularity of the Surface 32-gigabyte RT device; that one was more successful
this last quarter. And we actually saw demand increase in both Commercial and in the Education customer segment as
well. So we did see some improvement across both those segments.
<A - Amy Hood>: Yes, I would say that another way is that it was in retail and in Education was really our RT
performance.
<A - Chris Suh>: Yes, sorry.
<A - Amy Hood>: Chris, let me go back a bit. I just want to make sure that was clear. It really was better execution at
retail and in Edu, and I still look forward to building a Commercial channel, which we're just starting to do as we
continue to add resellers to our model.

<Q - Brendan J. Barnicle>: Thanks so much, guys. I had two quick ones. One was the SQL Server success continues
to be very impressive, particularly relative to the field, so I'm wondering where you're seeing the most success there. Is
that market share gains? Is that pricing is getting into some new markets? If you've got any color there, that would be
helpful. And then when's your expectation for the next update on Nokia?
<A - Amy Hood>: Great. Let me take the second one first because it's the easiest. We still do expect the transaction to
close in the first calendar quarter of 2014. And post-closing, if there are any EPS impact changes to what we said
before, we'll give them post-closing.
So now back to your original question on SQL, that's a terrific one to get to talk about. Our growth there is, as you said,
both share growth and revenue growth. It's happened I think generally both in BI, which we've seen a lot of traction
with. I don't know if you've had a chance to see some of our Power View announcements recently. Our ability to span
from the end user to the hardest big data problems really has resonated both in the market and with industry analysts
who have taken I think a strong position that we're the real market leader there. The other thing I would say is a very
healthy performance of our premium SKUs. Our premium SKUs have continued to provide market growth and I think
are competing quite well with the competition.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Gregg S. Moskowitz>: Thank you very much and good afternoon, guys, just two questions. First, Amy, if I recall
correctly, I believe last quarter you had mentioned an expectation for double-digit annuity growth in fiscal 2014. Is that
still how you're thinking about the annuity part of the business? And secondly, the year-over-year cloud revenue
growth you reported was certainly impressive. But I was wondering if you could shed some light perhaps on how much
of Azure billings or revenue are incremental versus cannibalistic.
<A - Amy Hood>: Two good questions. I do expect our annuity growth, and the guidance we gave still does assume
double-digit annuity growth going forward. And I think our performance this quarter gives me confidence that the
guidance in Q2 is the right one, given our strengths and our competitive position.
Secondly on cloud revenue, your question gives me an opportunity to talk about the importance of our hybrid cloud.
Within especially our server business, our ability to power the cloud, whether you want to run it, you want a service
provider to run it, or you want to use ours, is really an incredibly powerful story. And I think in some ways, whether or
not it's cannibalizing becomes somewhat difficult. What we've generally found right now is that it has been often
additive. And if you look at our server growth all-up, which we tried to provide to help give some parameters around
that to give some confidence that we're both growing the base and providing additive opportunity, I think that's the
number I would probably look to, to see the impact there.

<Q - S. Kirk Materne>: Thank you very much for fitting me in; I guess two quick ones for you, Amy, on the
Commercial cloud offerings. I guess first around Office 365, you mentioned you've seen pretty good uptake, even
outside the U.S. I was interested in just your ability to monetize Office 365 in some of the emerging markets that have
been challenging over time for Office. And then secondly as a follow-up to Greg's question on Server, within Azure,
how much of the uptake in Azure is coming from existing Microsoft logos versus bringing on net new logos onto the
platform? Thanks.
<A - Amy Hood>: Great, thanks, Kirk. I'm going to talk about two things. I do think it's interesting. Maybe the best
example of how to think about us moving beyond our traditional markets is the fact that we were the first to connect to
a data center in China, a market that we've historically had challenges monetizing at a high level. We went there. We're
going there with Office 365 and Azure. We look forward to being able to make progress. We're investing, both head
count and capital dollars, because we do believe this provides interesting opportunity for us to begin monetizing end
markets better than harder for us to grow in maybe with our more traditional business model.
Secondly with Azure, I think we've seen both. The thing I would say is what has been really helpful is that as we make
it easier to attach Azure services to our normal rhythm in the field through our enterprise agreements and through
volume licensing, it provides a really helpful way and a really easy selling motion to provide customer flexibility. We
added in the normal rhythm of a sales motion. We allow people to try, use and buy. And that has served us well in
terms of being able to expose Azure to more and more customers in a normal selling cycle. So I think that's probably
one of the better ways. It's the same actual selling rhythm we've used with Office 365 so successfully.
Amy Hood
And with that, I wanted to say thank you. I know that this quarter we changed reporting segments, and that requires a
lot of work. So thank you for all the work put in to understand our transition that we're trying to make as a company.
