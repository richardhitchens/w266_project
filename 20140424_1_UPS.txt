Joe Wilkins
Good morning. Welcome to the UPS First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Scott Davis, our CEO, and
Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, along with Chief Operating Officer, David Abney, International President, Jim Barber, President
of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray, and UPS's Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.
Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are
forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the
company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties which are described in detail in our 2013 Form
10-K, which is available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Although there were no adjustments to first quarter 2014 results, there was an adjustment related to the attempted
acquisition of TNT that increased first quarter 2013 diluted earnings per share by $0.04. As a result, in our remarks
today, all quarterly and full-year comments and comparisons will refer to adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss
UPS's free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The webcast of today's call, along with a reconciliation
of free cash flow and adjusted results, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website.
Before we review the details of the quarter, I want to announce that we plan to hold an investor conference later this
year. The 2014 UPS investor conference will be held at the Grand Hyatt hotel in New York on November 13. We look
forward to updating you on our strategy, demonstrating our technology, and sharing our plans for the future. You will
be receiving a save-the-date invitation soon with more details. And just as a reminder, as on previous calls, please ask
only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.
Thanks for your cooperation. Now we'll turn it over to Scott.
D. Scott Davis
Thanks, Joe. Welcome to your first call. And good morning to everyone. UPS first quarter performance produced
mixed results. International demonstrated strong volume growth and margin expansion on an 8% increase in export
shipments. Supply Chain and Freight delivered results that were about as we expected. However, our U.S. domestic
segment fell short, due to the unusually harsh weather during the first quarter. We pride ourselves on being an
all-weather company, but the intensity of this year's winter storm season produced challenging conditions. Buildings
across the UPS network were forced to cease operations somewhere in the U.S. on 34 days during the quarter. These
weather events not only led to increased costs, but also influenced UPS product and customer mix, contributing to
lower yields. We saw business-to-business shipments slow, as manufacturers, distributors and retailers closed shop. On
the other hand, snowbound consumers took to the Internet to make their purchases. Clearly, UPS results in the U.S.
reflect both the lost revenue and the additional costs associated with these storms. And Kurt will provide more details
in just a moment.
While we're yet to see the first quarter U.S. GDP numbers, it's safe to say that growth will be slower due to weather.
The good news is that spring has arrived, and we expect the pace of U.S. economic growth to pick up as 2014
progresses. In Europe, the economy is showing signs of recovery and faster growth. Yet, if the situation in the Ukraine
deteriorates, that pace may slow. Economic expansion in Asia has remained steady, with mid-single-digit growth. And
in Latin America, expectations call for increased merchandise exports.
The economic benefit of global trade is clearly visible in both established and emerging economies. Trade promotes
economic expansion, creates jobs, makes companies more competitive, and lowers prices for consumers. Congress now
needs to act to pass a trade promotion authority bill or TPA that supports economic growth and job creation in the U.S.
TPA gives the administration authority to pursue trade agreements to meet objectives laid out by Congress.
We strongly encourage swift passage of TPA, as there are currently three important trade pacts pending that provide
real economic benefits, and TPA will clearly increase their chances of success.

The expansion of global trade is an important catalyst to the UPS growth strategy. Recently, our management
committee and board of directors conducted a detailed review of UPS's long-term strategic initiatives and identified key
opportunities that bring long-term value to both customers and shareowners. The updates we received were
encouraging. UPS is on the right path to ensure that our solutions meet the ever-changing needs of the marketplace. We
will continue to stay focused on providing industry-specific solutions as we invest in our healthcare capabilities and
develop omni-channel solutions for the retail industry. In addition, we reviewed the implementation of the operational
technology projects, Orion and hub automation.
On the international front, Jim Barber will bring you up to date this morning on how we're expanding the UPS global
network in both developed and emerging economies, as well as what we're doing to serve end consumers around the
world. In support of our healthcare strategy, UPS announced several investments during the quarter, including the
acquisition of Polar Speed. This addition to our global healthcare network will provide improved access to the
important U.K. market as well as unique cold chain transportation capabilities. Also, UPS opened new healthcare
distribution facilities in Canada and Mexico and announced plans to expand with additional facilities in Brazil and
Chile late this year, further increasing our capabilities in Latin America. Adding to these industry-specific solutions,
we've expanded our distribution network in North America for retail and manufacturing clients. These investments add
almost 500,000 square feet to our footprint at three key distribution sites in Kentucky, California, and Alberta, Canada.
Now, before I turn it over to Kurt, I want to give you a quick update on what we've been doing regarding peak season.
During the last couple of months, we have met with UPS's largest customers. We are working collectively to improve
forecasting accuracy, increase visibility of shipments, and improve mutual planning capabilities. Our shared goal is to
enhance the end consumer's experience.
In addition, David Abney and his team are on track with the system changes, facility automation and capacity
enhancements we discussed last quarter. These improvements will provide better flexibility at peak and will deliver
service and productivity gains throughout the year. As we continue to implement these enhancements, we will keep you
updated on our progress.
Now Kurt will take you through the details of the quarter.
Kurt P. Kuehn
Well, thanks, Scott. And good morning, everyone. Our goal today is not to make this call all about weather. But
unfortunately, it did significantly weigh on earnings. So we'll have to spend a minute or two talking about it. The
difficult weather environment this quarter created severe operational challenge that increased cost and also pressured
demand. But fortunately, due to our diversified portfolio, weather is not the only story. Most notably, we're encouraged
by the strong momentum in International and the positive results in the Supply Chain and Freight segment. We expect
both of these to continue.
Now let's review the segment results. Our U.S. domestic operating profit was $927 million, down $158 million, with
margin contracting 220 basis points. Clearly, the impact of weather was reflected in the bottom line. We estimate that
the profitability was lowered by almost $200 million. This includes the additional expense from lost productivity, snow
removal, increased utilities. In addition, it was a drag on revenue due to perishable demand and increased service
refunds. UPS experienced service disruptions in the network on more than half of the operating days in the quarter,
materially increasing network costs as we attempted to navigate around the many storms.
For example, a substantial rise in the number of delayed trailers slowed network operations and pushed direct labor
hours up 5.4%, including a 20% increase in overtime. U.S. domestic revenue increased 2.6% to $8.5 billion. We were
encouraged to see strong demand in the U.S. as daily volume was up 4.2%. Ground products were up 4.4%, driven by
SurePost, which grew more than 50%. UPS deferred products grew 6.3% and Next Day Air was 1.5% higher, due to
increases in Next Day Air Saver package. B2C shipping contributed broadly to gains across all products, while B2B
improved slightly, primarily from e-commerce, including omni-channel customers. Average revenue per package
declined by 1.5%. Base rate increases were more than offset by changes in customer and product mix. Slightly lower

fuel surcharges and weather also contributed to yield declines.
Couple of interesting things we noticed. Customer mix shifted a bit as large accounts were able to more effectively
manage around storms. Also, B2B volume was clearly reduced by weather events. Whereas in contrast, B2C growth
remained robust, as consumers were able to continue shopping online, pushing our residential delivery mix to almost
44%.
Next, the international segment results. We're encouraged by the positive business trends we're seeing, especially in
Europe. UPS international revenue was up 5% to $3.1 billion. Operating profit increased 12%, and operating margin
expanded 90 basis points to 14%. Over the last several quarters, we've been making adjustments to optimize network
efficiencies. These improvements, coupled with the increased shipments, contributed to margin expansion during the
quarter. Our international export volume was 7.7% higher, with Europe leading the way with growth to all regions of
the world. Strong demand for UPS trans-border products increased intra-European exports by more than 15%.
Non-U.S. domestic volume jumped more than 8%, led by Germany, Poland, the U.K. and Canada. Export yields on a
currency neutral basis were down 3.2%, negatively impacted by shorter trade lanes and changing product mix, as
non-premium products grew by 13%, with premium up 4%.
Looking now at Supply Chain and Freight, operating profit was up 3.5% to $148 million, led by the forwarding and
distribution business units. Operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 6.8%. In forwarding, shipments and tonnage
increased, while market conditions drove revenue per kilo lower. The ocean forwarding and brokerage businesses both
experienced solid revenue gains and improved profitability. The distribution unit continued to expand its footprint, with
the facility openings that Scott mentioned earlier. The retail and healthcare sectors combined to produce
mid-single-digit revenue growth. Operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 9%, despite the expansion costs. UPS
Freight saw both pressure on demand and higher operating costs due to weather. Revenue was up slightly, due to a 3%
improvement in LTL revenue per 100 weight that was offset by a 2% tonnage decline. Operating profit was lowered by
increased network costs associated with the difficult conditions.
Looking now at cash in our balance sheet, the ability to generate free cash flow on a consistent basis is a hallmark of
UPS. This quarter, UPS once again had a conversion rate well in excess of 100%, generating $1.9 billion in cash.
Capital expenditures were about $320 million. The pace of investment will accelerate as the year progresses. We expect
capital expenditures to reach $2.5 billion for 2014. Many of the network enhancements and operational technology
projects will ramp up during the second and third quarters.
Regarding shareowner distributions, UPS paid $596 million in dividends, reflecting the 8.1% increase announced by
the Board in February. In addition, the company repurchased 6.8 million shares for approximately $660 million. On the
labor front, we are pleased with the progress that's been made. And while we've not yet received final word from the
Teamsters, we feel it's an appropriate time to share with you some key elements of the new agreement. A detailed
presentation will be made available on the IR website upon implementation of the contract.
The new agreement includes reasonable wage and benefit increases, as well as flexibilities that will improve service
and profitability. UPS has devoted substantial time and effort, working to help the Teamsters better understand our cost
structures and the changes needed to provide attractive benefits in the future while remaining competitive in the
industry. Sponsorship of healthcare plans has become expensive, largely due to high healthcare inflation trends and
legislation like the Affordable Care Act. After much evaluation, we determined that the best path for UPS was to move
our union employees to multiemployer healthcare plans. In simple terms, UPS is moving from a defined healthcare
benefit plan to a defined contribution environment, with the contribution set for the duration of the contract.
Once the new contract is implemented, the responsibility for providing medical coverage will be assumed by Teamster
plans. As a part of this settlement, UPS will also remove existing post-retirement healthcare liabilities from our balance
sheet. This obligation for future retirees, as well as ongoing coverage for active employees, will become the
responsibility of the multiemployer plans. When we transfer this liability to the union, UPS expects to make a
significant cash payment to these plans and record a one-time charge. As I said, more details will come in the future
when the contract is finalized.

Looking now at our expectations for the rest of the year, while we took a hit in the first quarter, our expectations for the
remainder of the year are unchanged. In U.S. domestic, we still anticipate operating margin of approximately 14% for
the remainder of the year. We expect a little higher package growth, somewhere between 4% and 5%, resulting from
the gains in UPS SurePost.
Looking more closely at the quarters, as we discussed back in January, we will be incurring at least $100 million in
extra operating expense. This expense is related to network and systems enhancements, as well as the accelerated
deployment of ORION. The lion's share of this expense will weigh on the second and third quarters by about $0.02 to
$0.03 each. Our expectations for International and the Supply Chain and Freight segments remain unchanged.
So overall, we are encouraged by the positive trends we've seen across the business, and anticipate the remaining three
quarters to perform as we originally guided. However, due to the challenging start to 2014, we expect to be at the low
end of our earnings per share guidance range of $5.05 to $5.30.
Now, Jim will take you through our International business.
Jr. James Jay Barber
Thanks, Kurt. I would like to take a few minutes to update you on the key components of our International strategy and
the positive momentum we are experiencing. The International segment delivered our best volume growth since the
third quarter 2010, up almost 8% per day. This growth, combined with our network and operating efficiencies, drove
our industry-leading margin to 14%.
As we look at the business around the world, UPS experienced high growth in many developed economies during the
first quarter. For instance, in large European markets, like Germany, the UK, France and Spain, exports were up more
than 17%. Meanwhile, large Asian markets like Hong Kong and Japan saw export growth of more than 6%. We
continue to align our networks to market conditions and regional trade patterns.
Europe has been the foundation for UPS International investment and growth. Our customers continue to value the
capabilities and solutions that we provide to support the single market economy. One of the most rewarding
components of our Europe growth is to see the success of our recent acquisitions. Some examples of that success are:
Turkey with revenue up 18%; the UK was up 11%; and Poland was 15% higher. UPS operational methods and systems
facilitated the successful integrations of these key acquisitions.
Our intra-Europe air and ground networks are proving attractive to customers looking to optimize their supply chains.
We recently invested $200 million in the UPS Europe air network with the expansion of our Cologne air hub. This
increased our sort capacity by 70%, coupled with state-of-the-art security screening and improves our air and ground
network performance. The value of our extensive ground network in Europe was also evident, as cross-border
shipments were up 15% in the first quarter. Recent investments such as our Kiala acquisition and the UPS Access Point
rollout in Europe are further strengthening our e-commerce proposition, escalating our ability to serve the end
consumer around the world.
UPS My Choice continues to be a great success in the U.S. As part of our global retail strategy, we are evaluating
expansion opportunities for this end consumer solution in markets around the world.
In 2012, we changed how we interact with our middle market customers across our International business. We
understand their needs better, and are tailoring industry-specific solutions that add value for them. This initiative is
paying dividends as we achieved double-digit gains in four important verticals: retail, healthcare, industrial and
automotive. UPS capabilities and solutions resonate well in these verticals, giving us confidence that recent trends are
sustainable.
Emerging markets are the next logical step in the UPS international expansion strategy, and will contribute to growth,
as we enhance our capabilities in these underserved markets. We are the early stages of the UPS emerging markets
strategy. The realignment of the international businesses units is allowing us to concentrate our efforts and leadership

In closing, I'm proud of the dedication and hard work of UPSers around the world that produce these results. In fact, I

diversified portfolio. No matter where I go, UPS people speak the language of dedication and commitment to
exceeding our customer expectations. Thanks. Now I'll turn it back to you, Kurt.
Kurt P. Kuehn
Great. Thanks, Jim. And we look forward to a lot of great future events in the International segment. Operator, we'll
turn it back over to you, then, to open up the lines.
Q&A
Operator
Our first question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott A. Schneeberger>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Yeah, I'll address the weather and then guidance first off
here. You're maintaining that you can hit the low end of the previously stated guidance range despite the tough first
quarter. I'm just curious, what are the two or three main drivers that give you the confidence? You mentioned some
strong package growth in SurePost, but just the two or three broadly that you think will help you and maybe some
trends here into the second quarter that support your confidence in those. Thanks.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. Scott, it has been a challenging time, and our operations people in the U.S. faced clearly
extraordinary conditions and really storm after storm. And as you heard, over half the days, we had some significant
network operations with facilities shut down. So it was a very tough quarter. Beneath that, though, we do feel that the
initiatives we've rolled out and the core momentum of the company is continuing steadily. So if you peel away that
exclusion, basically our guidance remains unchanged. We're seeing a little better volume on the lightweight side and
the operations, now that skies have cleared, have worked a little better. So Myron, maybe you could talk a little bit of
how you guys, I guess, survived Q1 and the momentum coming into Q2.
<A - Myron A. Gray>: Yeah, as Scott and Kurt both have alluded to in their opening comments, on 34 of the 63
operating days in the quarter, we experienced severe weather conditions, prompting many of the governors in the states
that were affected to issue Level Three emergency conditions that prohibited us from working. We also saw a
tremendous uptake in the number of trailers that were impacted by weather rising over 400%. As a result of it, our
direct labor hours, as well as overtime expense, went up significantly. Overtime hours were impacted by more than
20%. I don't think there's a person in the country who is more happy about seeing spring weather return, and as a result
of it, in April, both our productivity and service has returned to normal levels. So as Kurt has alluded to, we don't see
an issue moving forward.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: And I'd just add the macroeconomic environment looks decent as we move forward. I think the
– both the global GDP and U.S. GDP will be a little better than they were last year, not robust but better than they were
a year ago. And what excites me is I think we're going to see all three segments producing good growth. We saw
International, we saw Supply Chain and Freight accomplish what they are supposed to in the first quarter. That
momentum is going forward. In domestic, we started to see improvement into March and we're seeing it in April, so we
feel very good about the 14% margins in domestic.
<Q - Scott A. Schneeberger>: Great. Thanks.

Next question will come from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You know, Kurt and Scott, I'm curious if you
can talk a little bit about pricing. Scott, given the comments you just made about GDP and given the experience in the
fourth quarter where we kind of ran out of capacity, it would seem to me we've got maybe an increasingly positive
backdrop for pushing harder on price. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about that and are we entering a
period where maybe pricing gets a bit better?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well, we do think that pricing is very stable and I'll have Alan talk about it a little bit. Clearly,
the significant change in our mix does mask what we think is a core base rate pricing of about 2% plus or minus. And
so with the substantial mix shift, it's made it hard to see. But we feel pretty good that we're making investments and
we'll be compensated fairly for it. So Alan, maybe you could expand a little bit on pricing.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah. I would just add that the base rate increases of about 2%, we've been experiencing
for quite some time certainly masked by customer and product mix changes that were certainly exasperated by some of
the weather trends that Kurt alluded to in the opening comments.
As far as peak season goes, our goal is to ensure we are appropriately compensated based on our customers' shipping
characteristics and also their seasonal patterns. And we're certainly working with each customer and their specific
contracts on an individual basis to make sure that we're compensated fairly for the services that we're providing.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Thanks for the time.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. If I can just follow up on the pricing commentary there and maybe
just get a little bit more specific on that, do you plan to use price to then adjust behavior in terms of getting it away
from the December 23 peak day and kind of maybe shifting the behavior a little earlier to help the network? And I
guess following on that, what additional projects – it sounded like you're doing things to accelerate shipments, maybe
some more automation. Can you maybe dig into that a little bit in terms of where the $100 million and $500 million of
investments are going?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Ken, I'll take your first question anyway and I'm going to let Alan expand a little bit on our real
priority with customers. Our top priority this year is to provide superior service and quality operations to help our
customers succeed during peak season. So we'll talk a little more in the future about the network enhancements. But
Alan, this is nothing new. You guys work with customers and plan out very specifically peak season and use both price
and strategy to manage that, right?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah. So just to add a little bit of color on that, we've met with all of our major and
certainly our largest customers to increase the collaboration. Very, very productive meetings that we've had. We're
working on improving mutual planning capabilities with obviously the ultimate goal of enhancing their end consumers'
customer experience. We're working on areas with these customers, splits, bypasses, direct ships, late multiple weekend
pickups, special operating plans, and then we're obviously communicating the plans that we're working on unilaterally
in the areas of forecasting, capacity planning, visibility and communication.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: And Ken, I'll just add that pretty much all options are still on the table. It's early in the process.
What we said last quarter is we really want to be able to meet customer expectations, but also meet our financial
objectives at peak. So we're still evaluating alternatives out there.

Our next question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Nate J. Brochmann>: Yeah. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to talk a little bit about maybe some of the
network adjustments that you're making in terms of – as you're getting more of the SurePost revenue, one of the
benefits on the ground network had been getting the better density on that local delivery on the B2C type front, and if
more are shifting over to the SurePost, which is probably great for the overall network in terms of the revenue streams,
but like you had to do on the international side, are you having to make any network adjustments because of that
flowing into SurePost? And then secondarily to that, and I know it's probably too early to talk specifics, but does the
new contract with the Teamsters give you greater flexibility to maybe handle more SurePost away from the direct
ground business? Thank you.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: I'll take the Teamster question, I guess the contract question first and then we'll move over to
probably David. The news just broke last night on this contract being ratified. We have not yet been formally notified
by the Teamsters. Once we get formal notification, as Kurt said, we will do a webcast with details of the contract, so
really don't want to get into the flexibilities of the costs until we get the formal notification, which hopefully is coming
soon.
<A - David P. Abney>: Okay. As far as the changes in the system and effects that it could have by the addition of
SurePost, really it's the same technology that we use in the rest of our business. Certainly helps us here. So SurePost
Redirect is about as good an example as you can have in how our technology allows us to accommodate this change. So
very late in the process, we can determine if there are additional packages going to the same stop, and then we can
redirect that. And then we will actually deliver it. It will be much cheaper than tendering it to the post office. If it's a
single package, then we would do just the opposite, let it go ahead and flow. There's other, you know, the technology
where we can scan and make those decisions and the automation that we have placed in our hubs, we also have in our
preloads. So, yes, we see a change in types of packages and the flow of the packages. But we certainly have the
automation, and we certainly have the technology to adjust to that.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, I guess maybe one high-level recap on that is that the goal for us is to make the
investments to get our variable costs down extremely low. And these packages drive very little capital and low
operating expense as they flow through our automated system. So we're confident that we understand the operational
changes and we're making the investments to be able to profit off of this growth for a long time.

Our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Could you give us a little bit of an
update on the rollout of the ORION system? And maybe talk at the micro level about what types of sort of productivity
impact this is having in terms of, you know, stops per an hour or any type of metric that could give us a better sense for
how impactful this rollout can be going forward?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Right. Well other than the fact that we had some of our core ORION people out in three feet of
snow trying to chart out routes, I think it's moving pretty well. Myron, what do you think?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: David, we're certainly encouraged by the results that we've seen thus far. And as we alluded to
in the last call, we've certainly added 200 resources to help us with our implementation. To-date, only approximately
20% of our drivers have been implemented. We would expect that to approach nearly 45% by year's end. But it's too
early to give you any numbers at this point, even though we're encouraged. And at the November investor's conference,
I think we will have more information to divulge to you.

Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey. Thanks. Morning, guys.
<A>: Good morning.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: So wanted to ask a little bit about the buyback and if you see some flexibility now that the
Teamsters contract is about to get approved to ramp that up. And maybe do you feel comfortable putting some broad
numbers in terms of the payment to the multi-employer plans? And then as debt comes off the balance sheet, is that an
important metric you look at or consider when you think about how much stock you do want to buy back?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Okay. Scott, I'll try to piece all that together into one question, I guess. No, our capital
distribution policy, we guided this year of repurchasing $2.7 billion in stock, you can see that we're well along the way
on that in the first quarter and the increased dividend. So the settlement of the contract is not a material impact on our
capital policies. We remain very strong on free cash flow and will distribute accordingly. We'll be sharing a lot more
information on the migration of the retiree healthcare liability off our balance sheet and are always looking for ways to
use our low cost to capital and our quality balance sheet to minimize volatility and improve returns. So this is no
different.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah, and then that information will be forthcoming soon. If the reports are accurate from last
night, we should have the information hopefully in a couple of days and share that with you.
I guess the one thing I'd add, Scott, is even though obviously net income was impacted dramatically by the weather, our
cash flow again was extraordinary in the first quarter, over $1.9 billion of free cash flow. So we'll obviously consider
that in our decisions going forward.

Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Kurt or Jim, I wanted to talk a little bit about
international margins because I know there's a lot of moving pieces this year. And you did have a good outcome in the
first quarter year-on-year but the comps get a little bit more difficult in the second and fourth quarter. So what are some
of your assumptions around margin improvement for the remainder of the year? Are you assuming sequential demand
improvement and yield improvement? Can you talk a little bit more about that?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, we have guided to profits growing 12% to 14% this year. Clearly, they're off to a good
start. So I think you'll continue to see improvements, and hopefully you got a sense that we do think that things are
moving well. So Jim, maybe you could expand a little bit on some of your guys' results and outlook.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Yeah, so Brandon, obviously the comments in the opening gave some framework to it. I
think that we should keep in mind that international, we keep talking about momentum. This is really the fifth quarter
in a row it's come up. I think we have to also keep in mind it's been a year since the TNT situation ended, let's put it
that way. And the business itself has really gotten back to the basics of what we're supposed to do. You can see that.
And so the leadership teams are in good place right now. And I think the other comment I would tell you is we've also
looked at the International business, and not only investing today, what you're seeing today, but in some of the
guidance, some of the emerging market investment, the teams, the restructuring is coming forward, so we're actually, I

We have a question from the line of Mr. Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on the International question, when you think
about this re-acceleration of volumes that we're seeing particularly in Europe, does it bring to the table any more
opportunity to start thinking a bit more about price? It seems like the underlying base rates are still pretty good. Just
getting a rough sense though of how maybe there could be some leverage there or this is more going to be a volume
opportunity as you look forward over the course of the next couple of quarters.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah, well, not all volume is created equally. And I think Jim, maybe you can maybe expand a
little bit on our focus there.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Yeah, a couple of things that are also going on. I think you have you to recognize
certainly in Europe, the supply chains are moving too, they don't remain static, so some of the big supply chains around
the world, the customers are trying to optimize their networks. We work with them to do that. So the zones move, the
distribution patterns move, so our trans-border growth in Europe, a lot of that was to support moving distribution
patterns that shorten up zones. That affects the yield of the package, but our job is to create the margins in the new
networks. So we're very comfortable with that.
I also made an opening comment that I think is important, which is our middle market acceleration we've seen in the
last couple of quarters, and we really haven't seen this in the past, is our middle market is now outpacing some of our
larger global enterprise accounts. And then the other thing that's going on, I think of material nature is the high-tech
industry and those product launches have kind of laid down. So, in the middle of all that, some of our internal
optimization investment seem to be paying dividends and they'll move forward and we'll leverage all that together. So...
<A - D. Scott Davis>: You know what was encouraging, Jim, in quarter two, is while we still saw the slower products
grow at a double-digit pace, we still saw Express grow at a 4% to 5% pace internationally, which is a good sign to see
the Express market still growing.

Our next question will come from the line of Ms. Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.
<A>: Morning.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: I wanted to ask about growth in Europe and specifically the strength that you've seen in the
pan-European business. Can you give us a sense of the contribution of this segment to international profit margins and
returns on invested capital? And do you think Europe as a whole will be able to achieve margins that are similar to the
U.S. at some point?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. As you know, we don't break down margins specifically by area of the world, but clearly,
the International business has been a great business for us and Europe is our flagship. Over half of our revenues are
European-based. So, we won't get into more detail, but we do think Europe is here to stay and that the business model,
Jim, that you're managing is in pretty good shape.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Yeah, I mean, I think that it's the underpinning, as Kurt said, I think margins, our
product will keep away from. I think it's more about the network and its capability to react to the market, the single

And we have a question from the line of Mr. Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - Kevin W. Sterling>: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A>: Good morning.
<Q - Kevin W. Sterling>: Just kind of dive and maybe taking a different look at international. You talked about the
strength we saw in the first quarter, I think it sounds like April is off to a good start. I think you also cited some
improvements in your forwarding business on a net revenue basis. And maybe you can talk about a little bit what's
going on there. Is that just kind of strength you're seeing in the overall international economy, or maybe you're getting
some market share gains there as well?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: So, as the opening comments alluded to that we – our tonnage is up, we know that. The yield is
really kind of still pressured. And when I say that, what I mean is a few quarters ago, I talked about concentration in
high tech and military and making sure that we try to diversify through that. The team is doing a good job with respect
to that. In some lanes, the markets still are tough to actually get to buy/sell just right. We're very, very happy with the
ocean product, with the brokerage product, with the North American Air Freight product. So we're just -- we're very
focused on and have some projects in the pipeline right now to kind of get at that Air Freight so we continue the
momentum there. And so we feel like we're hitting on three of the four cylinders with the fourth one being worked on
in a pretty good way right now.
<Q - Kevin W. Sterling>: Okay. Thanks for your time this morning.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: So, I think Scott had said that the international outlook was more or less unchanged,
total volume growth in the quarter up 8%, above. I think the target that you had provided for the beginning or for the
full year of 4% to 6%. I'm wondering if we should expect that rate of growth to decelerate through the year to converge
toward that target. And then also in conjunction with that, can you provide any context to how you see the growth
between non-premium and premium products trending through the year as well? Thanks.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, great. Couple of pieces there. But I think we did show very strong growth in the first
quarter, surprised us a positive, just a little bit. There's a little bit of a benefit of the Easter timing, I think, in the first
quarter. Easter was right at the break between Q1 and Q2 last year. So there may be a little extra beef in Q1 that would
put a little drag on Q2. As far as the trends on premium versus standard, I'll let Jim talk to that a little bit.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Yeah. I think, again – I think as I mentioned a minute ago, four or five quarters of
growth, and I would combine that with the acquisition comment I made in the opening, in the UKs and the Polands and
the Turkey markets, for example, there's some good solid growth in the domestic product now four or five quarters in a
row. So you start to get lapping yourself, quite frankly, from that perspective. Therefore, the end of the year looks a
little bit different than the first. But we keep talking about that in a momentum basis. So – but that kind of outlook you

Operator
And then we have a question from the line of Thomas Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Hi. I had a couple of questions just related to the Europe part. One was just, can you parse out the
organic growth related to Europe, if you are able to parse out the harvesting of the recent investments? And then I guess
one of the other sort of comments or questions is, I was wondering if you could elaborate on the mix shift change that's
happening in Europe, where your nonpremium is growing more than premium. And should we be thinking about that
mix shift change similar to the way that we've been seeing it sort of evolve over in Asia, where you've had increase in
deferred impacting the real mix in pricing? Thanks.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. Let me piece the parts of that that I can combine for you here. First off, the issue with the
organic is everything's organic right now. The acquisitions were several years ago, so there's no material acquisitions at
all. Really, the only notable acquisition is in the healthcare space, and that did not impact the results at all.
The whole issue of managing the mix changes, it makes a big difference if it's – that you're seeing trade down against
the same asset. That's been the challenge in Asia, where you've gone from express to slower modes. And if you don't
adapt, then you're stuck with lower revenue on a fixed asset. But the whole nature of the UPS network is to allow
customers to move up and down. And I'll tell you, there's a huge difference in capital employed between a package
moving from Asia to Europe in a 747 versus a package moving across Europe in our integrated ground network. So the
capital required and the returns are substantially different and so we're very happy to see robust growth through our
integrated network.
And then to Jim's point, as we grow the domestic business, what that does is it lowers the pick-up and delivery costs for
all products. So that's the benefit of the portfolio that these products reinforce themselves and we get both economy of
scale as we get bigger in each country and economy of scope as we have complementary products. So as Scott said,
Europe is very much following the lessons we've learned from the U.S. capital returns in investment and we're happy to
get standard volume there or premium.

Our next question will come from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Kurt, a quick housekeeping item. Can
you give us a sense if the new Teamster contract is incorporated into the current guidance because it's not yet finalized?
And then Jim, two quick follow ups with regard to the European network. With the stronger-than-expected growth that
we've been seeing to date, are there any sort of necessary incremental capital investments within the ground network?
And can you talk a little bit about the density within your line haul network in Europe and how that compares to U.S.
currently? Thanks.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Okay. I'll break ranks and answer two questions because the answer to the first one is one word
and that is yes. It's in our guidance. Jim, maybe you could talk about the capital expansion for Europe and whether it's
material.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Yeah. So I would say that certainly in the network today, as part of the ongoing process
and the numbers we give you every year, the capital is in there. But I would also say yes to the question. We have to
keep investing in that network. We talked about Cologne today, but our big hubs in Germany and the UK, we're
investing in Turkey hubs as we speak, so yeah, there's continued capital requirements, but again, that's all baked into

the overall network and bringing the customers in that they choose the network. So we're very, very comfortable with
that.
As far as density and line haul network question, they're really different networks, to be honest with you. The way we
run the networks European-wide versus U.S. is different, and the mix of the carriers and how we actually take those
products across the single market in the UPS or a partnership or contractors is different, so you really can't compare the
two networks, from my perspective. But again, I think the networks in Europe are performing across the business
beautifully and they'll continue to do so.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. I guess one comment on Europe. Clearly, we cycled through at the one-year anniversary
of us bidding goodbye to the attempt to purchase TNT. During the period of negotiation and work with TNT, we
clearly put some projects on hold, both strategic projects and opportunities and also capital expansion until we were
sure how we'd optimize new assets. So we certainly are in a period right now of, to some extent, facing the next five
years with an aggressive organic approach, and we are thrilled to make investments to grow our integrated ground
network in Europe.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Appreciate the time.
Operator
Okay. And we have a question from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please go ahead.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Yeah. Quick follow-up on the capital investment. Given the growth in Europe and the mix
realized, do you anticipate making adjustments to the air fleet? Or is this where you need it for now?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: No, the air fleet is in great shape. As we said, David and the airline finished purchasing 767s
last year, and David, I think, at least, as far as the foreseeable future, we don't expect any major capital additions.
Right?
<A - David P. Abney>: No. We don't have any plans to buy any aircraft in the next few years. We have, of course,
been able to increase our load factor and the biggest focus is just on improving the quality of the revenue that's in our
aircraft. And with the fact that the expedited volume has grown, it's given us a lot of flexibilities on how do we actually
protect our aircraft. Do we do something else with it or do we hold it for a day to more fully utilize the aircraft, so it's
given us a lot of flexibility.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: And this is Jim, I would add one comment to it parallel to the opening comments. The
network in Europe as an intra-European fleet is in great shape, as we've been saying. The fun part of this right now,
given where we are is through the emerging markets is to adapt and connect it globally across the world in a different
way, and the teams are working on that. And as we go forward, that would probably be likely where the adaptations
come to the network, to connect to the European network versus changing the core of it.

<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, I'll start off and then David can fill you in maybe on the status of it. You know, we've
really quoted a couple of numbers, one that we're expanding our capital investments in general broadly to expand
capacity in the U.S. and automate facilities. Those are long-term investments that stand regardless of the peak issue.
The other is we are doing some things on the technology side, on the customer alignment side and on the flexible
capacity side, and that's really driving that $100 million expense headwind this year. That's more of a onetime issue.
And David, maybe you could expand a little.
<A - David P. Abney>: Certainly will. Our peak planning committee has been focusing all this year, made solid
progress. And when it comes to capacity, we are taking two approaches. The permanent capacity will help us
throughout the years and Kurt referred to that a little bit, but the [ph] North Bay (50:55) automation refit, retrofit
project is an example that we're also increasing the capacity of CACH, our Chicago Consolidated Hub, and we're also
happening some trailer capability in Worldport, both from an unload and a load standpoint.
But then the other thing we're doing is just temporary, what we call, mobile capacity that we can move from peak to
peak from building to building, and it's adding, we're going to add nearly 10% car positions this year. It's over 6,000 car
positions, and it's in what we call mobile distribution units, and these will be addressing specific temporary needs, but
if those needs change next year, we'd just simply move that capability from year to year.

has cleared, continue very steadily. That's why we feel pretty good on the U.S. economic outlook.

We have a question from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the mix
conversation. Should we think about these mix trends as secular trends that will accelerate? Or do you expect some
kind of normalization, if only from easier comps? And just wondering if you can give us a sense of what yields might
look like after you incorporate your base rate increases? And then what's going on, on the mix side of things?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, there's a couple of big dimensions, and I'll have Alan talk a little bit about it, that some of
them are cyclical and some of them are long-term trends. Certainly, the continuing growth of B2C, both in the U.S. and
globally, is something that's here to stay. But things like weight increasing or decreasing or near-shoring versus far
shoring are things that come and go a bit.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah, just let me add just before Alan gets in here. Certainly the first quarter was exaggerated,
though, with the weather.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Right.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: It hit commercial, it hit manufacturing harder than it hit obviously e-commerce. So what you
saw in the first quarter was exaggerated.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: You know, I think, certainly the – we're going to continue to see, strong residential growth.
And I think you'll see it across all of our residential products, whether it's air, ground, or SurePost. As retailers are out

there offering a wide variety of services to their customers to meet the varying needs. Certainly, these last few quarters,
we've seen, our commercial growth turn positive on the ground, which is a good sign also. And I think that while
there's certainly been a significant amount of down-trading in the marketplace, we believe that the express, the express
market will come back as the economy gets better and global trade increases.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: And we're not uncomfortable with these trends. We still think for the last nine months of this

our technology, with our network, we can still generate good margins on B2C.

there for the first time in a couple of years. So I guess could you comment on what you think is really driving that? Is it
a better global economic picture? Do you think maybe it's inventory restocking or is it something else? And do you feel
like these trends are sustainable for 2014 and maybe beyond?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Great. I'll have Jim talk about that.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: I would say, with all of what you just mentioned plus one, and that is that our customers
don't stay static with their supply chains and they move them and they're trying to optimize their supply chains and
they're moving from small package at times to air freight and air freight to ocean, and ocean to a domestic on another
continent. So our job is to be ready for that and be one step or right in lockstep with them. So that – and I think the
other thing that you should keep in mind is that that kind of power of the UPS offering is we don't run a pure freight
network. It's a hybrid and we've got a lot of options depending on how the customers choose to come to us. So there's a
lot of factors going on and we've just got to make sure we're supportive of really the needs and the requests of our
customers.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. And I guess one of the nice things is we did see and are seeing some rebound in exports
out of Asia on the freight side. But Alan, we're also seeing quite a bit of strength south of the border, right?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah. So on the U.S.-Mexico lane there, we've launched, on the package side, a standard
ground service to and from Mexico which, on a small base right now, is experiencing very, very significant growth on a
percentage basis, so we're really excited about that. We've got our cross-border connect product on the freight side
that's also experienced some good growth. And I would just add to Jim's comment that the portfolio that we're
positioning with our customers is also, I think, allowing us to penetrate the air freight market in a bigger way and I
think you're going to see some broader gains in that area for us.
And the other last thing I would just say is Worldwide Express Freight, we haven't talked about today. That's been
launched, I guess, a little bit over a year ago now in a big way and we're experiencing very, very high growth in that
area, again, on a small base right now, but very well resonating with our customers.
<Q - Jack Atkins>: Okay. Great. Thanks for the time.

And our next question will come from the line of Ms. Helane Becker of Cowen. Please go ahead.
<Q - Helane R. Becker>: Thanks very much, operator. Thanks for the time. You might have talked about this and I
just missed it, but can you just talk about why the tax rate went up so much in the first quarter on a year-on-year basis?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, Helane. We did guide this year that we would be seeing an increase in the tax rate. We
ratcheted up in the middle of last year, from the 34.5% that we had in January of last year first quarter and it is now at
36%. So we have seen an increase and yeah, this is the last quarter at which we'll have this big of a gap, but it clearly
was an increase. It just has to do with the mix of profits around the world. Our forwarding unit that struggled last year
and some of those things impacted our marginal rate, so certainly, there's no company more eager to see U.S. tax
reform and some rebalancing of rates around the globe than us. And we continue to make that a priority and are
working with Washington to ensure that the U.S. remains competitive.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Helane, we did build the guidance in at 36%, so that was expected.
<Q - Helane R. Becker>: Right. I figured you did that, but I was just kind of wondering, it was 30.4% last year going
to 36%, I think, this year. So okay.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: The 30.4%, no, I'm sorry, Helane, that was distorted because of the nature of the TNT
settlement. Some of the payments were taxable, some weren't. The core rate for last year on the adjusted is 34.5%.
<Q - Helane R. Becker>: Gotcha. Okay. Thanks for your help.
<A>: Great.

Due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Mr. Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Thank you. And thank you for taking my question.
<A>: Sure, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Just wanted to touch base. The cash on the balance sheet's back over $7 billion. I know you
mentioned it will cost you some money to exit these remaining pension liabilities, but could you talk a little bit about
how much cash you think you need on the balance sheet? Because this is almost double what it was at the bottom of the
recession here. And just kind of longer-term thoughts on capital deployment.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. And as Scott said, we had a just a huge free cash flow quarter in Q1. Capital
expenditures were a little low. Clearly, it's hard to build buildings in the blizzards, so we'll ramp some of that up and
use some of that cash for capital improvements, Jeff. But we do – we do expect to continue strong distributions. The
company has no agenda to hoard cash. At the same time, we like to have a strong balance sheet. So we're going to
continue with our basic targets of distributing near 100% of net income in the form of dividends and share repurchases
and keep a little powder dry for M&A and other strategic initiatives.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: In Q1, Kurt, I think we distributed 140% net income. So, Jeff, it will be a balance. We'll
continue the strong distributions, we will continue to reinvest in the business.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Okay. Thank you. And congratulations.
<A>: Thank you.

Let me just – this is Scott. I'll just do a quick recap. It was – clearly the first quarter was a challenge, but, again, as we
talked about, the rest of 2014 looks quite promising. The economy, although it's still not robust, it will be better than
what we saw last year, both here in the U.S. and globally. What I'm excited about is at UPS, we're going to be hitting it
on all cylinders as all three segments of our business will show nice improvements and operating profit over the last
nine months of this year. And frankly, we've not seen all three segments improve at the same time since 2010. So look
for good things ahead from UPS, and thanks for being on the call today.
Operator
