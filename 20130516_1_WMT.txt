MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Walmart earnings call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2014. The date of this call is May 16, 2013.
This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and is intended for the use of Walmart shareholders and the
investment community. It should not be reproduced in any way. [Operator Instructions]
This call will contain statements that Walmart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe
Harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that act. Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the

Carol A. Schumacher
Hi. This is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Thanks for joining us
today for our earnings call to review the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Our press release and full transcript of this call are
available on our website, www.stock.walmart.com.
Here's today's agenda. Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will provide his thoughts about the
quarter and some of his thoughts about his recent interactions with our customers. Jeff Davis, EVP of Finance and
Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details. Then we'll go to the operating segments. Bill Simon, President
and CEO of Walmart U.S. first; then Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International; and then Roz
Brewer, President and CEO of Sam's Club, will round out that section. Charles Holley, Walmart's CFO, will discuss
our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns and he'll also provide Q2 guidance.
A quick reminder about our guidance conventions, we update our full year EPS guidance only when we release Q2
earnings, so you'll hear that information in August, not today. Today, we will provide you Q2 guidance for both EPS
and our U.S. segment comps.
Let me also remind you about our comp sales calendar. Our comp week begins on Saturday and ends on Friday. During
fiscal 2014, we will report comp store sales on a 53-week basis, with 4-5-5 reporting in Q4. Because we didn't observe
the 53-week retail calendar last year, our comp calendar for Q1 began on Saturday, January 26, and ended on Friday,
April 26, 2013. Last year also included an extra day for leap year so this year's fiscal calendar for Q1 includes one less
day.
Additional information regarding some of the terms we use at Walmart, including constant currency, gross profit and
gross profit rate, are available on our website. Please note that this year, we no longer have discontinued operations, but

we do have one new term we'd like you to make note of. Corporate and support is now what we call our corporate
areas, including core Corporate, such as financial and legal, as well's Global eCommerce and global leverage services.
Previously, we referred to this as other unallocated.
Our Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held at 7:00 a.m. Central Time on Friday, June 7, at the University of
Arkansas campus in Fayetteville. The meeting also is available via webcast through our website. Again, that's

So, now, let's get on to the results, Mike.
Michael T. Duke
Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Walmart grew first quarter diluted earnings per share 4.6% to $1.14. In a
quarter marked by considerable headwinds to top line sales, we delivered solid EPS growth.
Frankly, we had a more difficult quarter than expected when we announced our guidance in February. It's important to
note that Walmart U.S. continued to gain market share across several key categories. Sales were pressured, primarily
by delayed tax refunds, which caused customers to put off discretionary purchases. And though no one likes to talk
about weather, it was a real factor across the United States. In fact, right here in Northwest Arkansas, we had the latest
snowfall in the history of Arkansas reporting.
I'm pleased that Bill and his team managed through these headwinds to deliver almost $67 billion in sales and leverage.
This disciplined expense management allowed Walmart U.S. to deliver solid operating profit, despite the pressure on
sales. I share Bill's optimism about the remainder of the year and I believe the underlying strength of the Walmart U.S.
business will deliver positive comps next quarter.
Now let me share some additional key metrics for the quarter. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales
increased 1.8% to $114.2 billion, which excluded $1 billion from currency exchange rate fluctuations. Consolidated
operating expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively flat and we are committed to achieving leverage for the full
year. We are proud that our U.S. operating segments leveraged operating expenses. We generated $6.5 billion of
consolidated operating income, an increase of 1.1%.
As you know, I like to visit customers in their local markets around the world. I recently traveled to stores throughout
South America and the U.S. It's gratifying to see how important EDLP is for our customers. Our mission is simple and
focused, to help people save money so they can live better. When we simplify and focus our execution against this
mission, it's easy for our associates to prioritize what they have to do.
Listening to our customers ensures we deliver the merchandise they want and the experience they expect. We also
evaluate how our daily decisions support our EDLC and EDLP priorities. This is our opportunity to get even better at
being Walmart. Our customers also remind me how they are integrating technology into their shopping occasions. Our
goal is to make their shopping experience seamless and we have fantastic talent delivering a number of innovative
solutions to enhance their experience.
When I recently visited our eCommerce teams in San Bruno, California and in Sao Paulo, Brazil, I witnessed the
tremendous quality of talent in our eCommerce organization. I have no doubt that we are making the right investments
in this space to differentiate ourselves and become a better Walmart. And with eCommerce sales growing more than
30% in the first quarter versus last year, these investments are paying off.
Turning now to Sam's Club, Sam's delivered a positive comp for the first quarter. You will hear more from Roz about
our nationwide member fee increase rollout that was announced yesterday and how Sam's is also driving member value
through improved merchandise assortment and in-club of marketing.
Walmart International's constant currency sales expanded 5.4%, while, on a reported basis, net sales were up 2.9%. We
grew market share in a number of our markets, despite headwinds from difficult economic conditions across several
markets and weather. Online sales in the U.K. and Brazil were strong. Our focus remains on bringing Walmart's low

prices to customers in all of our markets and the transition to EDLP continues in key markets, like Brazil and China.
We are, however, disappointed in our expense control in International. As you know, we have put a lot of emphasis on
the importance of leveraging expenses as a company. And Doug and his team are taking actions in each country to
improve our cost management and expand on a number of productivity initiatives. I'm pleased that, overall, Walmart
International made progress on managing inventory this quarter.
Across our segments, improving new store productivity is a priority. We have a more diligent process for reviewing
grand opening performance and we're taking immediate actions to strengthen sales where they're needed. And, as we
discussed last year, we slowed the pace of store openings within selected International markets.
Our Corporate and Support cost increased this quarter, due to investments in leverage initiatives and Global
eCommerce support, as well as higher compliance-related expenses. Jeff and Charles will provide more details on the
financials behind these investments.
In the first quarter, we continued to strengthen our compliance programs around the world. We're working closely with
third-party anti-corruption compliance experts to review and to assess the programs in our International markets and to
partner with us on anti-corruption support and training. Beyond anti-corruption, our comprehensive global compliance
review continues in all of our markets to evaluate and reinforce our procedures and our programs applicable to 14
compliance areas, including license and permits, food safety and ethical sourcing, among others.
Walmart continues to make strides on the issues that matter to our customers. I was honored to stand with First Lady
Michelle Obama recently to pledge of Walmart's support of the Joining Forces initiative to benefit our U.S. military
veterans and their families. On Memorial Day, we will begin a program to hire recent, honorably-discharged U.S.
veterans. We're proud of this initiative and appreciate the partnership of other large companies that are joining us in
providing employment opportunities to these worthy Americans.
As I close my remarks, I'd like to reiterate that I'm confident about our long-term strategy and the direction that
Walmart is headed. We didn't have the first quarter performance we wanted as a company, due partly to various
external factors and also the comparison to last year's great first quarter. You'll hear the specifics about why we feel
better about our U.S. businesses' performance for the second quarter. This, coupled with more discipline in
International and our investments in strategic initiatives, will allow us to improve our performance throughout the year.
Our commitment to Walmart's mission to save people money so that they can live better benefits our customers and our
shareholders alike.
Now, I'll turn it over to Jeff for more financial details. Jeff?
Jeff Davis
Thank you, Mike. As you just heard, Walmart reported first quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.14 versus $1.09
last year. Recall last year end, we stated the company's continued investment in eCommerce initiatives would
negatively impact our fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share by an incremental $0.09. Consequently, our first quarter
results were unfavorably impacted by these initiatives by approximately $0.02.
Consolidated net sales increased 1% to $113.4 billion. I would like to remind you that the first quarter of last year
included an extra day, due to leap year, and added approximately 100 basis points to net sales. Separately, first quarter
net sales included $200 million from an acquisition and were also impacted by more than $1 billion of currency
exchange rate fluctuations. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales would have increased 1.8%
to $114.2 billion.
With respect to comp sales for the quarter, total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, decreased 1.2%. Bill and Roz will
provide more details in a minute. Membership and other income increased 1.6% compared to the first quarter last year.
Please stay tuned to hear more from Roz regarding our recent advancements in club membership.

Total revenue for the first quarter was $114.2 billion, a 1% increase over last year. This is on top of a strong 8.5%
increase at this time last year.
Gross profit increased 1.2%, primarily driven by supply chain productivity and merchandise mix within our U.S.
business segments. The gross profit rate was relatively flat to last year.
Now turning to expenses, our operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 19.1%, which is relatively flat to last
year. As you heard from Mike, our U.S. businesses leveraged operating expenses for the quarter. And you will hear
more from Doug on the International team's focus to reduce expenses for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Now, let's take a closer look at Corporate and Support expenses. Corporate and Support is comprised of core corporate,
Global eCommerce support, and global leverage services. Total Corporate and Support expenses increased
approximately $200 million, or 44.4%. Our core corporate expenses increased 37.2%, including $73 million in
expenses related to FCPA matters, which was above our forecasted range of $40 million to $45 million. Approximately
$44 million of the expenses represent costs incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, while $29 million
covers costs regarding the global compliance review, program enhancements and organizational changes. Excluding
the FCPA matters, core corporate increased by approximately 14.6%.
The remainder of the Corporate and Support growth is primarily associated with global leverage services. This increase
is the result of investments to enhance enterprise information management, build global capabilities and leverage scale.
Though we will continue to invest in these areas, we expect these expenses to moderate for the remainder of the fiscal
year.
This leads us to consolidated operating income, which grew 1.1% to $6.5 billion, slightly ahead of sales growth. Net
interest expense for the quarter decreased 0.9% to $530 million, as we continue to avail ourselves of low interest rate
funding. And consolidated net income attributable to Walmart increased 1.1% to $3.8 billion.
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was 33.4%, essentially unchanged from the first quarter of last
year. Full year guidance for fiscal 2014 effective tax rate continues to be between 32% and 33%. As a reminder, our tax
rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
Now turning to our balance sheet, consolidated inventory increased 4.5%, primarily driven by our U.S. operations.
You'll hear more from the segment CEOs regarding the individual drivers of inventory growth.
Payables as a percentage of inventory was 85.2%, which compares to 89.8% last year. This decrease was primarily the
result of increased levels of inventory within our U.S. segments and the timing of disbursements.
Our debt to total capitalization was 44.8% at the end of the quarter compared to 44.2% last year. During the quarter, we
generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow versus $3.1 billion last year. An increase in income tax payments, due primarily
to changes in Federal bonus depreciation rules and an increase in capital expenditures contributed to the free cash flow
decline.
Moving on to returns, for the quarter, the company returned $1.6 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased
approximately 30 million shares at a cost of $2.2 billion. As of April 30, we have approximately $1.5 billion remaining
under our current $15 billion authorization.
To wrap up, return on investment, or ROI, for the trailing 12 months ended April 30, 2013 was 17.8% compared to
18.1% last year. This reduction was primarily the result of acquisitions and an increase in fixed assets within our base
business.
Now, let's turn it over to the operating segments. We'll start with Walmart U.S. Bill?

Thank you, Jeff. When we last spoke to you in February, we shared that the first quarter had gotten off to a very slow
start, essentially due to the delay in income tax refund checks. When we provided flat comp guidance for the first
quarter, we had expected, among other things, to recover a reasonable portion of these tax refunds and had also
assumed that customers would follow historical spending patterns with these funds. This did not materialize as we had
anticipated.
Similar to what you've heard from companies in various industries that have reported earnings, top line revenue was
challenged by a number of issues. These included a $9 billion reduction in IRS estimated tax refunds versus last year
and we cashed less in income tax refunds than the prior year. Additionally, the 2% increase in payroll taxes, reduced
inflation and some of the most unfavorable spring weather we've seen in recent years across much of the country
impacted our business.
While we don't generally like talking about weather, it certainly had an impact. Weather sensitive departments like
outdoor living, sporting goods, air movement and apparel were challenged, particularly for mid-March to mid-April,
when weather was much less favorable than last year. However, there were bright spots. Where weather was fairly
normal, in Florida for example, we had positive comps for the quarter.
In addition, as we gave guidance last quarter, we expected an increase in the level of grocery inflation, but it did not
materialize in a meaningful way. We experienced very modest inflation, much lower than last year, and, in fact, we had
some deflation in areas like dry grocery.
We estimate that the factors discussed earlier affected our comp sales by as much as 200 basis points in the first quarter
versus our expectations. Primarily driven by these factors, we ended the quarter with a lower comp than expected at a
negative 1.4% compared to a strong positive 2.6% comp last year. Traffic was down 1.8% while ticket was up 0.4%.
However, excluding the first two weeks of the quarter, comp sales were relatively flat and traffic improved.
Despite sales being lower than expected, I'm really proud of the work done by all of our associates during the quarter.
The team did an excellent job managing the business, taking care of our customers and bringing in a solid profit result,
with an operating income increasing 5.9%.
We also continued to gain market share across several categories. According to the Nielsen Company, we gained 20
basis points of market share in the measured category of food, consumables, and health & wellness/OTC during the 13
weeks ending April 27, 2013.
As of now, we're encouraged by the start of sales in the second quarter, because we've seen more normalized weather
and we're getting past the main effects of the reduced tax refunds.
Now, let's cover the financial details of the first quarter. Net sales were up $220 million, or 0.3%, to $66.6 billion. Last
year's leap day added approximately 100 basis points of net sales to first quarter fiscal 2013. Gross profit increased
0.7% to $18.2 billion, with gross profit rate increasing 10 basis points from the previous year, partly driven by supply
chain productivity and cost of goods savings initiatives.
We continue to leverage these initiatives, targeting specific areas of our grocery business, providing savings to our
customers in the first quarter. These actions, along with our ability to leverage expenses, enabled us to further
strengthen our position as the price leader in the market.
Our commitment to the productivity loop is a long-term, sustainable strategy. We will continue to be strategic about
price investments, monitoring competitor price gaps, market share and other data to ensure we maintain an appropriate
balance between price investments and margin.
Our strategy is based on an everyday low cost structure. For the quarter, the team did a good job managing expenses,
contributing 32 basis points of expense leverage. Although a large part of the leverage was driven by a decline in
incentive expense versus historically high levels last year, every part of the organization was focused on operating for
less, from our distribution centers and transportation fleet to each one of our stores. Together, we reduced expenses by
1.3% versus last year, driving a 5.9% increase in operating income.

For the quarter, inventory was up 4.6%, driven partly by an expanded assortment in some merchandise areas, in
addition to challenging weather, which created headwinds for some seasonal categories. We feel good about our current
inventory position, as the weather improves and customers get ready for summer.
Before I discuss the performance of our merchandising areas, I'd like to spend some time covering a few things we're
doing from an operational perspective that helped drive our quarterly performance. Our logistics team continues to be a
key contributor to our results by generating savings that benefit our leverage goals and gross margin. In the first
quarter, the team continued to improve processes within our supply chain. This enabled us to transport 3.1% additional
cases per mile driven, helping us to reduce the overall cost per cases shipped versus last year. Our result in logistics,
quarter after quarter, are proof that our strategy is sustainable.
Within our stores, we continued to fine-tune our technology investments, including self-service checkouts and work
assignment tools, like MyGuide. These initiatives drove another quarter of solid gains in productivity, as our
management teams work towards continuous improvement.
We continued to expand our self-service checkouts in the first quarter, with about 38% more stores in service versus
last year. In general, customer response has been positive, with utilization across the chain up over 300 basis points
year-over-year. In the back rooms, projects like MyGuide and OneTouch also enabled improvements in stocker
productivity by helping to facilitate the process of moving merchandise from the truck to the shelf and prioritizing work
for our associates. In the first quarter, these initiatives contributed to an increase of over 3% in cases handled per work
hour.
We're focused on driving productivity by implementing initiatives that make work simpler for our associates and
enhance our customer experience. As you might expect from Walmart, there are a number of metrics we monitor to
ensure strong operational execution, including customer line lengths, customer experience scores and merchandise
in-stock levels. While we always strive to improve, we're pleased overall with our current performance against these
metrics.
Now, let's review the performance of the various merchandising areas. Grocery, which includes food and consumables,
generated a low single-digit positive comp on relatively flat inflation, a much lower inflation rate than last year. In
food, we've made great progress in the quality of our fresh departments and I'm particularly excited about the
momentum in the produce area. We've improved our process for handling and culling produce, allowing us to get the
freshest assortment in front of our customers. In the first quarter, we started to see the positive results, evidenced by
mid-single-digit positive comps in produce and market share gains for the 13 weeks ended on March 30, according to
Nielsen.
In consumables, we also continued to gain market share across most departments and are particularly encouraged to see
customers respond to our price investment strategy, evidenced by the Nielsen data that shows noticeably higher market
share gains in areas where we invested in price in the first quarter. Overall, our performance in consumables was
mostly driven by the every day need categories.
Health & wellness generated a low single-digit negative comp. While units were up, we experienced the largest
brand-to-generic impact to-date, coupled with an overall increase in generic versus brand sales. While our Rx business
was pressured by the brand-to-generic impact, we continue to see strength in OTC, with solid comp sales and market
share gains, according to Nielsen. Also noteworthy is our performance in the core, non-seasonal categories like
vitamins, analgesics and antacids, which delivered a mid-single-digit positive comp for the quarter.
Hardlines, which includes our seasonal business, posted a low single-digit negative comp. Weather significantly
impacted sporting goods categories, like fishing and camping, in the first quarter, with non-weather impacted categories
like stationery and crafts delivering positive comps. Stationery and crafts was driven by strong growth in needlecraft,
paints and other indoor categories. Our new assortment is resonating with the customer, evidenced by our gains in
market share across several of our stationery categories for the three-month period ending April 6, according to the
NPD Group.

Comps in our seasonal business were also positive, driven by solid growth in Valentine's Day and Easter, with strong
results in gifts, décor and party ware. We continue to be a destination for the holidays, providing our customers with
one-stop-shop solutions to stock up for the big events of the year.
Entertainment, including toys, had mid-single-digit negative comp. Softer discretionary spending impacted
entertainment and created even more significant headwinds for higher ticket electronics like TVs. On the other hand,
our wireless business again delivered a double-digit positive comp, with Straight Talk sales hitting a record high in the
first quarter.
Let me remind you how we're reporting sales of wireless. Reporting convention calls for sales of Straight Talk and
third-party gift cards, such as iTunes and restaurant cards, to be included in sales, net of the product cost. In other
words, we only account for a commission on sales. We continue to make great strides for our customers in the wireless
space, providing a broad selection of affordable solutions. According to NDP, Walmart became the number one retailer
in handset unit share for the three months ended March 31, 2013.
In toys, similar to the rest of the business, we experienced softness in outdoor categories like spring toys and bicycles,
which was partly offset by strength in educational and preschool toys.
Apparel reported a low single-digit negative comp for the quarter, mostly driven by soft demand for spring categories.
I'm pleased with the work of the team in apparel and particularly encouraged by the performance of our basics offering,
which delivered a low single-digit positive comp. Kids' and accessories were also positive in the first quarter,
benefiting from assortment improvements. We've made great progress in this area and will continue to focus on quality
throughout the year to drive results.
In home, pronounced softness in outdoor living impacted the performance, driving the business to a mid-single-digit
negative comp. Our results were significantly better in areas of the country less impacted by weather. In the Pacific
division, for instance, outdoor living delivered a high single-digit positive comp in the first quarter.
In indoor living categories, we continued to work on assortment, making national brands like Rachel Ray affordable for
our customers and delivering a low single-digit positive comp in cooking and dining. Our customers are shopping our
home aisles, evidenced by our gains in market share across the business, according to NPD.
Other areas of the business where we're gaining momentum are walmart.com and mobile. We continue to drive
integration with our stores to deliver a seamless customer experience. In the first quarter, we continued to test the
mobile self-checkout option Scan & Go, expanding it across more than 200 stores in 14 different regions. We're
encouraged by the early results, with the majority of Scan & Go customers using the feature multiple times. The team is
constantly making improvements and will soon be testing digital coupons and gift cards with Scan & Go.
We also announced we'll be testing self-service lockers in select stores this summer. The goal of the program is to
reduce the wait time for Site to Store orders, providing customers with an anywhere, anytime pickup solution.
We're also very excited about the opportunity to grow the Ship from Store program. You've heard us talk about the
power of our physical footprint and how we plan to utilize our presence across the country as an additional asset in our
fulfillment network. We're pleased with the initial results and are currently shipping certain orders from 35 stores
straight to customers' homes. We expanded the pilot considerably in the first quarter and will continue to expand
strategically throughout the rest of the year.
Our eCommerce strategy complements a growing real estate portfolio. We're in a unique position to serve our
customers whenever and wherever they want to shop, integrating our walmart.com capabilities with an expanding
presence of supercenters and small formats. In the first quarter, we added 38 new units and converted eight units to
supercenters through relocation or expansion. These 46 units added 3.6 million incremental square feet and included
one discount store, 24 supercenters and 21 small formats, most of which were Neighborhood Markets.
Neighborhood Markets continued their positive performance, delivering a low single-digit positive comp, primarily
driven by solid traffic gains. The vast majority of Neighborhood Markets include pharmacies, providing an additional

experience is resonating with the customer, evidenced by our positive comps across most of the merchandising areas.
Walmart Express also continues to generate strong results, delivering another quarter of double-digit positive comps. In
the second quarter, we'll begin testing various supply chain initiatives as part of the North Carolina density test, which
will strengthen our understanding of supply chain strategies for smaller stores.
During the second quarter, we're planning to open between 60 and 65 new units, including new stores, expansions and
relocations. Our second quarter forecast represents about 4 million square feet of retail space, which will put us well on
our way to deliver our previous guidance of 15 million to 17 million square feet of retail growth in fiscal year 2014.
This year started with many challenges for our core customer. Nevertheless, I'm confident in our position and in the
ability of our teams to execute. We believe that our strategy works under any economic environment and our
underlying business remains strong.
From an operational perspective, we will continue fueling the productivity loop, improving every aspect of our
operation, so we can leverage expenses, invest in price and drive results. Our price investments will be supported by a
solid marketing program that will communicate our strong price leadership. Throughout the rest of the year, we'll
continue expanding our local basket challenge campaign through TV and radio, covering 70% of our markets across the
country.
Most important, we'll continue to run our business with our customers, our associates and our communities in mind.
Earlier this year, we announced our veterans' initiative, with the objective of hiring any honorably discharged veteran
seeking employment within his or her first 12 months off active duty. On Memorial Day, we'll be ready to launch the
program, and we believe the vast majority of applicants will be placed within 30 days.
May is off to a good start, with positive comps. We continue to feel good about the underlying business, as evidenced
by first quarter results in areas less impacted by weather, as well as by our market share gains. We'll continue to
monitor the impact of the 2% payroll tax increase, along with other factors like fuel prices. Based on these factors, we
forecast comp sales to be increased in the range of flat to positive 2% for the 13-week period from April 27 through
July 26, 2013.
Now, I'll turn it over to Doug for an International update. Doug?
Doug McMillon
Thank you, Bill. I'd like to start the update on International by reminding you of our priorities: balancing growth and
returns. As you know, Walmart International is an important contributor to top line growth. During the first quarter, we
delivered a respectable top line. We feel good about the net and comp sales, especially given last year's really strong
first quarter, the loss of leap day and weather issues. As a reminder, our first quarter last year was our strongest of FY
2013 with International net sales on a reported basis up 15% and operating income up 21.2%.
During this year's first quarter, on a reported basis, Walmart International grew net sales 2.9% to $33 billion. On a
constant currency basis, Walmart International's first quarter sales were $33.8 billion, up 5.4%. A stronger dollar
against key currencies impacted International results more negatively than expected and decreased the top line by $1
billion. Our acquisition increased sales by $200 million.
Our stores in the U.K., Africa, Mexico, Central America, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, China and India delivered positive
comp store sales. Comp sales declined in Canada and Japan. As mentioned, last year had an extra leap day for leap year
and the comparison to last year impacted sales and customer traffic by about 100 basis points.
From a relative performance point of view, we were encouraged with our market share gains around the world during
the quarter. We grew our share in Canada, Africa, Chile, Argentina, Central America, China and Japan. We maintained
market share in the U.K. and Mexico. And although we did not grow overall share in Brazil, we did increase share in
food and consumables.

Like revenue growth, another important priority is improving our returns. We were disappointed with our operating
income performance this quarter, which impacted returns. In fact, we had a decline in profitability versus last year. This
was partially due to having one less day of sales in all markets, as well as specific drivers that I'll elaborate on as I
review the markets.
Operating income was $1.3 billion and decreased 4.7% on a reported basis versus last year. On a constant currency
basis, operating income declined 2.4%. Our gross profit rate was slightly down and operating expenses grew faster than
sales. Several factors contributed to us not leveraging expenses: softer sales; wage inflation; higher indirect taxes; and
strategic investments, including those in eCommerce. These are investments beyond those covered in the Corporate and
Support budget.
Unfortunately, in the International markets, we have less workforce flexibility than in the U.S. In many markets, it
takes more time to introduce and implement productivity improvements that help us to adjust wages to sales realities.
Given our current headwinds, I expect second quarter expenses to remain under pressure. Let me assure you that all
management teams are focused on reducing expenses throughout our operating segment and we expect to demonstrate
improvement in the second half of the year.
Another priority has been inventory management. I'm pleased to say we've seen some improvement in this quarter that
was aided by Easter being one week earlier for the markets that celebrate the holiday. Constant currency inventory
increased 7.1% over last year, an improvement from the first quarter last year. On a reported basis, inventory was up
only 3.6%.
Now let's get into the results for our larger markets. The following discussion is on a constant currency basis and,
unless otherwise stated, total sales and comp sales are presented on an unadjusted nominal calendar basis.
Let's begin with EMEA. The U.K. had a solid first quarter in a challenging market. Personal income grew much slower
than the cost of essential items, putting pressure on all consumers. According to Kantar Worldpanel, the market
experienced stronger growth in the first quarter than in previous quarters, driven solely by inflation, while market
volumes declined. The U.K. market as a whole experienced significant supply integrity issues within the quarter related
to meat. Asda responded by carrying out robust and rigorous testing and continues to focus on transparency for
customers.
In the first quarter, Asda's net sales rose 2.6% and sales, excluding fuel, increased 3%. Comparable sales rose by 1.3%,
excluding fuel, growing ahead of the market. Average comp ticket increased by 1.6%, while comp traffic decreased by
0.3%. Asda's market share was flat at 17.9% for the 12 weeks ended March 17, the latest data reported by Kantar's
Worldwide Panel Total Till Roll.
A bright spot continues to be Asda's online grocery sales, which grew more than 16%. During the quarter, Asda
increased investment in reducing the price of key food essentials. As a result, Asda's internal inflation measures
continued to be significantly below the market and comparable food volumes were positive in the first quarter.
Reinforcing this strategy, Asda also won the Grocer 33 Lowest Priced Supermarket for 12 of the 13 weeks in Q1.
Strong price and value gaps, combined with events such as Valentine's Day, Easter and Mum's Day, drove food sales
growth with Easter categories, such as lamb, salmon and bakery significantly outperforming. A January clearance event
and seasonably appropriate weather drove strong general merchandise sales. Asda's gross profit margin declined
slightly in the quarter, driven by sales mix and price investment.
Considering the impact of fuel sales, operating expenses grew slower than sales. The We Operate for Less program
continued to deliver savings, offsetting some of the cost headwinds across energy, property taxes, insurance and
environmental tariffs, along with some weather-related costs. Operating income decreased by 0.8% from the prior year.
Moving to Canada, Walmart Canada faced a challenging quarter, as consumer spending weakened due to higher
household debt levels. Our results were impacted by the unseasonably colder weather this year versus the unseasonably
warm weather last year and the leap year overlap. Net sales grew 6.1%, but Canada had a decline in operating income
and did not leverage expenses. Comparable sales decreased 1.3%, with comp ticket up 0.7% and comp traffic declining

2%.
We had strong comp sales in food, consumables and homeliness, but continue to see softer sales in entertainment. The
colder weather also impacted sales in hardlines and apparel. However, in the first quarter's challenging environment,
we drove market share gains of 120 basis points in The Nielsen Company measured categories of food, consumables
and health & wellness.
Regarding profitability, gross profit rate increased due to improved initial margins from private label and direct import
gains, as well as reduced shrink. However, operating expenses grew faster than sales, primarily due to negative comp
store sales, the lapping of costs related to the year-over-year growth in new store base and investments in eCommerce.
Moving to Sub-Saharan Africa, as you know, Massmart is a publicly-held company in South Africa and only
announces results every six months. For the 14 weeks ending March 31, Massmart increased sales by 10.3% and
comparable sales by 6%. While these are good numbers, the trends are slower than we reported for Massmart at the
close of fiscal 2013. The South African consumer environment remains cautious and sales growth is forecasted to be
under pressure for the remainder of the year. Also note that Massmart will hold its annual meeting on May 22.
Now to Latin America: the following summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America and is
on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reports its earnings under IFRS, so some numbers are different than
Walmex-reported numbers.
Walmex results for the first quarter were mixed. We had solid results in Central America and disappointing
performance in Mexico that impacted the overall business. For the quarter, net sales grew 5.5%. Gross margin
increased 60 basis points versus last year, driven by improvements in both Mexico and Central America. Operating
expenses grew more than sales. Management is focused on reducing expenses and increasing productivity savings.
Operating income for the quarter grew 7.5%, faster than sales, primarily due to strong gross profit margins.
For the first quarter, Mexico's sales increased 5.6% over last year and comparable store sales grew 1.1%. Average
comp ticket in Mexico increased 4.4% and comp traffic decreased 3.3% over last year. Traffic was negative due to
calendar effects and a general market slowdown in consumption. In relation to the market, we maintained market share
on total sales, but Mexico's first quarter comp store sales for the self-service formats grew 0.8%. This was slower than
ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, at 1.4%.
In Mexico, gross margin was up 48 basis points. Expenses grew 8.8%, above our sales growth. The biggest increases in
expenses were in physical infrastructure investments, like maintenance, repairs and depreciation. Operating income
grew 5.5%.
Central America is on track to deliver good results. Systems integration will conclude as expected in the second quarter
and markets that were lagging, like Guatemala, are improving. Central America increased net sales from the previous
year by 4.9%. Comparable store sales increased 2% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin increased 124 basis
points versus last year, as a result of better merchandising and EDLP execution. The transition to EDLP in our Central
American countries is completed. Expenses grew more than sales. Operating income increased 40%.
Moving on to Brazil, Brazil grew sales in the first quarter and had a slight operating profit. We continue our mantra of
EDLC and EDLP, maintaining a 7% price gap in self-service formats and we're pleased that we're gaining traction with
customers. First quarter retail sales in Brazil grew 5.5% from last year, with comparable sales growing 3.7%. Ticket
grew 7.2% and comp traffic declined 3.5% when compared to last year. There was strong performance in consumables,
food and perishables, as we gained market share in these categories.
Sales of general merchandise were weak, as we scaled down interest free credit offerings. Gross profit rate increased
slightly, as a result of lower shrink and better markdown management, but we did not leverage operating expenses in
Brazil due to our lower rate of comp store growth, specifically in our wholesale formats, and wage inflation.
Like Walmex and Massmart, Walmart Chile is also a publicly held company and will release first quarter earnings on
May 30.

Moving to Asia, Walmart China grew sales and operating income during the first quarter. Net sales for the first quarter
grew 5.4% over last year, despite a weaker than expected Chinese New Year. Comparable store sales growth was 1%.
As more Chinese families own a car and other amenities for their home, there is much greater trip consolidation. Comp
ticket grew 8.9% in China, but traffic declined 7.9%. Traffic declines are consistent with the overall market.
First quarter gross profit rate was slightly down from last year, due to our investment in price; however, Walmart China
leveraged operating expenses, even with wage inflation. In China, we are near the end of our planning stage of our
EDLP transition and have started to take a few steps. As in other markets, this is a multi-year effort and we know it'll
take time for our customers to see and appreciate the value brought to them by EDLP.
On to Japan, where the economy continues to slow, Walmart Japan's net sales and comp sales decreased 1.7% and
2.3% respectively, reflecting cautious consumer behavior. First quarter comp traffic decreased 1.9% and ticket
decreased 0.4%. Traffic decreased due to an increase in competition in the convenience-related formats. According to
statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry, or METI, overall supermarket
comparable sales for the first quarter declined by 3.3% from last year. So on a positive note, we outperformed the
market.
Walmart Japan's gross profit rate decreased by 96 basis points, due to our increased investment in lower prices.
Walmart Japan missed leveraging expenses by a slight margin, due to the sales decline, but year-over-year operating
expenses were down, even with higher remodeling costs. Accordingly, Walmart Japan had a slight operating loss this
quarter compared to positive operating income in the prior year.
Turning to the opportunities in eCommerce, we are excited about the global capabilities we are strengthening and
expanding in the key markets of the U.K., Brazil and China.
Asda's continued focus on offering a convenient shopping experience for customers drove strong online sales in the
first part of 2013. During Q1, Asda completed the rollout of Wi-Fi across our stores to enable a better smart device
shopping experience. In addition, our Asda team added its grocery Click and Collect offer in approximately 100 stores.
Asda also significantly expanded grocery home shopping capacity by opening a third dedicated online fulfillment
center in Nottingham, providing increased accuracy, efficiency and delivery options. Customers can now tap into
20,000 additional delivery slots per week.
Over the last six months, in Brazil, our walmart.com.br site has become the largest traffic eCommerce site. For the first
quarter, online sales in Brazil increased over 40%.
In the previous year acquisition of Yihaodian, one of the fastest-growing eCommerce businesses in China, we now
have a platform to compete in a market with broadband penetration that has exceeded the U.S. Yihaodian provides
consumer goods on a same-day basis in Tier-1 cities, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou.
We grew market share already this year in eCommerce in the U.K., Brazil and China and the integration of technology
into our business is a key for future growth. We will expand our successes and learnings from the U.K., Brazil and
China into other markets, such as Mexico, Japan and Canada.
We are also focused on building a world-class compliance program across the globe. Our comprehensive program
spans 14 different compliance dimensions that address areas from ethical sourcing to licenses and permits. We are
strengthening what already existed in each market, adding subject matter expertise, significant investments in talent,
process, systems and training. For example, we recently announced a $16.2 million, three-year investment in food
safety in China. We are reinforcing Walmart culture, based on our basic beliefs of respect for the individual, strive for
excellence, service to the customer and, as always, on a foundation of integrity. With our compliance program, we will
operate more effectively in each market and we are building a solid foundation for future growth.
In closing, it's been a tough start to the beginning of the year, but we're focused in each of our markets and have tighter
discipline in our execution. As Mike said earlier, we are simplifying, we are focused and we're prioritizing. With our
current outlook, we do not expect to leverage expenses in the second quarter, but we've begun to take actions that will
demonstrate improvement as we progress through the year.

For example, we're working hard to accelerate the improvements that we will receive from working with our Global
Business Process group. With that, we remain focused on the core tenets of our operating model and being the best
Walmart we can be. Our global consumer is challenged with their household budgets and we need to continue to
provide them with the price and value they need.
Now, I'll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz?
Rosalind G. Brewer
Thanks, Doug. This year, Sam's Club celebrates our 30-year anniversary. It's been an exciting journey ever since our
first club opened in Midwest City, Oklahoma in 1983. I'd like to take a moment to thank all of our associates over the
past 30 years who've delivered tremendous value to our members and made our business so successful.
During the first quarter, we grew net sales and comp sales were within guidance. We grew membership income by
delivering superior value, responding to business member trends and enhancing our membership offering. Combined
with reduced operating expenses, we generated operating profits more than 7% ahead of last year. Comp sales, without
fuel, were up 0.2% for the 13-week period, lapping a 5.3% comp sales increase last year. Comp traffic was up 1.3%,
driven by our Advantage members and ticket was down 1.1%, driven by Business members.
Unfavorable weather this year created a headwind in our weather-sensitive categories. In geographies with more
moderate weather, such as the West, members responded positively to our seasonal merchandise, indicating sales in
these categories improve as the weather changes. Additionally, inflation continued to moderate from Q4, impacting our
top line results, as inflation this quarter was approximately 50 basis points. Inflation ran between 250 and 300 basis
points in the first quarter last year.
Our Business member is an integral part of our business, and comp sales and traffic patterns continued to indicate that
they remain pressured. Small business optimism remains at historically low levels, as businesses adapt to higher payroll
taxes and cautious consumers. In response, we're focused on increasing awareness of the value Sam's Club offers.
We're executing regional business expos and small business appreciation programs in May and June, in which our
associates spend time working with members in their place of business.
Despite these headwinds I mentioned in the first quarter, we drove sales and profit growth. Net sales, including fuel,
were $13.9 billion, up 0.1%. Fuel created a 40 basis point headwind to sales growth, as fuel prices were down 3.8%
compared to last year. Gallons sold were up 1.3%. Gross profit rate was up seven basis points. Operating expenses as a
percentage of net sales improved slightly. Operating income increased 7.4% to $525 million.
Fuel is an important component of our strategy to provide more value to our members. Volatility in fuel prices,
however, can notably impact our financial results. The remainder of our discussion, therefore, will be focused on the
core business and exclude fuel for comparative purposes.
Net sales for the quarter were $12.2 billion, up 0.5% from last year. During the first quarter last year, we gained one
additional day due to leap year, resulting in one less day this year. The addition of leap day last year provided a benefit
of about 100 basis points. Our strongest divisional performance was in the West, with our strongest regional
performance in the Mountain, Mid-Atlantic and Southwest regions.
Now, let's move on to merchandising highlights for the quarter. Fresh comp sales were up low single-digits, with
strength in dairy and produce. Members responded positively to our new pack-size innovation in certain frozen food
items. These items contain smaller bags within the main pack, increasing convenience for our members.
Grocery and beverage sales grew low single-digits, driven by growth in dry grocery, partially offset by declines in our
beverage business, due to both weather and Business member softness.
Sales of consumables posted a low single-digit comp. With the support of our strategic price investments, we delivered
low to mid-single-digit unit growth in areas like paper and tabletop. Our baby category continues to be a strong source
of growth, with market share, according to Nielsen, growing by 20 basis points for the 13-week period ending April 27,

2013.
Technology and entertainment posted a negative low single-digit comp. Pressures in office electronics and media were
partially offset by compelling value in wireless, which posted double-digit comp and unit growth. According to The
NPD Group, we gained market share in TVs for the 13-week period ending April 27, 2013.
Sales in apparel and home were down low single-digits. Home saw modest gains, driven by domestics and mattresses.
Apparel was down due to seasonal merchandise, but our core basic apparel business posted mid-single-digit comps,
indicating strength in our underlying business. Jewelry, where we have strengthened our assortment and our price
points, gained momentum throughout the quarter. Members responded very well to our improved selection of high
quality diamonds.
Health & wellness, including pharmacy, experienced low single-digit comps. Over-the-counter merchandise continues
to grow, especially diet products. We filled more prescriptions, but sales declined as the industry shifts more to
generics. The majority of our prescription business remains maintenance-related, generating regular traffic to our health
& wellness area. We continue to increase awareness of the services available at Sam's Club, such as pharmacist
provided immunizations and health screening programs. During the quarter, we increased the number of health
screenings by almost 30% over the same period last year.
Sales of ancillary categories negatively affected the quarter, due to decline in tobacco sales, driven by softness from our
convenience store members as they see increased competition from dollar stores.
Moving to online, innovation and collaboration with our Global eCommerce team resulted in double-digit sales growth
for the quarter, driven by categories like portable electronics, baby and mattresses. These categories were not only
strong online, but also in our clubs, demonstrating that our members are finding great values no matter what channel
they shop.
Gross profit rate remained relatively flat, as continued strategic price investments were offset by a more favorable mix,
due to softer sales in lower margin categories, like tobacco and beverages.
Strong membership growth is critical to remaining a healthy club business and we're focused on innovative ways to
reach new prospects. We collaborated with Living Social from March 4 through the 6th to reach new Sam's Club
members. The offer included a base membership, $20 gift card, and a merchandise package that included a variety of
take-home meal solutions, all for $45, a total value of roughly $80. In just 48 hours, we had more than 157,000 people
sign up for this offer and we were pleased with the significant social media buzz and deal share volume generated.
Net membership income grew 2.4%, driven by Advantage member growth, offsetting slight declines from Business
members. Membership and other income was up 6.5% versus last year, because of improved contract terms relating to
our profit sharing arrangement with our credit card provider. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased by
12 basis points. A driver of this leverage was a decline in incentive expenses versus last year.
Looking at the bottom line, first quarter operating income was $519 million, a 6.6% increase over last year. Inventory,
including fuel, was up 6% year-over-year, as softer sales significantly affected our sell-through rate across several
areas. Our management team is focused on actively slowing the rate of inventory growth to better align with the rate of
sales.
We continue to focus on creating member value by executing our real estate strategy, enhancing the membership
offering, improving item merchandising and offering members access anytime, anywhere.
We are pleased with the performance of clubs opened within the last two to three years. During the quarter, we
relocated one club in Texas City, which outperformed expectations. We plan to open 15 to 20 new and relocated clubs
during the year, the majority of which we've scheduled for the third and fourth quarter.
Now, I'd like to provide more details on our overall membership strategy. We applied key learnings from the last month
of our membership pilot in Texas to enhance the value of a Sam's Club membership. The Texas pilot represents 12% of
our total U.S. club base.

As of yesterday, we increased our membership fee nationwide. The membership fee is now $45 for both Advantage and
Business base memberships, reflecting a $5 and $10 increase, respectively. The fee for our Plus membership remains
$100. This is our first increase since January 2006 and we do not expect a significant impact to renewal rates or new
sign-ups. We will continue to offer additional value to our members, while driving strong membership income in the
coming years, as the full benefit of the fee increase will be recognized over the next 24 months.
Our first Instant Savings book, which is available to all members from May 15 through June 9, includes over $3,500 in
savings on nearly 100 items, both in-club and through samsclub.com. Additionally, Plus members will continue to
receive exclusive offers automatically loaded onto their membership card, which will now include fresh and private
label items. With the exception of the cash rewards program for Plus members, these changes are consistent with our
Texas pilot. Initial response to cash rewards has been positive. We will continue testing this benefit in Texas
throughout the year to gain a better understanding of the longer-term financial impact.
You're also going to see a change in our merchandise strategy throughout the year. In the past, we've had great success
treating our clubs essentially the same, but we recognize our member base varies around the country. Moving forward,
members will experience exciting merchandise, heightened by local brands, all displayed with a new level of visual
excitement.
We're also adapting to serve our members who are shopping online and in our clubs. Members are using their mobile
devices before, during and after their shopping experience. The Sam's Club mobile app is giving our members
personalized eCommerce and the ability to shop anywhere, anytime. Before visiting the club, members can build
shopping lists and fill prescriptions. In the club, they can research merchandise information and compare costs. And
alongside Walmart, we're piloting the Scan & Go app, which will be in 150 clubs by mid-June. Technology clearly
enhances our members' shopping experience.
The combination of our strategies position us well for the second quarter and we have a number of events to drive sales.
We were pleased with the first two weeks' start to the quarter. We expect comp club sales, without fuel, for the
13-week period from April 27 through July 26 to range between 1% and 3%. Last year, for the 13-week period, comp
sales, excluding fuel, increased 4.2%.
The core business at Sam's Club is solid. We're confident that the combination of new club growth, membership
improvements, exciting and locally-relevant merchandise, as well as eCommerce and digital opportunities, will drive
momentum. We're proud of what we have accomplished in the past 30 years and are confident that we are well
positioned going forward.
Now, I'll turn the program over to Charles for our wrap up and guidance. Charles?
Charles M. Holley
Thanks, Roz. To wrap up, let me provide some perspective on the quarter. First, we feel good about many aspects of
our company's performance. We delivered 4.6% earnings per share growth in a tough sales environment. Both Walmart
U.S. and Sam's Club levered expenses and grew operating income faster than sales. We generated solid cash flows
from operations. We grew our eCommerce sales more than 30% and grew market share in the U.K., Brazil and China.
We issued $5 billion of fixed income debt at record low rates on the strength of our balance sheet. And in February of
this year, we announced an 18% increase in our dividend.
The first quarter also presented some challenges. As a company, our leverage ratio was relatively flat. And although we
grew consolidated operating income faster than sales, the growth did not meet our expectations. Looking ahead, our
financial priorities remain growth, leverage and returns. And we usually talk about them in this order, but today, I'd like
to start with a discussion on leverage.
The company's leverage in the first quarter was relatively flat and the second quarter will be challenging as well. Our
largest challenges are with International, as Doug spoke about, and our leveraged services area, where we are investing

in projects and programs that will save costs in the long run.
Operating expense leverage is a critical piece of our business model and we remain focused on delivering the five-year
100 basis point goal through fiscal 2017. Though expense leverage is not expected to be achieved equally across the
quarters every year, we are committed to leveraging operating expenses for this year.
Early investments to expand our leverage initiatives will initially have a short-term impact on expenses; however, these
investments will benefit Walmart for the long-term. Our leverage teams are focused on three key areas: best practice
implementation; building greater sourcing capabilities; and back office efficiency. Under the best practice umbrella, for
example, our Global Business Process teams continue to work on self-checkout expansion, auto replenishment systems
and associate scheduling systems.
Our sourcing teams are working to increase direct import volumes to deliver greater savings on cost of goods and
transportation. We also continue to make progress on goods not for resale, especially in the refrigeration and energy
areas.
In our back office area, we completed the migration of work from four different finance offices in Central America to a
regional center that is now serving most of our Latin American countries. Initiatives like this help us simplify, prioritize
and focus.
In addition, we continue to invest in our International markets through new store growth and our compliance
organization. Jeff provided details earlier on the expenses related to the ongoing FCPA matters, as well as the processes
we're putting in place to continue to strengthen our global compliance organization.
Now, let's talk about growth. During the quarter, we added over five million square feet of retail space. Our total
revenue growth was less than we expected, growing 1% versus last year. In addition, headwinds from currency
impacted top line more than we anticipated. However, as you heard from Bill, Roz and Doug, we feel confident about
our growth in the second quarter and the balance of the year.
One final comment on sales, eCommerce will continue to grow in importance for our company. During the quarter,
eCommerce sales increased by over 30% and we continue to make strategic investments in the markets that offer us the
greatest growth opportunity. We're focusing this investment in key areas, including our global technology platform and
next-generation fulfillment networks, as well as scaling additional markets around the world.
We remain focused on four important markets in eCommerce. From a traffic perspective, we see over 45 million
visitors each month in the U.S. on walmart.com, where growth and conversion are accelerating. In the U.K., we're the
second largest online grocer, while in Brazil, we were just named the number one trafficked eCommerce site. And
you've heard us talk about our investment in Yihaodian, one of the fastest growing eCommerce businesses in China.
We're excited about the potential for growth in this space and Neil Ashe has assembled the talent necessary to achieve
our growth plans.
Let me finish our discussion on our financial priorities today by talking about returns. We deployed cash to grow our
business and return value to shareholders. During the quarter, $3.8 billion was returned to shareholders through
dividends and share repurchases. Walmart has a long history of delivering great returns for our shareholders and we
remain committed to continuing this trend.
Let's move on to guidance. As we think about earnings per share guidance for the second quarter, there are a couple of
specific items that we've included. First, we told you during the fourth quarter last year, that investments in Global
eCommerce initiatives would have an incremental $0.09 impact for fiscal 2014. During the second quarter, we expect
an impact of about $0.02 per share. This is in line with the $0.02 impact we had in the first quarter. Additionally, we
believe cost associated with FCPA matters will be between $65 million and $70 million for the second quarter.
Taking these factors into consideration, along with current business and macroeconomic trends, including currency, we
expect second quarter earnings per share to be between $1.22 and $1.27. Last year, Walmart delivered earnings per
share of $1.18 in the second quarter.

Carol A. Schumacher
Good morning, everyone.
I know this is unusual for us to do, but we are trying to be more efficient for all of you. So rather than taking your calls
on an individual basis, we are trying this out today. It doesn't necessarily mean that this will become permanent. So
certainly after we're done, we do value the feedback from you on how this has gone. This is designed to hopefully make
your job a little easier, because we'll certainly get a lot of the questions, I think out of the way overall. We are available
throughout the day, and tomorrow and into next week to take additional questions from you on an individual basis.
Before I get started, I have to remind you that, we certainly might be making some forward-looking statements today.
You can see our forward-looking statement on our website. It's included in the script and in the press release. And I
hope you took note in the call today, that we had a much shorter forward-looking statement at the top of the call. And
you can still listen to the full forward-looking statement at the end of the call after Charles finishes up on guidance.
That's to say that we heard your input, and we didn't bog you down listening to the call with 11 minutes of
forward-looking comments.
A couple other reminders before I get into some of the actual details of our quarter. One, our comp calendar this year is
a little different than what we are seeing from some of the other retailers out there in the marketplace. Our comp last
year was on a 52-week basis. We are reporting on a 53-week basis this year. And I think you can take note of that
calendar effect when you look at our comp period for this quarter. So, our comp ended this quarter on April 26.
The second thing I'd like to remind you and I see this reflected in a number of the sell side reports is that, a lot of you
may have expected us to update full year guidance today. Our convention and, if you will, kind of our policy is that, we
don't update the full year in the first quarter. We begin to update the full year in Q2. So, you're going to hear more from
us on full-year update on EPS guidance in August.
So let me get into just an overview of our overall points today. And then, we'll open it up to Q&A.
Certainly, I think you've seen reflected in our news today that we felt Q1 was more challenging than what we expected.
When we announced year-end back in February, we told you that especially in the Walmart U.S. business we were
starting to see a pickup in the activity from tax refund checks. That did not materialize to the level that we have seen
historically in past years, and so Q1 ended up to be more challenging, given that headwind from less on tax refund
check activity than we had originally expected.
We were also affected, as you know, by weather. No surprise there as other companies, including retailers and others,
have talked about weather in the first quarter.
I will say that inflation was less than what we had built into our forecast. That is due to somewhat lower food inflation
than we expected, as well as deflation in dry grocery. And again that comment is primarily a Walmart U.S. comment.
The last thing that we are starting to see is certainly some impact from the 2% payroll issue. And I think others have
talked about that as well. If you look at our overall business, we were affected overall by currency to a greater extent
than what we had forecast going into the quarter.
On the positive side, let me give you some callouts for the quarter as well. Our EPS, as you know, was up 4.6%. It was
in the middle of our range, roughly. Our range top end was $1.16. We came in at $1.14, and that compared to $1.09 last
year.
Our net sales were up $1.2 billion. We closed Q1 at $113.4 billion. And again that included an impact from currency of
$1 billion. So as I said, that was a little more than we had expected going into the quarter.
We did grow operating income. Good numbers on op income from both Walmart and Sam's, $5.9 million and $7.4
million respectively. And both of our U.S. businesses also leveraged expenses. You know that one of our key metrics is
to grow operating income faster than sales, and both our U.S. businesses did that.
So I think if you peel back the onion a little more on Walmart U.S., total net sales were $66.6 billion. We did have a
negative $1.4 billion comp.
If you were strip out the first two weeks of the period, we felt our comp would have been close to flat. And if you add
up the impact – and it's not a perfect science, but if you look at the four factors that we mentioned in the call, that Bill
talked in great detail about – tax refund activity, weather, less inflation, 2% payroll impact – if you look at those in
cumulative, it could have been up to 200 basis points that would have impacted our comp in the first quarter.
The next thing I'd point out on Walmart U.S. is that despite all these headwinds, we certainly grew market share. And I
think you've heard from us now in the last quarter as well that we've grown market share in food, consumables and
OTC. Those areas of the business – grocery and health & wellness in aggregate – make up about 66% of our revenues.
So we feel good about the fact that we're growing market share in the key areas of our business.
The most important message you should take away from Bill today is this: May is off to a good start, we're seeing
positive comps so far in the period. And we expect our second-quarter comps to be positive in the range of flat to up
I know a number of you asked what the consumers are concerned about. Jobs, far and away, still number one. Despite
the fact that unemployment has come down. Remember that the core Walmart customer – household income 35k to
50k – is still pressured a little more in the jobs category than the general population.
Number two on the list of concerns, food cost. Number three, gas prices. And both number two and three have come
down in April, compared to where things were back in February.
A distance fourth is taxes. And if you remember what we've talked about as far as their concerns in February, taxes
were number two then.
Let me jump to international. Net sales were up 2.9% to $33 billion and remember we do look at sales on constant
currency basis, doing that meant our sales were up 5.4%. As Doug pointed out, we grew market share in most of our
markets. The biggest disappointment in international is expense control. You heard both from Doug, if you look at the
script, and from Mike about disappointment that International do not leverage expenses. Factors there include softer
sales, wage inflation, especially in a couple of key markets, things like higher indirect taxes and strategic investments.
And we can get into a little more of that later probably in the Q&A.
I think one of the key takeaways for International is the point that Doug made and that is – and Charles reiterated that
expenses for Q2 and International will remain under pressure. We don't expect to see improvement there until the back
half of the year, but we certainly are taking steps to mitigate that and move that along.
Sam's Club had pretty good news. Their comps were up 0.2%, 20 basis points, but remember that was in the range. It's
good to note their comps were positive. And I would point out that Sam's was up against a 5.3% last year. Remember
too, I didn't say this earlier, but Walmart U.S. was up against 2.6% a year ago. So inflation impacted top line as well as
at Sam's, there is a little more detail in the Sam's script on exactly where inflation netted out. Again we leveraged
expenses at Sam's Club. Operating income really, really bright spot for Sam's, that was up 7.4%. One of the key
takeaways in the Sam's Club section is that, as of yesterday, we took up our membership fee. So the membership fee is
now $45 and that reflects a $5 and a $10 increase for Advantage and Business members.
So we feel that the steps that we're taking on the Sam's Club side to improve not only the overall merchandise
presentation, price investments there, but the membership fee increase, bodes well for Sam's for the rest of the year and
into next year.
[Coughing] Sorry, I have been battling a sinus infection, so you have to bear with me through the coughing here.
The other takeaway I'd point to you – point you guys to on Sam's Club is, like Walmart U.S., Roz said we feel good
about the start to Q2. Comp guidance for Q2 for Sam's Club is to increase 1% to 3%.
That brings us to overall guidance for EPS for the quarter. We went out with $1.22 to $1.27 and that compares to $1.18
last year. I'd remind you that in the fourth quarter, we talked about $0.09 of impact coming from global e-commerce
initiatives. This year we saw $0.02 of that in Q1. We expect to see $0.02 of that come again in Q2 and that is included
in our guidance.
One of the things that we had miss-forecast in the first quarter was the line item on FCPA costs. As you know, we said
that we would estimate FCPA costs for the first quarter to be between $40 million and $45 million, and we ended the
quarter at $73 million, that was a factor in us not having EPS a little higher than $1.14.
We expect FCPA costs for Q2 to now range between $65 million and $70 million, and again that's reflected in our
guidance of $1.22 to $1.27. We do expect, as Charles pointed out in his section, that Q2 could be a little challenging on
the expense leverage side. But remember that Charles pointed out, we're very committed to leveraging for the full year,
and that you'll see some ups and downs, ebbs and flows quarter-to-quarter on the expense leverage side.
So with that, I have my team here with me and happy to open it up for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Barclays. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Good morning, Carol. Thanks for doing this.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Hey, Bob how are doing?
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: I'm good, I'm good. Thanks. So, the two questions that I have for you, the first is, within the
quarter on the comp, can you quantify the buckets on the weather sensitive impacts in terms of the categories on the
comp? I think you said overall a number of things led to that 200-basis point impact. On the different categories, can
you tell us which ones were more pressured and maybe give some numbers around that?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Unfortunately, we're not that scientific, Bob, that we can do exactly what was what. I
will tell you that if you strip out the first two weeks, which were primarily affected by the lower tax refund activity, we
would have been flat. So, you can interpret that to mean we felt that greatest part of the impact was in the tax refund
activity this quarter.
We're only starting to see and if you look at what we said in the fourth quarter call, at that point Bill said we weren't
seeing much impact from the payroll tax increase. At this point, toward the end of the quarter, our research with our
customers points to the fact that they are starting to recognize that. They were starting to see it in their shopping
activity. We're starting to pick up a little of that and it is clearly, as Bill pointed out, something that we're monitoring
well into Q2. So, that one is still a little difficult to read.
On the inflation front, inflation moderated at a much faster rate than we expected. As I said, we saw very little food
inflation in this quarter and in fact we had deflation in dry grocery. And you know dry grocery is a big portion of our
business.
So, I think if you take those factors together and then you layer in weather, if you look at what we said in the Walmart
U.S. script, you see almost every category with the exception of entertainment, weather was a factor. So it's hard to put
a financial quantification against those, but I think if you look at what I've just said, you can pretty much see that the
integration of all those coming together really pulled our comps down and have we not had first the tax refund activity,
we certainly would have been closer to our guidance that relatively flat.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Okay. Carol, you guys have historically given the dollar number of the tax refunds that you cash.
Could you give us this year's number versus last year?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: We did – we're not disclosing that. And all I can point you to is the fact that if you go to
the IRS website, we did have this data point in Bill's script, the IRS said that they ended tax season $9 billion down
from their forecast and certainly we make up a portion of that, but we're not quantifying that today.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Okay. The last question that I have is on – on the inventory levels, I mean the seasonal appears to
be a portion of this, but are there any pockets of inventory that are a concern in the levels that you reported this
morning?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: The concern is primarily on the seasonal categories, obviously, affected by weather.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Hey, Carol. How are you?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Good.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: I also want to thank you for doing this. Three quick questions, two really follow-ups. The
first is, so just on this excluding the first two weeks of the quarter, was the traffic comp positive excluding the two
weeks? And was it consistently positive through the quarter excluding those two weeks?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: We've not broken it out that way, Robbie, so I can't comment on that particular question
today.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Got you. And then on the inflation commentary, it didn't materialize the way that you guys
thought. Can you give us more color on what you guys thought was going to be driving the food inflation and then
where maybe the variance came from? Was it competition required you to be more price aggressive or was it your own
planned investments in price or was it mix? Just maybe help us understand what happened?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: I think it was a little bit of a combination of factors. Certainly, we're still seeing some
inflation, primarily in beef, but we had expected to see some food costs come up a little more. So, as I mentioned, dry
grocery had much more deflation than we had anticipated. What was your other question, Robbie?
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Sure. And then my last question is just some things helped gross margin, I guess, in Walmart
U.S. in this quarter. How are you guys thinking about gross margin for the rest of the year? How should we be thinking
about the gross margin puts and takes for you guys for the rest of the year?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Well, I think if you look at what we said about – we talked about our gross profit being
partly driven by supply chain productivity. We gave you some examples of that where Bill talked about the logistics
side. We also have a number of cost – COGS initiatives in place. And I think those savings help offset some of the
price investment.
I will tell you though that we are continuing to invest in price, and as Bill mentioned, we've now expanded quite a bit
our price investment, marketing campaign. We call it internally the local basket savings challenge. That is now on the
air in 70% of our markets.
So if you remember, we ended the year only in 25 markets. We're now well over 60, and again that represents 70%
penetration of our U.S. markets.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Great. Thanks so much, Carol.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Thanks so much, and Carol, thanks so much for doing this call. So a few questions for
you. Can you talk about the paycheck cycle that you saw in the first quarter?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Paycheck cycle is still there. Not more or less pronounced than what we've seen before.
Still, in the beginning of the quarter, it was a little difficult to read because of the payroll – or not the payroll tax – the
income tax refund activity. But at the end of the day, when you look geographically at when the money flows into the
markets, we still see evidence that the payroll cycle is there.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Okay. And then in terms of the traffic comps, can you help us compare and contrast? So
traffic was negative at Walmart U.S. and positive at Sam's. Can you maybe just talk about some of the traffic driving
initiatives at both businesses?

<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Okay. At Walmart U.S., I'll do that one first. Clearly what I just mentioned from a
marketing standpoint is important.
I'd also point out that in the – included in some of the supply chain productivity is a big push by us to improve our
produce business. I think those of you who have an opportunity to shop at Walmart know that produce hasn't always
been our brightest area of the grocery side of the house. And we have taken a lot of steps this year to take days out of
the supply chain to improve that area of the business. And in fact, Bill pointed out, that comps were positive on
produce.
So I think you're going to continue to see us move forward on initiatives that can help drive traffic to the box, produce
being one of them.
Last year, you heard from us about our meat initiative to improve the quality of our meat, which brought traffic to the
box and consequently our meat sales continue to be up this year. In fact, that's one of the headwinds we're up against
this year as we get further into the year, is that those meat comps were really good as we got into last year. And so we
will be up against that going forward this year.
So price investment will continue to be important. Remember, Bill's overall strategy has been broad assortment backed
with EDLP. But the strategy this year that we're also layering in is another push more toward local relevance. So you'll
continue to see us make sure that we're right locally, store-by-store across the country. I think that's the Walmart U.S.
side.
On the Sam's Club side, very focused on driving that value message to the member. Doing more price investment to
drive traffic to the box. And I think the new membership program with the instant savings book is clearly going to be a
traffic driver for Sam's club.
Remember also at the same time that Roz talked about doing a little more to differentiate, and to make sure that clubs
are right locally as well. In Roz's script, she points out that in the past, we've treated clubs pretty much the same across
the board and across the country. And I think you'll see that emphasis on local relevance come through on the Sam's
Club side this year, Deb.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Okay. And then can you talk about where you are with ad match right now as well?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Where we are from what standpoint?
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Just in terms of the number of markets and kind of how should we think about your
success so far?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: We know from the past that when we have that the ad program in place versus a control
market where it's not, we generally see a lift in comps, especially when it airs in a market for the first time.
We've gone from ending fiscal year so ending January with a campaign in 25 markets to over 60 or 65 markets right
now. So it is a campaign that we're expanding. Still focused primarily on the grocery and food side, but also
secondarily on drug.
You'll start to see us get into a little more of the seasonal aspect of that campaign like we did last year, where we had a
back-to-school example against [ph] the dollar stores. (25:14)
So where it makes sense, there will be some seasonal adjustments. But overall, the focus is going to be on the grocery
side of the business.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Okay. And then lastly, I think you're about to cycle the kind of one year – coming up on
your one-year anniversary of working with Nielsen. Can you talk about how that's changed, what you're carrying in
stores. and maybe just how you're working with vendors?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Really can't talk too much about how we're working with vendors, other than to say,
generally, the Nielsen data is certainly helping us have more visibility into what's going in the marketplace, and hence

is helping us make some strategic decisions about what assortment we carry.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Okay. And then lastly, as we dig into the details on the international side, obviously,
there has been a lot of concern about a major competitor coming into Canada. Those comps, I think, were negative
1.3% and traffic was down 2%. Can you just talk about that market specifically?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Not going to get into it too much.
I mean, remember, Target didn't open at the start of the quarter. So weather was the primary factor in Canada that hurt
our traffic. And the consumer is pressured a lot more in Canada as well. So we don't feel at this point that Target has
been in the market early enough for us to have a real, true read on the business.
Hey, what I'd ask you guys going forward – I see there are a lot of you waiting to ask questions. Let's try to keep it just
– no offense to the ones who've been on already, but to everybody else, if you could limit it to two questions, so we can
make sure we get through as many of you as we can.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Good morning, Carol, and let me add my thanks for doing this as well. And I hope you take a
glass of water to get some lubrication in your throat. [indiscernible] (27:20)
I guess my first question is I know Bill gave some examples on the gross-margin improvement – gross-profit rate
improvement in the U.S. But there is no quantification of price investment versus supply chain, other than those
examples. Can you feel comfortable giving us a little bit of – maybe more color on that?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: We're not breaking it down. Obviously, we feel we have a little competitive advantage
from that standpoint.
I will tell you that the supply-chain productivity was part of it, but we're not going to give a breakdown of how price
investment figured into that.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Okay. And I guess for my second question, that's – Charles said that expense leverage would be
a challenge in the second quarter. Do we take it that that's primarily still pretty much all international, and the U.S. and
Sam's – should we expect them to leverage expenses in Q2?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: You should expect that to mean that international is our bigger challenge.
But also remember what Charles said about two things. One, the higher FCPA costs. We've already accounted for that
in our guidance.
The second thing though that I'd point you to where Charles talked about is ongoing investments in our leverage area.
We have a lot of systems in place, many of which you guys are familiar with, like the MyGuide system, the associate
scheduling. We're investing to put those in place in our international markets.
And so that investment falls under the corporate and support line currently. And you saw that our corporate and support
area was up quite a bit compared to what you normally see.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Right. And I'm going to sneak one more on. FCPA, is that going to be – are those going to be
continuing expenses? When do we expect that to be resolved?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: It's an ongoing investigation. We don't know what the timing is, because obviously
we're working with the SEC and the DOJ on that. So we don't have a crystal ball, as far as the timing goes. And that's
one of the reasons why you see us estimating the costs quarter by quarter.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Thanks, good morning. Can you – I think last year you talked about the net inflation impact
to the Walmart U.S. business being around 50 to 100 positive – the balance between higher inflation – but the offset
was trade down. So can you talk about what that impact was here in the first quarter?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: There wasn't much material impact. We said that it was really – that inflation really
moderated. It was almost close to flat, Chris.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Okay. So you didn't see like people then trade back up, and pack size help you, or something
like that?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: No.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Okay.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: I mean we're still seeing – related to the paycheck cycle, which we mentioned earlier,
we're still seeing some of the ongoing ebb and flow during the paycheck cycle, where you see as people run out of
money, you see the trade down, and you see the move to pack size differences.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Yep, and then also in the margin structure in the U.S. business, on gross margin, was there
any impact from increased markdowns because of the weather? And then also in the SG&A line, can you describe how
much of [ph] the expense (31:08) leverage was incentive comp?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: We've not disclosed that. I can tell you, I think the word we used was that was the
primary reason.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: And then markdowns in gross margin, did you have – was that a negative?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Markdowns – ask that question again. Sorry.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: In gross margin, the weather obviously hurt sales but did it also contribute to any gross
margin pressure in the first quarter?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Toward the end of the quarter, certainly. We're – maybe towards the end of the quarter,
a little bit. But obviously it's something that we're looking at from a Q2 standpoint. Because we did acknowledge that a
lot of the seasonal merchandise didn't really move through.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Okay.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Bernard Sosnick with Gilford Securities. Please proceed with
your question.

Bill mentioned that in the apparel area, kid's apparel and basics did quite well. What portion of total apparel sales
would you say that represents?

Page 9 of 18
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: We don't – we don't break it down. Remember, apparel overall is about 7% of our total
revenue. The biggest piece – I'll give you the biggest piece. The biggest piece of our apparel business is ladies. But I
won't break it down percentage-wise on how much kids is.
I think one of the takeaways should be that we've been working really hard to improve the quality and the offering in
that area though. So the fact that comps were positive means that a lot of the steps we took are working.
<Q - Bernie Sosnick>: That you can see in the store. And that's why I was focusing on these areas. Your basics looks
terrific.
But with regard to the 4.6% inventory increase in the U.S. business, I assume that much of it – in fact, probably the
lion's share is due to the weather. What would you be looking for inventories at the end of the second quarter?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: We don't forecast inventory ahead, Bernie. So, I'm not going to give you a direct
numerical answer on that one. What I would tell you is that at Walmart we tend to mark down until we move it out.
<Q - Bernie Sosnick>: But spring is a long season and it hasn't really begun. So, the transfer of those inventories to
sales could be significant, if the weather breaks early. What are you seeing in terms of the ability, perhaps, to clear that
inventory?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: We feel good about where we are. We don't feel that we have much in the way of
inventory liability.
We do feel confident in what we're seeing in the beginning of the quarter. And as Bill said, we have positive comps for
the first couple of weeks of the period so far.
<Q - Bernie Sosnick>: Thank you again for having this call. It's very helpful.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: You're welcome.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Hi, good morning. First question on the Sam's membership fee increase. Obviously you
haven't had one in a long time. And recognizing it's not the overwhelming part of your profitability, I was curious,
nonetheless, if the plan is to use the proceeds, if you will, to really step up price investment activity?
It seems like you were fairly aggressive in Q4, less so this quarter. I'm just kind of curious what the thinking is around
this, now that you get membership fee income helping to take profitability up?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: I mean remember, membership is recognized only month-by-month. We don't recognize
it all when the member signs up. So it's going to be over a longer period of time that that cycles into the business.
That being said, we're going to invest in price, with or without the membership. You started to see that in the first
quarter, Dan.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: I mean this gives you a lot more fuel to do more. So I guess what I'm asking is, all else being
equal, is the view let's keep profitability more – operating-margin rate – more or less flat and just funnel this back into
price investment?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Well, remember we don't forecast those specifics on a go-forward basis. All I'd tell you
is that Sam's laid out a strategy at the end of last year to invest in price. You started to see that in the first quarter. You
should expect to continue to see that this year, Dan.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Why do you suppose your main competitor in that space isn't really calling it out? I mean
they don't seem to be seeing it in their own comp shops. I mean are you doing this in a way that it's not focused on the –

sort of the biggest items? Or are they not looking at the right clubs? Or I was just trying to reconcile.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: I can't speak to what Costco is looking at. So really – I really can't answer that one.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Okay. Second question was on international. I mean you called out several markets that had
gains. Traffic continues to be negative, and it's been for a while in many of these markets.
So I guess I'm just trying to understand what's going to stop that? Is there structural issues that are keeping this from
getting back into positive territory? And moreover I don't how that reconciles with positive share gain?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: I think you have to look market-by-market, and I think that's what Doug pointed out.
There is nothing that we can say that's a broad-scale change that we make in the marketplace.
We do know that EDLP works. And that's why in the markets where we don't have EDLP, like China, we are moving
in that direction now, going forward.
There are different issues in different markets. You had weather in the UK and Canada. In Japan, the economy is very
soft. So I think once you start breaking it down market-by-market, there are reasons why. And we are certainly tackling
it on a country-by-country basis.
Hey, Dan, one more question, and then we've got to move on.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Yeah, just a follow-up to the price [ph] divestment (38:42) only as it pertains to Walmart
stores.
In our own pricing survey, we were seeing kind of maybe a little more aggressiveness in grocery towards the end of the
quarter, a little less on non-food. Just trying to understand, are you guys just tweaking this around? What's going on in
the rest of the P&L to manage to get to the earnings levels that you want to be at? Or is there more consistency to it
than that – than what we are seeing and given that the supply chain efficiencies are ahead of plan, it would seem like
you have room for more price investment.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Well there's certainly going to be a balance. Obviously, when you have softer sales, as
we started to see after we talked to you guys in February, you're going to manage against – against where you are from
a sales line. But I will say that our price investment has always been focused on the – on greater investment on the
grocery side of the house.
You will see some investment throughout the store, but it really is going to be weighted toward grocery and health and
wellness. Nielsen gives us that visibility to look at where we need to have the right balance.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Okay. Thanks.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Joe I. Feldman>: Yeah. Hi, how are you Carol? Thanks for doing the call as well. Wanted to ask about – drill
down in international expenses, which going through the transcript and I guess just wanted to better understand at a
deeper level what's going on. Like is it a need for better controls, is it need for more efficiency? Can you maybe talk a
little about that?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: I think – one of the things I mentioned earlier, Joe, is the fact that we're investing in
systems to have some of those same global business practice or the global business process systems go in place in
international, leveraging off the investment that we've made on some of those systems in the U.S. now. Those systems
allow – allow our management team to react. So when they – they do see sales come down a little bit or change, they
have the ability to react quickly. That has not existed in international. And so, the reaction time maybe isn't as quick as

we would like to see it.
Also remember that you have higher wage inflation in some markets and we also know that we have some countries
where we have unions where you also have agreements in place that that you have to follow through on. So you don't
necessarily have all the flexibility to make changes on the wage line that you have in the U.S.
<Q - Joe I. Feldman>: Got it. That's helpful. And then if I could just add one more question, was on e-commerce.
Maybe you could talk a little about – just a little update on ship from store. I know there was like a one-liner in the
transcript, but also, how much that helped to contribute to the 30% increase in e-commerce sales and just a little more
flavor on how you're doing on e-commerce in general?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: The 30% number that we gave you guys today that's a total company number
representing primarily sales in the U.S., UK, Brazil and China with the U.S. being the biggest portion of those sales.
Joe, what was your other question – what was that, ship from store?
<Q - Joe I. Feldman>: Yeah, ship from store. Yeah.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Well, you heard that we've had that program in place now for less than a year. It gives
us the stores, our 4,000 plus stores give us the opportunity to ship directly from stores, especially when it allows us to
cut days out of the shipping.
Our main DC on the e-com side of the business in the U.S. is in Carrollton, Georgia. And so if somebody is ordering
something in Kansas, and we can ship it from a store Kansas or a store or state next door, we can get it there much
more quickly.
So we're currently shipping orders from just now 35 stores, so out of 4,000 plus, 35 is still a small number, but I think
you can look to hear more from us as we go through the year on where we are there.
<Q - Joe I. Feldman>: Got it, thanks and then just related, the same day shipping? I'm sorry, I should have asked that
too.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Well, ship from stores will let – no, ship from store is different than same day shipping.
Same day delivery is still in test right now, but it's only in a handful of markets. That's going to take a while, I think, for
us to continue to evaluate that test.
<Q - Joe I. Feldman>: Okay. Thanks very much.

<Q - John R. Lawrence>: Hi. Good morning, Carol.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John R. Lawrence>: Carol on the initiatives – on the productivity cycle, et cetera, self-service check outs and
MyGuide. Can you give us a sense of how far along the process we are on both of those and maybe magnitude of with
self-service checkouts give us a little more productivity for a longer period of time or sort of give us some context
there?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: MyGuide is fully in place in all stores in the U.S., in the Walmart U.S. business. But the
utilization rate of that continues to get fine-tuned. So as we continue to execute against that there is still more upside
from a productivity standpoint.

Self-checkout, we know customers like it. They use it. We're seeing greater utilization of self-checkout and we'll
continue to push that into our stores this year. That again offers a pretty good amount of upside for us from an overall
productivity standpoint.
<Q - John R. Lawrence>: Great. Thanks. And secondly, just some kind of – Charles talking about leverage
opportunities in international, just a couple of things that you could focus on that sort of demonstrates the confidence
there of what can make that happen?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Well, certainly, we have the U.S. business model to look at and I would say that we're
going to work off the investments that are in place there and the best practices that are already in place. But as you
know, it will take a little longer to get those in place in our countries outside the U.S.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jason DeRise with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Yeah. Hi, it's Jason DeRise, UBS. So, I guess my two questions; one, there is a lot in the press
about on-shelf availability or the lack of it. I know that in the past, it's been called out that it's between 90% and 95%.
I'm wondering if you would comment how that progressed year-over-year rather than just having random news articles
siting one or two stores. It would be good to hear what the big picture is on that?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Jason, it's primarily one reporter in particular who tends to write about that – maybe a
couple others then pick it up from there. Our goal is to have OSA in place at a rate of 95% and that's a pretty good goal.
I think what sometimes the media don't understand is that if you have OSA – on-shelf availability at a rate of 100% it
means your doors are shut and nobody is shopping or buying anything. So 95% is a really good rate.
In the first quarter, when a lot of this OSA stuff was starting to be talked about, depending on the area of the country,
OSA ranged in the 93% to 95% range. So you're always going to have some stores, when you've got 4,000 plus stores,
you're always going to have some that are not as good as others. Those are the stores that are getting management
attention and I would tell you that management throughout Walmart U.S. is very focused on, on-shelf availability to
drive sales.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Okay. And I guess just as a follow up on that, can you talk about Project Spark and how that
is helping in terms of the on-shelf availability with your vendors.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: I haven't talked much about that so far, but yes. I can tell you, it is in place, we are
working with our vendors on that, it's tied into Retail Link and it's allowing us – it's an expansion of our effort to make
sure that we're in-stock all the time for our customers.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Okay. And I'm going to say that that was a follow up and this is my second question. Just on
the e-commerce and following up on the prior questions there. So I just want to make sure I've got this right. So it was
up 30% and it's about 2% of your sales. So it's about – that's more than half of your sales growth for this quarter, I just
wanted to make sure that had that right if you...?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Jason, we have never disclosed what total online sales are in terms of our overall
percentage. What we have said and we said this in October is that we expected global e-commerce sales,
pre-acquisition, meaning before the Yihaodian acquisition, to be about the $9 billion this year. You guys can do the
math. We did $466 billion last year, $9 billion off that probably doesn't get you to 2% necessarily, but we've not
provided any disclosure beyond that $9 billion. I will say though that was without the Yihaodian acquisition. So, it
would be a little above that for this year.

<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: But – is the acquisition in that 30% year-over-year number?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: The 30%, yes. The Yihaodian sales are included in that.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Okay. Is there a comparable or a like-for-like type number that we can just maybe put in

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird and Company. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hi, Carol. Thanks. So, most of my questions have been asked, but just curious as to the
outdoor live goods business, the plants, the lawn and garden, that business obviously, it's probably tough. But can you
give us a sense of what that comped and I'm thinking about the Walmart US business here. What that comped to last
year in the first quarter and what it comped this year for the first quarter? And then within that, maybe the monthly
cadence, did you move to positive comp in the April and how is it doing so far in May? Thank you.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: I won't give you the breakdown for April, because we don't do that, but I will tell you
that it was positive last year. If you remember this quarter last year, we had incredibly warmer weather compared to
what we had this year. So, we would have comped positive this time on those businesses last year, Peter.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: So, I assume they were negative for the total quarter this year. Is that true?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Outdoor, specifically on a national basis was. Certainly, as Bill pointed out in markets
like Florida, where we had more normalized weather patterns, you would have seen that being positive, but we had
snow here the first weekend in May in Arkansas. Never in the history of our state have we had snow. The weather here
has just been terrible.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: I totally understand. And then just in terms of May, any comment thus far, is that category on
a national level back to positive.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Not going to give you that for this quarter.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. All right. Thank you.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: You're welcome.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Thank you. And Carol, let me add my thanks to you for doing this. It's a big investment
of time. So, really appreciate it. Just wanted to ask about expenses in the U.S. if – understanding the primary driver was
incentive comp, but still with the comps down 1.4 in store comps, I'm assuming the e-commerce number is in there,
store comps probably down closer to two. It sounds like there were some pretty good underlying drivers of productivity
and efficiency and I was hoping maybe you could just kind of list those if not enumerate them?

<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Sure. Not necessarily in this order, Colin, but I would tell you that certainly the things
that Bill talked about in terms of our logistics business being a major contributor to increased productivity. You've
heard us start to talk more about that last year.
When we put our leverage goal in place, obviously, we went after the obvious low hanging fruit from the start of that.
The scheduling system that we've rolled out department-by-department throughout the store, that's been a big area of
focus. I will say though, once those things go into place, it's also a matter of making sure that we have 100% utilization.
And I think I mentioned that before, but the MyGuide system now in place in all stores and as it gets to be more
familiar to our associates, as they get trained more on it, as they utilize it more, still upside opportunity there from the
expense standpoint.
On the logistics side, remember that we have not added a DC in the last five years. So that means that we have a lot of
extra capacity in the existing system. We're doing things not just in a DC network – hold on – but also within our
trucking system and our fleet. So when you're integrating, you put all of these things together. You can see that we
continue to have leverage opportunities going forward. And then I forgot who it was who asked the question before, but
certainly as we're putting in self-checkout, there is just a lot of additional opportunity there.
I will tell you that for those of you guys who are coming for our shareholders and our open-house, we are going to have
about five people from our global business practice area available in the Walmart Supercenter to be able to show you
some of these things that are in place.
The last thing I'd mention is, the one-touch freight system, where the fewer times we can touch the freight, the more we
can – and the more and the faster we can get it on the floor, saves time, saves money and in an area like produce,
obviously delivers fresher product to our customers much faster.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Okay. That's super helpful. And then just for the second question, internationally
understanding the specific drivers around wages and taxes and initiatives but- two sub-questions there. One is, why
didn't we see incentive comp leverage there, which seem like it was a pretty big driver in the U.S. and then what
specific changes would you expect to start happening in the second half of the year where you can leverage the
expenses better?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Well, remember, Colin, that our incentive programs are based on a number of factors,
the biggest one being sales. So, last year sales were okay in international but that was a big factor on the international
side.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Okay.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: [Coughing] Sorry. And what was the other part of your question?
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Just the second half leverage gets better, I'm assuming some of the strategic
investments will start paying off but just anything specific to the leverage opportunity in the second half?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: On international or total company?
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: International.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: No specifics that we want to get into today.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Okay. Thank you, Carol. Very helpful.

<Q - John M. Zolidis>: Hi, good morning. Carol, can you talk a little bit about competition in the U.S. and pricing
actions from competitors and maybe also touch on saturation, any impact from new Walmart store openings on the
existing comps? And feel better soon.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Thanks. From the competition standpoint, I would say we're not necessarily seeing more
competitive activity on the Walmart U.S. business than we've seen previously. And I think, remember grocery being
our critical driver, we're focused very much on being the price leader in the marketplace and we look at that from a
local standpoint. So, we certainly look competitively not just at the obvious national players, but also on the regional
front as well.
On the dollar store side, we still believe that food drives traffic and we feel that that gives us a competitive advantage in
that channel as well. John, what was your other question?
<Q - John M. Zolidis>: Just lastly on saturation of the supercenters and smaller stores and whether the impact of
cannibalization from recent openings has been greater or – greater than expected or whether it's really in line with what
the plan is?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: No. Our cannibalization rate is not a factor. I mean, if you look at the two states where
we have the greatest number of stores, it's Texas and Florida and we have continued to open stores in both of those
states this year. I would say that we're moving in. You're starting to see some more neighborhood markets and
remember the smaller format allows us to have some of that filling capacity without affecting cannibalization.
<Q - John M. Zolidis>: Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll jump off.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Okay.

Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ian Gordon with S&P Capital IQ. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Ian J. Gordon>: Hi, Carol. I just wanted to think about the comp more on a comparable basis to maybe how a lot
of the other retailers are adding. So, maybe checking my math, I don't know if you've done this, but if you were to take
that first week off and add the – I guess – what I guess is the last week of April, which I'm thinking is – was probably
positive even though you just said May was positive. Would that get you sort of closer to – from the 1.4 negative to
maybe half that or even less, does that sound about right if you were to shift it a week later?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: I won't crunch the math for you that way. But, I will let you know that if you take out
the first two weeks of our period, we'd have been close to flat.
<Q - Ian J. Gordon>: Right, right, right. Okay. And then, thinking about the tax rate guidance for the year, which I
guess you didn't discuss specifically, you said didn't change. It is, I guess, it's about one to two percentage points higher
than last year. Is there anything specific underlying that, was that really just a function of an abnormally low tax rate
last year, any color on the prospect for that being different?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Well, remember, our tax rate guidance last year was, I think, 32.5% to 33.5%, guys
correct me if I'm wrong, my guys here and this year we're saying 32% to 33%. Now we – remember we only say that
there is some level of fluctuation quarter-to-quarter on the tax rate. But we still feel that our – and it was a little higher
in Q1, it was 33.4%. But remember that as we go through the year we update you on a quarterly basis and we haven't
moved off our annual guidance for the ETR, Tal (sic) [Ian] (1:01:31)
<Q - Ian J. Gordon>: Yeah. I understood you. It came in at 31% last year, which was well below the guiding. There
may be a big true-up in the fourth quarter. But I was just trying to get a little clarity on...
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: No. I mean, we still – at this point we still feel our guidance is 32% to 33% for this year.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Lev with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Tal Lev>: Hi, good morning, Carol. I hope you feel better and thanks for doing this despite the challenge of
talking for an hour. Two quick questions on international and one on dot-com. On international comps, especially
focusing on some countries like Brazil and the UK, have you looked at what's the contribution from inflation to those
comps and also what's behind the worsening of comp trends specifically in Mexico and Brazil. I'm sorry, of traffic
trends in Mexico and Brazil.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Okay. Let me hit your inflation questions first. Certain markets like, if you look at some
of the Lat Am markets like Argentina, you have tremendous inflation. So inflation is going to be different
market-to-market. It's hard for us to give a broad stroke look to the level of inflation. I think if you look at what we said
in the UK, the UK market was driven primarily by inflation. So that it's really something on the inflation front, Tal, you
have to look at market-to-market.
On the traffic front in Mexico, we did have – let's see, traffic was Mexico – traffic was down 3.3 over last year. One,
the general consumption among customers is down a little bit in Mexico. The bigger factor in Mexico was the Easter
shift. Remember, internationally Q1 runs except for Canada, January to March. Last year Easter was in the second
quarter, it moved into the first quarter this year.
<Q - Tal Lev>: So is that also in Brazil?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: And in Brazil. Brazil, remember we're transitioning to EDLP. On our retail, we have
two key businesses in Brazil, retail and wholesale. On the retail side, comps are pretty good and traffic is positive. The
Brazil numbers are being pulled down by our wholesale business, which is Sam's Club and Maxxi. And that's where
we're transitioning to ELDP and that's where traffic has been a little weaker.
<Q - Tal Lev>: Okay, that's very helpful. On dot-com, can you just break down the [inaudible] (1:05:03) number, I'm
really sorry. Hope you feel better. On the dot-com, can you please break it down between traffic and ticket or by
categories or domestic versus international just to give some more color on what this growth number came from?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: We don't give that level of detail in our dot-com business. Remember that our overall
comps, so when we report our U.S. comps that does include our dot-com business. But you know, again, we don't break
it down. You have a gray area, especially in Walmart U.S., where a sale made site-to-store is that – it's not 100%
e-commerce sale, it's not 100% store, it's a blended one, so that's why comps are reported for the total business.
<Q - Tal Lev>: Maybe I squeeze one last one on Sam's, how much would be the open house weekend promotion?
What was their experience with it and how much did it boost if any the monthly performance for Sam's?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: We wouldn't get that specific on just one particular event, Tal, sorry about that.
<Q - Tal Lev>: Got it. Thank you, Carol. I hope you feel better.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: I can't help you with that one. Okay, I think we are going to take on more question and
that's going to be, if I look at the list, Mike Montani. This will be our last question and then will wrap up.
Operator
Thank you. Mr. Montani with the ISI Group, you may proceed with your question.
<Q - Michael D. Montani>: Hey Carol, thanks for taking my question. The first one was really as it relates to the
improvement that you've seen sequentially into May, where now comps are positive is traffic now positive and really

what have you seen that changed sequentially, is it traffic driven or ticket?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: I can't get that specific. We wouldn't go that specific this early in the month, Mike, at
any time, even if we were still reporting monthly comps. But I can tell you that our overall performance for both
Walmart U.S. and for Sam's is that we have positive comps for the first couple of weeks.
<Q - Michael D. Montani>: And maybe just to follow-up on that topic. You mentioned obviously less inflation than
you had planned, when you talk to the buyers, not just in grocery but more widely, what's the outlook you might have
for inflation into 2Q? And also any traffic drivers coming online that you can speak to, especially with relation to
expanded assortment or potentially stepped up ad spend?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: All right. Let me do the – say the first part of the question again, sorry?
<Q - Michael D. Montani>: Sure. So just the first part was on inflation, you had mentioned it was sort of below plan
this current quarter. And I guess my question is looking ahead, what are your buyers seeing? How are you planning for
that to change going forward? And then obviously I had the traffic driver question?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: I assume you are talking mostly about Walmart U.S.
<Q - Michael D. Montani>: Primarily, yes.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: On the Walmart U.S. front, we expect inflation to moderate. Obviously now we have a
little window into that. I talked about a couple of categories earlier. We've continued to see deflation on dry grocery,
about the only area of the food business where we're seeing some inflation is beef and that's really related to last year's
drought. But you are not seeing that rate of inflation coming through in some of the white meat categories.
<Q - Michael D. Montani>: Okay. So it sounds like some of the experience of the deceleration of the first quarter
could continue, it seems like?
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Yeah.
<Q - Michael D. Montani>: And then just on the traffic drivers of assortment expansion or increased ad spend,
anything you can share there.
<A - Carol A. Schumacher>: Not specifically, but remember earlier on the call I mentioned that, we do know, we see
an effect when we put the ad match program or the local basket challenge campaign into place. So when that does go
into place, we do see customers react, because at the end of the day, especially when you've got that paycheck cycle
still affecting so many customers who are working at what their paycheck is and what they have to spend, why pay
more for branded goods, if it's – especially if it's a national brand. So the ad campaign does have an impact for us on
traffic.
As far as other traffic drivers, I would say that we're also very focused on continuing what we started last year and that
is driving innovation and working with a lot of our CPG suppliers to bring innovation to our customers. I think if you
go back and you look, you guys are familiar with what we call, "The year beginning meeting," which is when we see
what's coming for the first half of the year and we bring all our store managers together in Orlando.
When you walk through the merchandise area, whether it was grocery or it was the GM side, you saw a lot of
innovation coming. And we're looking for unique ways to drive traffic. So you may not have noticed, but we have – we
are the exclusive location for getting tickets to the Superman movie, the Man of Steel movie and that's a traffic driving
initiative that's unique to the marketplace. That's the kind of thing you should expect to continue to see from Walmart
going forward.
We're going to have some things coming later in the year on back-to-school and certainly getting ready for the holidays
and even right now, if you look at what's coming on Memorial Day, we're looking to have some unique products, not
just on the GM side, but on the food side. I tell you ice cream is one category I personally self-tested some of the
product offerings at the year beginning meeting. I can tell you we have some good things in the pipeline.
