Richard and Kathy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide
presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at
usbank.com.
I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and
uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of
today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.
I will now turn the call over to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thanks, Jen, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin a review of U.S. Bank's results
with a summary of the quarter's highlights on slide three of the presentation.
I'm pleased to report that U.S. Bank reported record net income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2016, or $0.83
per diluted common share. The second quarter results include several notable items that together increased earnings per
share by $0.01. These notable items include: $180 million of equity investment income, primarily the result of our
membership in Visa Europe, which was recently sold to Visa Incorporated. Additionally, we've recognized $110
million in accruals related to legal and regulatory matters and a $40 million charitable contribution.
I'm very pleased with our second quarter results where we once again delivered industry-leading profitability and
posted record results for revenue, net income and earnings per share on both, a reported as well as a core basis.
Record revenues were driven by growth in average linked-quarter loans of 1.6%, as expected, and continued strength in
our fee businesses. While we saw a reduction in our linked-quarter net interest margin as expected, we did report
modest linked-quarter growth in net interest income and strong growth in net interest income on a year-over-year basis.
Total average deposit growth also remained strong at 7.6% versus the previous year and included net income growth –
net new income account growth of 2.8%.
Credit quality was stable for the second quarter, as expected. The net charge-off ratio was unchanged at 48 basis points
compared to the previous quarter and the previous year. So we recognized a modest improvement in nonperforming
assets, which was driven mainly by improvements in the energy credits.
Slide five provides you with the five-quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in
the industry. Moving to the graph on the right, you will see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.02%, 4 basis
points lower than the prior quarter, which was in line with our expectations. The industry continues to face headwinds
from low interest rate environment and the flatter yield curve, which became more pronounced at the end of the second
quarter, and continues as we begin the third quarter.
The lower long-term rates will have an impact on our second half results if the rates remain at these low historic levels.
We would expect that given the current yield curve and expectations that the short-term rates will remain flat for the
near term that the net interest margin will decline on a linked basis in the range of three to four basis points. However,
we also expect net interest income to increase on a linked-quarter basis, principally driven by an increase in earning
assets.
Expenses excluding the notable items increased 3.4%, at the bottom end of our expected range. And our efficiency ratio
improved to 54% versus 54.6% in the previous quarter. As projected, quarter two expenses included a linked-quarter
increase in marketing expense related to the investment in our brand advertising and also reflect the expected peak in
our compliance-related costs. As we look out to the second half of the year, we would expect expenses to grow.
However, the rate of growth will be lower than the 3.4% linked-quarter growth reported in the second quarter.
Turning to slide six, the company reported record net revenue of $5.4 billion in the second quarter. Excluding the Visa
Europe sale, revenue increased $226 million or 4.5% from the prior year. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by
core loan growth as well as strength in a number of our fee-based businesses, including our payments, mortgage, and

Wealth Management businesses. We also saw strong results from our capital markets business, as we were well
positioned to provide product and services to our customers as they navigated through the recent market volatility.
Kathy will now provide you with more details about our second quarter results.
Kathy Ashcraft Rogers
Thanks, Richard.
Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide seven. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.6% on a
linked-quarter basis and increased by over $20 billion or 8.1% compared with the second quarter of 2015. Excluding
the recent retail card portfolio acquisition and student loans that were carried in held-for-sale in the second quarter of
2015, loans grew by 6.5% compared to the prior year.
In the second quarter, the year-over-year increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average
total commercial loans of 10.7% and improved residential mortgage loan growth of 8.6%. Other consumer loans
continue to show positive momentum led by credit card growth of 14.3%, which included the retail card acquisition.
Finally, home equity loan growth continued, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 2.7%.
On a linked-quarter basis, our loan growth was 1.6%, meeting our expectations, and was driven by total commercial
loan growth of $2.3 billion or 2.6% and growth in residential mortgage of $1.3 billion or 2.4%. We currently project
linked-quarter average loan growth in quarter three to be similar to the growth reported in prior quarters.
Total average deposits increased $22 billion or 7.6% compared with the second quarter of 2015 and were up 3.9% on a
linked-quarter basis. On a year-over-year basis, the trend continues to reflect strong growth of 9.5% in our low-cost
deposits, which includes our non-interest bearing and low-cost interest checking deposits, and more than offset the
runoff in higher-cost time deposits.
Turning to slide eight, as Richard mentioned, credit quality remained relatively stable in the second quarter. Second
quarter net charge-offs increased $21 million or 7.1% compared with the prior year and reflected a modest increase of
$2 million or 0.6% on a linked-quarter basis. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 48 basis points in the
second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter and the prior year.
Compared with a year ago, nonperforming assets increased $95 million or 6%, mostly due to downgrades that occurred
in prior quarters related to energy credits. Linked-quarter nonperforming assets improved 3% or $47 million, driven
mainly from improvements in our energy credits.
Slide nine provides an update of our energy exposure. At the end of the second quarter, $3 billion of our commercial
loans and $11.3 billion of our commitments were to customers in the energy portfolio, which was down from the
previous quarter. The decline was primarily driven by the completion of our spring borrowing base redeterminations on
reserve-based loans within our energy portfolio. During the second quarter, criticized commitments within this
portfolio decreased $509 million while nonperforming loans decreased $54 million, principally driven by paydowns.
Finally, credit reserves associated with the energy portfolio declined by $45 million, reflective of reduced loans, which
resulted in an 8.8% credit reserve for our energy portfolio compared to 9.1% in the previous quarter. Given the
underlying mix and quality of the overall portfolio, we expect linked net charge-offs and total provision expense to be
relatively stable in the third quarter of 2016.
Slide 10 gives you a view of our second quarter results versus comparable periods. Second quarter net income,
excluding notable items, increased by $17 million or 1.1% on a year-over-year basis. Higher operating income was
partially offset by higher provision expense. On a linked-quarter basis, net income, excluding notable items, decreased
by $114 million or 8.2%, mainly due to the seasonality in certain fee businesses, partially offset by higher noninterest
expense related to expected increases in compliance costs and marketing expense. The marketing expense represents
our brand advertising.

Turning to slide 11, net interest income increased by $126 million or 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average
earning asset growth was slightly offset by the impact of a one basis point decline in net interest margin to 3.02%. The
modest year-over-year decline in net interest margin primarily reflected the impact of higher short-term rates, offset by
lower reinvestment rates in the securities portfolio.
Net interest income increased by $8 million or 0.3% on a linked-quarter basis. Strong growth in average loans was
offset by a four basis point reduction in net interest margin. The decline in the margin was principally due to the loan
portfolio mix as well as lower average rates on the investment securities portfolio, which is principally due to flatter
yield curves.
Slide 12 highlights noninterest income, which increased $100 million or 4.4% year-over-year, excluding the Visa
Europe sale. The year-over-year increase in noninterest income was primarily due to increases in payments revenue,
trust and investment management fees, mortgage banking fees and commercial product fees, which was mainly due to
increased capital market fees resulting from the recent market volatility.
Credit and debit card fees grew by $30 million, or 11.3%, reflecting higher transaction volumes including acquired
portfolios. Corporate payment products revenue grew 1.7%, reversing a negative growth trend recognized during the
previous year. And this was driven mostly by market share gains resulting from prior-year investments made within our
middle-market, virtual payment and commercial freight platform.
Merchant processing services increased 2.0% year-over-year, or 3%, excluding the impact of current foreign currency
rate changes. Commercial products revenue increased $24 million or 11.2%, driven by higher bond underwriting fees
and other capital market activities as our customers responded to the recent market volatility.
On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income, excluding the Visa Europe sale, increased $223 million or 10.4%,
principally due to seasonally higher fees within our payments, mortgage banking and deposit service charge fee
category. Credit and debit card fees increased $30 million, or 11.3%, and merchant processing fees increased $30
million, or 8.0%, primarily due to seasonally higher transaction volumes.
Commercial product fees increased $41 million, or 21%. Mortgage banking fees increased $51 million, or 27%, which
was in line with our previous guidance of 20% to 30%. Growth in mortgage banking revenues primarily reflected
seasonally higher production volumes. We currently expect linked-quarter mortgage fees to increase 20% to 30% again
in quarter three.
Moving to slide 13, noninterest expense, excluding notable items, increased $160 million or 6% on a year-over-year
basis. Higher compensation expense, mostly due to the impact of merit increases in variable compensation, higher
professional service expense, principally related to compliance activity and higher marketing and business development
expense related to the investment in our brand advertising, were partially offset by lower employee benefit expense.
On a linked-quarter basis noninterest expense, excluding notable items, increased by $93 million, or 3.4%.
Linked-quarter expense growth was driven by higher marketing and business development costs, again reflected of the
investment in brand advertising, higher professional services fees expenses principally due to compliance and an
increase in compensation expense mostly due to merit increases. These increased costs were partially offset by
seasonally lower employee benefits expense.
As Richard mentioned, we expect expenses to grow in the second half of the year, however, at a lower rate of growth
versus a 3.4%, excluding notable items, that we've reported in the second quarter.
Our current expectation is for linked expenses to increase 2.5% to 3% in the third quarter, but let me provide some
additional detail. We anticipate that the FDIC surcharge assessment for larger banks will begin in the third quarter,
which will increase our expenses by approximately $20 million. Additionally, expenses related to our tax credit
business are seasonally higher as we move into the third quarter. These two items account for more than half of the
expected quarterly expense growth.
In the second quarter, preferred dividends totaled $80 million, which compared with $51 million in the first quarter of
2016. The linked-quarter increase is reflected of a recent preferred stock issuance with a semiannual dividend payment

that will repeat again in quarter four.
Turning to slide 14, our capital position remains strong and in the second quarter we returned 77% of our earnings to
shareholders through dividends and share buyback. On June 29, we announced that Federal Reserve did not object to
our capital plan. As a result, we announced the $2.6 billion stock buyback program that commenced on July 1 and
announced an expected increase in our third quarter common dividend of 9.8%. We would expect to remain in our
targeted payout range of 60% to 80% going forward.
Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as of fully implemented at
June 30 was 9.3%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose
to 18.46 at June 30, representing 10% increase over the same quarter of last year and 3% increase over the prior
quarter.
I will now turn the call back to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thanks, Kathy.
I'm proud of our record second quarter results. We maintained our industry-leading performance measures and we
reported an 18.7% return on tangible common equity in the quarter. Our industry continues to face challenges from the
low interest rate environment. However, we remain confident that we'll continue to grow revenue and prudently
manage expenses, while strategically investing in our business to create value for our shareholders.
That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Terry, Bill, and I will now be happy to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John McDonald with Bernstein.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Richard, I was hoping you could provide a little bit of color
on loan growth. What's gotten better and what's given you the confidence to expect the trend to continue? It sounds like
you might expect more of the same. Maybe a little more color there?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Sure, happy to do it and yes, we're expecting more of the same pretty much what we've seen
for the last two quarters. I'll have Andy give a little color on the detail as he oversees all those revenue businesses, but I
will say it continues to be a theme of repetitive quarter-after-quarter while on the Wholesale side, you're seeing
increased capital markets activity that in fact move up and trigger loan repayments and lower line utilization and
M&A-related activity. So on the Wholesale side, we're not – still not seeing the kind of organic growth we would like
to see, but we are pleased as we said in our comments that we have a fully capable capital markets business in order to
take the benefit of what would otherwise be some activities we didn't used to have in the company when customers
moved outside of the lending market and into the capital markets.
On the Consumer side, we're seeing all areas moving slowly but surely and nicely, favorably from autos to RVs to
credit card to home equity and then we particularly have good story to tell in the mortgage business as we continue to
be a bigger player in that area.
So it's a lot of the same, John, but everything has got a generally positive, slightly positive bias but a lot of the
opportunity of the wholesale market is yet to be the kind of organic growth that we all want to see that gets evidenced
in a more healthy and robust economic environment.

Andy, you want to add something to that?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Richard, I'd add in that, that we did see record revenue in our commercial products groups
and you saw that our credit, fixed income or FX and municipal products all were up at record levels, somewhere
between 40% and 50% on a year-over-year basis. And again, that's reflective of the tremendous bond issuance that was
occurring here in the second quarter. We did continue to see strength in auto lending as well as residential mortgages.
Again, [inaudible] (17:45 – 17:52).
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Say the last part again.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: And commercial real estate also grew a bit this quarter also, which is a little bit of a reversal
on the trend.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Great. And maybe Bill could follow-up. You had good credit results this quarter. I
think the outlook was for relatively stable. I'm just wondering if you might need to build some reserves if loan growth
remains healthy here.
<A - P. W. Parker>: We've started that, so we are adding. We're done with the days of releasing and we are adding to
our reserves, so we are mindful of that. As I've said for a quite a period, there is still probably room in the existing
portfolio, specifically residential, home equity, where we do have – we continue to see improvements in home values et
cetera. So that could allow for releases out of those portfolios which does help offset some of the loan growth. We are
in a position where we feel it's prudent to be adding to our overall reserves.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And is this quarter a pretty good indicative pace for now, Bill?
<A - P. W. Parker>: For now.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And in terms of the NPAs and the charge-offs, can you just repeat what your
outlook is there?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yes. It's pretty – it's very stable really across the board. I mean if you look at each of the asset
classes, C&I is surprisingly low, and this quarter we thought we were very – got out ahead of the energy issues in the
first quarter, and this quarter we had no material energy charge-offs. In fact, we had a nice recovery on one of our
credits, so we feel like we've got the energy – with $50 a barrel anyway – that we have energy issue behind us, and if
you look at the other asset classes it's all very stable.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Just to add to that, Bill, I would add, we marked our portfolio at $35 a barrel for the second
quarter, and we have no intention of releasing that reserve for some time, when you're starting to see sustained higher
levels of value on oil, but we do have at 8.8%, we think, sufficient coverage and provision. And that we're quite pleased
with how that portfolio is behaving at this point.

year ago you gave the chin-up bar analogy on rates remain low, you might have to be tougher on expenses. Appreciate

there is some other offsets. But maybe your latest thoughts, long-term expense management efficiency if the rate

environment remains challenging?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes, I appreciate that. So picture the bar still up there, grimacing like crazy. Both the
knuckles are white, but we're hanging in there.
A couple thoughts, Jon. I want to start by saying I'll give you guys the forward-looking view that we intend at this
point, at least for the second half of the year, to stay in the 54% range, 54.0% to 54.9% range in our efficiency ratio.
And I'm giving you that because I don't know exactly with no interest rates, a very flat yield curve – and that can move
– either of them can move at any time, and they seem to be very volatile.
We're not giving up on positive operating leverage, but it's getting a lot harder. And I'd rather just tell you guys that
we're going to stay at the same current level – and we've there for a couple of quarters now – of efficiency because
what I am saying is we already are under a pretty steady and measured expense control program. We've got an FTE
hold in the company that allows for any growth items and areas for compliance. We haven't added those now since
February of last year, and we continue to watch all the noncritical expenses, the discretionary expenses to a point that
we think is right up to the line where it would start to impair our new growth.
And you guys invest in us not just for this quarter or next quarter but for the long-term, and we're going to be very
careful not to overreact. And we have been careful so far not to do that.
So our expenses will go up as we said less than the 3.4% linked quarter. Next quarter will be 2.5% to 3%, and as Kathy
mentioned half of that will be in the FDIC premium costs and in the CDC which typically has higher expenses in the
second half. The rest is just core part of adding people for our portfolios, adding to compliance, and as you said
professional services starts – it did peak this quarter – starts to come down. But I'll tell you it comes down very slowly,
so it's not a big measured improvement, but it is at least a point in fact that this will be our highest quarter I hope on
record.
So that gives you a little more color, and I think at the 54% range that gives us enough room to have some prices during
the quarter but also protect the knowledge for you that we're not going to do something to get to 52%. And I don't see
this thing moving into the 55%s or 56%s.
<Q - Jon Arfstrom>: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe quickly, just an update on the consent order, and once
lifted, what really changes in your mind?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Sure. So the consent order, as you know, precludes us from whole bank transactions,
particularly things with branch banking. And as we go through this consent order, it takes quite some time not only to
get things where they need to be but to sustain and improve that they stay there. And we're in those processes now, so I
have no idea what the exit time will be, but we're working closely with our regulators to make sure that we have
permissions, particularly to be released from any part of the consent order first if that's helpful to us to get back into the
traditional M&A business.
However, I remind you that our M&A in the area of merchant portfolios, credit card portfolios, mortgage business
activities, trust activities, none of those are precluded under that order, and those have been exactly the things we have
in the last five years consistently as part of our M&A. So we haven't been precluded from doing what we've wanted to
do. And as I said before, there hasn't been a bank deal or a branch deal that we've wanted since the Citizens Chicago
deal that we've been precluded from. So our goal is to get out of it as soon as possible so we don't have any barriers on
our options. But for now it's not impairing any of our ability to run the company or find opportunities to acquire.
<Q - Jon Arfstrom>: Okay, great. Thank you.

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Tim Hayes>: Hey, guys. This is actually Tim Hayes for Paul Miller. What is your view for mortgage revenues in
the second half of the year given where interest rates are today? Are you guys seeing any pickup in refis yet? And do
you think that the tailwind to the income from lower rates could offset the detriment to margin?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: This is Andy replying. So our second quarter mix was about 65% new purchases and 35%
refinancing, so I would expect that to go closer to 60:40 in the second quarter. And given that coupled with the normal
seasonality, I would expect mortgage fees to continue to increase in that 20% to 30% range

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning. I wonder if you can give us a little bit more color on the merchant processing
revenue. It looks like it came in a little bit light from where I was looking for this quarter. I just want to see if we can
get some of your updated trends that you're seeing on the merchant side.
And then separately, for the payments business, just overall revenue trends that you can expect here. I know we've seen
a pretty good rebound in that business, but I want to get some color on your outlook. Thanks.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Okay, this is Andy again. Let me start with merchant. You're right, there are a few moving
pieces in merchant I want to explain. So first, one of the principal drivers of merchant fee revenue is same-store sales.
And same-store sales in North America were up just under 2%, 1.8%, and in Europe they were up about 5%, so
globally up about 2.6%. And what you typically see from us is same-store sales plus 1% to 2% is total merchant
revenue growth.
What happened this quarter is, while we were up 2% on a year-over-year basis, if you exclude FX that's up 3%. That is
also now flattening out revenue related to equipment sales. So we were up higher in prior quarters because equipment
sales were going up. They are sort of leveled off. We've lapped that so to speak.
The other thing you'll see is our transaction volume is down, and that was intentional. We exited some low-margin
business, so it did add impact on transaction volume, but as you saw, not a tremendous impact on fee income. So as we
look forward to the next few quarters, I would expect again same-store sales plus 1% to 2% in terms of our fee growth
in merchant volume.
You asked about the other payments business, so let me comment on that. Credit card is very strong. Excluding
Fidelity, we were up about 6%, and that's driven by card transaction volume growth of about 7%, and I would expect
that to continue in the future quarters.
And then finally on corporate payment systems, a very good story there is that we're seeing growth on the corporate
side of the equation. While government is continuing to be flat, our corporate fee income is growing. Transaction
volume, sales volume is up about 6%, and that's a function of the investments we've made in virtual pay and product
activity, which is very positive. So T&E continues to be weak or level or down a bit, but payables and virtual pay is up
strong.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I'll add to that. This is Richard. Just if you're going to bring up a Brexit question, I'll help you
out here. For Brexit, first of all, it's not material and it's pretty neutral to the bank. But if it shows up anywhere, it shows
up in our European businesses, which is merchant acquiring. You may recall, those of you that followed us for a

decade, we started our business, merchant-acquiring business in the UK. That's where it's actually headquartered, so a
disproportionate amount of business is in the UK.
And actually there's a lot of prognosis that believes there will be a lot more travel and visits and spending over in the
UK, which is net positive for us. And given our portfolio mix being heavy on hotels, hoteliers and airlines, that could
be quite positive as well, offsetting any variances that may occur in the rest of the European market through this
disruption. So we're seeing Brexit as fairly neutral to nonmaterial to maybe even a little bit more positive.
As it relates to our employees, we have a few hundred employees that are working in the UK and/or in around Europe
that would either have to have passporting circumstances changed for them because they're either UK employees
working in Europe or European employees working in the UK. Now that's something that we'll learn over the next
couple of years. There's no rush to it and there has been no reaction, and we're not changing any of our strategies as a
result of that.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay, great. Thanks for all that color. That's helpful. And then just separately on the commercial
real estate portfolio, pretty good growth this quarter. And looking actually at the construction piece, I saw a pretty good
jump there. So I wanted to see what you're seeing on the commercial real estate side in terms of where the growth is
coming from. And do you expect any moderation from regulatory scrutiny around CRE trends right now at all? And
then lastly, any credit concerns on that front because we're hearing a little bit of that too. Thanks.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes, I'll go first. I want to go first on this. CRE has got, as you know, for our company, is
one of the areas we want to be particularly conservative in, much as we love it and we're very big in it. And so the
scrutiny is high in the industry. I'm quite comfortable that the scrutiny will not be placed here because we've been
conservative for a decade and we continue to be in our underwriting.
I'll also remind you that commercial real estate has a CMBS market where there is a lot of activity, and our guys are
telling us that the lack of buyers coming particularly from the life insurers has affected the refinance and purchase
activity, which only serves to say that there's a reduced pace of payoffs. So part of the increase is actually good news;
we're keeping the customers we have.
But we're not striving to get new customers at any risk of underwriting or a pricing change. I think the portfolio will
prove itself more over time. Andy and Bill can add a little color about where the growth is and where we see pockets of
strength. But we love this business. We're very good at it, but I promise you we're just not going to get greedy at a time
like this in the marketplace on terms or underwriting because it's easy to do, and it's not going to happen here. So,
Andy, do you mind going first?
<A - P. W. Parker>: No, go ahead.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: To follow up on Richard's point, if you look at our construction loan activity, you see that
that's been increasing fairly consistently over the last five or more quarters. What's changed is that commercial
mortgage or standing loan permanent loan whereas the attrition has declined and actually reversed this quarter, a very
slight increase. That was what Richard was highlighting. I mean, the strength has been – it continues to be on the
coasts, especially the West Coast for us and through a lot of our REIT clients. They've been very active.
<A - P. W. Parker>: And that's what I was going to say. California and Pacific Northwest is where we're seeing the
strongest activity.
<Q - John Pancari>: Great. All right, thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: You're welcome.

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - R. Scott Siefers>: Good morning, everybody. Richard, I was hoping either you or Kathy could expand upon your
comments on the margin from the beginning of the call. First I want to make sure I understood it correctly. I think when
you characterized the down three to four basis points, I think you were talking about the second half, but is that three to
four basis points per quarter in the second half, or in the aggregate for the second half?
And then I guess the broader question there is, at what point would you guess that the margin compression would stop
in this kind of pressured rate environment? Because I guess the two big issues would be securities portfolio
reinvestment risk, and then there is still kind of wide gap between your loan and deposit growth but just curious to hear
your thoughts on both those phenomenon?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Scott. I think – we got to question five before we got to NIM. That's pretty good. I'll
be very clear. What we said was in quarter three, which is all we can see into, we have a three to four basis points
prediction of NIM decrease. I have no idea what quarter four would be.
As we woke up this morning, you know that the call for interest rate increases is 21% for September, 36% for
December. Better than zero, worse than it was when we talked last time, so we're not going to bet on any of that, but to
the extent that any of it comes back would be terrific.
Also, the 10-year is above 150 basis points again, thank God. That's as helpful to us as interest rate increases, and you
know there is an equal impact on the income statement based on that. So if we can manage through these very worst
times, which is continued zero interest rate increases and very, very low 10-year, we can manage through just about
anything, which is how we're building the lower-for-longer kind of term around the company.
So for one quarter, we can see that pressure. We can't predict beyond that. I'll have Kathy talk a little bit more about the
sequencing and the importance of the refinancing that occurs in the securities and the fact that we're actually seeing
stable performance in most margin areas for compression as it relates to competitors.
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yes, so Richard is exactly right. So we're looking out it into the third quarter and we
are down about – we are projecting that we're going to be down in that range of 3 basis points to 4 basis points. But I'm
going to say it's going to be a lot more of what you've seen. So as the rate curve has kind of flattened, although some
signs of improvement here most recently, that's going to continue to have an impact on our securities portfolio, so we'll
see – we'll continue to see a decline in that. And then the rest really, you have to look to our loan growth. To the extent
that we continue to grow, our wholesale loan is a little bit stronger than our retail loan, that's also going to put a little bit
of compression going forward.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: So Scott, let it be said at the end, remind you that net interest income will increase in quarter
three. So we can outrun this in the asset growth, but it's going to be continued more challenging until we get interest
rate increases around that. Okay?
<Q - R. Scott Siefers>: Okay, terrific. Thank you, guys, very much.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks.

have a really good loan-to-deposit ratio. You're still growing deposits, and I see you're able to remix from the

try to remix just more into loans, less into securities, given an understanding that you need to keep LCR? But does

anything structural change with that thought process around just asset liability management?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: No. It doesn't, Ken. And we're nowhere near those lines. I mean, we take what the market
gives us and then make sure that we apply it appropriately to the balance sheet and, therefore, the income statement.
But there is no – we're not near any line where we're evaluating the value of even deposits. We're still collecting
deposits and happy to take them because they'll be more necessary in the future. And we're pricing loans at the right
level to win the high-quality and the securities portfolio was kind of a result of all of that, but it wouldn't be a driver.
It'd be a follower. And there is nothing in our strategy that's going to change at this stage and there is nothing that's
getting us close to the edge where we'd have to sit down and strategize on our balance sheet as it relates to a mix or an
area of an appetite that we haven't already demonstrated.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Understood. And then on the deposit side, I think a lot of banks are starting to still see modest tick
ups on the deposit pricing side. What are you guys just seeing in terms of customer behavior in terms of product
choice? And any cost that you have to hand along, even though we're not really getting it on the left side of the balance
sheet?
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yes. You know, we really haven't seen a whole lot of shift. Really the consumer has
really no rate change, whatsoever, on the consumer. We talked previously that we did have some repricing on our
Wholesale side. Some of that was just contractual that happened. Other is, as we work with our customers, but I'll tell
you it's been relatively stable as we look into this quarter.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Okay, last one, a real quick one. The preferred dividend, Kathy, does it go back to the first quarter
$57 million...
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yes.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: ...in the third quarter?
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: So it's a quarterly payment. So first and third quarter will be at the lower rate. Second
and fourth quarter will be at the higher.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Probably around $60 million, right?
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yes...
<Q - Ken Usdin>: So $50 million?
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: About $50 million. I would say, $60 million in the third quarter. About $80 million in
the fourth quarter.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I'm glad you asked that because that got missed. We either didn't telegraph it well or just got
missed in a lot of the models. And it's real money and it's also real value. So I'm glad to have that clarity. Thanks for

<Q - Mike Mayo>: On the other hand, you do have some accelerating loan growth. I know you talked about loan
growth here. So originally you've mentioned economic growth a couple of years ago, accelerating, improving and then
the 10-year goes down and that's why I brought the comment initially. So if you look at the 10-year, you're really
losing. If you look at your accelerating loan growth, maybe you're winning a little bit more. So I'm just trying to make
sense of – are the markets where you do business improving or not?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Mike, that's a great question. They're improving slowly, but I will tell you what. I wish I'll be
here 10 years from now to prove it, but we are taking market share. Swear to God. Honest engine. We are taking
market share. We have been for years. Think of our home equity portfolio. It's still growing, albeit slightly, but that's
been shrinking across the industry. Auto loans, we've never gotten out of it, so we're still in it big. Leasing, we're now
one of the few players that are really quite capable at it. We've been doubling down on credit cards and, you're seeing,
some of our recent portfolio and partnerships. So it's mostly market share.
There is not a market that's actually weaker than it was a year ago. But for all intents and purposes, there is not a
market much stronger than it was either. And what, I think, really turns on the dial for banks is when Corporate
America is more confident and I don't mean the original old unconfident. We're always uncertain, but things with a
presidential election in the offing. Things like Brexit uncertainties. We don't need any of the things like that to continue
to give Corporate America a reason to just wait.
But for M&A and for restructuring our balance sheet, Corporate America is not organically doing big things, at least
not needing banks in that process. So that's when the thing really starts to take off. But in the meantime, we're all
gutting it out in the trenches, trying to keep more customers and do more with the ones we have. And I just think the
right answer, as much as it's hard to prove, is that we're doing it, in our case, with market share growth.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And so the answer to my question – now that's helpful, but if you strip all that away, do you think
things are improving generally or not, or just the same old?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes, I think I meant to say every market is a little stronger than it was last year. So yes, but
not very much.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Okay, all right. Great, thanks a lot.

Your next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Erica.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could share a little bit of color on the CCAR
results. I was a little bit surprised at how the regional banks fared in terms of their stressed ratios or PPNR assumptions
relative to last year. I'm wondering if there was any color that you could share with your investor base on that. And
also, Richard, I'm wondering if the CCAR results and how acquirers were treated in this year's results at all impact your
thinking about future acquisitions?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Let me just say first of, we were very pleased with our CCAR results. I always joke it's a
stress test and it's effective because we're stressed the whole time. You also be reminded we haven't had the final exit
exams on all of the details and you also know we'll never know exactly how the model works. But I'll remind you that
in this particular cycle, the negative interest rate scenario was added and that's hard for any of us to predict exactly how
that fare for each bank but I know that that had an impact on what was likely the PPNR for every bank. As you know,
we continue to be at the top on the PPNR. Barely in this case, we're slightly below breakeven but in the years past
we've always been above.

And I think on a relative basis, we even performed better. So I'm not concerned about trying to predict that and I think
that the test continues to be effective in helping us all understand whether or not in a most distressed scenario we would
be okay.
Acquirers had more limited capital distribution and so we don't think that's a factor to us because it's not as relevant to
us as it would be to some others but I think as you look at the stress test results and you apply it across different kinds
of companies, it's not unusual to see a different distribution model based on both what we're starting from, what the
stress test would do to us and where we would end.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: So essentially, it doesn't impact how you're thinking about understanding that you have a
consent order in place but it doesn't impact your thinking about how to manage capital for future acquisition?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: No. I mean, emphatically, no. In fact, it doesn't have any impact on it at all. What we want to
do is we want to continue to understand the best methodologies that they use in stress testing the loan portfolio so we
can better understand what mechanics are in there so we can predict those better than we have in the past, but we also
continue to outperform on the PPNR as it relates to their satisfaction in the model with how much money we'll make.
So it works both ways. But every year we get smarter, every year we go back and do our best to evaluate it. And as I
said, we're a little bit early on getting any formal feedback which we'll be getting in the next couple of weeks between
this and the next time we talk.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. And just as a follow-up question, I really appreciate the color on how to think about
payments revenues as we think about forecasting. Could you give us a sense of how much of your payments revenues
are generated in pounds so we can think about translation risk?
<A - P. W. Parker>: The translation risk is rather limited. So if you think about every 1% change is about $1 million.
It's not a big number, Erika.

Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Vivek.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Hi, a couple of follow-ups. Firstly on CCAR, your current costs are at the high end compared to a
lot of peers. Can you comment on your thoughts on the results that are showing up there?
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yes, and I think really where you see that is particularly within our wholesale
portfolio, and that's been something we've been working on for quite a few years. I think we have tended to be on the
higher side or the Fed has been a little bit on the higher side. We don't have a whole lot of input into or insight into
what some of their modeling routines are. As you know, it's relatively a black box. But perhaps, we're thinking perhaps
that if you think about where our utilization rates and so forth that could have a play, we're relatively low on our
utilization side. But we are actually, as you noticed, we project a lot lower risk in a downturn environment than the Fed,
and we're just going to continue the share to work through that and try and figure out where the differences lie.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: So, Vivek, this is a point of frustration for me because in the first couple years, I was really
worried if we were different than them, how big a deal could that be? I will say that history is probably now a better
dictate than testing itself. And if you look in the last seven years, which is the exact timeframe that we've had the stress
test, our commercial portfolio has outperformed most everybody and done very, very well. And so I'm not challenging
the test. I'm just challenging that we're never going to figure out what they put in.

Kathy gave you a hint. We think our commitments have been growing faster than anybody's, well in addition to our
loan growth. And I think if they take a model where all the commitments go to 100% and they go to charge-off, that
could be it. We have a big government portfolio in our corporate business which if they take a 90-day late pay and take
the whole portfolio to charge-off, maybe that could be it. And as simple as it sounds, we'll never get the answer even to
those questions I just offered. But what we will do is continue to watch our own performance, as you should, measure
the dictate on how well we've actually done in charge-offs and non-performs over the course of time, and we'll just do
our best to get closer on that test. But we don't understand exactly ourselves how it tests like it does when the results
themselves don't show that way.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay, thanks. One more, capital markets you've grown very strongly, Richard. As you continue
to do that, does that shift what you're thinking in terms of – because that's been one of the strongest fee growth drivers
this quarter and you're trying to grow underwriting. Does that shift what you are thinking from a capital standpoint,
especially when you look at peers, et cetera?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Vivek, I would say it doesn't shift. It's a function of what's occurring in the market. We've
had traditionally two strong growth areas in fees, trust, and our payments group and it's great to have this third area
come in, and we're taking what the market gives us. And given this low rate environment and the volatility, things like
credit, fixed income, FX are very strong as well as derivatives. So it's great that we have these businesses which in fact
10 years ago we didn't have, so it's a positive add to the fee businesses that we have.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Right. But given that it's a higher volatility business, would that not mean that as you think about
economic capital, but when you've talked about 8% or 8.5% in the past that that starts to migrate slightly upwards?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: No, I wouldn't expect that to have any impact in our capital ratio at all.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay, thanks.

Your next question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you, good morning. Hi. Richard, I had a question on your P2P money transfer product.
How are you thinking about the potential disintermediation risk that clearXchange could pose to the revenues that you
generate on the card-issuing side of your business, or are there any restrictions that you could put in place to prevent
potential disintermediation?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good question, Bill. First of all, we are clearXchange, so we're going to be on either side of
that transaction. What I'll tell you is the same answer I gave three years ago with Square when Square started coming
out big with Starbucks. And at least for now, not for the long-term, but for now, most of these transactions are taking
cash out of the system, not other card debit or credit transactions. There's still so much cash in our system, in our
society, there's plenty of disintermediation of cash long before it starts to tap up against the other card businesses. And
that's what we're all planning for in the near term, and that could be a couple of years.
But beyond that period of time, we all have to be very thoughtful, and your question is right on the money as it relates
to what's the evolving relationship between real-time pay-to-pay, card, card-not-present, and the mobility of people
moving the money about in a different environment. Remember we're still under a Federal Reserve circumstance that
settles overnight and not over the weekend. So there's still a big disconnect and we have those things to fix systemically
before we get to a real real-time payment. But for now, the disintermediation is mostly seen on cash, and that's a net
positive for us and the other banks because we have no benefit in cash moving about for the most part. We do when it
starts to monetize itself in the form of a payment.

<Q - Bill Carcache>: Right. But maybe just as a follow-up, I guess the nature of that product is really for
clearXchange for P2P money transfer between individuals, not necessarily to conduct a payment transaction. But I
guess to the extent that you were and given your position as both acquirer and issuer, you would be in a very good
position to see the extent to which people were using the product to actually conduct payment transactions in lieu of a
USB credit card. And if that were the case, is that something that you would expect to be monitoring and react to as
appropriate to the extent that that were having a revenue impact?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: I think the principal – this is Andy. I think the principal activity today, as Richard
mentioned, is cash and it's also check individual to individual. I think the second category that will occur is for people
to pay bills. And the bill payment again is going to be a replacement for check and/or online checking, so it is bill pay,
so to speak. So in the interim or in the immediate timeframe, I don't think there's any negative at all, and we'll continue
to monitor, as Richard said, over the long term. I think the other thing to consider is how this migrates to the wholesale
side of the equation and the business, and that's also something we're very aware of.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: So think about it, this is P2P. Then there's P2B, people are paying their bills, and there's B2P
where people are trying to – businesses are reaching out to you and giving you reason to buy things and send money
back. And then there is B2B which we're all working on including blockchain. Then we're working on all those
alternatives. Most of those are still nascent. I think as a banking category, those are just all upside for us because there's
so much opportunity and much less disintermediation.
But you're on to something, Bill, and there will be a time – right now, babysitters you go home and you pay them cash
or you write them a check. Now you're going to start doing it in real time between you and the 17-year-old and the
money moves. We're disintermediating something that's right now not a debit or credit card, but over time this is
something that we have to put the whole universe together and figure it out.
And I've said this before, I'll say it again, the banks as a collaborative are working better together than we ever to make
sure we work together and create a better circumstance for all of our clients, and I think that's a big plus in the last
couple of years as we've seen payments emerge as a real-time issue.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: That's great color. Thanks, gentlemen.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes. Thanks.

Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Thank you very much. Good morning. In regards to your commentary around the Brexit and
the overall positive commentary around it, could you dig in a little bit on the impact of the Brexit in regards to your
payments business in particular?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes. In fact, that's generally where it's going to be, because we've got the merchant-acquiring
activity, which we've talked about a little bit here before. So I think we'll make – we'll call it neutral for now based on
what we can see, Kevin. Just because we have such a U.K. influence, I think there is a positive in UK and for UK, and
there's probably a slight negative inter-Continental Europe. But we're going to say that to be net to favorably positive
on the payments side. Terry, you've got the trust side. You know a lot of employees on the Brexit impact there. You
might talk about that.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yes, in our corporate trust business, which is that we have in Europe, at least recently we've
seen just a little bit of a tick down with respect to deals that are being done as people kind of pause during that
timeframe. But the impact that it's had on the long rate of the curve, so the 10-year, actually is probably going to
stimulate the deal flow in terms of debt issuances, so the overall net impact of that over the next quarter or two I would
actually anticipate would probably be positive.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes, deals aren't getting lost, they're just being doubled and then new ones might...

<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yes. In Europe, they're being deferred, but in the United States the yield curve impact is
actually stimulating some growth.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Is that helpful, Kevin?
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Yes, that's very helpful. And then in regards to your marketing-end spend and the professional
services spend, obviously that can be volatile quarter-to-quarter depending on the business conditions and what you're
planning for the future. But given the uptake you've seen there, would you expect that to decline over the next few
quarters just because of the spend we saw on the second quarter?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good question. In my 54% range of efficiency, we're holding steady to finish what we
started this year on our marketing and branding campaign because there is a lot of value in stability and sustainability
messaging. As you know, people have to hear things seven times to remember them once, so we're not going to give up
on that.
And then the cost of third-party assistance on compliance as I said starts to dig down slowly, so those are both
sustainable for the rest of this year. But trust me, everything we can control continues to be in our gun sights. And
marketing is one of those things that if it has to go, it has to go, but I'd love very much to not cut it off just a bit too
soon if in fact we're on the advent of some times here what we can afford to do, what we want to do and grow the
company greatly.

Your next question is from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning, Nancy.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning, Richard. How are you?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: How are you?
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good, thank you. I have a question that sort of encompasses a number of these interest rate
questions that have been asked before. If you looked at the JPMorgan Chase results yesterday, there is nothing in those
results that says recession. If you look at your results, there is nothing that says recession. I'm about to go on the Wells
Fargo call. I assume there is nothing there that says recession. But the talk is about recession. And when you listen to
Janet Yellen speak, it's about global softness, and – I mean there is just a massive disconnect now between what we're
seeing at the micro level in the banks and what the experts are talking about at the macro level. Can you help me
reconcile this before I bang my head into the wall?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: First of all, I'm going to join you more than not because I agree with you, but I will tell you
we are what we see. And I'm going to say two things that that is, it has a different lens on this – they're looking at
different things, they're looking usually later than we are. But on a real-time basis which we live in every day, we are
seeing a slow recovery, and it's a small nuance on a word but a recession says things are going backwards or people are
starting to feel worse and not taking actions that they might otherwise have taken before. We are not seeing that.
On the other hand, because we're balance sheet companies and because we're highly levered and because half of what
we do is in the wholesale business, we're all I think spending a lot of energy talking about how we're waiting for the
wholesale side of the balance sheet to pick up in a real, organic, old fashioned way, and we're also not seeing that. But
they're not going backwards, they're just taking this long, long, long period of time to restructure, evaluate their best
options when things do pick up and there is nothing wrong with that but that's where we all have these unused
commitments and continue to grow the balance sheet.

On the business side they've got reasons and they're informed and they're waiting. But on the consumer side, it's a little
bit better every quarter and it's not a recession and I would disagree if someone is saying that at the Fed level and in
fact, I think you can see consumers are starting to spend again. Their savings is at a level that they're comfortable.
They're using their credit cards and they're paying them back on time and getting rewards for it. But I would say it's
actually make sense to me, but for the words recession being bantered about lately by a lot of parties, we don't see it.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. Secondly, I have a question related to the consent order. You mentioned that it
prevents you from doing branch acquisitions basically branch institutions. Does it also prevent you from opening any
new loan production offices? Is that something you're thinking about? And which markets do you need – are there any
markets that you need to be in that you're not in right now?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good question, the answer is no. It doesn't impair our ability to open loan production
markets. And the answer is we don't have any new markets to get into but I've never had the chance to show you guys
just how many markets we are in out of our footprint. So 25-state footprint where you see us on the street and you
drive-by us every day. And the other 25 states for the most part, for commercial real estate, corporate trust,
middle-market and large corporate we're in all of those states. We just really have never taken the time to show you
that. So I'll make this a note to do that at the Investor Day in September 15 to make sure we show you where all of our
loan production offices are outside of what would be the footprint, because when I show you you'll see we're
everywhere we want to be and so the answer to the expansion is no because we're already there.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes.

Your final question comes from Terry McEvoy with Stephens.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Terry.
<Q - Terry J. McEvoy>: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Trust and investment management fees look to be up
6% or 7% if I just phase off the trailing four quarter average. In the release talk about, account growth, could you give a
little bit more color about that business in 2Q as well as maybe the outlook for the back half of the year?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: So if you end up looking at the second quarter or you look at the first half first, the first
quarter was a little bit slower simply because of the markets, but in the second quarter with the markets starting to
recover, we are starting to see a nice growth again with respect to new accounts both on the corporate institutional side
as well as within Wealth Management itself. So when we end up looking into the second half of the year, we would
anticipate that that sort of growth would continue just given the rebound for example in the markets and where they're
at today.
<Q - Terry J. McEvoy>: And then just a quick question for Kathy. Could you run through your mortgage banking
outlook for Q3? And then just so I'm clear, does that include your best guess on hedging, gains, losses and MSR
changes and fair value?
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yes. So for mortgage fees we are anticipating that will have a linked-quarter increase
of about 20% to 30%. That does include all of our assumptions around hedging and so forth so that's all in. As Andy
indicated earlier, I do think that we're going to see a little bit of a shift between – in our application base from purchase
– between the purchase and refi. As he indicated, we're kind of 65%/35% this quarter. I think that that's likely to go
more towards the 60% purchase, 40% refi as we move forward.
<Q - Terry J. McEvoy>: Perfect, thanks so much.
