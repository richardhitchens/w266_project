MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Caterpillar First Quarter 2013 Earnings Results Conference
Call. [Operator Instructions]
It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.
Michael DeWalt
Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's
Corporate Controller. On the call today I'm pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman; and Group
President and CFO, Brad Halverson.

posting it in the Investor section of our caterpillar.com website and it will be in the section labeled Results Webcast.
Now this morning we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risk, uncertainties and assumptions
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking information. A discussion of some of
the factors that individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be
found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, that's Risk Factors, of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on
February 19th of this year and also in the forward-looking statements language contained in today's release. In addition,
there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures and it can be found in our financial release which is also being posted
on our Caterpillar.com website.

Okay. Before we start this morning, the Q&A, I'll begin by covering three topics. The first will be a summary of our
first quarter results. Then I'll take a few minutes to discuss the outlook for 2013 and then the third topic will be our
announcement this morning that we'll be repurchasing stock in the second quarter. So let's start with results.
Without a doubt it was a challenging first quarter. When we started 2013, we expected it would be a tough quarter and
that's why we had a specific section in our yearend financial release that addressed the quarter. At that time we
suggested that sales and revenues would be down more than $2 billion in the first quarter and that's what's happened.
Sales and revenues were $13.2 billion and that's a $2.8 billion or about a 17% decline from sales and revenues of $16
billion in the first quarter of 2012.
Profit was $1.31 a share, $1.06 lower than $2.37 per share from the first quarter of 2012. In terms of the sales, the
majority of the year-over-year decline was a result of dealer inventory changes. Last year in the first quarter, dealers
bought more machines from Caterpillar than they sold and, as a result, their new machine inventories rose about $875
million.
In the first quarter of 2013, it was the reverse. Dealers bought less from us than they sold to their customers, and their
inventories of new machines declined about $700 million versus year-end 2012. In combination, the impact of the
changes in dealer machine inventories was negative by almost $1.6 billion quarter-over-quarter.
In addition to dealer machine inventory, dealers also have engine inventories. And while the amount is much less than
for machines and, as a result, we don't usually discuss it, there was some negative impact in the quarter from dealer
inventory changes for engines.
When we started the year and in our yearend financial release, we expected dealer inventory changes would be a
substantial negative in the quarter, and they were. Now in addition to the dealer inventory impact, end user demand was
also lower for both machines and for Power Systems.
Sales of after-market parts were also down, versus the first quarter of 2012. Parts sales were relatively high during the
first half of last year, trended down during the second half of 2012, but have started to move up now in the first quarter
of 2013.
For part sales though, compared with the first quarter of 2012, almost all the decline we saw was in North America
where coal mining has been down, and we've had some tailing off of part sales for on-highway trucks. And we had two
fewer work days than in the first quarter of 2012.
From a price realization perspective overall, the first quarter was about 1% for the company. That's about what we
expected and consistent with our outlook for the full year. So that's a summary of sales.
Let's turn to profit. The decline in profit was largely a result of the drop in sales, plus a $317 million of higher
manufacturing costs, almost all of which was the result of cost absorption impacts related to lower production and
inventory changes.
Inventory, and by this I'm talking about Caterpillar inventory, not dealer inventory, increased about $2 billion in the
first quarter of 2012 and came down about $0.5 billion dollars in the first quarter of 2013, again, that's compared with
year-end.
A portion of our cost of goods sold is relatively fixed in the short term, as a result significant changes in production and
inventory does have an impact on profit. In this case, it was negative year-over-year roughly $300 million. Now on
profit, there were other pluses and minuses, but sales volume and cost absorption were the main operating points in the
quarter.
Below operating profit, we also had a favorable tax item. But while favorable, it wasn't a surprise. In our year-end
financial release, we said we expected a favorable tax item related to changes in U.S. tax law that were enacted in
January of 2013 but related to 2012. And in our January conference call, we said it would be in the first quarter. It was;
it was $87 million.

Okay. That's a quick review on sales and profit. Let me change gears for a moment and talk a little bit about China.
Sales in China, while not a significant portion of our total, has been a concern by many of you over the past year.
There's been quite a bit of focus, in particular, on construction equipment sales in China. And from an end user
standpoint, our dealers reported deliveries in January and February that were below the same months in 2012.
March, on the other hand, was better, with dealer deliveries of construction equipment about the same as March of
2012. And while that's a move in the right direction and we're encouraged by it, it's probably still a little too soon to call
it a trend that will continue. We'll wait and see how the rest of the year shapes up.
On a more positive note, though, about China, our sales – this is Caterpillar sales, not dealer sales, were up in the
quarter. All-in, including machines, Power Systems and parts, we were higher than the first quarter of 2012. Inventory
in China, and this is both Caterpillar inventory and finished machines, and dealer machine inventory, has also been
pretty topical over the past year. I'm pleased to report this morning that we, along with our dealers, have made quite
significant progress in lowering inventory.
Dealer machine inventories declined throughout 2012, and are currently at reasonable levels relative to sales. In terms
of our inventory, that's Caterpillar finished inventory in China, as expected, it declined during the first quarter. While
inventory reduction is expected to continue into the second quarter, we do expect to begin increasing production in
China during Q2. All right, that's a quick update on China.
Two final points on the quarter, that's order backlog and cash flow. For the first time since the first quarter of 2012, our
order backlog increased from the prior quarter end. At the end of the first quarter of 2013, our backlog was $20.4
billion, and that's up from about $20.2 billion at year end 2002. The increase in Power Systems and Construction
backlog more than offset declines for Resource Industries, which is mostly mining.
For cash flow, our Machinery and Power Systems operating cash flow was about $900 million better than the first
quarter of 2012, and that's despite lower profit. Cash flow improved despite lower profit, and the changes in inventory
had quite a lot to do with it.
We began reducing inventory in the fourth quarter of 2012. It came down about $2 billion. And it continued with
another $0.5 billion reduction in the first quarter of 2013. We lowered production schedules, we've had rolling plant
shutdowns at a number of facilities during the fourth quarter, and continued that in many facilities in the first quarter of
2013.
While we do anticipate some additional inventory reduction in 2013, we are expecting to increase production levels in
the second quarter. Okay. That's the first quarter. Let's move onto the outlook.
From an economic standpoint, our view of the world in 2013 hasn't really changed much. In our previous outlook, and
this is the one that we provided with our yearend financial release back in January, we were expecting world economic
growth of about 2.5%, a small improvement from 2012. Our expectations for the year haven't changed much, and we're
still expecting world economic growth of about 2.5%. Again, that's a little better than 2012, but from a historical
standpoint, pretty weak.
While our economic expectations haven't changed much, our outlook for sales and profit have come down. We now
expect sales and revenues in a range of $57 billion to $61 billion, with profit of about $7 a share at the middle of that
sales and revenues range. Our previous outlook was sales and revenues in the range of $60 billion to $68 billion in
profit in the range of $7.00 to $9.00 a share.
Mining is a primary reason for the decline in the outlook. Previously, we'd expected that after depressed order levels for
mining during the second half of 2012, that we'd begin to see some improvement as 2013 unfolded. Unfortunately, that
hasn't happened. Overall, mining orders have remained depressed. As a result, we've significantly reduced our
expectations for mining sales in 2013.
We expect sales of traditional mining machines, now this would be large trucks, large loaders, large bulldozers, and the
like, in the aggregate, to be down about 50% from 2012, and mining machines from our Bucyrus acquisition to be
down about 15%. Because of the decline in the outlook is largely mining, and that's generally more profitable than

Construction and Power Systems, the impact on the outlook is not just sales volume. It's been also negative to product
mix.
However, cost flexibility and accountability are key elements of our strategy, and we're aggressively reducing cost to
mitigate the impact of lower sales. As a result, our profit outlook is $7 a share at the middle of the sales and revenues
range.
In addition to cost reduction, we've lowered our forecast for 2013 capital expenditures and now expect it to be less than
$3 billion for the year. The lower spending on CapEx is a good lead into the final discussion point today before we
move on to the Q&A portion of the call, and that's cash deployment.
Our priorities for cash deployment haven't changed. Our first priority is maintaining a strong balance sheet and our
Machinery and Power Systems debt-to-capital ratio in the band from 30% to 45%. After that we fund growth; organic
growth and acquisitions that fit our business model. Next is appropriate funding of employee benefit plans, funding our
dividend and increasing it over the business cycle, and when those cash needs are met, share repurchase.
We announced this morning that we are repurchasing about $1 billion of Caterpillar stock. We believe it's an opportune
time to do it. We have a strong balance sheet, cash flow is improving, CapEx needs are lower, and we think the stock
price is attractive.
So with that, let's move to the question-and-answer portion of the conference call.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation then post
your question.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: Hi. Good morning. Credit Suisse. First question on mining and then second on share
repurchase. On the mining side you're assuming – just why – your core mining down 50% and BUCY only down 15%.
And then, I guess assuming a sort of down 50% mining this year, how do you put that into context versus sort of
normalized levels doing forward? Because obviously everyone's trying to figure out what 2014 could potentially be.
And then I guess, Doug, my question to you on sort of the change in thought process behind sort of share repurchase.
Before that didn't seem like a focus for you. And is -how do we think about normalized CapEx? And then do you
assume any share repo in your guidance? Thanks.
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Okay, Jamie, I'll tell you what, I'll start with the first part of that, and I'll let Doug do the
second part.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: Great.
<A - Michael DeWalt>: The first part on mining, I just want to clarify, we're not looking for our total mining sales to
be down 50%. Aftermarket is going to be, certainly in our outlook, a lot closer to flat. The Bucyrus piece of it is down
about 15%. So in the aggregate, it's not down 50%, it's just the new machines, big trucks, loaders, bulldozers and the
like.
In terms of what's normal, man, as I look back over the last few years in mining, it's a little tough to decide actually
what's normal. I think this year is a year where our sales are certainly being impacted by dealer inventory reductions.
Last year in addition to the end user demand dealers built some inventory in mining. So that's a factor in – certainly in
2013 as kind of – as well as the demand level from customers.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: No. I know, Mike, but just to clear – I didn't phrase the question right. I understand that it was
more new machines down 50%, and I assumed aftermarket would be better. But why is BUCY only down 15%? You
know what I mean, I would assume...

<A - Michael DeWalt>: Yeah, well, yeah, I think if you look at – if you look the traditional Cat machines, you do have
a dealer inventory impact that you don't really see with the Bucyrus machines. So – and I think the Bucyrus machines
are more specific. I mean they're not – they order them in smaller quantities and more specific to products individually
that are maybe being retired in a mine. Historically this has been the case. We saw this – when we looked to acquire
Bucyrus, we saw that even in the 2009 downturn, the decline in that type of product was less than we saw in trucks and
bulldozers and such.
I do want to get back to one other point that you made, too. And that's on 2014. And I'm sure we'll over the course of
the next couple of months get a lot of questions about, well, what does this mean for 2014? And that's a really hard
question to answer at this juncture. I mean, certainly, we don't have an outlook for 2014, so we're not going go out with
new assumptions about that or assumptions about that today. And what I would caution everybody to think about just a
little bit is, if we go back a year ago and we put ourselves in April of 2012, whatever predictions we made a year ago
about 2013, the market has certainly changed since then. It may change between now and the end of the year. It may
not. It's just too soon, I think, to make a call on 2014.
Other than just a couple points that, in fact, we made this in our release today; dealer inventory changes are impacting
this year's sales. So the real end-user demand level is not quite as bad as is our production and sales level, and once you
kind of get through that, it stops being a drag. And then secondly, commodity demand overall has held up reasonably
well. And our machines are being used in the field. Most of what we sell is for replacements. And at some point here
that's going to have to perk back up. So sorry I can't be more specific on 2014. With the record the second question, on
share buyback, I'll turn it over actually to Brad.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: Okay.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Well, that's a good question and the fact is that our priorities, as Mike just talked about,
have not changed. We think stock repurchase is an important way to reward shareholders and we've done it in the past
and that's been part of our – of the things that we look at. So the question is why now. And our balance sheet is very
strong. We think with the drop in stock price recently and where our PE is, the fact that we believe we have a slow
growing economy but one that's stable. If you look at our debt-to-cap in the mid-30%s, we've got enterprise cash of
around $6 billion and a pretty strong net debt-to-cap. We had a good cash flow quarter. We have plans for a good cash
flow year and we think, again, this is an opportunistic time here in the short term to reward our shareholders with $1
billion stock buyback.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: But, Brad, is anything assumed in the guide?
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Say again?
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: What do you – do you assume in the guide levels, do you assume the $1 billion in share
repurchase? Is that in the guidance or not?
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Yes, it is.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Yes, it is..
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: It is. Okay.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: $0.06 or $0.07 a share, something like that.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: I would just add a couple of footnotes on this, Jamie. Doug here. We have been
intensely focused on investing in the company the last four and a half, five years since the recession. But the thing that's
probably been the overriding objective is to get our – to make our balance sheet rock solid, impenetrable. And the first
quarter we saw – in the fourth of last year we – the inventory reduction really came through to levels that we were
expecting, that we wanted, that we liked. The organization has responded in cost control. The first quarter cash flow
was outstanding. That all coupled with, again, a debt to equity – debt-to-cap ratio of upper 30%s and if you factor in the

cash, it's below 30%. We contrast that back to the middle of 2008 or this time in 2008, we were much more fragile on
the balance sheet.
Coupled with, as Brad said, the multiple, it's an attractive use of our cash right now. And it's really that simple and I
think makes a lot of sense. And frankly, should seem to signal about how we look at 2013 and the longer term, because
I know we have a lot of questions around mining and where is all that going and I still firmly believe long-term, and
long-term being the next generation of management and beyond, we'll view our moves into mining and what we've
done the last few years as really changing our company for the better. We are used to cycles here. No question about it.
Steve Wunning and that Resource Industries Group right now is doing everything in their command to structure that
business for the cycle. They have OPACC targets that they are exceeding and I'm confident, no matter what the cycle,
we're going to like that business. It's just right now, it's down from where it was and it will come back, particularly if
worldwide growth even as slow as it is, at 3% over time, and the growing construction industries around the world,
they're going to require what comes out of the earth. So, we're definitely in a down cycle right now, but long term it's a
great business for us. Probably more than you wanted to hear, but I wanted to throw that in, Jamie.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: No, that's great. Thank you.
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Okay. Let's move on to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Volkmann. Please announce your affiliation then pose
your question.
<Q - Stephen E. Volkmann>: Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. It's Jefferies.
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Good morning.
<Q - Stephen E. Volkmann>: Mike, a couple quick ones, Mike, just to follow up on your inventory comment. You
said that inventory reduction would probably continue into the second quarter. Just order of magnitude there, if you
might have it. And I'm curious if you break that out between mining and the construction businesses. And then I have a
quick follow-up for Doug.
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Okay. Actually, I'm going to go slightly beyond what you just asked. I want – frequently
when we talk about inventory, sometimes there's – If you're not careful you can get some confusion between company
inventory and dealer inventory. So I really want to address both.
From a dealer inventory standpoint, our projections have it coming down again in the second quarter. And historically,
that is – it didn't happen last year but historically, that's the usual pattern. Dealers normally build inventory in the first
quarter and it comes down in the selling season when sales to end users are a lot higher in the second quarter. I think
our view is that that's, at least the selling down part of it in the second quarter in the selling season and it's likely to
happen. I won't put an order of magnitude on it but I think to a large degree it depends upon what happens to end user
demand.
But it's probably more than a couple of hundred million, otherwise we wouldn't have mentioned it; so, a reasonable
decline. And I think probably in the second quarter, it will be split between mining and construction. It's a big selling
season for construction plus we have this sort of march down of dealer inventory in mining that to some degree will
probably occur throughout much of 2013. For Cat inventory, we do expect a little bit more decline for the year. You
know we would not expect to do three more quarters of $0.5 billion a quarter. So over the course of the rest of the year
we would see reduction but a little bit lower than the pace we had in the first quarter.
<Q - Stephen E. Volkmann>: Okay, great. And then if I could, Doug, when we were out visiting in December –
correct me if I've put the wrong words in your mouth – but I think you had mentioned that you were willing to run with
a little higher expense than you might otherwise, because you did believe that things were going to recover fairly soon

and you didn't want to kind of cut into muscle and not be able to take advantage of any upturn that might come. And I
think you sort of said that you would reevaluate that as we got through the spring. And I'm curious now whether you
think there is more you need to do on the cost side, whether you might have changed that view, or whether you still
think that that's the right stance here.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Yeah, sure, Steve. I'd say the answer is split. In the case of construction, we are
seeing an uptick. We have been watching relatively flat but slightly increasing sales to users for a number of months.
We saw that in March. Saw it in the first quarter. You saw the backlog number. So, we have been reluctant to the bone
in construction and have not. Now we've got a number of restructurings occurring around the world in that, but it's
unrelated to volume. It's related to structural cost, I'm talking about Europe. In mining, yes, we are doing absolutely
everything required to get the cost structure in line with where we are in the cycle. And the resource industry's mining
guys, people have done a great job on that so far.
Where are we on all of that? Hard to say, but certainly the number of temporary layoffs we have, both in production
and office staff around the world are of the temporary nature. We've had a few announcements of something more
permanent fairly on the miner's side. Basically we will go as far as we need to go to generate the OPACC targets we
want and to deliver kind of the goals we've stated. So, far it's a pretty mixed bag though, Steve. I can give you a nice
ambiguous answer, because that's exactly the way we're operating, mining deep, construction industry is growing.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Yeah, I might add one comment. This is Brad. When we look at 2013 for the full year,
we had strong confidence in our ability to execute. And if you look at the pull through kind of on a decremental rate for
the year, it's around 25%. And it's around 25% in spite the that fact we have two decent headwinds, and that's the
mining mix in terms of where the sales are coming out of, as well as the period cost absorbs the impact that Mike has
talked about. So our plans, our trough plans, the flexible workforce, the things we're doing to control cost here, have
put less pressure on things like R&D and capital than would have been in the past. So we're comfortable with the year.
<Q - Stephen E. Volkmann>: Thanks, guys.
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Hey, thanks, Steve. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joel Tiss. Please announce your affiliation then pose your
question.
<Q - Joel G. Tiss>: Hi. Bank of Montreal, and just two things. One, can you give us an idea by the end of 2013 how
big mining is going be as a percent of total company revenues and operating profits, just so we can start to – as mining
shrinks faster than the company, it becomes less and less of a factor driving the whole company. So I just wanted to get
a sense of where we are.
<A - Michael DeWalt>: I think as a percent it will be down a little bit from last year. I mean if you – I don't have a
percent to give you Joel, but if you look at our results from last year, essentially almost all of the decline in year over
year sales are out of mining, so rather Resource Industries. Not quite 100%, but almost. So if you can calculate at least
the sales numbers presuming that most – all of the year-over-year decline is in resource. I think in terms of profit,
Resource Industries is still a very good margin segment and as Brad said we're – and Doug both, we're doing a lot of
work on getting cost out of Resource Industries. So that would mitigate some of the impact of the decline from sales.
Hope that helps some.
<Q - Joel G. Tiss>: Okay. And then your free cash flow expectation for all of 2013, roughly?
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Yeah, I mean, we don't actually go out with a forecast of cash flow that we talked about
externally. Suffice to say that inventory was a drag from last year. This year it should be a help. So that's quite a
turnaround, I think, in cash flow from inventory being a contributor rather than a user. And then in terms of free cash
flow, our CapEx requirements are likely to be down as well year-over-year, sort of $400 million or $500 million.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Casey. Please announce your affiliation then pose your
question.
<Q - Andrew M. Casey>: Wells Fargo Securities. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Good morning, Andy.
<Q - Andrew M. Casey>: Just wanted to make sure I understood the broader implications of the guidance change,
specifically the 13% reduction to earnings outlook, after not much change in the sequential backlog or the global
economic outlook. With respect to your mining views, clearly, you made some changes, but what I wanted to ask was
related to the customers. Does this suggest that current global capacity is sufficient to support their demand levels, or
do you think this is really a reset related to some of the management transition that's going on at your customers?
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Yeah, I think, Andy, I think to some degree it's probably both. There's been quite a bit of
management change with some of our big customers. And I think it's clear they are – the new management is much
more focused on operating costs, short-term cash flow, and sweating their assets a bit. And that's kind of stacked up
against the last few years, where they were very focused on growth, a lot of new mine work. So I think it's just
probably both management and the fact that they've actually bought quite a bit of equipment over the last couple of
years.
So I think it's both. I think if you look at our sales, you also have to throw in dealer inventory. We actually produced
more last year than customers bought. Customers will buy more this year than we'll produce, just the opposite. So
between those two, sort of an extra negative on us that our customers aren't seeing. If you look at our thinking around
aftermarket for the full year, part sales, that's a decent proxy at least in our world for production kind of levels with
customers and how they're behaving.
And our view is that with the exception again of U.S. coal mining, that part sales in that mining kind of business will be
pretty flat. So, that says that customers are using the equipment that's out there and they're repairing the equipment
that's out there. It's not a great economic climate but it's good enough to keep commodity production going.
<Q - Andrew M. Casey>: Okay. Thanks, Mike. And just one follow-up on that, is based on what you are seeing on the
customer CapEx trends, has this happened for a while or is this more similar to something we've got to go back 20
years, 30 years to see?
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Well it's – I've not seeing it quite like this in my time. I don't know and I'm one of the oldest
guys sitting around this table. Actually Doug's a couple years older than me. In my time, I've not seen this. I mean, the
reduction in the purchase of new equipment is substantially more than certainly the decline in commodity consumption
would suggest. So that's again making it pretty tough on us. We'll be at the point this year, if you look at our – let's take
mining production as an example. We've taken the forecast down to a point where we're likely to be for large mining
trucks only a couple hundred above 2009 which was a terrible year for the world economy. A big down year, financial
crisis, kind of freeze up in a lot of markets. So it's pretty dramatic what we're seeing right now.

<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: I would add to that a little bit more broadly, and that is just addressing cycles. And I
have been here longest in this room, anyway, and I've seen cycles from Argentina to Alberta to the great crash of 2009.
And the one thing, I guess, if there is any silver lining in it since 2001 really is this is the – well, 1997, probably the
fourth or fifth major cycle for this company. And I'd like to think as kind as negative, as perverse as it is, we're getting
pretty good at it. And while I don't like a three-year cycle, that is from 2009 to 2012 or 2008 to 2012, I guess, three,
four years, if that's what we're living with, we're going to learn how to manage it. And the Resource Industries group
led by Steve Wunning and his crew right now are doing everything they know what to do to size that for the cycle, and
we will take that right on through any other of the businesses we have as well. And that's very hard on our people; it's
very hard on our shareholders; it's hard on everybody.
But if you look at our performance through 2009, so far, I'm very happy with where we are. Brad mentioned the
pull-through decrement in this case is kind of what we would expect on that, that we would have been enjoying on the
upside. Unfortunately, we are getting pretty good at these cycles and when it comes back, we'll even be, I think better at
pulling that through on the other side of this. So, that's maybe the perverse reality of what we're seeing here Andy.
<Q - Andrew M. Casey>: Okay. Thank you very much, Doug and Mike.

Thank you. Our next question today comes from Andrew Kaplowitz. Please announce your association then pose your
question.
<Q - Andy Alec Kaplowitz>: It's Barclays. Good morning, guys.
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Hey, Andy.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Good morning.
<Q - Andy Alec Kaplowitz>: Mike, you talk about backlog already. It did improve sequentially. You mentioned this
was really a result of Construction and Power Systems offsetting Resource Industries. Do you think this was an
inflection point in these other businesses? And what's hard for us is we see, at least in the first quarter, Construction and
Power Systems were pretty weak. Some of that was inventory. And so how do we look at those businesses versus the
backlog increase offset by the weakness in the first quarter?
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Yeah, Andy, I don't know if it's an inflection point. I think that given what we have in our
outlook for mining, I suspect that the backlog for mining would probably inch down. But what we saw in the first
quarter was actually pretty strong order rates out of construction. Order rates for construction were – for example, were
better than the first quarter a year ago. Our production was down. Dealers were cutting inventory. So we had a pretty
decent build in construction backlog.
I don't know if that's an inflection point. I mean, our predictions around end user demand for construction, as Doug
said, are kind of stable to moderately better this year, so it's not like we're expecting a big increase year-over-year.
We're just not seeing the kind of declines that you're seeing in mining. But all that said, it was a pretty strong quarter
for orders outside of mining. Better than a year ago, and that's a good thing. Hopefully it is signaling a trend. We'll see.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Yeah. I would just throw in some maybe further clouding of the tea leaves to your
question on whether this is an inflection point or not. But many of you are aware and some of you were at Bauma last
week in Munich, I was there for an extended period of time. Some interesting statistics out of the Bauma show. Record
attendance by a long shot, record exhibitors, record waiting list of exhibitors to come in and record machine sales by
our dealer anyway inside Germany. You wouldn't think you'd hear that in Europe in this day and age. And so while all
that was great news, off the chart news, there was other stories in Europe that lead us to indicate that there is no end in
sight in Europe either, but it's just a tough time to read the tea leaves and I'd like to think this quarter or last quarter, this
quarter, or whatever might be an inflection point, but it's just too hard to say. We're taking it day-to-day. We like what
we saw in the first quarter in terms of our backlog. We like what we see around the world in sales to users, but it's

certainly not a boom.
<Q - Andy Alec Kaplowitz>: That is good to here, Doug. Mike, maybe if I could switch back to Resource Industries
in the margin sense, decrementals on the quarter were expectedly high. You talked about how you're going to mitigate
that going forward. Can you talk about price competition within the segment? Are you finding – have you had to
bundle equipment more against competition? Is there any discounting going on in mining right now? Maybe you can
just talk about pricing within Resource Industries?
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Yeah, I think whenever the subject of pricing comes up, whether it's Resource Industries or
Construction, or impacts of the yen at 100 or something close to 100, the reality of the real world is it's not
instantaneous, it doesn't usually change by big amounts. Our first quarter with Resource Industries, Power Systems,
Construction, all of them were plus, minus pretty close to a 1% increase for the year. That's what we said four months
ago for the outlook for the year. The first quarter was, I mean, spot-on our internal plan for pricing. So it's less than last
year. If you look at constructs – oh, I'm sorry, Resource Industries last year, pricing was up a bit more than that for this
year. It's definitely in positive territory, but not as big as last year.
So I think it's – I'm not trying to suggest that low volume has no impact, but certainly in our business and probably for a
lot of our competitors, a lot of the pricing that we have are under long-term agreements that we have with customers.
So during times when demand is really high and maybe otherwise, you would go out and get more or at least have the
ability to – those long-term agreements are, kind of mitigate a little bit on the upside and mitigate a little bit on the
downside. And so pricing doesn't seem to be – it doesn't swing in big increments from plus to minus. In fact, even in
2009 when sales dropped like 40% in total, price realization ended up being a positive for the year and in this first
quarter, our sales and revenues down 17%, were positive 1% on prior. It's about as we thought. So I think realistically,
it's not that there aren't competitive pressures. I mean they are – there are big competitive pressures all the time. But I
think the net impact is probably less volatility than most people think.
<Q - Andy Alec Kaplowitz>: Thank you. Take care, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Hi, ISI. On the Resource Industries, the sales guidance for the year seems to be implied around
down 20%. If I look at the first quarter revenues and just run that out flat sequentially, which – given the backlog is
down sequentially, that's – it's not necessarily a lay-up, that would give me though revenues down for the year of 31%.
So I am just trying to understand what gets better sequentially in Resource Industries to get you back to full year down
20%. I guess maybe less inventory de-stock. I am just trying to square those two numbers up. What gets better
sequentially in Resource Industries to get the full year to down 20%, not the 31% if it's just flat sequentially?
<A - Michael DeWalt>: David, I don't – we didn't give a down 20% for Resource Industries. I think kind of what
we've been saying is last year, our total sales and revenues were about 65. It's certainly at the midpoint of this year's
outlook we are looking – or the new outlook we are looking at 59 and essentially all that is – the down is Resource
Industries. So I think it will be more than 20%.
I think if you look at the first quarter and then the second, third, and fourth quarter, kind of the movement through the
year and what's likely to happen there, I think the negative impacts from dealer inventory build last year kind of
continued throughout the year were actually positive for last year, absence of and further declines this year on dealer
inventory will probably start tailing off the fourth quarter. For example, we didn't have the same kind of dealer
inventory builds. From a – just a production standpoint, from the orders we've received, orders on hand, kind of the
production trends for the year. If you were to look inside our production schedules, we are not presuming any big
upturn in order rates. We – our forecast doesn't need that. I mean it's not that we're forecasting no new orders, but it's
very modest. So much of the year is in the order book already for big machines. So I guess in answer to your question,

dealer inventories and impact plus the full year decline is probably more than the 20% you're thinking.
<Q - David M. Raso>: That's an important distinction, Mike. Obviously, people want on the stock, I want as much
negative mining news baked already into the guidance. So just to be clear if you can ...
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Yeah, they're quite a bit baked in.
<Q - David M. Raso>: I hear you, but if Construction is up only 3% and Power's flat and other is going to be down,
with the Logistics gone, but also just say, core down a little, it's not a big business. Resource industry needs to be down
only 20% to hit your revenue number. If you're saying it's down larger than that, you're implying better from
Construction and Power, which given the mix the people are looking for, again, they want as negative Resource
Industries in the guidance as possible. But to help us understand the math, because the math is, Mike, basically down
20% in Resource Industries to the full year number. Can you maybe give us a little more clarity on how you're thinking
about Construction Industries and Power Systems on the revenue then?
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Yeah, so I will go back. We have about $6 billion decline from actual 12% to midpoint of the
guidance. That's $6 billion that is essentially all out of Resource Industries which is mining. So I think that's more than
20%.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Okay. So the bump-up sounds a little Construction Industries; Power being down 12% for the
quarter getting the full year flat, initially looked challenging, but you did cite the backlog is up in Power sequentially.
Did I hear that correctly?
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Yep. And construction.
<Q - David M. Raso>: And construction. And last quick one. The loss on that power project in the first quarter, can
you...
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Okay.
<Q - David M. Raso>: ...quantify it for us so we have better understanding of the underlying Power Systems margin
for the quarter? And is that loss completed, done, it's in the first quarter and there's no lingering going forward?
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Yeah. Well, we weren't specific to a customer. We certainly have confidentiality agreements
with customers, but it was a big – a quite large project. It hasn't been delivered yet. It's our expectation that the first
quarter contains whatever – we don't expect any continuing losses as a result of that project throughout the year. So it's
a loss in that context is contained in the first quarter. And I think in the scheme of our total results and probably in the
scheme of the size of profit for Power Systems, it's not a big material item certainly for the company. But in the scheme
of the profit change, it was – as we look at all the changes, it rose to a level that we felt like we needed to mention it.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Okay. Thank you for the detail. I appreciate it.

question.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: Hi, it's UBS. Good morning.
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: I'm wondering how you're thinking about EPS ranges at the high-end and low-end of your
sales guidance range and if you can give any kind of point estimates, I guess, with the narrower sales range, should we
assume that your EPS range is going to be narrower than $2 a share or is the margin impact such that it could still be
$2?

<A - Michael DeWalt>: Yeah, no. I would say it's not likely to be that wide. If you think about our profit and Brad
kind of talked about our expectations for incremental and decremental margins. We're order of magnitude in and
around 25%. Now, in the first quarter, it was worse than that because we had a sizable impact from inventory
absorption. I think if I were looking at our range, that's probably from an operating stand – operating profit standpoint
thinking about roughly speaking 25%-ish up and down is probably a reasonable change. Or I mean kind of a reasonable
assumption to do and that would give you a profit range less than $2 certainly.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: Okay. And then you mentioned that order rates in construction improved. Can you maybe
just give a little more color on that by geography and I guess by country is what I'm thinking? And then maybe within
North America, is there any way to kind of give some color on end market be it sort of highway versus housing versus
commercial or anything else?
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Yeah, I think it's – it was actually fairly widespread. But I think the better way to think of it is
order rates in the fourth quarter were quite low as dealers were trying to lower inventory. So they really dropped order
rates quite a bit in the fourth quarter really to get us to producing chip less to them. And so they can take inventory
down, which happened in the first quarter. And during the first quarter then, dealers raised order rates, and I'm going to
say largely kind of across the board, because what they'd already done to lower inventories for the most part was – has
kind of been played in. There will be more inventory reduction, I think, come in the second quarter in Construction a
bit, but order rates have moved back up to be certainly more in line. Remember too that the second quarter is a pretty
high quarter seasonally for kind of dealer delivery sales to end-users. So they're ordering more pretty much across the
board for that. I – if I can think of exceptions by country, I would tell you, but I think for Construction, it was pretty
widespread.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jerry Revich. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Jerry D. Revich>: Good morning. It's Goldman Sachs. Doug, you've ramped up CapEx earlier in this cycle than
what we've seen from Cat in the past. I'm wondering if you can talk about how we should think about CapEx beyond
2013 as we get past Tier 4 Final, and if you could touch on what type of projects you're trimming in the CapEx
guidance this year as that has implications for out-year CapEx, that'd be helpful? Thank you.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Yeah. I'd say, we'll see how the cycle goes here, but I'd like to – we've seen, I don't
know, $4 billion-ish in – at the high-end, we're down now under $3 billion, I guess, for this year. That's going to cycle
with where we are. The good news for – and I would say for 2013 and 2014 and maybe into 2015 is that the
modernization we've done with our plants, the investment we've put in, the restructuring around the world, should get
us through here for a couple of years regardless of the – whatever comes to us. And even minimal growth, we're well
poised for. We're concentrating on market share, things pick up a bit and we can serve the market. So we're in really
good shape when it comes to CapEx, but I would see it cycling up a bit if we see recovery kind of across the board the
next few years, kind of in line with where we've been.
<Q - Jerry D. Revich>: Okay. And, Mike, in Power Systems, can you flesh out for us what you're seeing in the first
quarter orders? It doesn't sound like you saw the order pressure that you saw in locomotives, but maybe you can add
some color there and touch on what you're seeing for bookings in electric power? Thank you very much
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Yeah, it's – actually the industrial businesses improved some, so the order rates for industrial
are up. Electric power has remained pretty weak. The oil and gas business has been kind of mixed. The drilling and
fracking piece has been down, compression has been pretty good. Solar has actually a very good order book for the
year. So I think if what you are trying to do is kind of gauge how the year is shaping up for electric power, I think we
have – we're probably most pessimistic on electric power, particularly the small end of that. Fairly neutral to positive

on the oil and gas business and solar as well, the big end of that.
There are some signs that marine and industrial are starting to do a little bit better. And to your point, rail, actually
overall in the first quarter was – certainly from a sales standpoint, fairly similar to a year ago. They have a pretty decent
order backlog in rail. That's a business that we've done pretty well in. We've worked pretty hard on the cost structure,
customers are buying more from us. I saw here just recently where GE is scaling back some production. So I think all
in all, we've done pretty well in rail. So in the context of a full year business that's relatively neutral in our outlook with
2012, you got industrial that's starting to look a little better. Marine, maybe a little bit better. Electric power, down. Oil
and gas, back up.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Seth Weber. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Seth R. Weber>: Hey. Good morning. It's RBC. I was wondering if you could just circle back on the mining
business again. The sequential increase in the parts business in the quarter; I mean you kind of touched on that U.S.
coal was soft, but can you tell us where that increase is coming from, where you're seeing some relative strength?
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Yeah, and I think coal is actually a good market to look at. If you look at coal versus the first
quarter a year ago, it's down, but production has been edging up. It looks like utility output is up a bit. It looks like
coal's percentage of utility production is up a bit. You've got record coal exports from the U.S. So while it's still a little
bit below where it was a year ago, coal production is kind of trending up a little bit and that has been, I think, a little bit
of a positive, certainly in the mining piece of it.
<Q - Seth R. Weber>: Okay. Any of the other commodities, any color there?
<A - Michael DeWalt>: On aftermarket, I don't know. I mean the numbers – once you get outside of the U.S., the
overall parts numbers are plus, minus. They're not – it's not – they're not dramatically different. So it'd be hard to get a
read from it. I think if you look at commodity production generally, it's by and large up a little bit, not dramatically. So
I'm just guessing here when I say this, but I would suspect outside of U.S. coal, there's probably not a lot of change.
<Q - Seth R. Weber>: Okay. If we could switch over to the planned increase in production in China, I mean can you
give us a little bit more color what you're seeing there? I mean is that a – is Cat just outperforming the market? Do you
feel like the industry is going to be more disciplined this time going forward? Or what gives you confidence to start
raising production there on the Construction side?
<A - Michael DeWalt>: Yeah, I think there's two things. I think the fundamental one is that we've spent almost a year
getting inventory down. So we've had production levels that are well below real end user demand levels to work down
inventory. Inventory is down to a point where, not quite yet, but probably in the next month or so, it will be getting to a
level where we're not looking to take it down more. And so then production will come back. So I think most of the
increase in China production is because we're kind of getting to the end of inventory decline, hopefully, anyway over
the next quarter. But I think also mixed in there, certainly for the mid-sized excavators in the marketplace, we're
actually doing a little bit better than the market overall. So that's been a positive for us as well.
<Q - Seth R. Weber>: Okay. Thank you.
Michael DeWalt
