Thomas Patrick Joyce
Thanks, Matt, and good morning everyone. We're pleased with the quarterly results we announced this morning.
Earnings came in above our expectation, thanks to the Danaher teams' very strong execution. Danaher Business System
continues to drive superior margin expansion, increased cash flow, and healthy top-line performance in a modest
growth environment.
The investments we've made in innovation and expansion in high-growth markets drove share gains in many of our
operating companies. Fluke, Hach, Veeder-Root, Radiometer, AB SCIEX, Implant Direct and Esko are among the
businesses that we believe outperformed relative to their markets during the quarter. These share gains and the team's
execution also help drive more than 85 basis points of core operating margin improvement in four of our five segments.
Our cash flow performance is also very good, resulting in free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of a 128%.
We're encouraged by our increased M&A activity of late, as we have announced $3.3 billion of deals across our
portfolio in the first nine months of the year. These acquisitions will strengthen our Dental, Life Science and
Diagnostics, Environmental and Test & Measurement segments. Cultivation funnels across our portfolio remain full,
giving us confidence in our ability to deploy our substantial M&A capacity in a strategic and disciplined way.
So with that as a backdrop, let's get into the details of the quarter. This morning, we reported diluted net earnings per
share of $0.95, up 13%, and representing another record third quarter for Danaher. Revenues grew 4.5% to $4.9 billion,
with core revenues up 3%. The positive impact of acquisitions increased revenues by 2%, while currency translation
reduced revenues by 50 basis points.
Geographically, high-growth markets led the way, increasing high-single digits. Despite the headlines in China, our
businesses grew double digits led by our T&M instruments, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics and Dental platforms.
Developed markets remained relatively stable as the U.S. and Western Europe both grew low-single digits.
Our gross margin expanded 80 basis points, or approximately $140 million to 52.7%. This increase in gross profit
enabled us to increase our sales and marketing and R&D spending by nearly $60 million in the quarter and delivered 70
basis points of core operating margin expansion.
Turning to our five operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues increased 1.5%, while core revenues decreased
1%, primarily due to a decline in our Communications platform. Reported operating margin declined 170 basis points,
while core operating margin decreased 115 basis points.
On Monday, you saw that we announced an agreement to combine our Communications business with NetScout
Systems to create a premier global provider of network management solutions for both carrier and enterprise
customers. We're excited about this transaction, which is the culmination of a multiyear discussion with NetScout about
working together. This is a powerful opportunity to combine highly complementary businesses in a transaction that we

believe will benefit all of Danaher and NetScout stakeholders, associates, shareholders and customers alike.
Danaher's premier troubleshooting, cyber security and engineering solutions combined with NetScout's
high-performance monitoring technologies will give customers access to the most expansive suite of best-in-class
products in the industry. The combined company will offer even greater breadth and depth across both carrier and
enterprise networks, expanding opportunities for innovation and growth, and improving our customers' overall
experience.
We anticipate that this transaction will close in 2015, subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory,
NetScout shareholder, and other approvals. Upon close, our Executive Vice President, Jim Lico, will join NetScout's
Board of Directors while retaining his responsibility to Danaher.
Now, back to the results from the quarter. Our Communications platform core revenues decreased at a double-digit
rate. High-teens growth in our security solutions business was more than offset by a decline in network management
solutions, due to spending delays from our wireless carrier customers, primarily in North America. Despite the revenue
decline, we were encouraged by the positive order growth for the platform that we believe will continue for the
remainder of the year.
At Arbor, demand for prevail enterprise security products grew more than 50% as IT security customers continue to
rely on Arbor to prevent and mitigate attacks on their networks. Around the world, conducting business is becoming
increasingly virtual, and Arbor is responding with flexible solutions to help customers of all sizes quickly and
cost-effectively launch or expand best-in-class security solutions.
Fluke Networks saw robust demand for its enterprise TruView system and portable network tools, which were each up
15%. FNET's TruView system continues to receive industry recognition, and was honored with the 2014
Communications Solutions Product of the Year award from the global media company, TMC.
Our instrument platform's core revenues increased at low-single-digit rate with growth in most major geographies.
Fluke core revenues were up mid-single digits, representing its highest quarterly growth rate in over three years.
Growth was solid across most major product lines led by calibrations and biomedical, which each increased double
digits.
Distribution sellout remained strong globally, particularly in North America and China, where growth was mid-single
digits or better. Fluke plans to build on this momentum by launching Fluke Connect in China later this month.
At Tektronix, core sales were up slightly with modest growth in point-of-sale in North America, and healthy demand
for power supplies and oscilloscopes in China.
Turning to our Environmental segment. Revenues increased 10.5%, with core revenues up 5%. Segment core operating
margin improved 85 basis points with reported operating margins down 30 basis points due to the dilutive effect of
recent acquisitions.
Water Quality core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate with strength in analytical instrumentation and
chemical treatment solutions.
Hach executed well in a temperate municipal spending environment, driving above-market growth in both North
America and Europe. Sales were also healthy in China, growing double digits. This month Hach will launch the
SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer, or PPA, a break-through system that dramatically streamlines water quality testing.
The PPA system is the only testing solution on the market that uses a disposable cartridge to improve ease of use and
reduce the manual steps by over 50% in an EPA-compliant drinking water testing environment. Importantly, it provides
technicians of all experience levels with a failsafe way to achieve highly accurate and consistent results.
At Trojan, demand for large municipal projects remained weak globally. Encouragingly, we received two ballast water
treatment system orders that will be installed in a total of 15 ships. We anticipate the delivery of these systems will start
in the second half of 2015.

On the regulatory front, we received Alternative Management System, or AMS Acceptance, from the U.S. Coast Guard
for our full suite of UV ballast water treatment products in July. This is a temporary designation that allows customers
to use Trojan solutions in U.S. waters, while our application for U.S. Type Approval is pending.
Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew mid-single digits with robust demand for our dispensers, vapor recovery
products and point-of-sale solutions. Vapor recovery sales grew more than 50% in China as businesses continued to
work towards compliance with environmental regulations.
In point-of-sale, North American customers are choosing GVR's reliable and affordable payment security solutions as
they upgrade their systems in advance of the new EMV regulations that begin to take effect in 2015.
In the quarter, Gilbarco Veeder-Root acquired FuelQuest, a leading provider of fuel management solutions for
suppliers, distributors and buyers of petroleum products. This acquisition further expands the capabilities of our
Insite360 cloud-based fuel management platform by allowing our customers to remotely monitor fuel acquisition,
planning and distribution.
Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenue increased 4% with core revenues up 3%. Core operating margin was
up 120 basis points, while our reported operating margin increased 100 basis points. Core revenues in our Diagnostics
platform grew mid-single digits.
At Beckman Coulter, core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate with double-digit growth in immunoassay,
urinalysis and automation. Growth was particularly strong in China, where revenues grew over 20%.
Beckman received FDA 510 clearance for its Power Express sample processing system in the quarter, further
expanding its world-class suite of automation products. The Power Express is a scalable, high-speed system designed to
automate sample processing in labs of all sizes across all core disciplines including chemistry, immunoassay and
hematology. The Power Express is just one of several new FDA cleared solutions that will help our U.S. customers
improve efficiency and reduce turnaround times for critical diagnostic tests.
Radiometer's core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate led by more than 35% growth in AQT sales.
High-growth market sales were up more than 20% as we continue to expand our market position in China.
Leica Biosystems' core sales were up low-single digits as mid-teens growth in high-growth markets was offset by
weakness in core histology instruments in Europe. Advanced staining instrument placements were particularly strong
as revenues increased over 20% in the quarter. We expect our advanced staining growth rates to remain healthy as our
growing installed base continues to drive sales of reagents and other consumables.
Core revenues in our Life Science platform grew at a low-single-digit rate, compared to high-single-digit growth in the
third quarter of last year. Sales in the U.S. and Western Europe were positive, but we continue to experience
uncertainty in tender timing and funding in China.
AB SCIEX core revenues grew at mid-single digits with strength in academic, clinical and applied markets. We
continue to expand our in vitro diagnostic offerings by launching the Triple Quad 4500MD and QTRAP 4500MD
systems. 4500 series offers greater flexibility, exceptional sensitivity and faster data acquisition, affording doctors and
patients quicker access to reliable and accurate diagnostic test results.
Leica Microsystems' core sales increased low-single digits. Our SP8 microscope continues to be very well received and
drove double-digit growth for our confocal microscope systems. Last Wednesday, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was
awarded to three scientists, including Leica's long-time collaborator and key opinion leader, Professor Stefan Hell.
Professor Hell and others were recognized for their work in developing a way to use optical microscopy to study the
molecular processes in the living cells.
This work is especially meaningful to Leica, as we collaborated with Professor Hell to commercialize the first
microscope that uses this technology back in 2004. Remarkably, this is the fourth year in a row that Leica microscopes
have been cited in Nobel Prize winning work, and we're honored that our products continue to be used to support this
and in other important scientific research.

Turning to Dental, segment revenues increased 3.5% while core revenues were up 2%. Our core operating margin
increased 100 basis points, and reported operating margin increased 110 basis points to 17.2%. The team has done a
terrific job in using DBS to drive productivity and improve segment margins over the past several years.
In early September, we announced the pending acquisition of Nobel Biocare, a premier global brand and a pioneer in
dental innovation. Nobel Biocare's expertise in implant dentistry, digital prosthetics and software, combined with our
extensive capabilities in 3D imaging, intraoral scanning and digital restorative solutions will benefit both patients and
dentists by further optimizing clinical work flows. We believe DBS will make a significant impact on Nobel Biocare's
performance by helping to drive further innovation, growth and collaboration with our other dental companies.
We're confident that Nobel Biocare is an outstanding bid for Danaher, and we look forward to working with this
capable team. The purchase price of $2.2 billion equates to approximately three times revenues, and less than four
times gross profit, which we believe positions us well from a return perspective. The acquisition remains subject to
customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the fourth quarter 2014, or the
first quarter of 2015.
Dental consumables core revenues grew low-single digits, as healthy demand in China and the Middle East was
partially offset by a modest decline in the developed markets. In the U.S., the sluggishness we saw in the second
quarter continued. Encouragingly, demand for our implant products remained robust, increasing globally at a
double-digit rate.
Dental Technologies' core revenues were up mid-single digits, driven by demand for our dental hand pieces and
imaging equipment globally. In mid-September, we introduced the newest member of our family of cone beam 3D
imaging products, the i-CAT FLX MV for a medium field-of-view. The FLX MV allows dentists to capture a
high-resolution lower radiation 3D image of the upper and lower teeth. Our Tx STUDIO 5.3 software is also integrated
into the FLX, allowing dentists to both scan patient's mouth and prepare a full digital treatment plan from one location
on a touch screen.
In our Industrial Technologies segment, revenues increased 2% while core revenues were up 4.5%. Core operating
margin expanded a 145 basis points, and reported operating margin increased 170 basis points to 24.3%. Motion core
revenues increased at a low-single-digit rate, marking the second consecutive quarter of growth for the platform.
Demand in the high-growth markets was particularly strong, led by industrial automation in China. During the quarter,
we completed the divestiture of our electric vehicle systems and hybrid product lines, which had annual revenue of
approximately $100 million.
Core revenues in our Product Identification platform grew mid-single digits as Europe and the Middle East both saw a
double-digit growth.
At Videojet, core revenues grew mid-single digits as a growing installed base of equipment and solid execution in
service help drive high-single-digit aftermarket revenue growth. During the quarter, Videojet launched its 1000 series
of continuous inkjet printers. These printers feature an extended life printing core that reduces downtime and enables
customers to print almost continuously for five years.
Esko also experienced robust demand in the quarter with double-digit growth in our workflow automation software and
digital imaging products. In September, Esko released its new packaging, design and workflow automation software,
Suite 14. This comprehensive set of software tools helps brand owners interact with their global supply chains in the
cloud, improving efficiency and control at every stage of the packaging, design and pre-production process. Reception
of Suite 14 has been exceptional and over 1,000 customers have already upgraded since launch.
So to wrap up, the Danaher team executed well this quarter using the Danaher Business System to expand margins,
generate strong cash flow performance and deliver higher-than-expected earnings. Across the portfolio, our expanding
presence in high-growth market, investments in innovative new products and focus on improving sales and marketing
have helped our businesses continue to take share in their markets.

As we plan for 2015, we remain mindful of the challenging macroeconomic outlook including the recently strong
dollar. Thus, we're continuing to invest in high-impact areas while also increasing spending on productivity initiatives
to approximately $125 million in the second half of 2014. We believe our focus on growth investments and margin
expansion combined with our robust balance sheet and M&A capacity position us to finish 2014 well, and drive
long-term results. We're initiating fourth quarter diluted net EPS guidance of $1 to $1.04, which assumes fourth quarter
core revenue growth similar to the first three quarters of 2014.
So before we go to Q&A, I wanted to take a moment to share a few thoughts after the first six weeks of my time as
Danaher CEO. When this transition began, I knew that Danaher's future was bright. My belief is now firmer than ever.
The caliber of our team, the depth of incredible talent, their deep commitment to DBS and our culture is second to
none. Financially, our balance sheet has never been stronger. Much as we've done in the past and more recently with
the $3.3 billion we have committed so far this year, I look forward to channeling this strength to build upon our leading
portfolio of companies.
At Danaher, we compete for shareholders, and that is on the top of my mind every day. We continue to look for smart
ways to create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders such as this week's announcement regarding the
combination of our Communications business with NetScout, the recent divestiture of our electric vehicle and hybrid
motor product lines, and our pending acquisition of Nobel Biocare. As you know, we're always in the process of
evaluating our portfolio and our focus will be on acquiring smartly, partnering smartly, and managing smartly.
Lastly, our team's culture of continuous improvement using the Danaher Business System will remain our primary
focus, because that is who we are and that is what truly defines our competitive advantage.
Matthew E. Gugino
Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. We're now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Scott Davis with Barclays.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Welcome, Tom, to the game.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Thanks, Scott. Game on.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Game on, yeah. So, look, speaking to that, the equity markets are telling us that there's bad stuff
out there, but you guys don't seem to sense any panic amongst your customers or anything, do you? I mean, can you tell
us if anything has changed in October, any activity amongst your customers, particularly in your more cyclical
businesses like Industrial, Tech or Fluke that folks are starting to hunker down a bit?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Scott, it's obviously still pretty early here in October, and I'm sure they're all watching
their screens or reading the paper day-to-day. But I think the simple answer to your question is, no. We've seen a start
to October here that is pretty consistent with what we've seen through the last couple of quarters. But that's certainly not
to suggest that as this environment unfolds day-to-day here, that those screens and those headlines won't start to
influence people's behavior. Obviously, over time, we've seen that happen.
And, frankly, not that the last week has necessarily been the overriding influence on us, but concerns over the
macroeconomic situation, obviously, the changes in currency, the shift in the strengthening of the dollar, have all

influenced the way we want to position ourselves going into 2015. But, again, going back to the short answer to your
question, no, we're not seeing customer panic in the order book at the moment.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. And then, the natural follow-on to that is the sellers, the bid ask spreads have been a little
frustrating I think for most guys in Industrial for last couple of years and the sellers have gotten a little, I don't want to
call it greedy, but it's certainly opportunistic. I mean, have you seen your phone light up in the last couple of weeks
where sellers might be a little bit more minimally compromised?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Again, I don't know that there's necessarily been any particular inflection in the last
couple of weeks or phone lines lighting up. But I would say that as a general direction, we have seen some increased
activity. We have seen, I think, the sellers interested in taking advantage of what are still some pretty rich valuations.
But those same sellers are interested in a transaction. So I think we would generalize by saying that we're pleased with
how the funnels are sitting today. The cultivation conversations are good. And we seem to be making progress in some
of those conversations. So, directionally, we feel pretty good about where we are.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it on. And, good luck, Tom, and hope for all the best here.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Thanks, Scott.
Operator
We'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks, Tom. Good morning. Just wanted to pick up on the comments about what might be
changing, and you're obviously planning for a pretty similar growth environments to what we've seen both in 3Q and
year-to-date. But I'm wondering if the mix of that 3% is somewhat different? And, obviously, Europe [ph] is the focus
of attention here (30:10). And are you projecting a weaker Europe, maybe stronger U.S.? Any change in the mix of that
3%?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Thanks, Nigel, and good morning. I wouldn't necessarily say we're thinking about any
dramatic shifts in that mix. But I would say there are probably a few things to note. I'd say we've seen and perhaps
would expect to see some marginal improvement here in the U.S. I would say while the European environment has
been stable quarter-to-quarter, obviously, there is a bit of concern out there right now about Germany and some
potential slowing there. So as Germany goes, as we know, sometimes Europe goes, and so I think there is a reason for
some caution as it relates to Europe. More recently, we've seen softness in Latin America, specifically in Brazil. And,
of course, the situation in Russia has changed the trajectory of that market.
So, I think when you put all that together, and then you add some continued very good growth in China, maybe not
quite as hard as over a long period of time, but certainly some continued very good growth. I think you see some shifts
on the margins, but we still consider the high-growth markets to be the leaders, the developed markets sort of hanging
in there, but maybe within each of those two major, that split, you might see some shifts here and there.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Nigel, maybe just to add one thing on Europe. As Tom and I went through the strategic
reviews here over the summer and the fall, we actually think on a relative basis, Europe's one of the places we're doing
pretty well, and some businesses where we felt we were taking share. A chunk of that was in Europe.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Hard not to be worried about all the headlines here in Europe, news about Greece today and
their sudden rise again in interest rates, foreign rates over there. But we're, actually at a relative basis, feel like we're
performing pretty well there.

<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. [indiscernible] (32:35). That's pretty clear. And then, just digging a little bit deeper, one of the
hospital providers called out some benefit from the Affordable Care Act on their patient volumes. And I'm wondering if
you've seen some benefit from that on your consumables? And then, on top of that, Life Sciences remains pretty
challenging in China. I'm wondering if you have a line of sight on when that might start improving?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sure. So on the Affordable Care Act and the impact on consumables, first of all, we're
very encouraged by the progress that we're making at Beckman. And I would say, largely the progress we're making
there at Beckman and frankly across the entire diagnostic portfolio is very good execution across those businesses. And
those businesses, I think, particularly Radiometer taking share and Leica Biosystems doing very well particularly in
advanced staining, which is an important area of future growth and one of the better market segment.
We think utilization is probably marginally improved as a function of the Affordable Care Act. And I think there are
some out there who would certainly say that the states with Medicaid expansion are the ones where we're seeing that
uptake. We're also seeing improvements in hospital's balance sheets with a little bit of pressure taken off the bad debt
side. So, you kind of put those things together and, yeah, there's a marginally improving environment there. But relative
to any improvement beyond that right now, I think it's probably still a little early to tell, but improvements on the
margin.
In terms of Life Science and in China specifically, that's probably one of the most challenging environments out there
today. You've heard us talk and perhaps others talk about some of the delays in funding in the Life Science market,
some of the concerns around compliance in that market that may be underpinning some of those delays as China
enforces what we believe are ultimately good policies for how that market will operate. But nevertheless, that is a
market that continues to be a slow market today.
And we don't think that's necessarily a phenomenon that's going to ease up here in the next couple of weeks let alone,
perhaps even in the next couple of months. So I think we're sort of thinking that that could be something that continues
to be under some pressure, slower growth market, maybe into 2015.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Thanks, Tom, and best of luck.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Thank you, Nigel.

We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Bernstein Research.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: Thanks, and good morning. Tom, maybe a little perspective on Tektronix specifically. It's
been – I guess, this is the first quarter in a 11 quarters, almost three years I suppose, where it's turned positive, even if
you said it was, I guess, up low-single digits, but slightly. Is this the start of something a little more significant, and
what drove that turn? Is there something fundamental that's starting to shift a little bit in that business that you're
seeing?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: It's obviously been a challenging time over a number of quarters, but we are very
encouraged by what we've seen in the last couple of quarters in the change there. I think that team has executed very
well. I think they've done some very good things from a product and from a go-to-market standpoint. Stringing two
data points together is always a good thing to do on the positive side, but I think that's still a business that will be
probably a low-single-digit grower here over the near-term. So I would probably attribute it a little bit more on the
execution side than necessarily a fundamental shift or an inflection point in the market. I mean, clearly, there are some
things going on that will drive market growth over time, but I'd put a little bit more on the team's execution here more
recently.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: And you mentioned ballast water for Trojan, that's another encouraging sign. Is this just a
one-off do you think, or something more significant again?

<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: No, we would not consider this to be just a one-off. We would consider it to be just the
beginning, and early and very positive indication of the market's acceptance. And I think it's just important to
remember that these regulatory approvals are really kind of threshold events for starting to bring this market to an
inflection point of higher growth. And so we were excited by the approval that we got, the AMS approval that I
mentioned, but that's not as big a deal quite frankly as getting the formal U.S. Type Approval that I mentioned that we
expect next year. So more to come on that. Very encouraging early indication of acceptance and it's, I think, an
indication of good things to come.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: And if I could just sneak one more in. On the separation earlier this week, the value of the
business combination, you've made it abundantly clear, just maybe a little more thinking on the shareholder value of
doing this outside of Danaher rather than within Danaher?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Steve, it's Dan. I think it's a reflection of our long-held view, NetScout's long-held view that
there was a lot of increment – this is a one plus one equal three, it's a little bit like our tools joint venture, but again we
think with a greater growth profile. And we just ultimately concluded this was the best way to affect that.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: Okay. All right. Great. Thanks, guys.

We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Good morning, Steve.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Good morning.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: So you mentioned ballast water and I guess are there any other businesses, maybe
Beckman perhaps, that just from some company-specific dynamics should perhaps look better at this time next year
versus what they're doing now, just outside of the macro?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Steve, I think I saw several opportunities the business has had as I came through the
strategic reviews that would point towards growth potential in a number of businesses. I think – for example, if you
think about Gilbarco Veeder-Root and what we're seeing around the early indications around the customer base moving
towards compliance with the EMV regulations that I mentioned, I think that's an indicator of some momentum that we
could see later in 2015.
I think as you mentioned, Beckman Diagnostics specifically, I think as Beckman continues to drive their improvements
in quality, in service, in delivery, in the overall customer experience and then you combine that with some of the new
product clearances and then the introduction of our molecular diagnostics platform, VERIS, next year, I think that too
has exciting potential for Beckman. So I think those would be two I would cite, and there would be a number of others
if we walked across the portfolio.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Right. And from a macro perspective, I mean it sounds like this is a 3% type of
economy. It doesn't sound like you think – even though you highlight the macro challenges out there, it doesn't sound
like you think this is kind of a 1% to 2% economy, this is just kind of a stable and steady growth type of environment
we're in right now.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Yeah, I don't think we want to go Chicken Little on you here. But I think we want to be
ready for what comes. We've done that obviously over a long period of time. When – as cycles move through, we try to
anticipate where challenges come. And we think there's some indications out there that'd be challenges, but we're not
trying to call a crisis here.

<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: And then, one last question just on portfolio mix. I mean, by buying Nobel and doing
this deal for the Comms business, I would assume this kind of reinforces the view that you guys aren't particularly
stuck in a frame of mind of a certain percentage from healthcare and a certain percentage from industrial businesses.
You're going to go where the opportunities provide the best strategic and financial returns.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Steve, I probably couldn't have said it any better than you just said it. We are not stuck
on percentages, and we absolutely move to where we can add the greatest value for our shareholders by making those
portfolio moves that come our way and that we can make happen over time.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Is it too late for sellers to get something done by the end of this year, or is everybody
just kind of looking more towards 2015? How robust is the pipeline?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Well, Steve, there's not a tax driver here. But on the margin here the last two months, three
months, and just what we've seen in the last four months or five months has been encouraging regarding conversation.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Great. Thanks.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Thanks, Steve.

We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Thank you, gents. Good morning. Just a quick one or two. Just on kind of on the sell side of
things, Tom, the NetScout deal is interesting, right, in an environment where it's tough to buy. Perhaps it makes sense
to sell a few things. I just wonder – and I think we're all fairly acquainted with your portfolio. But what's the prospect
for other moves, perhaps structured in different ways, but kind of pruning opportunities in the portfolio?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Morning, Jeff. First of all, it's important to recognize that there was no motivation
behind the partnership with NetScout that had to do with it being tough to buy. We thought that was just a great
opportunity, no matter what, as you might have expected. But we will continue to evaluate the portfolio and make sure
that our businesses are well-positioned for the future. I think we have a tremendous portfolio today. I think going across
the strategic plans that I did and not that I saw every operating company during the season, but I saw all the major
operating companies and certainly all of them from a platform point of view.
And I think there's just a lot of potential that we have across the entire portfolio today. But that being said, and you've
heard Larry say it over a long period of time that no business has a permanent home at Danaher. And we'll continue to
evaluate whether each one of our businesses is well-positioned in the portfolio. And if we see opportunities for smart
partnering, or an opportunity where that business is better served to be in a better place, we'll certainly look to make
that happen. But I mean, in general, I'm thrilled with the portfolio we have today.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Right. And then, I was just wondering if we could get a little additional color on just what's
going on in restructuring, just kind of a couple of questions and points around that? Tom, I think you said $125 million
in the second half, implying some of it started in Q3. I'm wondering, Dan, if you can just kind of give us a little color
kind of Q3 versus Q4, and if there's any change in kind of deal costs and other things that are going on in the fourth
quarter? And maybe just a little thought, if you could, on kind of where the activity is taking place and what the
payback might be?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Yeah. Jeff, on the point about where it's taking place, obviously, a lot of communication to do
here. So we're going to avoid to get into specifics. But the $125 million is largely in that over 90% of it will be in the
fourth quarter, broad-based, we would expect about a little bit less than a one-year payback. So on an annualized basis,
expect about $100 million of savings or roughly $0.10 a share. Probably don't get all that until we get to the end of the
first quarter given there's often some kind of lag effect, but found a lot of good projects here and obviously made the
decision to execute upon them.

<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Any change in deal costs on that – yeah?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Jeff, I just might add to that. I think as Dan and I went through each of the individual
businesses, both during the operating reviews earlier in the year and during the strategic plan reviews, it was clear that
the businesses were already thinking ahead as to where those opportunities might be and how to take advantage of
them. So we were really pleased with how the businesses look broadly across the portfolio and came up with really a
terrific group of projects.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: And then, Jeff, just in terms a deal costs, we highlighted some of that in July. I don't think it's
changed much. Clearly, losing the Motion business and the earnings in the fourth quarter, that's obviously in the guide
here. We continue to work on the integration of the Siemens business. That's going well, but we're spending money on
that. The only thing that could be of significance and we would call it out is, if we were to close Nobel here in the
fourth quarter, which is a possibility, we would have some one-time expense, which given the magnitude, we would
call out separately.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Right. Thank you, guys.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Thanks, Jeff.

We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Thank you. Just a question on Dental firstly. In sort of earlier in the quarter you
talked about U.S. sell-through of consumables being a little bit better. It doesn't seem to have shown up yet in your
numbers. Is that something you think reverses pretty soon? And also on Dental, very, very strong core margin
improvement performance in Q3. That was after a pretty weak Q2. What do you think the steady state run rate on that
Dental margin trajectory should be?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: On the Dental Consumables, Julian, it clearly is a business that is still closely tied to
what we think is a fairly slow growth macro environment. And so – well, I think we're doing a good job from an
execution standpoint. I think, clearly, we don't have any tailwind from a market standpoint. So we've got work to do
there, but I don't think there's anything perhaps anymore noteworthy than the environment in which that business is
performing today.
Dan will comment in a second on kind of an outlook on margins, but you're right to note certainly the good
performance from Dental on the margin side in Q3. Dental Technologies, in particular, did a very good job on driving
margins. Some of that a function of some things we did last year around productivity, some of that just continuing good
work this year from an execution standpoint, and then a little bit of help overall across the segment from a mix
standpoint with consumables, despite the slightly slower growth that you commented on generally providing a pretty
good mix for the segment overall.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: And, Julian, in terms of margins, for the full year – and there'll be some noise in Q4,
obviously, because of restructuring, but from a core basis, we would expect core margin expansion in that 75 basis
points to 100 basis points of core margin improvement during the year. You obviously saw more than that here in the
third quarter. It's a little bit hard for me to kind of quote a number here given the expectation of Nobel coming in. So,
we'll have a lot of noise for a couple of quarters. But ultimately with Nobel, what we have, we think this is a 20%
segment in four years to five years from now.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thank you. And then just on the outlook, you obviously talked about the restructuring
measures you're enacting now. And you talked earlier about the decent increases in SG&A and R&D in Q3 funded by
the gross margins. Have your own spending plans, whether OpEx or CapEx, changed in light of the macro conditions
that you cite? Or for now you're proceeding as you were and you'll just watch the order book closely for changes?

<A - Daniel L. Comas>: But, Julian, probably important to note here that we're just now entering into the budget
season here. So, we'll have work to do with each of the individual operating companies to understand how they're
positioning for 2015. I think one of the things we try to make sure we do through that process is to recognize that
there's not a one-size-fits-all across the portfolio when it comes to investment and where those gross margin
improvements either come from and/or where they get reinvested.
And so, as we walk across the businesses, we'll be, I think, thoughtful as we've always been about making sure that
we're investing smartly into those businesses. They have the best opportunities, that are the best positions in their
market. And that's where you see lifts, for example, in R&D, and in sales and marketing, and perhaps in some other
spots you might see us stay a little tighter.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Thanks, Julian.

We'll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
<Q - Richard Eastman>: Hi. Just a couple of quick questions. On Siemens, is that transaction that's tracking on the
timeline? Is that a first-quarter close? And, Dan, could you just give the IT integration expenses in Q3 and Q4? Are
those still kind of summing to maybe $10 million split between the quarters?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: That's directionally correct. I don't have the breakdown. We just debriefed with the Beckman
team the other day on the integration. It's going well and all our expectations are for a Q1 close.
<Q - Richard Eastman>: Okay. And then, also, Tom, just in terms of China, we continue to put up some very nice
double-digit growth there as mentioned. And I think we understand the issues in the Life Sciences marketplace there
and being regulatory and hopefully they clear sooner rather than later. But it feels a little bit contradictory your growth
in China coming in some of these more cyclical markets, T&M, I think Motion was mentioned. It seems contrary
maybe to the macro perspective that people have in China. So, do you attribute your double-digit growth to your
initiatives, distribution, sales, marketing, or how do you reconcile that?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sure. Rick. Thanks for the question. Jim Lico and I were together in China. I think it's
now two weeks or three weeks ago for a number of days. And we sat with each one of our individual businesses, in
many cases I was sitting with businesses that I was less familiar with. But, clearly, what – I think what we saw was we
saw a very good group of people, an outstanding set of teams that are continuing to build commercial reach in those
markets. We're seeing teams now putting innovation-related resources on the ground, product planning resources.
We're adding to our local R&D presence, developing products for that local market, commercializing those products in
ways that I think are helping to drive our growth.
And you're right to observe that that growth is coming fairly broadly across not just, for example, places where we've
talked about it in the past like Beckman Diagnostics. It continues to do an excellent job. Of course, that's a very big
business over there. So that's obviously a part of that growth, but it is broad-based. The Dental team, for example, an
outstanding team over there that's continuing to drive double-digit growth. And that's not only a good market, but the
team executing very well. So, I think you put that all together and it's a good portfolio well-positioned in a number of
good markets with good teams that are continuing to invest aggressively.
<Q - Richard Eastman>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Thank you, Rick.

We'll take our next question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Good morning, guys. Thank you.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Hi, Isaac.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Hey. Just one follow-up question on the Life Science business. If I look at your comments here, you
did say combination of pressure in China both in terms of the overall demand environment as well as budget delays. I
was wondering which of the two was maybe a bigger factor just to give us some insight on what your visibility is on a
recovery there heading into next year?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Isaac, tough to parse what you described as budget delays versus overall demand. But if
I were to try to generalize, we know that there has been and continues to be scrutiny over particularly the larger tenders,
the instrumentation related tenders. And whether you call that budgetary, or you call it demand, I'm not sure.
Now that being said, there is another dimension which is where on a macro basis are investments going at the moment?
And, clearly, we see investments going into the Diagnostics, more to healthcare side of the house, and we're seeing
obviously the benefit of that in our businesses doing very well there. And perhaps that means slightly less into the true
research side of the house, but I think it's a little tough to parse that much more precisely.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Isaac, I would say compared to 90 days ago, and this really goes to kind of Rick's previous
question, there are some parts in China that we actually incrementally feel a little better about. But I think to be fair on
Life Science, we'd have to say we're incrementally a little bit more negative than we were 90 days ago.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Yeah.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: That's helpful. And then on T&M, you guys I think in the 10-Q did call a little bit out expectations for
continued negative growth there in the wireless business into 2015. So just wondering how broad based that is across
your customers and just confirming that you don't think it's an issue of market share, just more the environment?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: We think it's largely environment and I think the thing that's kind of most encouraging here is
we saw orders turn positive in the third quarter for the platform. And that trend actually looks pretty good heading here
into Q4 as well. The issue there, as you know, we often get – some of that orders, we actually get upfront payment. You
see that in some of the numbers in our cash flow statement, but we actually won't book revenues for six months, nine
months, 12 months out. So we're seeing a nice turn in terms of orders. The next couple of quarters are going to be
challenged here. I don't think that's changed, but I think the outlook is looking a little better here.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Got it. Thanks so much guys.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Thanks, Isaac.
