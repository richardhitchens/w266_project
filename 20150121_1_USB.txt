I will now turn the call over to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin with a few highlights from
U.S. Bank's 2014 full-year results on page three of the presentation.
U.S. Bank reported record net income of $5.9 billion for the full year of 2014, or $3.08 per diluted common share. We
achieved industry-leading profitability with the return on average assets of 1.54%, a return on average common equity
of 14.7% and an efficiency ratio of 53.2%.
Total average loans grew by 6.3%, and average deposits grew a strong 6.5% year-over-year. Credit quality continued to
improve with an 8.9% decline in net charge-offs, and 11.2% decrease in nonperforming assets. Our capital position
ended the year stronger with a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated for the Basel III standardized approach as
if fully implemented, of 9%. In total, we returned $4 billion or 72% of our 2014 earnings to the shareholders in the
form of dividends and buybacks.
Turning to slide four and our quarterly highlights, U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter
of 2014, or $0.79 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew by 5.9% year-over-year and 1% linked quarter.
In addition, we continued to experience strong growth in average deposits. Credit quality remained strong. Total net
charge-offs decreased by 8.3% from the prior quarter, while total nonperforming assets declined 6% on a linked quarter
basis.
We continue to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated for the Basel
III standardized approach as if fully implemented, was 9% at December 31. We repurchased 11 million shares of
common stock during the fourth quarter, which along with our dividend, resulted in a 66% return of earnings to our
shareholders in the fourth quarter.
Slide five provides you with a five-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best
in the industry. Return on average assets in the fourth quarter was 1.5%, and return on average common equity was
14.4%. Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.14%. And Andy
will discuss the margin in more detail in just a few minutes.
Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 54.3%, lower than the prior year. Excluding the impact of notable items
in the fourth quarter, our efficiency ratio was 53.8%. We expect this ratio will remain in the low 50%s going forward as
we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends, while continuing to invest in and grow our businesses.
Turning to slide six, the company reported total net revenue in the fourth quarter of $5.2 billion, a 5.7% increase from
the prior year. Excluding the impact of this quarter's gain related to an equity investment in Nuveen, total net revenue
increased 3.2% from the prior year. The increase was due to higher net interest income as well as higher revenue in
most fee businesses.
Average loan-to-deposit growth is summarized on slide seven. Average total loans outstanding increased by almost $14
billion, or 5.9% year-over-year, and 1% linked quarter. Adjusting for the Charter One acquisition, total average loans
grew 5.5% year-over-year. Overall, and excluding covered loans, which is a runoff portfolio, average total loans grew
by 7.1% year-over-year and 1.2% linked quarter.
Again this quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial
loans, which grew by 15.5% year-over-year and 2.9% over the prior quarter. Total average commercial real estate loans
also grew, increasing 4.2% year-over-year and 0.3% linked quarter.
Residential real estate loans grew 2.2% year-over-year, and were relatively flat on a linked quarter basis. Average
credit card loans increased 3.6% year-over-year and were up 1.3% on a linked quarter basis. Total other retail loans
grew by 3.6% year-over-year and 0.8% over the prior quarter, mainly driven by steady growth in auto loans.

We continue to originate and renew loans and lines for our customers. New originations, excluding mortgage
production, plus new and renewed commitments, totaled approximately $53 billion in the fourth quarter. Total average
revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continue to grow at a fast pace, increasing
year-over-year by 13.3% and 3% on a linked quarter basis. Line utilization was relatively flat in the fourth quarter.
Total average deposits increased almost $19 billion or 7.2% over the same quarter of last year, and 1.6% over the
previous quarter. Excluding the Charter One acquisition, the growth rate remained strong at 5.5% on a year-over-year
basis. Growth in low-cost interest checking, money market and savings deposits was particularly strong on a
year-over-year basis.
Turning to slide eight and credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 8.3% on a linked quarter basis, and 1.3% on a
year-over-year basis. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.50% in the fourth quarter.
Nonperforming assets decreased by 6% on a linked quarter basis, and 11.2% from the fourth quarter of 2013.
The loss-sharing agreement for the commercial and commercial real estate loans acquired from the FDIC, which
comprised a majority of the nonperforming covered assets, expired at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. During the
fourth quarter, we released $20 million of reserves, $5 million less than the third quarter of 2014 and $15 million less
than the fourth quarter of last year.
Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect the net charge-offs and total nonperforming assets to
remain relatively stable in the first quarter of 2015.
Andy will now give you a few more details about our fourth quarter results.
Andrew J. Cecere
Thanks, Richard. Slide nine gives you a view of our fourth quarter 2014 results versus comparable time periods. Our
diluted EPS of $0.79 was 3.9% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013, and 1.3% higher than the prior quarter. The key
drivers of the company's fourth quarter earnings are summarized on slide 10.
Fourth quarter results reflected notable items that combined increased diluted earnings per common share by $0.01.
The notable items included $124 million gain related to an equity investment in Nuveen Investments and $88 million of
additional expense, comprised of $35 million of charitable contributions and $53 million related to recent developments
in certain legal matters.
The $32 million, or 2.2% increase in net income year-over-year was principally due to an increase in total net revenue,
driven by increases in net interest income, fee-based revenue and the impact of notable items. The company also
achieved positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis.
Net interest income was up 2.4% year-over-year, as an increase in average earning assets was partially offset by lower
net interest margin, including lower loan fees. The $35 billion increase in average earning assets year-over-year
included growth in average total loans as well as planned increases in the securities portfolio.
The net interest margin of 3.14% was 26 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2013. Primarily due to growth in
the investment portfolio at lower average rates, lower loan fees and lower rates on new loans, partially offset by lower
funding costs. Lower loan fees were due to the previously communicated wind down of Checking Account Advance,
our short-term small dollar deposit advance product.
Noninterest income increased $214 million, or 9.9% year-over-year, due to higher revenue in most fee businesses and
higher other income, including the impact of the Nuveen gain. We saw growth in retail and corporate payments,
merchant processing, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charge, treasury management fees and
investment product fees.
Noninterest expense increased year-over-year by $122 million, or 4.5%, primarily due to the accruals legal matters,
charitable contributions and an increase in compensation expense reflecting the impact of merit increases, acquisitions

and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities. Net income was higher on a linked quarter basis by $17 million,
or 1.2%, mainly due to the higher net interest income, the impact of the notable items and a decrease in the provision
for credit losses.
On a linked quarter basis, net interest income increased 1.9%, mainly due to an increase in average earning assets,
partially offset by lower loan and investment security rates. The net interest margin of 3.14% was 2 basis points lower
than the third quarter, principally due to the growth in lower rate investment securities, partially offset by unusually
high interest recoveries. These unusually high interest recoveries added approximately 2 basis points to the fourth
quarter net interest margin.
On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income was higher by $128 million or 5.7%. This favorable variance was
primarily due to higher other income, including the impact of the Nuveen gain, partially offset by lower mortgage
banking revenue and seasonally lower corporate payments revenue.
On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense increased by $190 million or 7.3%, due to seasonally higher costs related
to investments in tax-advantaged projects, higher professional services and the notable items, including the charitable
contributions and legal accruals.
Turning to slide 11, our capital position is strong. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III
standardized approach as if fully implemented at December 31 was 9.0%. At 9.0%, we are well above the 7% Basel III
minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $15.96 at December 31, representing a 10.8%
increase over the same quarter of last year and a 1.9% increase over the prior quarter. Our return on tangible common
equity was 20% for the fourth quarter. Also, we are complying with the fully implemented U.S. liquidity coverage ratio
based on our interpretation of the final roles.
I'll now turn the call back to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thank you, Andy. I'm very proud of our 2014 results. We reported record net income, maintained our industry-leading
performance measures and returned 72% of earnings to shareholders. These results are directly tied to the hard work
and dedication of our employees. In fact, last week I had the privilege of leading our ninth annual All Employee
Meeting. It was a pleasure to once again make this annual connection with our employees and to thank them for their
contributions and for our success.
I'd also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Andy and Kathy. Yesterday, we announced that Andy has been
promoted to the Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer, where he'll be responsible for our core lines of business.
Andy has demonstrated tremendous leadership as CFO, and we are confident in his ability to manage our businesses
effectively and execute our customer-focused growth strategy.
Kathy Rogers, currently EVP, responsible for business line planning and reporting, including the stress test process,
will replace Andy as Vice Chairman and CFO. Kathy has been with U.S. Bank for 28 years and has served in a variety
of leadership roles within the finance organization. Many of you have already met Kathy, and I know she looks forward
to meeting the rest of you very soon.
So as we head into 2015, we remain focused on extending our exceptional track record of financial performance for the
benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders.
That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill, Kathy and I would now be happy to answer questions from the
audience.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Jon.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Just on the topic of the promotion, I think we're all big Andy supporters. We appreciate the
new role for him. But, can you maybe share what drove the change, and is there anything you're trying to signal or
anything that changes with the way the company is going to be run and anything changing your role, Richard?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. My role doesn't change, but it is a chance for Andy to demonstrate the same acumens
he's had in the financial role by running the revenue business lines. And as we move through this transition, I think as
the economy starts to get better, I'm quite excited to have him keenly focused on what leverage we can create as the
economy picks up. I'll continue to be running the whole company, but focus especially on the support teams and the
compliance and the operating integrity that's gotten this company to this point so far. And it is fairly transparent, a
chance to give Andy an opportunity to prove that he can run virtually all parts of the company in the eventual
opportunity for him to run it someday.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Okay. Good. Thank you. And then, just a question on 2015 in terms of some of your targets.
Historically, you've had this 4% to 6% loan growth target. And I think it kind of changes from quarter-to-quarter your
level of optimism. But are you feeling optimistic and do you feel is that the right range, 4% to 6%, and what does it
take to get to the higher end of that?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, Jon. Actually, I'm optimistic. So we've been sitting in that 1% to 1.5% linked quarter
for a while, and this quarter you see we're at the low end of that. But for the year you look back, and we were just short
of 6% year-over-year loan growth. We're projecting a higher number for 2015, slightly higher in the high 6%, low 7%.
So if we are accurate, and we usually are, then we see that as a small but steady continued improvement in loan growth.
I'm going to take you back to 10 years ago for those of you who remember though.
We are not going to be dissuaded by people who want to compare us to those who are growing loans faster on a given
quarter, because we never have been impacted by that. But I can remember 10 years ago being questioned on a call like
this for why our loan growth isn't as fast as someone else's, and we're just not managing to that point. We're managing
to high quality loan portfolio. I think our quality of charge-offs and nonperforming assets will prove that.
And so, tempting as it might be to tell you guys we're going to move to 1.5% to 2% linked quarter or 8% to 10%
year-over-year, economy doesn't warrant that yet. And we're going to continue to take market share on the pricing
benefits and the quality benefits we've been using for the last five years to seven years. And as the economy slowly
improves so will our loan growth, but not remarkably. And therefore, in a few years you'll be satisfied that we have
remarkably high credit quality and a continued stability on what we promised through the entire cycle. So I think we're
optimistic for all the right reasons, but at a small incremental level from perhaps at 1% higher year-over-year than we
did in 2014.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah.

<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi, good morning. When we met back in November we talked a little bit about
outlook for investing in the business, and some of the things you were asking the business unit heads to do. And I guess
I'm just wondering if the game plan to grow the business with kind of the current head count is still in place. Basically
wondering if you're thinking about expanding at this stage to capture more market share or to grow the market share
with the same footprint?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Got it. I'll repeat it in a different way. What we said was, 2014 was the year that we continue
to keep an eye on any discretionary expenses that would otherwise not be as important given the fact that expenses are
going to be challenge and the fact that the economy was slow. 2015, I think, like a lot of peers, we've adopted the Fed's
interest rate scenario, which starts to move up in the middle of the year. If that happens, that's awesome. But if it
doesn't, we're not going to make or break this company whether interest rates move up, we're going to control a lot of
dozen things. So the first half of 2015, given slight interest rate scenarios, will be a lot like all of 2014, but we'll
continue to invest what we have to. We'll watch discretionary investments and keep them perhaps defer them a bit until
we can see the stronger economy. We'll add the compliance, operating risk areas, audit areas where we think we
continue to need to make sure we're at the right level of support. And then when interest rates hit, we're ready to pop
and move on to some of these more discretionary investments.
What's really good about it though is, we continue to grow market share, we continue to do well even though there's
really no underlying reason for it, but the fact that the employees are just better. They work harder. They find more
opportunities in each relationship. Our employee engagement is at record levels, which, I think, informs employees that
are engaged are intensely the nth degree here where they can do more with whatever assets they're given end up
continue to do it if they believe the company's future is strong and that they're part of it.
So I'm quite comfortable that in the next six months, we can keep doing what we've been doing. If rates move up, then
we are all glad and we're going to move right on and start adding back. But if they don't, this company still controls a
lot of levers and we're not completely relying on whether rates move up and we'll just manage it one month at a time
like we do every year and look forward to talking to you when things are better.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. So if rates don't go up, there's still the hold the line, total line on head count
expenses?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yup. Yup, except for the areas where it's either necessary or the opportunity is too great to
pass. There're a plenty of things where you can get an ROI in the same calendar year with an investment. I'm taking all
those I can. But some of those ROIs are three-year paybacks, four-year paybacks. They're great ideas, but they're not
necessarily the best investment at a time when you're trying to be prudent against an otherwise difficult backdrop. So
we'll hold those off for a while longer. We have so far, and it hasn't hurt us permanently and I don't think it will for
another six months, even 12 months if we have to.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. So you can flex if the rate environment changes from the Fed outlook? Is that
a takeaway?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: You got it.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: And then, just the follow-up is on the auto leasing business. We had some
information over the last couple of weeks that GM was going in-house. I'm wondering how that impacts you?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Right. Yeah. Not much. I mean, headlines are sometimes just that. For us, the leasing
business is part of our very big indirect auto lending, and this is leasing. And for us, it's probably 10%, maybe 15% of
our leasing business, which is a small fraction of our total lending business. So it's not material in every sense of the
word, literally and figuratively. And we do leasing with virtually every other party as well. So this wasn't a core
fundamental pillar of our success in auto leasing. So we're not worried that we can't replace it pretty shortly.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Yes, hi. Good morning. Richard, I was wondering your kind of high level thoughts on
how you're viewing the revenue to expense relationship unfolding in 2015, given what you laid out for Betsy, in terms
of your rate outlook? How do you see revenues and expenses kind of in your base case this year, and what are the key
wild cards?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. So, John, if you look back on 2014, we grew revenue just a little bit over 1%. This is
kind of normalizing for all what little noise we had, and expenses were up just a little more than 1%, slightly negative
operating leverage. So shame on us, we're disappointed, but it's the way it rolled out.
If interest rates move up in the middle of the year, consistent with the Fed's recommendation, we will see revenue in the
3% to 4% kind of range, and expenses more in the 2% to 3% kind of range. If they don't, then we're going to have to
struggle to get really close to positive operating leverage, just like we did for 2014. And following Betsy's question, we
know exactly how to do that without killing the future, but it'll be a lot less enjoyable. We'll have to continue to gut it
through until we see interest rates giving us the benefit of higher revenue.
I just want to say, we're positive of extra positive interest rates growing. But based on our trusts and payments
businesses particularly, more than most banks, when interest rates move up, for us, it's because the proxy of the
economy getting better that then triggers all kinds of benefits on our income statement, a lot more than just the spread
in the margin. So we kind of see it – the way we're positioned, we're kind of twofer on interest rates increasing because
it's a fundamental reason that the increase that's going to benefit some of our fee businesses.
But we're going to be positive. We're shooting for positive operating leverage at higher levels of both operating revenue
and operating expenses. But to follow Betsy's question and time together, if something less positive occurs, we're able
to adjust to it, and we've got a team that knows how to manage that. They've proven it, and we're not going to
disappoint you guys.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Great. And just a nuance on the rates up scenario in your best case. If the Fed does act
in the second half of the year, but we still see long rates low because of global issues. How does that impact the outlook
for revenue growth? And is that an incremental challenge? And Andy, how do you manage through the balance sheet
with long rates so low? And does that create pressure on your base case scenario if the tenure stays low like this?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: The short answer, John, is no. The long rate is less impactful to us. We're most impactful at
the very short end. And then if you think about the middle end, two years to three years, that's where we have a lot of
impact. We don't have a lot of assets in our book that are at the 10-year and beyond mark. So that's less impactful.
Again, the short end is the most impactful to us, both in net interest income as well as fee income, because of the
waivers in our money funds.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And just quick follow-up, Andy. What's your outlook for the net interest
margin in the first quarter?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Sure, John. So if you think about this quarter. Third quarter, we were at 3.16%. This quarter,
we're at 3.14%. And frankly, it's a little bit better than we expected and what we told you it was going to be. And the
reason for that, part of the reason for that is, we had unusually high interest recoveries this quarter, and I talked about
that in my prepared remarks. And that helped margin by about 2 basis points.
I would expect that to dissipate going into the first quarter. So you think about our core being at 3.12%, I would expect
this to be on a few basis points in the first quarter, from that 3.12% for the same reasons we talked about, which is the
loan mix, principally wholesale versus retail, and then the last tail of our securities bill. So we sort of had the first
average part of it in the fourth quarter. We'll pick up the rest of it in the first quarter. And we are done. We ended the
quarter at $100 billion. We're over the 100% LCR ratio. So we're done with it, but we'll still have a little bit of a
lingering impact. So down a few from 3.12% in the first quarter.

Your next question comes from Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, Bill.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Hey, good morning. So given your loan growth expectations and the NIM commentary that you
just provided, can you talk about your ability to grow NII under the different rate environments that you've been
discussing?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Well, we will grow NII in a year-over-year basis, both the combination of what Richard
talked about and what I talked about on rates. So our expectation is net interest income will grow. Now, in the first
quarter, if you think about it on a linked quarter basis, the first quarter has two fewer days and that costs us just under
$40 million. So absent that will be slightly relatively stable, but the first quarter is a little down because of days.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Okay. Thank you. I had another question on your payments business. On the issuing side, you
guys reported a solid acceleration in payment volume growth this quarter. Can you give us a sense of the interplay
between pressure on purchase volume growth from lower gas prices on one hand, and increased spending power that
the consumer enjoys on the other? Does the acceleration that you saw this quarter suggest that the latter dominates the
former, or is it too early to tell on the acceleration's a function of something else? Maybe some color around that.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I think the answer's yes. I lost the question, but latter doesn't form the former. So here's the
deal. We've got this really great opportunity with our corporate payments, not just our retail issuing, to see that and
government. We can see pretty much where everything's moving around. And we can see directly and very quickly the
movement in the, let's say, first in the corporate side, where corporate T&E is still out placing and we're still growing
that even with the softness of the fuel prices. So we're still seeing T&E growth, which is a pretty good sign that
businesses are transferring some of that into other expenses.
Consumers are the same. So anything related to energy or gas prices has been coming down. But the ticket prices and
the number of visits people have made to restaurants, hotels and some of those discretionary things that they would
spend money on has absolutely gone up. So, Bill, we've seen, at least in 90 days, of almost a perfect correlation from
people still spending the money they're saving on gas through their debit, credit or prepaid cards, but they're spending
on things that I'm sure that a lot of retailers and the restaurateurs are happy about. So we see that evidence both at
consumer and at the corporate level.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: That's really helpful. On the acquiring side, you guys also had nice growth, but interestingly, that
reflected a little bit of deceleration, which is kind of an interesting contrast to the acceleration that we're just talking
about on the issuing side. Can you talk about maybe what's driving that?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah. On the merchant acquiring side, part of that is seasonality. So our fourth quarter is
typically lower than our third quarter, and that goes to mix the business a little bit. If you think about the issuing side,
we have a lot of retail. On the acquiring side, we have less retail and more airlines and the like. And you think about
when people buy their tickets and so forth, it's less so on the fourth quarter. So it's more seasonal. Still, we're showing
good growth year-over-year. Same-store sales is just under 5%.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Bill.

Operator
I'm showing he disconnected. Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.
<Q - John Pancari>: Morning.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Another question on the margin. Beyond the first quarter, I wanted to get your thoughts on the
margin progression. Is it fair to assume 2 bps to 2 bps of quarterly compression, mainly on competitive pressures on
loan yield? I just want to get your thoughts there.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So I would describe it as 2 basis points to 3 basis points, given flat rates, more because of
loan mix than competitive pressure. Although pressure's a little bit of it, but it's more the mix. Most of our growth is
coming on the wholesale side of the equation. And wholesale has about half the yield of retail. So that's what's driving
that 2 basis points to 3 basis points more than anything. And again, that assumes the rates flat to current levels. Once
and if and when rates start to move, we'll start to see a positive advice there.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. All right. And then, separately, on the expense items, just on comp expense on the
increase in the fourth quarter, was that all performance related? Just want to get an idea of what the driver was.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: In the fourth quarter, we have normal activities going on in increases related to risk and
compliance positions for the most part. It's driving head count and FTE increases. We had some increases in
compensation expense related to incentives, but if you peel those two things out, it was relatively stable.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, John. It was the full effect of our RBS acquisition in Chicago that had a full quarterly
effect in quarter four as well, but there was nothing unusual and it doesn't bode for any significant change in quarter
one.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. All right. And then lastly, just want to ask on credit. You released additional reserves this
quarter. And wanted to just get your thoughts on where the reserve-to-loan ratio could bottom out? I mean, you're still
at a healthy level here at around 167 basis points or so. Thanks.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. Bill?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah. It's 1.77% on allowance to loans, all in allowance. Yeah, I mean, it's really a function of
our mix, that's why ours might look a little bit higher than some of our peers. So we have a higher percentage of credit
cards. So obviously we're comfortable with where it's at. You see we have a very, very modest reserve release. I think
when that inflects really gets to the point of what kind of loan and commitment growth we see during the coming year.
We have a little bit more room for opportunity in some of the residential and home equity products. But, at this point,
it's going to be more a function of loan and commitment growth going forward.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I mean the stability though, Bill, we've never seen anything like this.
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah, the stability of our credit portfolio right now is the strongest I've ever seen it. It's just
extremely all cylinders performing well.

<A - Richard K. Davis>: And there surely will be an inflection point for all the banking, right? Where eventually, you
have to reserve for loans that you're making then the future may go bad, but we're not looking at that inflection point in
the near term for our company. We're simply not. And we haven't been deriving much income off of reserve releases.
So we don't have much to get or gain from it. But eventually, we'll end up reserving for as oppose releasing. But we're
not there now, and we're not there for a little while.

Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks, and good morning.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: I just wanted to follow up on some of the commentary on fee income growth. I think, for
the prior year, the security gains were about 4% of the non-interest income. So as we think ahead to next year, is the
realization of those gains going to be something that continues as kind of a bridge to a better rate environment, or were
those really just opportunistic and we should really think about growth off of a baseline number of something like $8.8
billion?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: The latter. So I think the notable items, the gains that you talked about, the Visa gain in
second quarter, the gain from Nuveen here in the fourth quarter are one-time items that are now likely to repeat. So I
start from that base that excludes that and think about normal growth from there.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay. So I think absent those things, the growth rate was about 1% in terms of fee income.
And it looks like the consensus for next year has about implied 5% growth off of that core number. Is that an
achievable level, given kind of some of the acceleration that we've talked about, or is that maybe a stretch?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Eric, I think a key factor in 2014 was the headwind that we faced in the first half of the year
related to mortgage. And if you looked at the mortgage numbers, they were down 30%, 40% year-over-year which
caused a tremendous headwind in quarters one, two and a little bit in three. And you see in quarter four, we're actually
flat for the first time in the long time in mortgage. So I think the removal of that headwind will help us get to the
numbers that are higher than we achieved this year.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: That's a big deal. We should have had the applause [indiscernible] (32:50) because that is a
long anticipated moment where we're starting to grow mortgage again on a year-over-year basis. That is a big number,
Eric. So if you do the math, you'll see that it's more than enough to accomplish that.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Right. Thanks very much.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Richard Bove of Rafferty Capital.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Dick.
<Q - Richard Bove>: Hi, good morning. I'm going to ask you to think 30,000-feet high for a second. When I look at
your bank, I can see absolutely nothing wrong. In my view, it's about as perfect as a company can get in this industry.

And yet, when I take a look at slide nine, I see that, on a year-over-year basis, the net interest income to common is up
0.6%. I see that the EPS is up 2.7%. When I take a look at the price of your stock, it's up 2.6% last year in a market
that's up 11%.
What I'm wondering is, if a bank which gets as close to perfection as this one is, can't get its earnings to move up at a
faster rate and can't get its stock price to do anything but move up a rate one-quarter that of the market. What will it
take to get this thing moving in a direction where the stock is going to equal or outperform the market?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, Dick. This is Richard. Thanks for that observation. I think U.S. Bank moves best when
everything is moving one way or another. So the bank was, 10 years ago, a fairly considered bank with a sense of all
defense, right? We were an efficiency company. No one ever thought about us making revenue. We just know how to
save the next dollar. We can merge and acquire companies and squeeze more out of that than anyone else. And that was
well-regarded and well-recognized.
Then the downturn hits, and that was our first chance to prove what I said earlier, in an answer to John's question that
while we may not look like we're growing as much in the go-go times, we also chose not to take risks. And those
showed up later when the economy turned and we ended up getting stronger. I know you know this, you've written
about this. We became a flight to quality, a place of safety and we played on that.
So now, here we are in kind of a flat, slow, slow recovery that's almost flat. So we can't prove anything remarkable,
except to just say we're not going to disappoint, we're not going to surprise, we're not going to get complicated. We're
just going to gut it out and do a little bit better than everyone else on all the basic tenants.
The next opportunity for us to perform is when the rates pick up because the market has picked up, and then show that
the bank is repositioned now to be as strong as it ever was when it was on defense and be better than anyone else on
offense. So I'm going to hold your question in arrears until we get the chance to show you that when the recovery starts
and because of our high credit quality, our amazing pricing benefits that we have based on our debt ratings that we're
going to be able to show you we can be even better, and then I think the multiple comes back. We even spread further
than we are, because we're always sitting at this high multiple that people need us to be remarkable every quarter to
prove and protect.
But we have, looking forward greatly the time when the world gets better, and we can show you just how positioned we
are for that. And there's a lot we did in that period of time in the last five years to seven years to position this company
as innovative, payments-focused, trust leader and global.
So I'll look forward to that and I'll ask you to ask me the question again when things start to turn. But I think it makes
sense that we hold our own position of strength, kind of the yellow flag is out on the racetrack, but when the green flag
comes out, we'll take off first.
<Q - Richard Bove>: Yeah. Again, I have no questions whatsoever about that. I think the way you run the bank is
superb. But my issue, I guess, is, and we heard it again last night in the State of the Union message, will the
government prevent the industry from reaching a level where it can show meaningful profit increases? Or will it come
up with a new liquidity capital ratios, supplemental leverage ratios, loss absorbing capital ratios and special fee find for
taking high levels of risk?
In other words, as you improve your company, will the government stay one step ahead of you and prevent you from
showing the type of improvement that you're getting in the operation of the company?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Well, I'll tell you, I can't answer that because I don't know the answer, but I will say that
we're in a close set of competitors, right? At least as banks go, and we certainly wouldn't trade place with anybody else,
based on our current position, our size, the fact that we're a domestic SIFI, not a global SIFI, the fact that we don't do
leverage lending, we don't have high risks portfolios. And all I'm saying there is, customers, businesses, they're all
going to need banks. And unless there's a huge alternative I haven't found out there, they're going to need what they
need, mostly no matter what the government does to impair our profitability. We will be there and first among few, I
think, at the highest returns and the highest quality, to be there to receive those needs from the customers. And almost

despite – because, I mean, look, I mean, I think we lost $1.5 billion in the last four years, over four or five specific
government decisions on how to ring fence income. And we had a record year.
So we can do this. It's a lot harder. It's a lot less satisfying and it's a lot less predictable, but I think we've figured out
how to do this. And what you do is, control what you can. Be very nimble and ready to adjust for the next opportunity.
And I, for one, can't imagine a scenario that would be any more difficult than the one we have now. Kind of looking
forward to getting a little bit easier with a little more clarity. But I'll agree, it's complicated, and I can't answer directly
your question because it's what I contemplate at 30,000-feet every day.

Your next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Ken.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Bryan Batory>: Hi, guys. Good morning. This is Bryan Batory from Ken's team. Apologies for the mix up
earlier. Was wondering if you could provide a little color just on the starting point for noninterest expenses in the first
quarter 2015? Just particularly thinking about the reset in other expenses, and then also the potential pension expense
increase, just given where long-term rates ended 2014?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Bryan, this is Andy. If you think about the fourth quarter, there are two unusual items in
total. The first is the total denotables, which is $88 million. The second is our higher CDC or the tax advantage
amortization, which happens every fourth quarter. That was about $60 million. So if you take out that $150 million or
so, I would expect us to be relatively flat to that in the first quarter.
Secondly, with regard to the pension expense, year-over-year we'll see about $100 million increase in pension, about
$25 million a quarter. And that's reflected in the numbers I gave you for the first quarter.
<Q - Bryan Batory>: Okay. Great. And then, could you provide some color on your outlook for mortgage banking
revenues as we head into 2015, just given the recent decline in interest rates?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right. Good question. And it's changing every day as rates move a lot. We've had a very
good week last week, but right now I will tell you that our expectations were relatively stable total revenue, fourth
quarter into first quarter. So we have some pluses and minuses, and that could change as rates move around in the next
few weeks and we'll update you if it does, but right now, relatively stable.
<Q - Bryan Batory>: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hey. How are you doing?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: In terms of your outlook for loan growth, so you're expecting an acceleration, you said, from
what 6% closer to a 7% range. And also, your growth in commitments was up 3%. That's good. On the other hand, you
mentioned that the unused lines of your commitments are still bouncing on the bottom, I guess, unchanged. So once
again, we're at another quarter where you're expecting better growth, yet the 10-year yield is significantly lower. So
who is going to win, Richard Davis or the...
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Oh, my god, right?
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: ...or the 10-year bond.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I still haven't met the 10-year yield, Mike. I'm looking for them. I've invited them and
everything. Listen, I mean, actually you're playing into one of our thoughts. I haven't included the improvement in
utilization at all in our expectation if loan growth goes up. That is an absolute stable starting point. And the way we
look at it, wholesale commitments, a lot of banks look at the total retail. We look at wholesale. And that number at its
highest point was in the mid-30%s, and today it's sitting at 24%. It's been stuck there for about 18 months.
And so, to me, that is unbelievable upside. As long as we keep adding commitments more than loans that means that
more people have an open to buy with us and that they have an intent to use it, because they're paying for it, and so are
we, by the way. But if they use it, any part of it, even the slightest movement from to 24% to 28%, or 30% that's going
to be on top of the kind of loan growth we're anticipating. So we're not counting on that to be the answer.
And I do think that while customers look at the 10-year, as Andy said, most of them look more at the two-year to
three-year, and that movement is going to be what's going to trigger the decision on rather they want to grab something
before it gets too late and whether they'll be glad they prepared themselves with a line of credit that's got an open to
buy. That has a lot to do.
I think there will be a tsunami effect when there is a period where people are sure that rates are moving up. I think
they'll start grabbing the lines they have. They'll start using what they have and they'll be incentivized to be a catalyst
for this economy. But until then, we're not counting on that as part of our expectation of slight loan growth. We're just
doing with our better debt ratings, our better pricing power and our really remarkable employees who've learned how to
tell our story better.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So just more generally, put your economist hat on, Richard. So the 10-year is saying there's
much slower growth, yet your guidance is for some acceleration in your loan growth. How should we reconcile those
two thoughts?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Well, on one hand and on the other hand, if you want me to be an economist, Mike, I don't
think those are directly correlated right now. And I say that because the Fed and the Fed equivalent across the globe has
done some behaviors that are certainly not Kinsey, and they're not things that we all learned in school. And to the
extent that they're being motivated by, I think, by non-financial more political activities, and more financial data that
might be backwards looking, not forward looking. I'm not going to be able to correlate those two for you. And I don't
think our customers are sitting there thinking that way either.
So the 10-year stays low, yeah, sure, mortgages look great and then we go back to this again. But it doesn't inform our
customers that the majority of this bank, until we get to two-year to three-year, and until that starts to bend up, we're
going to stay right where we are. And if it the 10-year reforms it fine, if it doesn't, it's probably going to be a bit of an
inflection on the curve. But I'm not managing to the 10-year, I'm managing to two-year to three-year. And I'm just not
that smart.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then, lastly, you're implying market share gains. You said before that U.S. Bancorp has a
30-basis-point to 35-basis point pricing advantage when pricing commercial loans against some of the largest banks.
Now that the SIFI premium might go even higher for some of the larger banks, could that pricing advantage improve?

And how are you positioned your company to potentially benefit?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: The answer is yes, because you know the math. You knew the answer when you asked it.
And we're positioned as we – we have a philosophy that we will give back some portion of that advantage when we're
competing against one of the banks that has a different pricing scheme. And we'll only do it at the high-quality
customer.
I suppose, because the philosophy is in place, if that spread were to widen, then we give ourselves more room to be
more competitive, but it doesn't introduce new philosophy, or just more of a larger scale for us to use and to give our
lending officers the opportunity to price more effectively. So it's a net positive, I'm not counting on it. But if it happens,
we'll take it gladly and we'll be even more successful.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. How much higher could that go over, 30 basis points, 35 basis points today, could it go
up another 5 basis points, 10 basis points, 20 basis points, 30 basis points?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah, the capital differential is about equivalent. So if you think about your 35 basis points
on the side from the perspective of our debt rating, it's equivalent level on the side of the capital differential from the
highest levels.

Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Morning, Paul.
<Q - Jessica S. Levi-Ribner>: Good morning, guys. It's Jessica Ribner for Paul. How are you?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Jessica.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Jessica.
<Q - Jessica S. Levi-Ribner>: On the mortgage side, what do you guys seeing in terms of the purchase market? Is
most of your volume coming off the refi side? Do you see any recovery there?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So the third quarter was 70/30 new, and because the rates coming down a bit, it's closer to
60/40, 62/38. So it's coming down a little bit more high on the refinancing side. And we're also starting the year strong
that way because of the low rate environment. So I would expect it to be somewhere between that 60% and 70% new.
<Q - Jessica S. Levi-Ribner>: Okay. Great. And just in general, what's your institutional view on housing and the
recovery? Do you think that we have room to go, or, how do you see mortgage banking? Yeah.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, we do, but more than just mortgage, first mortgage, right? So we're already seeing it
now on our home equity. We're growing nicely in home equity. Thanks for asking, Richard. Yes, we're actually
growing almost three times the market share in home equity right now. And we're doing that because we're seeing a lot
of people invest property improvement kind of moneys into their homes, and not doing debt consolidation entirely.
They're doing it for their properties. And these are in some of the states where the hardest hit, where the values have
come back nicely.
So mortgage, in general, has got a really nice, I think, outlook because people who have houses now feel that they're no
longer underwater and they're willing to invest in them. People who have houses that are now above water are willing
to use it as collateral for something else, like a small business, and housing prices slowly but surely are recovering. I

think there's a social question we ought to ask ourselves is, how many 18-year-olds, who five years ago, their mother or
father lost their job or their house are going to want a house in the American dream category three years from now
when they're 25? Don't know that answer.
But I know that the housing stock is not at all overbuilt for the number of people who either need to get back out of
their parents' basements or get an upgrade in the house that they live in. We think this is a good business for us. We're
staying in it. We want to be in the top five from here to forever and we're investing accordingly to make sure that we're
great at originating loans and service them as well.

Your next question comes from Nancy Bush of NAB research.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning, Nancy.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning, guys. Congratulations, Andy. Well deserved.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Thank you.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Richard, there's a debate sort of brewing now in the wake of fourth quarter earnings, which
I think have not been particularly wonderful, particularly for the largest banks, about whether the industry can continue
to cut costs without, "going from cutting fat to cutting muscle." And I'd like to get your view on that. And secondly,
just from the perspective of your company, I think you go through this exercise every month of where you are in terms
of expenses. How do you make sure that you're not cutting muscle? I just like to get what you guys do and what you
see for the industry generally?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. Great question, as usual. Here's a couple of thoughts. I do think, let's talk about the
efficiency ratio as whatever it looks at. It's a fraction, right? It's a quotient. So one of the reasons I think we can do well
is because our revenues grows. I mean, there's a very basic fact like you all already know, but if you grow revenues fast
and expenses your efficiency ratio comes down. That's a fact.
Banks are usually two parts revenue to one part expense. So it's important. If I were to spend $100 million, my team
has got to get $200 million in revenue just to keep it to 50% efficiency ratio. So those are some of the foundational
points.
So number one, if you grow revenue, you can impact your efficiency ratio and still grow expenses, because it's not like
it's binary where you can't grow expenses. And we've been able to do that but not at the levels we want. I do think the
argument at the largest bank level is partly due to revenue. I think banks could do better with their revenue, but to the
extent that that gets slightly impaired by certain actions and things, they've got to watch their expenses. And, honestly, I
don't know why a bank is in the 60% efficiency. It doesn't make sense to me, because if you watch every dollar, there's
plenty of money that is not necessarily shareholder-friendly that's been spent. And you can put a discipline in place
where the employees own it first before you're telling them what to do.
So in other words, we've never brought in an outside party to look at our company and tell us how to run it or tell us
how to cut expenses where you impose on employees some oversight that they didn't do themselves, because, number
one, it's intrusive; number two, it's very unnerving. Because if I have to cut 10 people out of the group of 100, the next
90 don't know if they're safe or if they're the next group to fall.
So I think that is another reason for us to be thoughtful is that banks need to watch their expenses very, very carefully,
and I'm now going to answer out the other side of my mouth that if in the last five years, it didn't cause banks to be
amazingly disciplined at knowing where their money is being spent, I haven't got an answer for why, as I thought there

will be a ton of banks in the low $50 millions with us at this point in time. I actually don't know why there isn't.
As it relates to U.S. Bank, we do meet every single month. Every capital expenditure at U.S. Bank, get ready for this,
over $100,000 has to come to a committee. And that's the capital expenditure includes particularly properties, leases or
any kind of technology improvement. That's a very low number. We look at about a dozen items every month, and the
whole team is a managing committee. And so, if somebody in commercial real estate needs a special new program
that's going to cost them $100 million, I got to look at the rest of the 13 people and say, are you willing to add $200
million in revenue over the next three years to offset this? And guess what? When the vote is taken by the group,
sometimes it's no. But we all know that we've got to be able to return our investments in a fairly short time.
So in closing, if we could do an ROI and everything in less than one year, it gets approved here every minute. If it takes
two years it gets contemplated, given the circumstances. If it's probably more than three years, we're very, very careful
and thoughtful about it. So I know that we are not improving every single thing that is revenue-improving three years to
four years from now. I know we're not. But I also know we're improving everything that has the highest value in the
next couple of years, and the minute the world gets better, I've got a list from most important to least important that will
go right back into the coffers. We will approve them immediately, and the shelf is full of the next best ideas so that we
don't linger and lose any time to get back to spending money.
So I didn't answer your question very well, but to say discipline, knowing what you're doing. Put it in the hands of the
employees where they control their fate, give them a forecast to show them what a decision's going to mean so they can
make that decision on their own or collectively as leaders, and they'll always make the right one. And then they don't
feel like they're told how to run the place and they feel like you respect them for the qualities of their leadership that we
do. So that's my long answer to your question.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: So I guess I interpret that as you're saying, yes, there's still lots of fat in the banking
industry that can be cut.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, I'm saying that. I'm. Why didn't I just say that? Why do I talk so much, Nancy? What's
wrong with me? Yeah, that's what I meant.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. Secondly, if I'm reading the news correctly, the Supreme Court just refused to hear a
case about swipe fees. Am I reading that correctly?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: That's right.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: And does that mean that this issue will now go away, or do you think that the retailers are
going to come back with some other new slant on this?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I think, in terms of a life cycle, it goes away for all of us on this phone. It could go back,
come back in a few years and has another 10-year to 15-year life cycle. But in this half generation, I think, by all
accounts, exclamation point, this one is dead.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Insert applause. Thanks, Nancy.
