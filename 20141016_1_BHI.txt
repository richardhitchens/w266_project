MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Hello, my name is Lorraine, and I'll be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to
the Baker Hughes Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any
background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]
I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Trey Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may proceed.
Trey Clark
Thank you, Lorraine. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Baker Hughes third quarter 2014 earnings
conference call. Here with me today is our Chairman and CEO, Martin Craighead; and Peter Ragauss, Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation and the earnings release that was issued earlier today can
be found on our website at bakerhughes.com.
As a reminder, during the course of this conference call, we will provide predictions, forecasts and other
forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectation, these statements are not guarantees of future
performance, but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We advise you to review our SEC filings for discussion
of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also, reconciliation of operating profits and
other non-GAAP measures to GAAP results can be found on our earnings release and on our website at
bakerhughes.com under the Investor Relations section.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Martin Craighead. Martin?

Thanks, Trey, and good morning. This quarter, we delivered a number of positive milestones including record revenue,
record EBITDA and record free cash flow. Yet as the quarter unfolded, market dynamics began to shift causing
margins in several of our operating segments to diverge from our expectations. This included region-specific trends that
required immediate action and some evolving macro themes emerging for the coming year.
Among the challenges this quarter were several geopolitical events across international operations. Disruptions in
Libya and Iraq and a sharp fall in the Russian ruble pressured our revenue and margins in the Eastern Hemisphere. And
in the Gulf of Mexico, profitability dropped sharply due to a significant number of deepwater rigs that were shutdown
waiting on unusually strong ocean currents to subside.
Among the positive trends emerging, our Latin America segment is delivering profitable growth. Recent wins in
markets where technology is valued, such as offshore Mexico and Brazil, are resulting in revenue growth and margin
expansion.
And within our United States onshore business, the recent increase in activity and service intensity per well has caused
strong demand for pressure pumping services and rapid tightening across the market.
The trend of more horizontal drilling, longer laterals, more stages per well and more proppant per stage has soaked up
the remaining spare capacity in the market. These market forces, along with actions we've taken to transform our
pressure pumping business, have set the stage for robust growth in our North America segment, accompanied by solid
increase in margins for the fourth quarter.
In the end, although the sequential results remain positive, including a 5% increase in revenue and more than a 10%
growth in adjusted net income, the quarter fell short of our expectations. I want to highlight a few of the actions we
have recently taken to mitigate some of the industry challenges going forward and to increase earnings in the
short-term.
In North Africa, in response to the industry-wide disruptions experienced in our onshore Libya, we've consolidated
several operations and restructured our geomarket to streamline our business and improve efficiencies. These savings
will be realized in our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian segment beginning in the fourth quarter.
In Iraq, where the industry has also seen disruptions, we completed the demobilization of a large turnkey contract
during the third quarter. This action will contribute to increased profitability in our Middle East/Asia Pacific segment in
the fourth quarter.
In Venezuela, we've employed an alternative business model to support and partner with local providers. Through this
unique approach, we continue to enable energy production in this critically important country while simultaneously
improving profitability. These are examples of actions we've taken which will deliver increased margins in each of our
international segments, including the resumption of growth in the Eastern Hemisphere next quarter.
That brings me to North America, where our number one priority has been and continues to be increasing margins. The
lack of margin expansion in the third quarter is mainly attributed to a sharp decline in our Gulf of Mexico geomarket.
This operation, which is one of our most profitable businesses in the world, experienced a significant drop in deepwater
activity as a result of abnormally strong ocean currents which caused several key customers to suspend operations.
In total, 13 different deepwater rigs were delayed at some point in time during the quarter causing a significant decline
in well construction activity. The loss of this high-quality revenue impacted our North American margin by
approximately 150 basis points.
At the same time, in our onshore operations we were very pleased with the tremendous growth in our pressure pumping
business. This one product line grew almost 25% in one quarter and accounted for 75% of the sequential revenue
increase in North America.
The earnings contribution from this growth more than offset the lost operating profit in the Gulf of Mexico. Although
pressure pumping margins did increase sequentially due to rising input costs that we were not to able recoup until later
in the quarter, incremental margins were not as strong as we expected.

With better commercial terms now in place, our pressure pumping business today is substantially stronger than it was
only three months ago. Efficiency is better, utilization is high, and new pricing has now taken hold. Outside of pressure
pumping, our other product lines are performing very well. Newly introduced well construction and production
technologies are seeing strong demand, and our new product introduction metric is on pace to be the highest it's ever
been.
Our outlook for the short-term remains positive and I'm confident we will deliver strong earnings growth and free cash
flow in the fourth quarter. As we look beyond the short-term, we see a number of evolving macro themes which are
shaping our outlook and strategic plans for the coming year.
Later in the call, I'll provide more details on the themes we are seeing emerge, and why I am confident that our
strategy, technology portfolio and investment position will allow us to navigate these market conditions.
But first, let me turn it over to Peter for additional details on the quarter and our guidance on the near-term. Peter?
Peter A. Ragauss
Thanks, Martin, and good morning. Today we reported adjusted net income for the third quarter of $447 million or
$1.02 per share. Adjusted net income excludes $14 million in before and after-tax charges or $0.03 per share relating to
the impairment of a technology-related investment. Adjusted net income also excludes $58 million in before and
after-tax charges or $0.13 per share associated with business restructuring of our North African geomarket, resulting
primarily from the recent disruption of onshore operations in Libya. This charge includes reserves for doubtful
accounts, inventory and certain other assets along with severance costs.
Concurrent with the restructuring of this business, certain North African entities previously reported in our Middle
East/Asia Pacific segment are now reported within our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian business. Likewise, the historical
financial results of these two segments have been revised to reflect this change.
Compared to the previous quarter adjusted earnings per share increased $0.10 or 11%. On a GAAP basis, net income
attributable to Baker Hughes for the third quarter was $375 million or $0.86 per share. Revenue for the third quarter
was $6.25 billion, a record for Baker Hughes and an increase of $315 million or 5% compared to the second quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was also a record for Baker Hughes at $1.19 billion, up $29 million or 3%
sequentially.
To help in your understanding of the quarter's results, I'll bridge last quarter's earnings per share to this quarter. In the
second quarter of 2014, we posted GAAP net income of $0.80 per share. First, add back $0.12 for litigation settlements
and the Venezuela currency devaluation, which were highlighted in the first quarter. That brings us to a second quarter
adjusted EPS of $0.92.
Moving to the third quarter. Add $0.06 for North America operations due to increased U.S. onshore activity and a
seasonal increase in our Canadian business, both of which were significantly offset by reduced deepwater activity in the
Gulf of Mexico. Subtract $0.04 for international operations due to reduced profitability, primarily in our Eastern
Hemisphere segments, which was partially offset by increased profitability in Latin America.
Next, add $0.05 for reduction in corporate costs and non-controlling interest and add $0.03 for a lower tax rate. That
brings us to adjusted earnings per share of $1.02 this quarter. To get to GAAP earnings per share of $0.86, subtract
$0.16 for the technology investment impairment and for the business restructuring in North Africa.
From this point on in the conference call, any comments on revenue, operating profit and operating profit margin refer
explicitly to Table 5 in our earnings release, which excludes these adjusting items.
Taking a closer look at our results from operations. We posted record revenue in North America of $3.16 billion, up
$312 million or 11% sequentially. North America operating profit was $380 million, up $40 million sequentially. As a
result, our North America operating profit margin was 12%.

The low incremental margins are attributed primarily to core mix. Essentially, lower margin revenue growth from
pressure pumping was partially offset by reduced high-quality revenue in the Gulf of Mexico.
Moving to international results, we posted revenue of $2.76 billion, which was flat versus the prior quarter. Operating
profit was $375 million, a decrease of $29 million versus the prior quarter. Revenue in our Europe/Africa/ Russia
Caspian segment was essentially flat compared to the second quarter.
Margins declined 310 basis points due largely to unfavorable exchange rates, which impacted profitability by
approximately 200 basis points. This includes a 15% drop in the value of the Russian ruble. Margins were further
impacted by unfavorable mix in Africa late in the quarter, which more than offset increased business in Europe.
Our Middle East/Asia Pacific segment saw a slight drop in revenue during the quarter. This is partially attributed to
reduced revenue in Iraq, where we demobilized on a major contract during the quarter. Additionally, planned product
sales in Asia were lower than expected.
In Latin America, revenue increased 5% and operating profit margins improved by 180 basis points. We achieved
growth in Mexico and Argentina and within our pressure pumping and completion systems product lines. This growth
was partially offset by significantly reduced revenue in Venezuela, reflecting the adoption of SICAD 2 late last quarter.
For our Industrial Services segment, we posted revenue of $333 million, which was flat sequentially. Operating profit
margins were 10.5%, up 30 basis points over the prior quarter.
Looking at the cash flow statement and balance sheet, during the quarter, we generated $725 million in free cash flow,
a record for Baker Hughes. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.2 billion, unchanged from the prior quarter.
Total debt for the quarter declined by $144 million or 3% sequentially to $4.4 billion, and we ended the quarter with a
debt-to-capital ratio of 19%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $425 million.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares on the open market, totaling $200 million. This
leaves just over $1 billion remaining under our previously announced authorization to repurchase shares. Also during
the quarter, as previously announced, we acquired a pipeline and specialty services business for $246 million in cash.
Now let me provide you with our guidance for the fourth quarter. Beginning with our North American business, we
project the U.S. onshore well count will continue to modestly increase into the fourth quarter, as we expect the holiday
period slowdown to be less pronounced than prior years. In Canada, the average rig count is projected to increase about
10% sequentially. And in the Gulf of Mexico, we expect activity to return to normal levels and to include a backlog of
well construction projects.
In summary, for the fourth quarter, we expect North American market conditions to be favorable, resulting in a healthy
increase in revenue and margins sequentially.
Turning to Latin America, revenue and margins are both expected to rise, based on year-end product sales; increased
activity in offshore Mexico; and a new favorable contract for drilling services in Brazil, which is expected to start in
December.
Our Middle East/Asia Pacific segment should also benefit from year-end product sales. Additionally, with the
demobilization in Iraq behind us, profitability in this country is expected to contribute to increased margins across this
segment.
In Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian, we expect higher activity in year-end product sales in Africa. This growth is expected
to be partially offset by reduced activity and profitability in Russia. As a result, revenue and margins are expected to be
up slightly for the fourth quarter.
In summary, across each of our oilfield segments, we expect to see an increase in revenue and margins to end the year.
For our Industrial Services segment, revenue should increase about 5% sequentially. This includes our recently
acquired pipeline and specialty services business, which is partially offset by seasonality in our existing process in
pipeline services business.

Margins should be in line with the third quarter. With respect to non-operational items, corporate costs are expected to
be between $65 million and $70 million. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $60 million. The fourth
quarter effective tax rate should be similar to the third quarter adjusted tax rate or about 35%. And finally, capital
expenditures should be around $500 million.
At this point, I will now turn the call back over to Martin. Martin?
Martin S. Craighead
Thanks, Peter. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our industry is seeing a number of evolving dynamics. The most
obvious being the recent slide in oil prices. If oil remains at these levels for a sustained period of time, it will clearly
have an impact on our customers in the form of reduced cash flow and, accordingly, less funds available for capital
expenditures.
In the near-term, we could see customers curtail activity, especially those who are more sensitive to commodity prices
or pursuing marginal onshore and shallow water plays. But for national oil companies and deepwater customers, two
areas where Baker Hughes is in a very strong position, we do not expect to see a meaningful change in activity anytime
soon. And if lower commodity prices continue to drag on, we may also see divergence between international and North
American markets.
Historically, when commodity prices soften, North America activity levels are the first to adjust. But today, the
combination of a stable business environment and more predictable production from the unconventionals has made
North American activity more resilient. With current breakeven prices for most basins in the $60 per barrel to $70 per
barrel range, we do not expect to see a meaningful pullback in North American activity in the near-term.
Although our customers are still in the process of refining their 2015 budgets; at this time, from what we are hearing
from them, we continue to project increased well counts and increased spending per well. In addition to fluctuating
commodity prices, our industry is encountering a steady stream of complex geopolitical issues.
As an example, Baker Hughes has made a number of long-term strategic investments in Russia, including
manufacturing facilities, a world-class technology center, and a strong local workforce. Russia has been a source of
profitable growth for Baker Hughes and today contributes about 2.5% of our revenue. The U.S. and EU sanctions and
subsequent drop in the ruble will obviously reduce growth opportunities going forward. So within the context of these
market dynamics, I want to provide more detail on my continuing confidence in the near-term outlook for Baker
Hughes.
Starting with North America. We're on a path to deliver meaningful revenue and margin growth. Our strategy to
transform our pressure pumping business is hitting all its metrics. Here are the three main reasons why we project
profitability to increase significantly for this product line in the fourth quarter and into next year.
First, better utilization. We entered the third quarter with a handful of fleets that were idled, and today we're essentially
fully utilized with no idle equipment remaining. This will result in higher utilization and better absorption in the fourth
quarter.
Second, increased stage counts. The trend of more horizontal wells, longer laterals, and higher stage density continues.
Additionally, the transition of our fleet to 24-hour operations is ahead of schedule. And today, 70% of our fleets are
operating around the clock, and we expect this figure to increase by the end of the quarter. Based on higher utilization
rates and more 24-hour operations, we're on pace to complete the highest stage counts since early last year.
And third, and most importantly, higher revenue per stage. Tightening market conditions have allowed us to be more
selective with the customers we work for. Just as we've secured more 24-hour operations, we've also secured contracts
with better pricing. More than half of our business today is performed under new commercial terms, which were
secured just in the last couple of months. And we're now seeing the full benefit of this turnaround today.

In addition to the accelerated transformation of our customer base, we're also benefiting from incremental cost
reductions resulting from actions we've recently made to reduce maintenance costs and optimize our supply chain.
These actions are helping us handle the rising logistical challenges associated with increased activity levels and
volumes of raw materials per well. Across our other product lines, newly introduced technologies designed to improve
well efficiency and optimize production are well embedded in the market.
To give you just a couple of examples, our customers have used AutoTrak Curve to drill more than 15 million feet in
North America so far. That's a remarkable milestone for a product only three years into its lifecycle, and underscores
the value of a technology that is redefining the technical limits of drilling in the unconventionals.
On one project, for a major operator in the Marcellus this quarter, we drilled more than 7,300 feet of lateral section in a
24-hour period. That's a record for us in North America and something that used to take four days or five days before
the AutoTrak Curve was launched.
And the other obvious example is our FLEXPump artificial lift technology. We introduced FLEXPump on an earnings
call last summer. This technology is helping our customers to reduce lifting costs and boost IPs. In a little more than a
year, we already have about 4,000 FLEXPump systems in the ground.
For our customers, products like these are no longer novelties, but are now necessities. And when our customers are
searching for ways to cut cost and boost production, only technology can provide a real step change in performance and
our differentiating value for Baker Hughes.
Internationally, we are pleased with our current position. We expect to benefit from a pair of key market segments
which tend to be less impacted by short-term oil price fluctuations. First is the deepwater market, based on lengthy
planning cycles and long production horizons, these projects are not likely to see a material impact in the near-term
based on today's oil prices.
During the last year, Baker Hughes has targeted and secured a series of long-term contracts for well construction
services in many of the world's most active and technically challenging deepwater markets. In West Africa, we've
secured several multi-year contracts to provide drilling services, cementing, fishing, wireline and production chemicals
for a number of deepwater clients. These contracts begin to take hold in the fourth quarter.
In Norway, our previously announced contract to provide completion systems to Statoil begins in the first quarter of
2015. In deepwater Australia, contracts for wireline services and drilling services have been awarded and are now
being executed.
And in Brazil, new contracts with more favorable terms for stimulation, drilling and wireline services will contribute to
profitable growth in both the near-term and longer term. The addition of these deepwater contracts is well timed and
will provide an outstanding source of activity going forward.
Next, many of our customers are national oil companies. With aggressive production targets for both oil and natural
gas, these companies have been the engine of growth in the Eastern Hemisphere this year and likely for years to come.
Over the last five years, Baker Hughes has made a number of strategic investments to increase our local content and
strengthen our alignment to the NOCs. This includes the geographic alignment of our management, the construction of
multiple world-class facilities, the creation of a global network of R&D centers and the hiring and development of local
workforces. The exceptional growth of our Middle East/Asia Pacific segment over the last two years is a reflection of
the strategy in motion and is expected to provide continued growth opportunities going forward.
To summarize, I'm confident that Baker Hughes is on pace to deliver solid results in the fourth quarter. And although
we expect to see some market readjustment in 2015, we're well-positioned for the months ahead.
National oil companies are expected to remain an engine of growth. Deepwater projects are currently moving forward.
And in North America, customer spending should remain stable at today's commodity prices.

But the most important long-term trend for Baker Hughes, the element of our strategy that transcends market conditions
is anticipating our customers' ever-increasing reliance on innovative technologies that enable the safe, affordable
production of energy. Against this backdrop, I'm confident the execution of our strategy will continue to deliver
differential earnings, increasing returns, and strong free cash flow.
Now before we turn it over for Q&A. I would like to take a moment to thank Peter as he concludes his last earnings call
before retiring from Baker Hughes. When Peter arrived as CFO, nine years ago, our revenue was a third of the size it is
today. We were a collection of seven divisions, and each with a different financial and management reporting system.
Under Peter's leadership, our financial organization has been transformed, as our systems and processes have been
standardized and streamlined, and made far more efficient across the entire enterprise.
So on behalf of the entire leadership team and our Board, we thank you, Peter, for your service and we wish you the
very best of luck going forward.
Peter A. Ragauss
Thanks, Martin. That's very kind.
Martin S. Craighead
Okay. So with that, Trey, let's open it up for some Q&A.
Trey Clark
Thank you, Martin. At this point, I'll ask the operator to open the lines for your question. To give everyone a fair
chance to ask questions, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and one related follow-up question. Can we
have the first question, please?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes
from Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Jim.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Martin, do you still think that you can reach 15% margins for North America by the end of
the year?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Oh, absolutely. Jim, I'm confident that we will. It's not going to be a walk in the park.
The Gulf of Mexico issue with the currents were certainly unexpected in the third quarter, we've ever seen them as
strong, and duration of them as far as I can tell is unprecedented. And going into Q4, we need some help there, if you
will, from Mother Nature that the Gulf comes back.
I think the thing to keep in mind, Jim, is that those particularly Mississippi Canyon completions that were delayed and
some of the drilling activity has not been cancelled. It's simply backlogged into the fourth quarter. So we're going to
have an extremely robust, almost maniac level of activity.

And then you have the backdrop of the pressure pumping market. Wells aren't getting shorter, and stage density is not
getting less and our customers are not going to pump less sand per stage. We were up 22% or so sequentially in pounds
per stage. That's going to continue. Maybe it'll slow a little bit. So that plus the continued absorption of some new
technology. I don't want to say that it's going to be easy. It's not. Nothing is. But I'm very confident that we'll deliver on
that number.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Maniac levels of activity is always nice to hear as long as I'm not the one who has to manage
them. So that's good.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That goes for me too.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Okay. And Latin America, both Brazil and Mexico, we all know they're going to recover.
You've won the drilling contract in Brazil, and Mexico is getting better. Can you just discuss a little bit the potential
magnitude, because I think we're probably going to need help from Latin America in 2015. Can you talk about kind of
the magnitude of what you expect to see there over the next year?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's a good point when you say a good help – some help, because I agree with you. The
first thing I'd say is we're not projecting a lot of activity in the market growth in 2015 for Mexico. And our successes so
far, and I credit our team, have been some pretty substantial share gains offshore on the drilling and completion side;
and I think that will continue. And then our projects up in the North have been quite well received both by PEMEX and
in terms of the bottom line. So Mexico is looking good, but I wouldn't say market-wise we're going to see a lot of help.
And in Brazil, you're right in referencing the share gain on the drilling contract. But it's not only the drilling contract
that's been recast, if you will. We maintain a large stimulation vessel position. That's been recast. Certainly the wireline
tender has been tendered and announced. But, again, the commercial terms are more supportive. But in neither of those
do we expect them to touch Q4. It'll be more of a Q1 activity boost for us. And then, again, the commercial terms are
more attractive.
But I'd say Brazil, through the end of 2015 and certainly into 2016. The discussions we're having with our clients there
is that they're going to reinvigorate on the exploration side far more than they have been over the last couple of years.
[ph] They've been distracted I'd say (29:55).
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Okay. Martin, thank you very much. Peter, all the best. I still think we need to build that
hotel though out by Baker's R&D facilities.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: I'm in.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Thanks, guys.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Angie.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: So, Martin, going to your comments in the prepared remarks, you said that you currently have
no idle equipment in pressure pumping in North America; and then your comments on the commercial terms. So first
on the idle equipment, does that imply that you've unstacked all of your cold-stacked equipment or just what's in this
field is all up and operating? And then on the commercial terms, have you had any success in net price gains or are
more cost recovery driven?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's a good question, Angie. I'd say that we have no – we activated the fleet in the third
quarter and we have no hot-stacked equipment left. And pretty much this quarter we'll empty any of the cold-stack,
okay? So there is nothing that can be put back into operations. There won't be a new build, certainly by the end of this

fourth quarter. And could you repeat your pricing question, you cut out on my end.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Yeah. On the commercial terms, was it cost recovery – you're increasing pricing on the
pressure pumping side. So was that cost recovery only or were you able to see any net increases in prices?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: We saw a net increase in pricing in the last few weeks of the last month. We saw quite a
bit of cost inflation, first led by freight, followed by sand. And the difference between Q3 and Q4 in that business and it
gets a little bit back to Jim's question, about 70% of our business is contracted, about 70% of those contracts now have
indexed pricing adjustments. So I expect that in Q4 we're actually going to see a little bit of flattening on the inflation
that occurred in Q3. And the pricing lift above those costs will be far more material for that business line in Q4 versus
Q3, Angie.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay. Okay, that's extremely helpful. And then just as an unrelated follow-up, do you have
any kind of early thoughts given the changing dynamics both in North America and even to some degree globally Asia,
Russia on revenue growth rates for 2015, when you think about North America versus LatAm versus Eastern
Hemisphere, even directionally from your original expectations?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, that's a great and very broad question. Let me try to answer it this way. As you well
know and most of the people on this that are listening, our customers right now are in the throes of trying to determine
what their budgets are going to be for 2015. But I can tell you the channel checks I do with my peer customers are that
they're concerned with what's going on in the oil markets, but they're not at this stage – I think frankly because we're all
a bit surprised with the markets – are they willing to give it a whole lot of credibility either that these numbers are what
we're going to see in terms of commodity prices.
So they're still confident that I think at this stage that these oil prices are not where they're going to settle. And also,
let's also realize that as you've written about and your peers, the breakeven prices in most of these basins with most of
the customers are still well below what the commodity prices are. So I don't expect that we're going to see any
appreciable activity decline.
But if oil should stay at this level for a couple of quarters and give it, so to speak, more credibility that this is what the
environment's going to be, then certainly a few of the customers out there that are either more dependent on borrowing
or maybe have a less attractive subsurface position could sideline. But I don't see that being material for us or, I guess I
am not projecting that anytime soon.
Internationally, I can't predict, nor can I control some of the issues that are going on geopolitically. Certainly, as you
know, Angie, we've talked about Russia. It has been a great growth engine for us. That's just not going to be there for a
while. We're hopeful. We're monitoring it and we're watching it very closely.
And for the Middle East, some slippage in Iraq is going to be more than offset by strength in the rest of the Gulf, led by
Saudi. So I am bullish on [ph] earth (35:04) overall. And in [ph] MEHAB (35:06) led by the Middle East. And as we
talked about on the previous question, Latin America is going to be a bright spot from an international perspective.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Perfect. Thank you for all your color. And, Peter, I also wish you the best on your retirement.
Thanks again, Martin.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Thanks a lot, Angie.

<Q - Byron K. Pope>: Martin, when I think about the benefits of you guys having reorganized your North America
region by geomarkets almost a year ago, I guess it's been, it would seem as though you guys are pushing toward being
better aligned with the types of E&P operators that see the value of your service-value combination. So I guess my
question is, how far along are you in terms of having migrated your North America customer base to those sorts of the
E&P operators?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I'd say we're probably – it's been a year now. Probably 75% would be a rough estimate
depending on how you characterize that. I guess that it certainly has always been that way in the Gulf of Mexico, but on
North America land I'd say probably about 75%, Byron.
<Q - Byron K. Pope>: Okay. And then just a follow-on question, based on what you're seeing in past cycles, obviously
no one really has a good view at this point on how North America activity progresses over the next 12 months. But
when I think about Baker technologies like FLEXPump, ProductionWave, SHADOW series frac plugs, it seemed as
though the customer adoption rates should prove fairly healthy barring some game over scenario on the commodity
price front. But I'm just curious as to what you tend to think historically as it relates to new technology adoption by
customers when activity perhaps slows, growth rates potentially slow a little bit overall?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah. That's very good question. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're all going to be
in a much better position as far as North America is concerned, no matter what the global scenario is because the
unconventionals provide a far better level of predictability for our customer, both in terms of costs per well, which are
going down, because we're more into this industrialization, if you will; and the geological risk of these wells is less
than what it's been to previous cycles. So North America land will certainly be a lot more resilient.
And maybe a little bit to your – first part of your question. As these customers perhaps, let's say, get a little bit more
scrutinizing on ultimate recovery figures and initial flow rates, then there is an emerging group of technologies within
our organization that are aimed right at the unconventionals, right?
So you don't want to be drilling with a conventional motor bottomhole assembly when your peer is drilling on the
adjoining lease with AutoTrak Curve, because you're going to get your tail kicked. And I don't think they're going to
want to be in a position – and that's why I say things like AutoTrak Curve, and FLEXPump and ProductionWave are
not novelties. They are changing the conversation with the customer. And we don't ever want to see a tightening price
or cost environment, but on the other hand they will be more front and center with our customers as their budgets
perhaps become a little bit more strained.
So I feel great about our portfolio, as it relates to the customer situation. The second thing is, Byron, and you know this,
it may go more to an OpEx world than a CapEx world for our customers. And, again, there is ProductionWave, there is
upstream chemicals right at the heart of maximizing production and cash flow for our customers. So I'm realistic about
what's going on, but I am also extremely excited about the way we fit in terms of being able to solve some of these
problems.
<Q - Byron K. Pope>: That's helpful, Martin. Appreciate it. And, Peter, wish you the best.

<Q - James West>: Thank you. So, Martin, would you say that as we look into 2015 that your growth outlook versus,
say, your peer group is differentiated given your market share gains and contract wins in North Sea, Brazil, parts of
West Africa. Is that a fair statement?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's a very fair statement. Sometimes, what do they say, better to be lucky than smart?
<Q - James West>: Right.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Six months ago we didn't see this what we're experiencing today; and six months from
now, it could be a whole lot different. But six months ago, a year ago, we pick up one of the world's largest drilling
contracts, I think the world's largest ever completions contract. Obviously, a realignment in Brazil; all the biggest
deepwater markets with some of the world's best, most stable, consistent operators. Now I am not predicting as what
the world looks like six months, a year, three years from now, but these are five-year, seven-year, eight-year long
contracts with price escalations and so forth. So no matter what, these are the rigs you want to be on.
<Q - James West>: Right.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: And these are the customers you're going to want to be working for. So I think our teams
have done an excellent job in fielding a portfolio of some nice international work.
<Q - James West>: Okay. Good. Good. And in Latin America, a nice pickup in margins there. You made comments
about margins at your Analyst Day back over this year. Can we move Maria's goals forward at this point? And if so,
where is Maria going next because she crushed it in Latin America?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: The business is exactly kind of going the direction that we've mapped out. Our strategy
has been risk mitigation followed by growth. I think you can see by the realignment of the business in Venezuela and
the repositioning in Brazil and some of the contract wins in Mexico that the strategy is following exactly, the outcome
is exactly as we planned. So I'd say that risk mitigation is never anywhere off the table. But now it's all hands on deck
for top line growth. And what I expect to see is some nice incremental margins as these contracts emerge in Brazil and
in Mexico. And then just a more appropriate business model for us in Venezuela should also be accretive going
forward.
<Q - James West>: Okay, great. And, Martin, thank you. And, Peter, best of luck in your next transition. And if it
truly is a retirement, let's go out and play some golf sometime soon.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah. Thanks.

<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Good morning.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Interesting times indeed. Hey, I'd like to get your perspective, you mentioned the work that
you've done to increase your utilization on frac in U.S., you've got some new commercial terms and contracts from
what it seems. I don't want to harp on too much of the risk dynamics, but with oil doing what it is, it'd be remiss if I
don't.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Sure.

<Q - Kurt Hallead>: So in terms of the contracts themselves, is there any breakage fees or is it a situation where the
terms are maybe more aligned with a land contract drilling dynamic, where they're going to have to use a rig or they're
going to have pay you some sum of money if they don't use your frac operations. Can you just give us some color on
maybe how these things are being structured and whether or not there is more, say, durability to the contract to maybe
prior periods?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: There are, Kurt, granted given our past and all. Maybe I could safely say that the number
of take or pay contracts in our portfolio is probably higher than ever for that particular product line in U.S. land. Our
customers – even as of yesterday, the key buyers are still biased towards securing capacity to deliver on their plans
before year-end and into Q1. So, as I said earlier, there is no indication that these folks are going to abate or slow down,
just none whatsoever.
And then on the cost side, if this does answer your question a little bit, 90% of our input costs around sand and freight
are now under some kind of contractual arrangement. So our exposure to the spot cost side is not that – I mean, it's just
a world of difference as to what it was, say, this time last year. So I feel secure with what our cost structure is going to
be. And we've improved the ability to more immediately pass things through.
In terms of visibility, the systems are catching it. We have auditing, if you will, mechanisms in place to make sure that
these things get passed on in a timely fashion. So I'm very confident that in spite of the uncertainty that's out there, the
Baker Hughes pressure pumping business will navigate whatever, if you will, storms should come to pass; if any do.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: That's great. So with the strategy that you've put in place to align yourself with the customers that
have more sustained programs, again, [ph] guys gone (46:21) back to your customer base and say, look, the economic
breakpoint maybe X, but what is their CapEx breakpoint? Where do they say, you know what, we're going to slow
things down. Is it – they have to see $75 oil on the strip by December. Any framework that you can help us get our
hands around so we can get the same kind of conviction that you may on how you're going to kind of work through this
challenging environment?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, it depends on the customer. But if we leave off – if we just look at the core, most
successful customers, I would say that it's – I think $75 is the starting point to where activity could start to slow. I don't
believe anything above that. And the second very big variable to that is the duration of it. So if we were to see $75 next
week, I don't think you're going to see one iota of activity slippage; none.
But if we're sitting at $75 come the holiday season or early into Q1, then certainly I think the conversations with the
customers will be different. So it's mid-$70s. And we've got to see a few months of that to give it, as I said earlier,
credibility that this isn't just bouncing all over the place, because our customers are still in a pretty good – the right
customers are in a pretty good economic position. The returns are still quite attractive, and you know that.
And there is a bit of a competitive uneasiness that they're going to be able to get all their work done that they've
promised you guys that they would do. And I don't think they want a – they don't want to miss that. So right now it's
full steam ahead. And I'm not – and like I said, most of the peers I talk to are not – my customer peers aren't nervous,
they're concerned, they're not nervous. They're watching it closely. But if it should stay down below $80 for a while,
then we'll probably – the conversation will change.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Got it. All right. Thanks for that. And, Peter, congrats and good to see a fellow Spartan do well.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Go green.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Indeed.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Thanks, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Bye-bye.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Marshall Adkins from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Marshall.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Let's shift to Russia, how much have things been shutdown there so far? And what's your
sense of where we go from here, let's say, over the next 12 months due to sanctions, et cetera?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, first of all, I can tell you what's happened. Our number one priority has been to
make sure that we navigate this with full compliance and focus on both the EU and the U.S. sanctions. I'm confident in
our systems – our software tracking systems that can really check everything to make sure that nothing is out of
alignment to where it's supposed to be.
I think the other thing that's a bit missed – or misunderstood I should say, Marshall, is that the number of rigs that are
actually associated with the projects that are being identified in the sanctions are pretty small; very few, very few. And
the financial impact in terms of products, sales or the services is absolutely inconsequential. And I think that's going to
even be going forward for the next couple of quarters, assuming the sanctions stay where they are because those
projects are not that material.
The problem has greatly been the impact on the currency, and I can't predict where that's going to go. And secondly,
concerns about access to capital and just an overall, if you will, cloud that's hanging over our customer community is
slowing things down, adding friction to just the entire commercial relationship.
So what I think you're going to see is just a shrinkage of what's being spent there. Not because it falls within the bounds
of the sanction, but because there is just a storm cloud and that people are not feeling optimistic about the outlook for
their business in country. Does that make sense?
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Yeah. That's actually – that's very helpful. So it sounds like no massive impact yet, but
maybe a slight downward trajectory due to the friction; and obviously the currency, which was my follow-up. Ruble
has been hit, but that's not the only currency that's been dinged.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's right. Exactly right.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: So on the currency impact that you had this last quarter, how much was ruble versus all the
other currencies out there?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: It was predominantly the ruble, Marshall. There's a little bit in the Stans. Their currencies are
linked to the ruble. But it was predominantly the ruble, not much else.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: All right. Hey guys, thank you all very much. And, Peter, thanks for all the help over the
years.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: My pleasure. Thanks.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Thanks, Marshall.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Thank you. Martin, I wonder whether you could just help with a little bit of a roadmap from the
margin you delivered in North America in the third quarter to the fourth quarter, given the dual impact of the recovery
in deepwater and the new pressure pumping prices and increased efficiency driving higher margins on land. So how
should we think about the combined impact of the two, which is the most important?

Page 14 of 16
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, yes, they are absolutely the most important, and then there are some peripheral
supporting elements too, right, in terms of the technology. But as we highlighted, you can get to 13.5% just because of
the missed activity by our customers and then us in Q3. As I highlighted I think in the first question, Ole, I don't expect
– now the rig issue has not completely abated as we sit here today. The currents are still an issue on the risers and on
the associated rigs.
Still I think maybe one rig's gone back out of the eight or so that were affected. But it's not going to be a normal Q4 if
and when these – not if, but when these rigs go back. So we're expecting an extremely strong Q4 that we didn't expect
when we were putting out our 15% guidance for North America. So Gulf of Mexico, while getting a slow start this
quarter, could absolutely deliver more than what it normally would.
And on the pressure pumping – and let me say this as well, our models suggest that even if we don't get a lot of the
Gulf to come back, what we're experiencing in the stimulations business right now will definitely get us within spitting
distance of it. And that's a hard number to predict of course in terms of the costs and the timing of things on the
pressure pumping, but it's very, very robust.
So Canada continuing. We've got a little bit of a holiday impact, but I can tell you that some of the customer
conversations are that they want to get these wells put online before the end of the year. So there will be a holiday
impact, but may not be as protracted as it's been in the past.
And you know there was another element. There was some weather challenges in West Texas, you probably heard
about. We didn't highlight it on the prepared remarks in Q3. It was quite impactful on a couple of fleets in the Permian.
That's past us now. So I can't give you an exact dollar for dollar – I just won't do that, Ole. But there's not a lot that I
could see that would hold us back other than in a protracted holiday period these rigs for some unbelievable reason just
don't get back to work [ph] in the gone (56:10).
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: No I was just – thanks for that. I was simply trying to back into how far along you are on the
restructuring of the old BJ or your pressure pumping division both in terms of what you've done on the equipment side,
and the customer side, and the personnel side and how far along are you?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: We're probably north of 80%, 85%. I mean, I would tell you we're 90%-some except that
this is not an area you should ever be satisfied with. It's infinitely perfectible. The infrastructure associated with the
logistics in moving the sand is just – you wouldn't recognize the organization relative, whether it's in the areas of
purchasing or contract management or logistics. It's completely overhauled.
And there has been quite a bit of talk about the impact of North American logistics on the pressure pumping business.
I'm not telling you we weren't up against the wall. It was tough. But we lost no work, disappointed, no customers. The
teams had all the products in the right locations with the right customers, and those fleets got the jobs done.
We added another fleet, and we're optimistic of what the opportunities are to do some more of that in Q4. And we'll
update you on the Q4 call. I don't want to tell you what our plans are. I'd tell you what we've done in terms of adding
capacity.
The customer mix is overhauled probably entirely. There I could tell you it's 100%. Now it's just managing the pricing
and the pass-throughs accordingly. So infrastructure-wise, supply chain-wise, customer-wise, it's all falling into place.
And, again, I could tell you that it's all done, but it's not, because it can always be better.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: So based on what you say, would it be fair to say that at some point in the fourth quarter your
pressure pumping group as a whole will start to close in on that mid-teens margin?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: The pressure pumping business in Q4 will – still it's my expectation will be dilutive to
the overall margin number. Now I'm only talking land, I'm not talking about the [ph] big picture in the (58:40) Gulf.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Exactly, yes, yes. Land, land, land. So...

<A - Trey Clark>: Thanks, Ole. Lorraine, let's go and take one more question, please.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question will come from Rob MacKenzie from IBERIA Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rob J. MacKenzie>: Thanks for squeezing me in.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Hi, Rob.
<Q - Rob J. MacKenzie>: Martin, I wanted to ask you a very difficult question I guess you've gotten several times
right now, but from a little different angle. And that's with the uncertainties that your customers in terms of commodity
prices on what they're going to spend, how do you think about in your budgeting process what you're going to spend
next year particularly in the context of long lead time items?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's a great question, and right down the heart of what we're spending our time on.
Let's start with the most obvious which is pressure pumping capacity. We've done a great job in lining up the right type
of suppliers to the equipment. We're a great assembler. We're a great designer, engineering of what the frac fleet of the
future should look like. The objectives there are putting more horsepower on smaller footprints. And the partnership's
with that supply chain somewhat proprietary, and we're having conversations today with them in terms of what do we
need starting in Q1 and Q2.
We're going to need – I mean as I think mentioned to Angie, there is nothing that's in the parking lot anymore. And
then within the context of the customer, vis-à-vis their budgets we're still looking at – if we even project a flat rig
count, which we're not at this stage, the well intensity is going to require a certain percentage, I'm not going to share
with you what our estimates are because we feel that's kind of competitive, of additional horsepower to get these jobs
done.
And our models also project or indicate, and you've seen this in some of the announcements from our customers, they
can't get the wells drilled with the budgets they've currently got because they're spending more per well. And we don't
see that trend changing. The well results are fully supportive of longer laterals and more stages and more pounds per
stage.
So it just doesn't – its incongruous to suggest that at this stage that we're not going to need more capacity on that front.
In terms of rental tools, if you look at the Middle East, if you certainly look at what's going on in Brazil for us, if you
look at what's going on in Norway with Statoil and us, it's biased upwards in terms of top line and therefore the capital
to support it.
I don't want to give you a projection at this stage. But again, we're not hearing anything from our customers. And, Rob,
a deepwater rig running today is going to be running next quarter and the quarter after that. They don't slow down just
because of a little bit of trickery around these commodity prices.
So we're pretty steady as she goes at this stage, and that's because that's what we're hearing from our customers. And
maybe that's fortunate for us, because of the way we're positioned with these customers now. So we'll leave it at that,
but it's all going in the right direction.
<Q - Rob J. MacKenzie>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: You're welcome.
