Greetings and welcome to the Third Quarter 2013 Monsanto Company Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions]
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank you. Mr.
Hurley, you may begin.
Bryan Hurley
Thanks, Christine, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining Monsanto's third quarter earnings update.
I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Commercial
Officer; and Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team are Manny Cruz, Ashley Wissmann and
Tim Boeker.
As usual, this call is being webcast and you can access the webcast and the supporting slides at monsanto.com. The
replay will also be available at that address.
We're providing you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. Where we
refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which
are posted to our website.

This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results, because these statements are based on
assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a
material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may
cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.
With our guidance update last month, we provided an early read on the factors in the quarter, so this call will be more
forward-looking as we focus on growth in the next year and in the next several years. Hugh will lead that with a
strategic view on our growth opportunity. Brett will fill in the milestones that translate that opportunity into our 2014
operational plans. And Pierre will bring this together in the translation to our current financials and guidance outlook.
Let me start by grounding the conversation in the basic financials. There's a brief review of the financial results for the
third quarter on slide four. As a part of our guidance update, we increased our full year outlook to $4.50 to $4.55 of
ongoing EPS, reflecting greater than 20% growth for the full year. We recognized that there would be some shifting in
our earnings pattern, particularly in Q3 from some of the factors in play this year and the Q3 numbers reflect those
trend factors we highlighted.
Ongoing earnings for the quarter is $1.66 per share, which is slightly above our expectation in our guidance update and
slightly ahead of Q3 in 2012. This quarter reflects some of the expected effects from the Brazilian soybean business,
lower overall planted cotton acres and the more visible effect of the higher drought related corn production costs. Those
effects were partially offset as we saw continued strength in Ag Productivity and the practical benefit as we had the full
positive effect of a discrete tax item flow through into this particular quarter.
On the cash side, through the quarter, we've generated $399 million in free cash flow compared with free cash flow of
$311 million through the first nine months of 2012. That increase tracks with the improvement we've seen in the
overall business balanced against some of the growth in working capital and our conscious deployment of capital
investment to support the business growth we talked about going into the year.
So with that, let me turn it to Hugh to lay out how we view our growth story over the long-term.
Hugh Grant
Thanks, Bryan, and good morning to everybody on the line.
As Bryan indicated, our results this quarter came in slightly ahead of our guidance update and they track with our
outlook for how the year plays out in total. So the power of our conversation today probably lies less in the direct
results and more in the color we see behind the numbers, through the trends and how those translate to our confidence.
The third quarter provides a unique view. With three quarters behind us, we're close to finalizing another year of
growth. But more importantly, we've enough visibility in our plans and drivers to confidently begin to project the
growth arc that continues in 2014 and carries for a multiple year horizon.
If I start with the reflection on fiscal year 2013 on slide five, the headline as we expect to deliver another year of 20%
plus ongoing earnings growth and that's our third in a row. That's a clear statement of growth but it's a more profound
statement on the ascension and the strength of our portfolio.
Most years the results come together differently than you draw them up during planning, but that's actually been an
area of strength for us this year. Our 20% plus growth comes after we've excluded the historic $0.25 of EPS from the
Brazilian soybean business and worked through the significant effects of the 2012 drought in corn and the pullback in
planted acres in cotton. At the same time, we've had different elements of the portfolio really step up ranging from the
strength of the Ag Productivity business to contribution from our international businesses. And that's what really
matters. I'm particularly proud of the resilience of our portfolio. Our growth is more global and it's more balanced and
because of that, we now have a portfolio that can manage the practical variability inherent to agriculture better than
we've been able to do so in the past.

If I broaden that perspective to our next fiscal year, we've reinforced our opportunity to grow mid-teens ongoing
earnings again in 2014. Our confidence in making that projection at this relatively early point is a reflection of the
continuing momentum, the underlying growth and the layers of opportunity that come together in our global portfolio.
In fact, we're at an inflection point where the visibility on these drivers isn't just about 2014. We expect to also drive
growth into 2015 as well and we are in a better position than we've been in some time to project our growth path over
multiple years as shown on slide six.
In fact, we've accomplished a couple of key things this year that set the strategic course for at least the next 24 months.
First, with the approvals for Intacta now in hand, it's the catalyst for unlocking a completely new wave of growth in
soybeans. It's much bigger than Brazil alone and it sets up a target market opportunity across our total soybean trait
portfolio of more than 200 million acres across the Americas as soybeans officially enter the multi-stack, multi-country
opportunity more typically associated with corn.
Second, the agreement that we reached with DuPont in the third quarter rewrites the U.S. soybean opportunity for us. It
also replaces a difficult relationship with a much more positive dynamic that has the potential to extend beyond
soybeans. Third, our international businesses have taken center stage this year and now reflect a significant source of
strategic and financial growth. While we often get caught in the debate of acres and products in the U.S., the reality is
that this year some of our strongest growth from key platforms like corn has come outside of the U.S. borders.
And finally on slide seven, we're demonstrating the early promise of some of the next-generation technologies that
have the potential to be the next wave of growth drivers that carry us beyond this decade. For me, the prototype of this
next-generation technology is our Integrated Farming Systems or IFS. IFS is in Ground Breakers this year and with
planting, we have already passed a breakthrough milestone. The prescriptions for more than 40,000 acres were
successfully transmitted and put into action for planting this spring.
That validates that data can transform something as time-honored as planting practice but we think it has a bigger
potential to transform how we help farmers make decisions about increasing yield. That same approach to unlocking
yield is playing out in our other platforms whether that's our trait pipeline or our new ag biological research. So I think
this year and next are key for early R&D milestones that foreshadow ongoing growth.
Brett will walk through more of the color and milestones for these drivers but in the near-term, the beauty of our overall
strategy is it carries forward into 2014 the momentum that has driven our success this year. We've made a conscious
effort to reconnect with our customers, develop and drive products that deliver more yield and multiply our business
onto a global stage.
Couple this with the backdrop of the global need for improved productivity shown on slide eight and you can see that
the significant opportunity for innovators like Monsanto to create a lot of value. Things like yields, acres and prices
will fluctuate from year-to-year, but structurally the business drivers that we're focused on continue to play out for an
extended time horizon. And I think that really underlines our core opportunity. If I summarize where we are at, at this
third quarter there's three points I'd emphasize.
First, with the conclusion of this year now in sight, we are on track to deliver our third consecutive year of greater than
20% ongoing earnings growth. Secondly and just as important, there's significant opportunity ahead. We've made an
earlier than typical declaration on the earnings growth in 2014 and that's a reflection of the momentum coming out of
this year and the opportunity that we see in our ability to unlock successive layers of growth going forward.
And that leads to my final point. As good as I feel about this year and as confident as I feel about how 2014 sets up,
what I like about our position is that we've good visibility on the critical drivers that carry Monsanto for the next
several years in a row.
So with that, I'll hand the time over to Brett to walk you through in more detail the strategic business milestones that set
up these near-term opportunities. Brett?

Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone.
Let me start off today by highlighting that our renewed focus on our customers is at the core of our overall opportunity.
Our success depends on the success of our farmer customers. That's why our ability to deliver better performing
products and a consistent pricing strategy is so important. And when those two things are done right, we see two
desired business outcomes shown on slide nine.
Number one, we see volume growth. The best example of this is our global corn portfolio in which we expect to hit a
third consecutive year of record total volumes, even with the possibility that U.S. planted corn acres come in lower than
initial estimates. That continues in 2014 and we expect to set another record with our global corn volumes.
And number two, we see pricing opportunity. I like the fact that every year we see incremental pricing opportunity
backed by the fundamentals of our business. The mix upgrade is our biggest overall driver, whether that's our global
germplasm portfolio or the acceleration of traits, and the consistent approach we've taken to pricing has resonated very
well with our customers. This year is a good example.
We've absorbed some additional costs associated with the effects of last year's drought, and we chose not to pass that
on to our customers. While this cost pressure has a short-term effect on our financials, it's the right trade-off as it gives
us the business flexibility to supply our customers and stay focused on our long-term pricing strategy. Over the last few
years, we've worked hard to find the sweet spot with our pricing philosophy that allows us to remain focused on our
customers and grow the business.
Now, let me tell you how these key themes, pricing opportunity and volume, come together in our growth drivers for
next year. We expect the biggest growth driver for Seeds and Genomics in 2014 will be the same as 2013, and that's
our corn germplasm platform and the power of the global upgrade on slide 10. Every year, we upgrade a significant
portion of our portfolio across key geographies with the newest, highest value hybrids. And going into 2014, this
germplasm refresh will certainly be as important to growth in – as it was this year. Coming into this year, we projected
a total seed portfolio price lift in corn in the range of 5% to 10% from this refresh, and that played out as planned. And
while we haven't communicated specific pricing, we project that same 5% to 10% range in price lift in our corn seed
portfolio for 2014.
This speaks to the consistency we want to reinforce with our farmer customers, the predictable financial benefit of this
annual upgrade as well as why our practical approach to pricing creates a positive lift, even in a variety of commodity
price environments.
The next layer of the overall corn upgrade opportunity comes as we accelerate trait penetration. If you move to slide 11,
you can see that there is significant opportunity in corn across the Americas. There are approximately 150 million acres
of corn in this region. And with our leading share position, the Americas provide a significant runway for upgrades.
We've seen strong demand in the U.S. for our reduced refuge family in corn. In fact, we now project this family will
come in at or above the high-end of our initial range of 36 million acres to 38 million acres. We expect to continue to
add incremental acres into that reduced refuge family next year, and we'll focus further on the compounding benefit we
get through the upgrades within the family as the highest-performing, highest-value products become an even bigger
part of the family portfolio.
If you move south of the equator, there's nowhere in the world that can touch the pace and impact of upgrades we're
seeing in Latin American corn. We're still in the early phases of the ramp-up of traits in Brazil. This year, VT PRO 2
reached nearly one-third of our branded portfolio, and this growth continues, as we project it reaches nearly half of our
portfolio next year.
In Argentina, the upgrade is to the triple stack, but the storyline is the same as Brazil. This year, we had Triple PRO on
about 40% of our brands, and in 2014, expect that to accelerate to roughly 60% of our portfolio. These upgrades are
important and powerful in the financials as they create significant margin lift on each acre that layers on top of our
normal mix upgrade from germplasm, creating an additive benefit.

As we round out the corn contribution, I'd highlight the last of our fundamental growth drivers in Eastern Europe on
slide 12. The corn footprint in Eastern Europe is as big as Brazil and has been expanding. Our breeding efforts are
fast-tracked, given that our U.S. corn germplasm fits nicely with Eastern Europe's growing conditions. And with our
ability to upgrade our offerings every year and our current business investments to support this growing business, we
expect this is another of the fastest-growing businesses in our global portfolio.
If we shift from corn to soybean, I'd highlight some of the layers of growth that start coming online in 2014 on slide 13.
With the last remaining key import approval for Intacta in hand, we officially enter the decade of the soybean as the
cumulative power of our next-generation soybean platform drives our financials in meaningful ways.
We have three breakthrough soybean technologies that build out our commercial portfolio: Roundup Ready 2 Yield
that boosts yield, Intacta that should revolutionize insect control, and Roundup Ready Xtend that is a whole new
weed-control platform. We expect these three come together as a multi-billion dollar driver in the next five years.
On this slide, you see that there are 200 million acres of soybeans planted in North and South America. This year, we
touched only about 20% of that massive opportunity with these next-generation products – and that was exclusively in
the form of Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the U.S. And just like we're seeing with the reduced family in corn, the demand
for Roundup Ready 2 Yield means we'll be at or above the high end of our original 39-million-acre to 41-million-acre
range this year.
And the opportunity is growing, as there's significant headroom here, and here's how I think about how that contributes
in 2014. In the U.S., the deal we struck with DuPont completely rewrites the landscape for Roundup Ready 2 Yield.
We now effectively reach 100% of the market opportunity, as I look at the total acre fit now touching the total U.S.
base of around 75 million acres.
That second wave ramp-up begins in 2014. Just as importantly, we get the first of our fixed royalty payments from
DuPont in 2014, providing a reliable new licensing stream that boosts our soybean portfolio contribution.
Then you shift to Latin America, where we're officially on the verge of launching Intacta, the first of our new
100-million-acre opportunities. On the product side, we now have the final data from our second year of Ground
Breakers, which are shown on slide 14. The second-year results confirm the better-than-four-bushels-an-acre advantage
on more than 1,000 locations. That's double the number tested last year. That's created good buzz, a strong base of
support from our customers, and some unique pull, as I believe farmers are as anxious as we are to see Intacta in
commercial fields.
On the process side, with the China import approval, our teams are now focused on the commercial rollout of Intacta.
The approval gives us ample time to position the seed with key customers and get everything in place for our planned
fiscal 2014 launch. With the upcoming Latin American planting season in sight, we're officially targeting around 3
million acres for the launch of Intacta, which would make this not only the largest soybean trait launched to date, but it
will effectively double our largest previous first-year opportunity.
In addition, we've been working with our customers in Brazil, and we will start rolling out official price cards soon, in
anticipation of our first year sales. We won't get ahead of our customer communication, but generally speaking for
2014, our planning projects retail prices that reflect the value we've seen through Ground Breakers and talked about for
the past couple of years. It's a pricing approach that we believe gives Brazilian farmers the right opportunity to see the
value of a breakthrough new technology while simultaneously supporting the opportunity for us from our fastest ever
soybean trait ramp-up. The cumulative opportunity makes our next-generation soybean platform one of our biggest
growth drivers, and the strategic milestones are right on track.
Against the backdrop of those incremental drivers of growth, we recognize one of the elements that added to the
strength of our portfolio in 2013 was our Ag Productivity business. After the challenges of the commodity cycle
through 2010, Ag Productivity and the Roundup business in particular has emerged nicely, and our strategy is working
well.

As we approach the conclusion of this 2013 season, the market environment has held strong, and our conscious effort
to layer our branded pricing on top of generics is providing some stability and added financial contribution. With the
next season around the corner, our line of sight is better than it was a quarter ago. But I look at this one year at a time,
and we see the Ag Productivity business in 2014 as a relatively stable contributor to the portfolio.
Let me wrap up by giving you my sense of how that portfolio comes together and more importantly, how it drives the
next level of incremental growth. First, I'd say that the last few years have been important in confirming our strategy
and speak to the renewed focus on our farmer customers. It's this strategy and an expanding toolkit to deliver better
performing products that underpins our confidence in the future, so we won't lose sight of our farmer customers.
Second, we felt a lot of momentum in the areas of our business that matter. I think that momentum continues, creating a
tailwind that I can feel throughout our organization. And finally, we're confident because this growth is in our
wheelhouse. It's in the areas that we know well with a strategy our teams own and it comes through drivers we've
shown we can deliver on.
With that, let me turn it over to Pierre to walk you how all of this comes together in the financials. Pierre?
Pierre Courduroux
Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone.
Hugh and Brett talked a lot about the strategic elements that drove our growth over the last few years and that give us
confidence in further growth going forward. I'll provide some early color on how I see this reinforced by some key
themes in the numbers for next year. Then, I'll end on how we see that growth translating into cash and guided – and
guiding our strategy for cash deployment.
But before I do that, let me reinforce our fiscal year 2013 guidance and use the year-to-date data to complete the
financial picture of our view on the year.
I'll start with a walkthrough of our guidance on slide 15. As Hugh said, every year plays out a little differently and
between factors like the exclusion of the historic Roundup Ready soybeans revenue in Brazil or the accelerated first
half growth from the early U.S. season, 2013 has definitely developed in a very different way than our historical
earnings pattern and that continues to be true in the third quarter where the quarterly results magnify some of these
factors. So to get the best view on our performance and guidance, it's most useful to focus on the year-to-date
financials.
Within the year-to-date results, I will emphasize the key drivers. Start with our global corn business. It is the biggest
contributor to overall earnings in the year and it is also the one driver that we have seen contributing to growth across
the board. For the year-to-date, our corn sales growth is 14%. Combined with a strong outlook for corn going into the
fourth quarter Latin American season that keeps us on track for mid-teens sales growth across corn for the full year.
From my perspective, seeing that consistent growth is critically important not just to delivering our numbers this year,
but also for supporting our confidence in the next few years.
As Brett mentioned, this year, we have made some conscious investments in our customers related to our corn cost of
goods and the full cost from the effect of last year's drought on our production are now reflected in our result this
quarter. So against our overall sales growth, we now have the visibility to say that we expect full year margins to pull
back a couple of points from last year's levels. We absorbed much of that cost, took care of our customers and still
delivered our bottom-line company growth. Just as importantly, these are not structural costs as they come from the
special circumstances caused by the drought. So we expect there is some potential incremental benefit in 2014 as we
return to more normalized conditions.
The strength we've seen in corn is complemented by better-than-expected results in Ag Productivity and the Roundup
business in particular. We've seen [ph] generic life seed prices are firm (25:22) into the second half of this year, and as
we stay focused on our strategy, we've managed to capture the practical upside from this positive pricing environment.

With that expected continued contribution, we expect the full year Ag Productivity gross profit to come in above the
$1.4 billion that reflected the high-end of our previous range. Just as important, with the visibility we now have, we
expect the contribution from the segment to stay strong going in 2014.
The other significant area to highlight from a gross profit perspective is soybeans. We've seen strong growth in the U.S.
as we've seen the mix benefit from the upgrade on Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans, however, this positive driver is
offset by the effect of Roundup Ready 1 soybeans in Brazil, which was excluded from guidance earlier in the year. And
you see these effect both in the year-to-date results and for the quarter as Q3 is the largest quarter where the Brazil
soybean contribution historically flows through our P&L.
The fact that we were able to balance against these moving parts through our global portfolio speaks to the strength and
the momentum we see in our business. And with the majority of earnings in hand for the year, we are targeting to
deliver $7.7 billion to $7.75 billion in overall gross profit. I will stay to the same year-to-date look as we move below
the line. As we look at SG&A and R&D spending, we expect to see positive earnings leverage for the full year with
total operating expense on track to grow year-over-year by mid-single digits as our total sales growth outpaces
spending. In the quarter, our SG&A expenses came lower than our earlier expectation as a result of a shift in the timing
of expenses creating a timing benefit of a few cents in Q3 from SG&A.
The last key piece in the P&L comes from tax. As we entered the year, we anticipated a tax rate in the range starting at
about 30%. Through the first half of the year, we've already seen most of the benefits of the discrete tax items we
anticipated coming into the year. And in Q3, we realized a significant cumulative benefit that impacts our effective tax
rate. I now expect our full year rate will come in a couple of points below our original 30% guidance as our owing tax
benefits are now likely to be more pronounced than what we expect for in a typical year. Practically, I'd also expect a
more normalized rate in Q4 as well as for fiscal year 2014.
From here, we have one quarter less to close out the year. With the improved second half outlook from last month's
guidance update and the final Q3 results, we expect Q4 will land relatively close to last year's fourth quarter. We'll see
how much of the upside in Q3 may flow through to the full year but what's important to highlight is that Q4 is really a
function of the contribution from our international corn portfolio with a strong start of a new growing season in Latin
America and the expected continued contribution from Ag Productivity.
Looking into next year, here are some key themes I see in the numbers. These themes are summarized on slide 16.
First, our expected growth comes on the back of our Seeds and Genomics business. With our expectation that Ag
Productivity is relatively stable in FY 2014, it isn't a major factor in our growth projection, so we are really focused on
driving growth from our Seeds and Traits engine. And that is a continuation of the things we consistently do best, like
creating annual mix upgrades through germplasm and trait acceleration.
Second, our growth really continues to reflect the strength of a global portfolio. Our portfolio is built on our core U.S.
business and an expanded global position as the acceleration and mix benefits in growing regions like Latin America
and Eastern Europe step up contributions.
Third, the strength of our portfolio gets compounded. Completely new growth layers start to come on line next year,
most notably the expanded opportunity with Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the U.S. and Intacta in Brazil. These early
trends signify more global business with more opportunities coming from a bigger portfolio than we've ever had. And
that reinforces our confidence in our financial outlook to deliver mid-teens ongoing earnings growth for fiscal year
2014 off of this higher fiscal 2013 base.
The last point I want to emphasize today is the continuing evolution of our cash strategy on slide 17. With the strong
cash generation we've seen to date, we are on track to meet our guidance range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion of free cash
flow for the year. Another year of strong performance further highlights our ability as a technology company to
consistently deliver strong cash flow. And with that strong cash position, we're continuing to evolve our approach to
cash use.
Last quarter, I indicated we'd be more aggressive in using excess cash. Practically, our cash strategy still focuses on
reinvestment in the business to support our global growth opportunity, but we are also moving to use cash over and

above our current levels to further prioritize our share buybacks and dividend programs. The best example of that more
aggressive approach is the recent authorization by our board of a new $2 billion three-year buyback program.
Practically, this is the first time in our company's history where we've doubled the size of our buyback program. Our
current program was approved in June of last year. So between what we spend for Q3, additional spending in the first
month of Q4 and our expected program for the remainder of the quarter, we have accelerated the current buyback
program.
Let me conclude by telling you that there are two things I take away from this third quarter. First, this quarter serves as
an early capstone for the year and with an expected full year of greater than 20% earnings growth, it confirms that the
strategic elements are aligned in our business. And second, it reinforces our confidence in growth for 2014. Fiscal 2014
is a continuation of the success of our current strategy with an even stronger global portfolio.
Thanks for your time. And with that, let me now to turn it back to Bryan for the Q&A period.

Thanks, Pierre.
We have Hugh, Pierre and Brett here as we open the call to your questions and as we typically do, I'll ask you please
hold your questions to one per person so we can take questions from as many people as possible. You're always
welcome to rejoin the queue for the follow-up question.
So, Christine, I think we're ready to take questions from the line.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Cox with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: Thanks a lot. Congrats, guys, on a great year.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thank you.
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: It seems somewhat early to be speaking to volume growth in corn for 2014 considering the
speculation that we'll plant fewer corn acres here in North America next season. I was just wondering if you could
comment on what gives you the confidence to make this statement and perhaps is this a reflection of what you're seeing
from fall orders or indications from South America?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, thank – Mike, thanks for the question. We had a record year this year, very strong volume
and a nice mix effect. As I made the comment on my opening remarks, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing in
the international business as well. And maybe, Brett, you can give a little bit more color on confidence going into
2014?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, I think as we look at 2014, it's important to step back and recognize that the global
demand for corn continues to grow by a significant amount. And as we project forwards, it's going to continue to take
some new acres, which we look to and I mentioned in Eastern Europe; but just as importantly, the strength of our
portfolio as we continue to perform well and look for share opportunities around the world in our global footprint. So
between a look to total acres globally, not country-by-country, and we look at it as share contribution. We feel good
about projecting 2014 growth.
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: Okay. And if I could ask just one quick follow-up on Intacta, given the value capture formula
you've described historically, and what seems that you're steering us towards for pricing as that rolls out, it seems that

that would effectively double seed cost for growers in South America on soybeans, and I would just be curious as to
what your thoughts are around any sort of pushback of that sort of magnitude of price escalation.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Michael, the two years the Ground Breakers down there and this last year we had 1,000 plus
farmers that used the technology. We're now very confident on our four plus sort of strong four bushel advantage
versus the older technologies, and we'll – Brett said, we're shooting for about 3 million acres or so, we'll sell out. So
demand is high and we'll price against that at farmer level and we're working through that farmer price level. We'll
price against that four bushels.
But, Brett, anything you'd add in terms of how growers are looking at early pricing?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Thanks, Hugh. I think the important part, as you mentioned, is the two years the farmers
have had the opportunity to participate in Ground Breakers. And when you have a 1,000 growers looking at these
opportunities and seeing the product perform in the field, that gives us confidence that they're seeing the value and
talking to their friends and neighbors about the value that they're seeing. And we're in the process of pricing today and
– right now and we're working through that conversation with farmers that I anticipate a very good uptake of the
product.
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: Thanks a lot, guys.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thanks for your questions.

Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Thank you. A question on corn margins. Pierre, you guided that we're going to be down or you
expect to be down a couple of hundred basis points for the year as a whole. I'm just wondering what was the overall
impact of eating that costs, because clearly you had positive mix benefits upgrading in both North and South America,
is it this quarter sort of 5.6 percentage point decline that's indicative of the full impact of cost year-over-year and do
you expect to gain all that back and more as we go into fiscal 2014?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Don, thanks for the question. I'll maybe ask Pierre to give you a little bit of color on this. I'd say
the headlines in corn despite a really tough planting season for our customers, record volumes, good growth, I'm
delighted with the mid-teens growth that we've seen in corn and for us, a conscious decision around consistency and
maintaining consistency between years. So we saw – we ate costs this year and frankly see it as an investment in our
customer base. So we consciously absorb that cost with the expectation that we'll see some of that coming back as an
advantage, both in customer sentiment and margin next year. But, Pierre, maybe you can go a lot bit deeper than that.
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: Yeah, maybe to be a little more specifically, we entered the year with a number of goals
regarding corn and one was to grow volume. And as Brett mentioned during the prepared notes, we are very
comfortable that we're going to be hitting a record volume in corn. The second goal was to be able to price and see
some price lift. And we've always been talking about a 5% to 10% price lift from a year-to-year perspective and we are
squarely within that range. So we feel very good. So the strategy is definitely working and it's, I mean, translated into
the numbers where we see sales growing, I mean, by mid-teens, 14% on a year-to-date basis.
So feeling very good about the strategic driver and where the business is going. However, as you mentioned, Don, I
mean, we are seeing the impact of non-structural costs that are definitely related to last year's drought and the impact it
has on our production costs, the need for us to bring back products from South America and grow product – more
product from South America, but that, as I mentioned, those costs are non-structural. They have disproportionate
impact into Q3 as you noted. I mean we are talking about a couple of points for the full year and you noted that you're
5% to 6% in the quarter. So this is disproportionate in Q3. This is non-structural and based on normal growing
condition and looking into 2014, I would expect ample supply. I would expect a normalization of COGS and from a
margin's perspective, I would certainly expect a couple of points lift from where we are right now. Having said so, I

mean this is based on seed production and seed has only been in the ground for a month, but we feel, as I mentioned,
non-structural and we see the margin lift next year.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Just a quick follow-up, you talk about your certainty on volume growth. So what kind of share
gain are you anticipating in U.S. corn in the 2013 season?
<A - Hugh Grant>: We're really pleased with the volume, Don, and we'll wait and see where the total planted acres
come out. The smaller the denominator, the bigger the numerator or the better that share growth will be. But based on
the number of bags that went out the door and the performance of the crop the previous year, I'm feeling pretty good
about performance. But that's still ahead of us, I think.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Hello?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Frank, good morning.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Hey. Good morning to you. Hey, a couple of quick questions here. Given the fact that other
companies have been talking about the weather impact on their ag chemicals business and you guys posted some pretty
good results in Ag Productivity. What would explain the delta between what you're doing and what the rest of the
industry is doing there?
<A - Hugh Grant>: In Ag Productivity, Frank?
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Yes, on the [ph] cost station (40:38) chemicals side.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, I think a piece that we saw really a nice offtake, and some of it in our international business,
especially in Latin America – and in the Northern Hemisphere, terrible spring conditions. Very wet. So it delayed the
ability of a lot of growers getting into the field, but when they go in, they're controlling bigger weeds. So you see an
increase in those rates as well.
So I think it's a combination of the growth that Brett talked about in Southern Hemisphere and I would anticipate those
rate increase with bigger, harder to control weeds in the Northern Hemisphere with a wet spring. So we're pleased with
the performance of the business both in volume and in price.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Is there any spillover effect that we could look for in terms of Ag Productivity into Q4 as well,
fiscal Q4?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So we expect Ag Productivity to remain strong in Q4. I mean that's certainly part of our
anticipation right now.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes. Good morning. Two financial questions for Pierre, if I may. First, on free cash flow,
it look like you maintained your range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion but it looked to us as though cash flow from
operations was adjusted lower and cash flow from investments likewise ratcheted it down somewhat. So I was
wondering if you could speak to the variances in those two buckets.
And then second, if you could provide an update on your commodity hedging strategy with regard to level and duration
of hedges and whether or not there's been any change there.
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So as far as the cash flow question is concerned, I mean, once we're getting closer to
year-end and I mean every quarter, we get smarter about how we see our detailed breakdown of free cash moving
forward. And we've done some corrections in the way we are looking at that. Fundamentally, as we've said from the
beginning of the year, this year we still feel very good about our cash generation and we are also, I mean, based on
what we've seen in recent year investing or forecasting to invest in working capital to rebuild some of our inventories
when looking at year-end. So we've been correcting some – the breakdown on our free cash and we got a range which
allows us to manage within this range. We still feel very good about the cash generation coming from our business. So
it's just adjustments we've made. And as far as the cash from investment, I mean the same holds true. It's just – we
know we've got a multi-year plan as far as our CapEx is concerned, and now that we're coming closer to year-end, we
are, I mean, more precise on how it's going to play out by the end of this year. So this is why we've been adjusting
some of the variables in our free cash. So that was your first question.
Regarding hedges, I mean, we've not changed our approach to hedges and as far as commodities is concerned, what we
are trying to do is get to predictable levels of commodity prices when we are thinking about our COGS, and we are
planning our hedges on a 18 months window and on a rolling window; that's something we've done for years and there
is no change there in the way we're thinking about it.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Okay, great. And then quick clarification, if I may, on tax. I think you indicated
something like a more normal rate for fiscal 2014. Just to clarify, is that meant to signal approximately 30%? In other
words, an increase in your tax rate year-over-year looking to 2014?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So what we've seen in the third quarter is we've been through the resolution of a series of
discrete tax items and we are very pleased because we validated some of the positions we've been taking. So looking
into next year and the fourth quarter that we are expecting a more normalized tax rate.
And as you were saying, Kevin, I mean when you look at those historicals, we are – we've always given a range of 30%
to 32%. We're now looking at the lower end of this range, based on the confirmation we got from those discrete tax
items.
And what's really important to mention – I think that's where your question is coming from – is when we are talking
about growth next year, and we're affirming our mid-teens aspiration to grow, we are not including any further benefits
from tax. We are getting back to normalized tax rate in our thinking right now.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes, that's exactly what I was after. It sounds like it will be a headwind for you, so that
maybe you're anticipating underlying operating growth a bit stronger. Thanks for that.
<A - Hugh Grant>: [ph] All right. (45:24). Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thank you. Maybe a week or so ago, I saw a presentation that was given down in Brazil to a
bunch of growers, and somebody there said that you had about 6 million acres of Intacta that you could potentially sell
next year. And so I'm guessing that's a gross number, and you're whittling it down to the 3 million by selecting for
varieties.

But could you talk a bit about that process and how it compares relative to what you did with Roundup 2 back in that
launch year? And just give us a sense of – I know you have that slide in the deck, but if you're working off of 3 million
acres or off of 6 million acres, how does that – and you're going to be sold out this year at 3 million acres – how should
we be thinking about the next two years of the volume you might have, and what might you be able to sell after this
year of 3 million acres?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Vincent, thanks a lot. I think you kind of answered your question with your comment on varieties.
So we're really pleased with the 3 million acres. It's always tricky declaring how big is big. But in Brazil, a piece of this
production is done by multipliers. So it's less transparent than it is up here, when you get through variety selection and
that sort of stuff.
If you think about 3 million acres – if you think of the 3 million acres and you contrast the Roundup Ready 2 launch,
the first few years that went, year one was a 1.5 million acres, year two was 7 million acres, and year three was 17
million acres. So really steep trajectory. So starting with the three-year or number around three years is a nice launch
pad.
But, Brett, maybe a few more words on production and transparency?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, I think, as I think about the Intacta launch, I step back and remind that we're looking
at this as a 100-million-acre opportunity, not just a Brazil opportunity. And it's absolutely critical that we have the best
and most successful launch that we can in Brazil. And that's what our focus is on. Whether it's 3 million acres or 6
million acres, really financially, it'll be somewhat immaterial. It's all about a smooth introduction of Intacta in South
America.
And as Hugh already mentioned, we're anticipating this to be the fastest ramp-up of a biotech trait that we've ever seen.
At the same time, even at 3 million acres, it's 2x the largest launch we've ever had.
So I'm excited to have around 3 million acres. And if it ends up being more, so be it. I'm more focused on a smooth
launch with a trajectory to that 100-million-acre opportunity.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: And if I could just ask a quick follow-up to Pierre, and this relates to the share repurchase.
Obviously, you've almost completed a program. You've announced another program, but shares have basically been flat
for three years now.
And I guess the question I'm asking is – and I know this information can all be done with the math in the 10-K – but
can you give us a sense of what you think the share creep is going to be over the next year or two, assuming the stock
price roughly where it is, or maybe a little higher? How much incremental share authorization do we have to offset
before we're actually going to see the share count go down?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So, Vincent, as we said – and I think we have to position that as part of our mid-term
strategy. Our goal is to reduce share count. And when you look at the first half of the year, to a certain extent, we've
almost been a victim of our own success with the share-price appreciation, which has accelerated some of the dilution.
But when you look at the time window we're looking at, which is a couple of years, our goal is definitely to reduce
some of the share count. And we don't expect dilution to accelerate actually, based on where we are today. And with
the programs we are putting in place, we are actually targeting a share-count reduction.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: But no sense of what the headwind is over – what it would be over the next couple of years,
just as things vest?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: Well, we've always been talking in a normal year of dilution in the range of $300 million
to $400 million. And that's still what we are thinking about.
Now as I said, depending obviously as you know on the stock price, this may accelerate some, or slow down. But the
$300 million to $400 million is the number we're working with.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: I was hoping you could help a little bit with the cadence of the bean business in 2014,
specifically since you're going to be introducing new seed into that market. Will that change the timing of payment and
when you recognize revenue for seed as you bring in the Intacta?
And then secondly, on the Pioneer royalty payment, how will that move across the quarters? And does it show up on
revenue or just as an income stream? Thanks.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Bob, thanks for the two questions. I'll ask Pierre to give a little bit more detail.
I think the way I would think about Intacta in this first year – and Brett is exactly right – the focus in the first year – and
it's the learning out at Ground Breakers. Happy farmers is a good thing. Smooth launches make for faster growth. So in
terms of change in quarters, I don't think there's a material difference in that first year [ph] relative to (51:10) Intacta.
The focus is getting the product into the right farmers' hands in a timely basis.
But, Pierre, quarterly shifts on Intacta, and then the DuPont booking?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So we're not anticipating major changes regarding to Intacta in terms of the
calendarization. I mean we're expecting it will follow mostly the patterns we've seen in Brazil, knowing that this year,
we're going to sell seed, and there's not going to be a revenue coming from [ph] POD (51:40). So it may be a little more
upfront loaded compared to what you traditionally have. But I'm not expecting huge shifts from that perspective.
And as far as DuPont's revenue is concerned, it will be booked at twice a year, if my memory is correct. But that's
something we may have to come back to you on in details. So it's going to be booked as royalty, I think, twice a year.
But I'll come back to you on this one.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Thank you.
<A - Hugh Grant>: The good news is less of a timing, and it's more about a third of the soybean market opens up for
Roundup Ready 2. So that's the real headline.

<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: Good morning.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Good morning.
<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: Given the emphasis on international growth, I have two questions in Brazil. One is on corn.
And obviously you have some ambitions there. But given the very high transportation costs and the fact that it looks
like no time soon will those logistic costs be addressed, farmers are just almost breaking even on corn, when you factor
in those freight costs.

And then secondly, and kind of a follow-up, we've had a lot of political unrest in Brazil recently. Demographics there
are a lot different. Farmers are much more wealthy, I think, than in the U.S. So do you think the political unrest will
change at all ag policy, as it affects your sales and your earnings in Brazil, given what's happened in the last several
weeks?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Mark, two good questions. I think in the – you're right, transportation, in beans, can be 45% plus
of total cost of production. But it puts more and more of focus on yield and optimizing yield on an acre.
And if you look at what's happened in corn in Brazil in five short years, production has gone through the roof on fairly
fixed acres. So it doesn't compensate for gas or distance travelled, but they're leveraging the assets that they have.
Brett, I don't – you've been there recently. Would you add in a little?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, I'll just add that keep in mind that the disproportionate volume of corn in Brazil is
produced for domestic consumption and the livestock feeding industry down there, and only recently have they started
participating in the export market. And that's not necessarily expected to grow exponentially. It's really more of the
animal-feeding industry growing and supplying that.
At the same time, I'd just reinforce the point Hugh's made. That's been one of our success stories in Brazil is – and it's
why you see the ramp of the biotech trait so fast – is it helps the farmer increase yield and productivity, and that puts
them in a better position, even with an inflated cost structure to be able to compete.
<A - Hugh Grant>: And then your second question, it's an interesting one. So there is unrest. There's been
demonstrations in Brazil.
I don't know if Brazilian growers are richer. They're bigger. They're highly technified. They're really focused on
production leverage.
I don't – we watch the Real. We watch the relationship to the dollar. We don't see any change on ag policy any time –
in any time soon, Mark.
I think the advantage we have is we are an insider in Brazil, in that we are producing and selling inside the country, and
agriculture is a huge piece of the economy. So I don't have any vision or anything there that would answer your
question directly. But I like our position with the footprint that we have in Brazil and the presence that we have in the
country. I think that gives us a little bit of foresight.

Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Hugh, I think Brett or you touched on the multi-trait – the multi-stack
opportunity in soybean beyond just South America. Could you expand on the timing and the potential of that going
forward?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, so Brett talked about the decade of the bean, so we see a long runway in this. But, Brett,
maybe just a quick word on the pipeline and how this plays out.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, I think so. So first of all, we're fully focused on successfully launching Intacta into
100-million-acre opportunity in South America as well as continuing the expansion of Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the
U.S. as another significant part of that market opens up to us.
But just as exciting is the near-term products that we have. I mentioned we have Roundup Ready Xtend coming, which
is the Roundup by dicamba trait that will be doing Ground Breakers in the U.S. Working through the regulatory process
here, and I will tell you, there's a lot of excitement at the farmer level for a whole new weed-control system that really
maintains the efficiency of the Roundup Ready system and makes it simple to control the difficult-to-control weeds.

And as we look at South America, that product also has a fit, particularly in Argentina where dicamba is already
registered, and a little bit later in Brazil where we have to go through the chemistry, but the product fit for South
America is just as strong as it is for North America. So it becomes a 200-million-acre opportunity for that product.
And also in that mix, we're also looking already at the second-generation of Intacta for insect control that will be part of
that portfolio in South America. So we have a really nice runway of innovation for that 200 million acre opportunity in
soybeans that I'm really excited about.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: And, Brett, just quickly, do think you gained share in soybeans in the U.S. in this year?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: It's a little bit like the corn situation, the farmers are just – what a tough year.
And as we sit back and look at it today, I feel really good about the success we're having with Roundup Ready 2 Yield
in the U.S., but I have no certainty yet of where acres are going to land and the trade-offs that farmers have had to make
between prevent plant and switching corn to soybeans and cotton.
What I would tell you that I focus on is, we're kind of in a unique position that when a farmer changes his mind on
corn, we have an opportunity with cotton and soybeans that not everyone else enjoys. And we're making sure that we're
getting the right hybrids there for the farmer to plant corn, if he chooses corn. We'll get cotton there in the south, if he
wants cotton, and we'll get beans there, if he wants beans.
And at the end of the day, I feel really good about how our soybean business looks in the U.S., and we'll wait and see
how the acres all sort out at the end of the day to know exactly where we're at.
<A - Bryan Hurley>: Christine, this is Bryan. I realize we're running kind of short on time. Maybe we'll extend it a bit
and try to squeeze in maybe three more questions here.

Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Hi. Thanks very much. Did your U.S. corn volume grow this year versus last year? And are
you bearing any exceptional costs for farmers now wanting shorter maturities instead of longer maturities or wanting
soy instead of corn?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Jeff, thanks for the question. So our volume is up this year. We – every year, we see those
trade-outs, and as to Brett's point, we're fortunate that we can satisfy those trade-outs.
The cost impact on that is fairly small. The advantage is you get something out in the shelf that the grower needs. And
at this point, I mean there's still beans – incredibly, there's still beans being planted. Being able to satisfy his second
pick or his third choice is a really big deal, and one that he doesn't forget. So it's more an advantage than a penalty.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Okay. And then lastly, the cash-flow guidance, as I think Kevin asked, was cut by $150
million sequentially. And it looks like your corn profits were sort of about $100 million lower than they might have
been, judging by last year's margin. So did something happen between the last time you reported earnings and now,
such that these two elements are meaningfully lower than one might have expected them to be?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Jeff, I think Pierre covered this. I'll ask him to say...
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: [Question inaudible] (60:35)
<A - Hugh Grant>: ...a few points on how a headwind becomes a tailwind. But we produced in a drought and sold in a
flood. And we consciously this year said we weren't going to jerk around on our pricing, and stuck to our consistency
with the growers.
But, Pierre, maybe to Jeff's point, maybe a little bit more color?

<A - Pierre Courduroux>: Yeah, I mean looking at the corn margin, which I think is what you're looking into right
now. As I mentioned, definitely, headwind coming from the costs that we've been – I mean – and non-structural costs
that have a disproportional impact on Q3 because that's when we moved the product from South America. So this is an
investment we've made in our customers, as I mentioned non-structural, and we are expecting this will play a positive
role when looking into 2014.
And as you mentioned, I mean the relative cost on our margins – you're talking a couple of percent. And that's
something that's been developing over the last quarter basically, when we got closer and closer to looking at the final
cost associated with this production. Which once again is related to last year – very unusual conditions regarding the
drought. So this is from the P&L perspective. And looking into 2014, I mean we are definitely looking into recapturing
those couple of margin points we've lost on our corn business related to the costs.
As far as free cash flow is concerned, it's more a rebalancing. As I mentioned, once again in between how fast we are
investing in our CapEx and also the need we have to rebuild some of our inventories looking into the end of the year.
So I wouldn't read more into the free cash because free cash has not changed. It's just the balancing in between our cash
from investment and cash from operations. I wouldn't read more into it than that.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thank you.
<A - Bryan Hurley>: Christine, we can probably handle those two additional questions now.

Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I've got two quick questions, one long-term, one short-term.
In the long-term, there was a recent Supreme Court ruling that basically says you cannot patent human genes. So when
you take a step back and look at your business, you're discovering genes, you're isolating them, you're inserting them
and a lot of technical steps in between. So what parts of this process do you think are patentable? And what could be
potentially at risk?
<A - Hugh Grant>: P.J., thanks for the question. I – we've examined the ruling, and we're watching this with interest,
and as we look at our business and we look at the mid to long-term impact, we don't see any impact to Monsanto. So
we feel – we just finished those reviews, we feel very good.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Okay. I'll follow up on that later separately. And then secondly, just a quick question on the POD
royalty collection system. Is it ready to handle Intacta? And then the split between you and the grain elevator, is that
going to remain the same because the absolute dollar level is going to grow up? Thank you.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yes, so – yes, I believe that the POD system is very capable of handling the launch of
Intacta and we've been in discussion with all of those participants as we've worked our way towards the launch and in
detail now, and as we finalize pricing and the launch of the product, we'll work through those specifics on how we're
going to share within the POD system, and that'll be something we can talk more about when it's finalized.
<A - Bryan Hurley>: I think, Christine, that puts us in good shape for our last question here.
Operator
Our final question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Thank you. Looking at slide 12 of the Eastern Europe opportunity, are you – number one, in
Eastern Europe, there was an earlier reference that you were number two overall in Europe. And maybe you could talk

about the transition from wheat to corn whether that's a broader phenomena across Europe and I don't know whether
even your plans on GMO wheat in your pipeline changed in light of some of the recent wheat events; maybe just some
commentary around the wheat trend in general and your share in Europe in the corn market.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thanks, John. Brett, maybe a quick word?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah. John, as you look at Eastern Europe, we're actually number two in Eastern Europe as
we look at it today. And as I mentioned, it's growing really fast both in acres as well as our shares. We extrapolate from
our U.S. corn base into that area as they match up very nicely. And to your point of wheat acres, yes, that's where some
of this growth is coming from. As we accelerate the yield gains in corn for an Eastern European grower, corn becomes
a more profitable crop for him to grow versus wheat. And I'll remind you that a significant part of wheat goes into
animal feed. Corn becomes an easy substitute for animal feed when you – and when you can increase the profitability
of the farmer, it makes a big difference. And I don't think this is a new phenomenon. If you look at the – at North and
South Dakota in the United States, 10, 15 years ago is mostly wheat; today, you look across those fields, it's mostly
corn and soybeans. And as I talk to our Canadian customers in Canada, they're looking at the opportunity to grow corn
as well. So I think this is just a real phenomenon that's playing out.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Thank you.
Hugh Grant
Thanks for your question, John. I'm just unconscious of the time. We run a little bit longer. Thanks for your questions
and your support as always. As I think about the third quarter, this is a call where the quarterly numbers traditionally
take a little bit of a backseat to the trends and the outlook, we very quickly look towards 2014.
So let me wrap up today by summarizing just a couple of key points to take away from our performance this year and
how it forms our future opportunity as we look at the next two years.
So first point, three back-to-back years of greater than 20% ongoing earnings growth. I think it's a clear endorsement of
our strategy and the continued focus on our customers, and the strength of our global portfolio. And I think it's fitting to
finish the call talking about Eastern Europe.
Secondly, we carry these elements into 2014, which reinforces our confidence in future growth. And thirdly, the
fundamentals in our business and the fundamentals in agriculture in general take a long runway. And that means that
the growth that we're talking about isn't just isolated in 2014, but we see a horizon of growth for the long-term and we
look forward to sharing that progress with you in future calls. Thanks very much for today.
