Thank you and welcome to Biogen Idec's third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage
everyone to go to the Investors section of biogenidec.com to find the press release and related financial tables,
including our reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our GAAP financials are
provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, which we
believe better represents the ongoing economics of our business to reflect how we manage the business internally.
We've also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.
I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current
expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially
from our expectations. I encourage everyone to consult our SEC filings for additional detail.
On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Tony Kingsley, EVP of Global
Commercial Operations; Dr. Doug Williams, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. We'll
also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our SVP and Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock.
I'll now turn the call over to George.
George A. Scangos
Okay. Thanks, Claudine, and good morning, everyone. The quarter marks another period of strong financial
performance and continued pipeline progress for Biogen Idec. Tony, Doug, and Paul will cover our achievements in
more detail in a couple of minutes and I just want to make a few introductory comments.
So revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion, up 32%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.35, up 23%.
Based on these results, we're raising our financial guidance for the year. In the U.S., the TECFIDERA launch continues
to go exceedingly well. According to IMS, TECFIDERA is now the leading oral therapy after only six months on the
market. Importantly, we've achieved this significant milestone by increasing our share in the overall market without
disproportionately diluting the rest of our MS franchise. We're excited by the initial success of TECFIDERA and its
trajectory, but our launch efforts continue and we need to remain diligent to fully capitalize on this early success.
As for the situation in the EU, I'm sure that by now you are aware of the release from the EMA on Friday that
announced [indiscernible] (3:01) was evaluating TECFIDERA and expects to make a decision on regulatory data
protection at its November meeting. We continue to believe that we're entitled to regulatory data protection and we're
working diligently to achieve that outcome. We'll have no other update on the EU situation on this call.
As expected, TECFIDERA has taken share from the injectable segment of the market. Within that segment, however,
AVONEX continues to hold up well. In the coming year, we look forward to the potential launch of PLEGRIDY, our
PEGylated interferon product candidate, which has the potential to provide patients with another efficacious treatment
option with less frequent dosing. If approved, we believe patients and physicians will view PLEGRIDY as a preferred
frontline treatment option in the injectable segment.
We continue to have confidence in TYSABRI's powerful efficacy and utility of risk stratification to effectively manage
patients. We have some work ahead of us near-term to ensure that patients with active disease benefit from TYSABRI.
Our [ph] fundamentals (4:06) remains unchanged. [indiscernible] (4:09 – 4:15), TYSABRI offers them the best
solution.
As you know, next year marks not only the potential introduction of PLEGRIDY, but also of our long-lasting clotting
factors, ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE. Today, I want to give you all an update on the regulatory process for our
long-lasting Factor VIII product candidate, ELOCTATE. Based on discussions with the FDA last week, there's a
possibility of a delay in the approval of ELOCTATE. The matter under discussion does not pertain to the safety or
efficacy of the product or any of the clinical trial data. It pertains to the validation of certain steps in the manufacturing
process, and we are in an active dialogue with the FDA. It's a bit premature to discuss this development since it is so
recent and evolving, and unfortunately, we cannot be more precise about the matter or timing at this time. However, we
know that approval of ELOCTATE is important for the hemophilia community and our investors, and we wanted to be

up-front on the call. When we have more complete information, we'll update you at that time.
I do want to remind everyone that, in addition to the three products now under regulatory review, we have a number of
promising drug candidates in mid-stage clinical testing, and we expect to have meaningful readouts on up to six of our
compounds by the end of 2014. It's unlikely that all six will be positive, but we're hopeful that some of these will
represent the next wave of Phase III product candidates.
In summary, we had an excellent quarter commercially and financially, and are raising our guidance for the year. Our
pipeline is making good progress; we'll know more about European regulatory data protection next month, and we'll
update you on the ELOCTATE situation at an appropriate time.
I'll now turn the call over to Tony.
Stuart Anthony Kingsley
Thanks, George. The commercial team is executing on all fronts as we continue to grow our MS franchise patient
market share while preparing for the potential launches of three new products in 2014. I'm very pleased with the broad
adoption and strong uptake of TECFIDERA and view it as a positive sign of initial physician acceptance. According to
our data, through the end of the quarter, over 5,000 U.S. doctors have prescribed TECFIDERA. Our sales force
continues to focus on educating physicians to deepen usage among current prescribers and further expand the
prescribing base. While there are still doctors who haven't prescribed, we believe these are generally community
physicians who treat fewer MS patients. We believe that our strong TECFIDERA launch puts us in a very good
position, but understand that TECFIDERA's long-term success will require a robust and sustained commercial effort.
Consistent with last quarter, our data indicates that approximately a quarter of TECFIDERA patients were not on prior
therapy while approximately three-quarters switched from a disease modifying therapy. We believe switches from each
therapy continue to be roughly in line with market share. In the upcoming quarters, we expect TECFIDERA new
prescription volume will remain healthy, but continue to moderate to more closely reflect the underlying patient
dynamics of the MS market. We believe that TECFIDERA is generally viewed by physicians as having strong efficacy,
a solid safety profile and good tolerability. Some patients do experience GI tolerability concerns, with a subset of
patients experiencing GI issues for an extended period. From our conversations, we believe physicians largely view
these side effects as manageable.
We continue to improve patient access to TECFIDERA. As of the end of the quarter, over half of U.S. patients had
access to TECFIDERA without requiring a step-edit. To further expand access, discussions with additional payors are
ongoing, and as additional contracts are implemented, discounts are likely to increase. Outside of the U.S.,
TECFIDERA was approved in Australia in July and we expect to have reimbursement approved by early 2014. In
Canada, TECFIDERA's launch is off to a good start through private insurance, and we also expect a public
reimbursement decision by early 2014.
Turning to AVONEX, within the injectable segment, AVONEX has gained market share year-to-date which we believe
is primarily driven by the convenience of the AVONEX PEN autoinjector. We believe convenience continues to be a
key differentiator for the injectable segment, and that we are well-positioned with the AVONEX PEN and potentially
PLEGRIDY should it be approved.
Moving on to TYSABRI, we believe physician perceptions of TYSABRI's efficacy remain strong. In the U.S., new
TYSABRI prescriptions continued at a good pace, despite the additional treatment option of TECFIDERA. There were
fewer discontinuations in Q3 compared to Q2, and about 70% of U.S. patients discontinuing TYSABRI started on
TECFIDERA and remained in our franchise of MS products. Accordingly, the number of TYSABRI patients leading
our MS franchise has declined significantly in the U.S. compared to prior to TECFIDERA's launch.
In Europe, TYSABRI growth continued to be impacted by oral competition. Strong commercial focus on TYSABRI's
high efficacy and differentiated product profile, coupled with risk stratification, remain very important to the success of
this product.

So in summary, I'm very pleased with the performance of our MS franchise during the quarter. TECFIDERA's rapid
launch trajectory has continued, and AVONEX and TYSABRI have held up well as expected. The commercial
organization has demonstrated strong execution in launch mode which I believe bodes well for the potential upcoming
launches in MS and hemophilia.
I'll now turn the call over to Doug.
Douglas E. Williams
Thanks, Tony. We're very pleased by the progress in R&D. I'll start by highlighting new data for TECFIDERA and
TYSABRI and then review a number of our other product candidates, many of which are expected to have important
readouts in 2014 and 2015.
We continue to invest in TECFIDERA to better understand the characteristics of this important therapy. At the recent
ECTRIMS meeting, we presented interim analysis from the ENDORSE extension study that support the favorable
safety profile of TECFIDERA in patients with relapsing-remitting MS and shown no new or worsening safety signals
in patients who had received TECFIDERA for up to six-and-a-half years. Longer-term analysis from ENDORSE also
demonstrates that TECFIDERA maintained its effect in reducing disease activity.
New data were presented at ECTRIMS for TYSABRI that reaffirms the powerful efficacy of this product, which we
believe continues to be its key differentiating feature. Based on analysis from the TYSABRI observational protocol, or
TOP study, MS patients treated for up to six years with TYSABRI maintained very low relapse rates and stable EDSS
disability scores.
We also presented baseline patient characteristics from the ASCEND study for TYSABRI in SPMS, a study which, if
positive, we believe has the potential to support expanded TYSABRI use into this vastly under-served population. This
study is being performed under an FDA Special Protocol Assessment utilizing a novel composite endpoint to evaluate
the ability of TYSABRI to slow disease progression independent of MS relapse. Accrual for this study is complete and
results are expected in 2015.
Now, I'll turn to our late-stage pipeline product candidates. Based on one year clinical and MRI data from the two-year
Phase III ADVANCE study, PLEGRIDY appears to have an efficacy and safety profile similar to other currently
available interferon therapies, combined with reduced frequency subcutaneous administration, and if approved, a
patient-administered autoinjector. We continue to expect FDA and EMA decisions for PLEGRIDY in mid-2014. Also
in mid-2014, we look forward to seeing Phase III data for daclizumab in relapsing-remitting MS. Data from the
daclizumab Phase IIb registrational study point at strong efficacy in annualized relapse rate and MRI measures of
disease activity and EDSS measures of disability progression. Our hope is that these data will be affirmed in the
ongoing Phase III DECIDE study, and support registration of daclizumab as a high efficacy, once monthly
subcutaneous therapy.
Now, moving to our hemophilia franchise, at the recent National Hemophilia Foundation meeting, we shared data from
registrational studies of our long-lasting recombinant hemophilia product candidates, ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE.
These data reinforce the value proposition that we believe these long-lasting therapies, if approved, may bring to
patients including reduced dosing frequency and innovative individualized dosing flexibility. The pediatric Kids
B-LONG trial for ALPROLIX and the Kids A-LONG trial for ELOCTATE remain on track to readout in 2014. These
studies are essential for filing in Europe and are also important for the U.S. label.
Another key event that occurred during the quarter was positive Phase III results in chronic lymphocytic leukemia for
GA101, a humanized anti-CD20 antibody designed to improve upon RITUXAN's efficacy. Combined with
chemotherapy, GA101 was significantly superior to RITUXAN in CLL. While we usually don't discuss GA101
because our partner, Roche, is operationalizing the program, moving this molecule forward is an important part of a
longer-term strategy to extend our anti-CD20 franchise. Roche will present additional data at ASH and expects an FDA
approval decision for CLL by the end of 2013.

Turning to the earlier-stage product candidates, our R&D strategy has been to improve the mid-stage pipeline in both
quality and number. We've invested in programs that we believe have both strong technical rationale and the potential
to provide meaningful clinical improvement in patients with serious unmet medical needs.
Our objective has been to design robust proof of concept studies to enable well-informed decisions about future larger
scale development efforts. During the last several years, we've been executing on this plan and our mid-stage pipeline
is now at a point where a number of our clinical studies are nearing maturity. As a result, we expect 2014 to be a data
rich period for Biogen Idec as we anticipate up to six proof of concept readouts for anti-LINGO and optic neuritis,
STX-100 and IPF, neublastin and neuropathic pain and BIIB037 in Alzheimer's disease, as well as for our partnered
programs: ISIS-SMNRx in SMA and anti-CD40 ligand in lupus.
With each of these clinical study results, we expect to gain a deeper understanding of the potential of each of these
candidates and hopefully take a step closer to bringing new therapies to patients in need. We also took steps during the
quarter to add capabilities to our discovery research platform in neurology by entering into research collaborations with
Isis Pharmaceuticals and Amicus Therapeutics. As part of our research collaboration with Isis, we gained exclusive
rights to use Isis' anti-sense technology to develop therapies for a broad range of neurological targets. Targets
discovered in this collaboration can be developed by Biogen Idec as biologic, small molecule or anti-sense drugs.
The agreement also provides Biogen Idec with the option to license ongoing anti-sense development programs against
neurologic targets. Our collaboration with Amicus will leverage their research platform and expertise and focus on
discovering and developing small molecule drugs for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. We believe Amicus has
unique approaches to developing drugs to reduce alpha-synuclein accumulation, a hallmark of Parkinson's disease
pathology.
In summary, significant progress is being made in the late-stage pipeline. And just as important, the Phase I and Phase
II portion of our pipeline is maturing nicely as well. Overall, we believe that 2014 will be a data rich year for our
pipeline, followed by a steady stream of important readouts for all of the late-stage programs: daclizumab in
relapsing-remitting MS in mid-2014, TYSABRI in SPMS in 2015, in addition to pivotal GA101 readouts in
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. I look forward to providing you updates on our progress in the coming quarters.
I'll now pass the call to Paul.
Paul J. Clancy
Thanks, Doug. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.05 in the third quarter, while our non-GAAP diluted
earnings per share were $2.35. The differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial results are outlined in the
earnings presentation. Total revenue for the third quarter grew 32% to $1.8 billion. AVONEX worldwide sales were
$733 million in the third quarter, compared to $736 million in prior year.
In the U.S., AVONEX revenue declined 1% to $457 million. Internationally, AVONEX revenue increased 1% to $277
million. Foreign exchange and hedging weakened AVONEX revenue by approximately $5 million in the quarter
compared to a gain of $9 million in Q3 of 2012.
TYSABRI worldwide revenues net of hedging were $401 million in the third quarter, comprised of $232 million in the
U.S. and $169 million internationally. Third quarter TYSABRI revenues were unfavorably impacted by $13 million of
deferred revenue in our Italian affiliate. The impact of foreign exchange in hedging for the third quarter softened
revenue by approximately $2 million for TYSABRI compared to a gain of $3 million in the prior year.
Global third quarter TECFIDERA revenue was strong at $286 million. U.S. TECFIDERA revenue include incremental
inventory build of approximately $12 million this quarter. Absent this inventory build, revenue generated from
underlying patient demand in the U.S. was approximately $272 million. As of the end of Q3, we estimate U.S.
inventory in the channel for TECFIDERA was in the four to five-week range, or approximately $92 million. Third
quarter international TECFIDERA revenue, entirely from Canada, was $2 million.

U.S. RITUXAN sales were $947 million. Our U.S. profit share was $282 million. Royalties and profit share on sales of
rituximab outside the U.S. were $21 million. The result was $303 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint
business.
Now turning to the expense lines in the non-GAAP P&L. Third quarter non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $235
million, or 13% of revenue, which includes TYSABRI contingent payments and third-party royalties. Third quarter
non-GAAP R&D expense was $409 million, or 22% of revenues, an increase of 38% over last year, primarily driven by
our recently announced research collaboration with Isis. Specifically, we made an upfront payment of $100 million, of
which approximately $75 million was expensed in the quarter. The remaining portion will be capitalized and expensed
over the life of the collaboration. Third quarter non-GAAP SG&A expense was $404 million, or 22% of revenues, an
increase of 36% over last year, driven primarily by increased investment associated with the TECFIDERA launch.
Our third quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 27%, driven by a larger percentage of our revenues coming from within the
United States due to the strong TECFIDERA launch. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for a total
of approximately $360 million. Our weighted average diluted shares were 238 million and we ended the quarter slightly
north of $1 billion in cash and marketable securities. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which
were $2.35 for the third quarter.
Now, we'll turn to the full year 2013 guidance. We're raising our guidance as the result of the strength seen with the
TECFIDERA launch. We now expect total revenue growth of approximately 23% to 25%. For TYSABRI, we hope to
record a revenue benefit of approximately $95 million by the end of the year related to the pending settlement with the
Italian National Medicines Agency, but this may not happen. The timing of the final approval remains a bit uncertain
and could move to early 2014, which would put our 2013 revenue growth at the lower end of the guidance.
Additionally, we will continue to defer a portion of our Italian revenue until this settlement is finalized.
Moving to the expense lines of the P&L, we anticipate cost of goods sold to be between 12% and 14% of sales. R&D
expense remains unchanged; we expect to be between 21% to 23% of sales. This includes approximately $60 million
earmarked for milestone payments and potential business development opportunities in the fourth quarter. SG&A
expense remains unchanged [ph], expected to be (23:34) approximately 24% to 26% of total revenues as we continue to
fund TECFIDERA's launch and make pre-launch investments in hemophilia. Our effective 2013 tax rate expect to be
between 24% and 25% of pre-tax income, a modest increase over our prior guidance, driven by a larger percentage of
our pre-tax income being generated in the U.S. As a result, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between
$8.65 and $8.85, and GAAP EPS to be between $7.50 and $7.70. The range reflects the uncertainty around the timing
of the finalization of the AIFA settlement.
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments.
George A. Scangos
Okay. Excuse me. Thank you, Paul, and look, Biogen Idec is doing well and we believe the prospects for next year look
even brighter. Our quarterly performance was strong and we've raised guidance for the year. We believe we're the
global leader in MS today with the growing market share and with potential leaders in the three market segments:
AVONEX and potentially PLEGRIDY in the injectable segment and TYSABRI in the high-efficacy segment and now,
TECFIDERA in the oral segment. We recognize that patients and physicians are seeking treatment options that provide
flexibility, and we believe that we have the portfolio to appropriately address the diverse needs of this population.
TECFIDERA continues on a strong trajectory, and we believe that its broad adoption in the U.S. is a testament to its
value to the MS patient community. Our launch efforts continue as we look forward to building on this quarter's
achievements to serve even more patients.
We have two large regulatory issues underway, TECFIDERA regulatory data protection in Europe and the process
validation of ELOCTATE in the U.S. We understand the importance of these issues and are working diligently to
resolve them. As you know, we're moving closer to a resolution of European regulatory data protection. The
ELOCTATE process questions have just recently arisen, and we will update you as soon as it's appropriate to do so.

These types of issues are part of our business and we're working through them.
Over the years, our commitment to reinvigorating the science has been a driving force behind our pipeline programs.
We're encouraged by the quality of our pipeline, but recognize that continued efforts to identify early-stage candidates
are necessary to ensure our continued momentum. We're determined to be at the forefront of science and medicine,
which we believe is critical to enable us to sustain and grow value in years to come. As we look at the number of
development milestones that we have achieved this year and those that we expect next year, it's evident that momentum
is growing throughout the company. We're very proud of our accomplishments, but know that continued success
requires sustained execution on the part of our organization. We believe we are on a trajectory for continued growth
with the potential for three additional products in 2014. This type of growth requires a broad coordinated effort,
especially for an organization of our size. Our team is diligently working to ensure that we have the resources required
to make each launch a success, while maintaining our momentum in the other areas of our business.
In closing, I'd like to take this opportunity to once again thank our dedicated employees for their contributions to
bringing meaningful new therapies to patients in need, and to physicians and patients who are always central to what
we do.
Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning, and we'll now open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group. Your line is
open.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: My question? My question, I wanted to drill down on the Factor VIII issue that you
disclosed. I don't know if there's – I mean basically it's an open-ended question. Is there anything else you can tell us?
And then specifically, is the commercial product exactly the same as the Phase III product? Is it the same cell line in
the same process, or were there any changes made between the Phase III production and the commercial production?
And if I just may, just as a housekeeping, is it possible to give us maybe, Paul, I'm not sure this is probably for the
TECFIDERA U.S. patient share according to your data?
<A - George A. Scangos>: Okay. Good job of getting two questions in there in one. Look, on the first issue, there
weren't any changes between the Phase III and the commercial product. But other than that, we really can't go into any
more details. This is all new, it's premature, and we're working through it. On the market share, I'll let Paul take that.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Yeah, Mark, I think what we said during the call was that we feel that during the quarter, we're
the leading oral. So we surpassed market share of the other oral during the quarter, and that puts us probably into
double-digit range into kind of the just over the bar on the 10% from a share perspective towards the end of the quarter
in the United States. So a very good launch, obviously. We're very pleased with that trajectory coming out of the gates.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Thanks a lot.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a continued success with TECFIDERA. I
won't ask for an update on the EU, but maybe I could ask for a post date. Could you clarify, George, whether
previously the CHMP has reviewed any status for TECFIDERA and actually turned down the molecule or could you
just say that you've not been informed one way or another?

<A - George A. Scangos>: I think, Eric, at this point, we're not going to say anymore at all. These processes are
complicated and they go back and forth and so better to just leave it as it is, I think. And we are getting closer to a
decision and we'll leave it at that.

Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from AllianceBernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much and also saying congratulations on the TECFIDERA trajectory
there. A quick question on MS. So could you tell us what's been the overall expansion in the size of the MS market if
you look at the treated patient numbers, say, the most recent quarter compared to a year ago? And then just on a related
note, could you comment on the trajectory of the new patient starts through the quarter, because we're seeing TRx
numbers that are blends, obviously, and it'd be helpful if you could tell us the actual main patient trajectory? Thanks.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Thanks, Geoff. It's Tony. So I think as we've talked in the prior calls, we've seen the
switch market in the U.S. moving at a rate that's much higher than it has been historically. Again, numbers we've
quoted we take – with the market at sort of a steady state, when you take switchers, returning quitters, people going out,
new starts, it tends to run at about 1,000 to 1,200 kind of available patients per week. And as we pointed out, even
TECFIDERA alone has been running at some multiple of that. We do expect to see that come down over time. We
have, as always, at best probably anecdotal evidence about returning quitters. It's hard to identify that population. We
do think some of the TECFIDERA volume is people who had come back into the market, but we've always been
cautious about overstating that. We think it's more just the underlying switch dynamic that has increased pretty
significantly.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Thank you for taking my two-part question, which is completely unrelated to each other.
TECFIDERA, could you just give us some input into the real world what the doctors are doing with regards to
lymphocyte monitoring and CBCs? I mean are they doing that monitoring more than the label annually that have to be
right? And secondly, Paul, the share buyback that you put in this quarter $360 million, 1.7 million, can we extrapolate
anything from that?
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: Ravi, it's Doug. With respect to lymphocyte monitoring, I think that there's probably a
little bit going on out there that we hear with docs monitoring lymphocytes maybe a little more frequently than what the
label suggests. I think that's not unexpected with a new product as the doctors are becoming familiar with it, but it's our
position based on the data from the Phase III studies and now from the ENDORSE extension study that has data for 6.5
years that the labeling is appropriate for monitoring these patients with respect to lymphocytes and white cells.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: And then, Ravi, this is Paul. The share buyback this quarter was intended for share stabilization
impact. So that's an ongoing what we do on an annual basis to stabilize shares. Certainly, as we go forward, high-class
problem in terms of the cash flow generation that we have and we'll continue to look to be very good stewards of
shareholder value in the deployment of capital.

<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Yeah, thanks very much for the question. On the tax rate, Paul, I am just curious if you can
give us a better sense. It looks like your guidance is implying somewhere in the high 20%s or maybe even 30% in the
fourth quarter. How should we think about tax for 2014 with and without European TECFIDERA? And then just
second part on persistency trends, can you talk a little bit more, Tony, about what you're seeing with discontinuations
for GI and tolerability overall? Thanks.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Yeah, Rachel, this Paul. So the tax guidance was, as you note correctly, that's tax guidance for
the full year. For the fourth quarter, our tax guidance, while it's not stated here, I'll just kind of give you the number that
we're thinking through at this point is right around 26% for the fourth quarter, so just to try to clarify that. It's just the
result of TECFIDERA profits in the United States being very strong and robust. As we move into the next year, I think
we'll have to get past and get clarity on the product mix as we go into next year and we'll update you probably at the
end of year call.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Yeah. Rachel, it's Tony. So we're still seeing a big – look, I talk to a lot of
physicians, they're seeing a big mix in their experience with tolerability issues. There are some physicians who see a
subset, usually a small subset of patients, who have more extended GI issues. There are other physicians who don't see,
in my conversation, much of an issue at all. We think the market is working through it. From sort of persistence
standpoint, I think we still think it's a little early to give very specific guidance on how we think discontinuation rates
are going to settle out because we're still early in the launch and we've had a lot of patients go on pretty quickly but
we're not seeing anything that's outside our expectation.

Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew Roden>: Great. Thanks very much and nice quarter, guys. I actually have a pipeline question here,
Doug or Al, if you're on. The 14-month follow-up data on SMA show to mean improvement on the Hammersmith, I
think 5.75 points in the high dose group with no patients declining. Just wondering in the absence of a placebo arm, can
you just add some perspective as to how that should be interpreted? I mean we understand that normal development
and growth, maybe even a learning curve, can drive the Hammersmith score higher. Just wondering if the magnitude of
the change in the high dose groups leads you to conclude anything here, ahead of having any placebo-controlled data?
Thanks.
<A - Alfred W. Sandrock>: Hi, Matt. It's Al Sandrock. I agree with you that without well-controlled trial, it's always a
little difficult to make any strong interpretation. It's gratifying to see the improvement, and you mentioned the average
improvement. Some patients are improving more than that. Some are less and so, I think in the absence of a
well-controlled trial, I think it's premature to make any strong conclusions.
<Q - Matthew Roden>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from JPMorgan. Your line is open.

TYSABRI. Can you guys talk about switches to TECFIDERA? I know last quarter, you gave a good amount of detail
on that. And then with the competition from orals in the EU, there really isn't a lot of new data. So what's the
commercial strategy for you guys to protect share going forward? Thanks.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Great question. It's Tony. So look, let me separate U.S. and EU. In the U.S., there's a
new alternative in the market which is TECFIDERA, which we know has caused some – attracted attention from lots of
patients. Look, in light of that, we think that TYSABRI – we believe TYSABRI actually new prescription volume is
holding up quite well. It speaks to the fact that, that is a product with higher efficacy that tends to have a subset of

patients that makes sense. The impact in the U.S. has largely been on the discontinuation side. Again, there is a new
alternative and for patients who are post-years JCV positive, we've seen a meaningful portion move over.
I think EU is a similar situation, certainly on the discons is where we're seeing more of the challenge and it's frankly
been the other orals pretty aggressively competing against that. So, look, it's an execution issue for us. I think in both
cases, we know what TYSABRI's value proposition to patients and physicians is. We know what the value of risk
stratification is. So it's very much focused on messaging presence in the physician office and focused on patient
identification and we think that that will help us work through that.

Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Thanks for taking my question. If you don't mind, I just kind of – I wanted to clarify
something and then I actually have a question. So just to clarify what – George, you mentioned that with ELOCTATE,
I think the words you used, and maybe I'm incorrect, but was the word you used that there might be an extension to the
review? I'm just trying to get a sense, are you kind of thinking a 90-day extension, or whether you're thinking a
re-filing? And then secondly, and that's the real question. Can you guys maybe share with us your thoughts, how does
MMF differ from DMF in the body, clinically? Thank you.
<A - George A. Scangos>: Okay, Yaron. Look, for the first question, we're not thinking about a re-filing. We're
thinking about a delay. And it's really premature to speculate on the...
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: Yaron, this is Doug. With respect to the difference between DMF and MMF, we had an
abstract at the recent ECTRIMS meeting talking about some pre-clinical work that we've done looking at gene
transcription changes that take place with systemic administration of those two different fumarates. And I think what's
clear from that set of experiments is that all fumarates are not created equal with respect to their biology. And we saw
different patterns of gene expression, and it's clear that MMF and DMF elicit different biological responses.

number one, if you can tell us where the manufacturing is done? If that's in-house? And then, how similar are the steps
between your Factor VIII and your Factor IX? Just wondering if there's – why there was only a delay for one of them?
Thanks.
<A - George A. Scangos>: The first question, do we do the manufacturing in-house? Yes, we do. And the discussions
we've had that led to these questions with the agency are centered on Factor VIII, right? And that's the update that we
provided today. I just want to emphasize we're not talking about jeopardy to approval here. We're talking about
timelines.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Yeah, hey. A question on – a follow-up on hemophilia. We continue to talk to a lot of doctors,
and I know a lot of people continue to do a lot of survey work as well. It's pretty consistent with a very bullish outlook.
Maybe you could comment about how you would expect this to launch? What is your work set now versus, say, a year
ago? The counterargument has always been a conservative launch with switching just to [ph] comfortable and safety
(41:50). So maybe you could compare-contrast the bullish outlook versus conservative doctor outlook?

<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Thanks, Michael. It's Tony. Look, I'm not surprised to hear that there is interest in
the surveys that you do out in the market. Again, long-acting factor is the biggest unmet need in this market. You get
that from – we've known that for a long time. You get that from physicians. You get that from patients. So look, we
think there is interest in the class of long acting factors, and so we think there is a product – profile that has the
potential to do very well. We still are sort of moderate in our expectations about pace. Again, this is a market that has
very slow switch rates. It's very patient-driven. There's a lot of conservatism among patients. There's a reasonable
amount of conservatism among physicians. And actually the frequency with which patients go to the hemophilia
treatment center, certainly, if you compare to something like MS, is less frequent. So excited about the product profile
and the potential and not surprised to hear there's some market excitement. But we do think this is a market that has a
lot of characteristics that make it move a little more slowly and is a patient commercial approach, an education
approach that we think is going to be needed.

Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: So now that you've seen the impact of the orals in the MS market, and you've seen
switchers from TYSABRI who are JCV-positive, do you have any updated thoughts on the positioning of daclizumab
now that you're a year away from data? Thanks.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Yeah, thanks, Robyn. It's Tony. We've said we have to wait and see the data. It looks
like it could be something that sits into the high efficacy space with potentially some attractive characteristics. So I
think it we'll – certainly, it looks like a product that would have a place in the market as we've often said. There are lots
of different patient segments with different needs, so we'll have to wait and see how the readout looks.

Our next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek from Stifel. Your line is open.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Hi. Thanks a lot. On TECFIDERA, I think I heard you say you expect discounts are likely to
increase. I'm wondering if you could give us more detail potentially on that. And then as far as the inventory on
TECFIDERA, you mentioned four to five weeks. I'm wondering if there's a possibility for that to go up or down, I
guess I'm comparing it to the AVONEX two weeks is four to five weeks a lot relative to the trajectory that
TECFIDERA is on? Thanks.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Yeah, Joel, this is Paul. Thanks for the question. Let me kind of start with TEC. So let me start
with the inventory first and move it to Tony on the TEC question. Four to five weeks is actually the total inventory that
encapsulates both the wholesalers as well as the SPP. So that's what we're actually looking at now. It's pretty common
to have two weeks at the wholesalers for the MS products and about two or three weeks at the retail we have in the SPP
basis. So I think we think that that actually is where the steady state is. And that implies very much kind of what kind
of happened in the third quarter that somewhat implies that our reported results will probably pretty closely mirror the
results in the patient demand.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Joel, Tony. On discounts, look, what I think we've said on TECFIDERA over time
we expect that growth in that characteristics to be similar to the other MS products with the main difference from, say,
AVONEX being the government discounts would be lower. So you'd have some favorability there. During the launch
period, we're not contracted in the early days with commercial payors, so you're not paying rebates, which is a piece of
that mix, just a signal that as we finalize the number of those contracts through the end of this year and into early next
year, we'll start to see some impact from payor discounts. But again, broad strokes, we think this will be characteristic
of other products in the market with some places it may be more favorable.

Your next question comes from Ritu Baral from Canaccord. Your line is open.
<Q - Ritu Baral>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess in the next 18 months to 24 months, you've got
some interesting potential trade-offs between different products in MS. And I was wondering how you look at
AVONEX versus PLEGRIDY and the strategy there for preserving the interferon franchise? And also your sort of
preliminary thoughts on the [ph] ORCHESTRA (46:47) data that is potentially coming in 2015 from GA101 in MS.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Ritu, it's Tony. Let me talk about the interferon franchise. Look, we do think about
interferons as a franchise for us over time. So look, job one is to continue to emphasize the benefits of the AVONEX
PEN and gain share in that injectable segment even as it decreases. We think PLEGRIDY plays right into the area of
convenience matters because it's a potential significant differentiator. So we will think about, as PLEGRIDY comes in,
it's a natural extension to that franchise over time.
<A - George A. Scangos>: And then, Ritu, I think I'm going to turn it over to Al, but I think what you're referring to is
the ocrelizumab data in multiple sclerosis on the OPERA trial so...
<Q - Ritu Baral>: Yeah, I'm sorry. OPERA trial, yes.
<A - George A. Scangos>: No problem. We're getting our sympathies – symphonies a little mixed up. But, Al, if you
have a point of view?
<A - Alfred W. Sandrock>: Yeah, I think actually there is an ORCHESTRA trial as well, but they're both
ocrelizumab. Ocrelizumab has very exciting Phase II data. And the extension studies that have been presented at
various meetings continue to show sustained effects, long-term effects with dosing at very infrequent intervals. It's
probably going to join the high efficacy segment. It depletes a class of cells, as does some of the other high efficacy
drugs. I think the distinguishing feature of daclizumab is that potentially it could have high efficacy without depleting
cells, and it would join TYSABRI as the other high efficacy drug that doesn't deplete lymphocytes. So – but I think it's
an exciting – I think ocrelizumab is an exciting drug and the Phase II data were meaningful.

Our next question comes from the line of Gene Mack from Brean Capital. Your line is open.
<Q - Gene C. Mack>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wonder if you can comment a little bit on TYSABRI.
Are you guys – can you just give us a sense of what level, if any, off label uses happening right now in secondary
progressive? Thanks.
<A - George A. Scangos>: Well, TYSABRI is labeled for relapsing forms of MS in the United States and patients with
secondary progressive MS who still have relapses are eligible per label and I suspect that there are people who have
entered SPMS but who are still relapsing who are on label getting TYSABRI. The issue of when somebody goes from
relapsing to non-relapsing, you only know that in retrospect usually because the relapse frequency decreases gradually.

studies? Thanks.
<A - Alfred W. Sandrock>: Well, the main additional piece of information that we presented at length at ECTRIMS
was the effect of anti-LINGO on axonal regrowth after optic nerve crush. And we've been talking a lot about the
biology of anti-LINGO in terms of remylenation but this is sort of additional information. But in a sense it's a good
drug for repairing because as you know in MS, you have axons that are transected as well as a loss of myelin. The
dosing has been informed. In the Phase I trial, we looked at CSF levels of anti-LINGO, we looked at some other
biomarkers in CSF and we know based on our animal studies when you achieve certain CSF levels of anti-LINGO,
you've achieved certain levels of anti-LINGO in the brain parenchyma and so that's how we based our dosing.

Our next question comes from the line of Marko Kozul from Leerink Swann. Your line is open.
<Q - Marko K. Kozul>: Hi. Congrats on the quarter. Just a quick clarification. In the prepared remarks, I believe you
said over 50% of patients have access to TECFIDERA. Does this mean that these patients are receiving commercial
reimbursement? And then my question is do you have any color on reimbursement tiering for the drug and any
potential impact it has on how the drug is used? Thanks.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Yeah, so I think what we've said is over 50% of the patients have access without a
step-edit. So, yeah, we would expect a lot of those patients would transition to commercial drug relatively quickly. It's a
good point at this stage in the launch. Over time, we're continuing to negotiate with payors. Probably a little early to
call what we think the outcome will be from a reimbursement standpoint, but we think we're on a track to get broad
coverage.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei from Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Thomas A. Wei>: Thanks. Just a clarification and then a question. On Rachel's question about persistency, could
you just clarify – should we interpret your answer to mean that discontinuation rates are relatively consistent with the
TECFIDERA clinical trial data? And then on the 1,000 to 1,200 steady-state rate in the MS market, can you just give us
a sense of what you're data tells you that number was during the third quarter on a weekly basis?
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Yeah, so on persistency, I don't I specifically compared it to the clinical trial. But
again, we think it's a little early to give very tight guidance on discontinuations. There are a lot of patients starting
quickly and still working through and I think we said before we'd go through the end of the year to get a good handle
on that. The 1,000 to 1,200 is, I think, round numbers what we have typically seen historically. You can look at even
the TECFIDERA if you can extrapolate on the TECFIDERA volume on its own in the third quarter, it was probably
equal to that or even north of it. So the whole market is continuing to move at a faster rate. But we've said we think that
will calm down and is working its way down over time.

unattractive to you in terms of launching the product? Thanks.
