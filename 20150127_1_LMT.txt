Marillyn A. Hewson
Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We hope that your New Year is
off to a great start. Let me begin by saying that I am extraordinarily proud of our Lockheed Martin team. We finished
another strong year in 2014, achieving excellent financial and program performance.
Our performance has the corporation well-positioned to continue to deliver value to customers and stockholders in
2015. The daily efforts of our employees are the foundation of our ability to deliver broad-based results across the
corporation, and I thank them for their ongoing contribution. While Bruce will cover the financial results in detail later
on in the call, I want to highlight a few key achievements and strategic items from my perspective as we closed out
2014.
Starting with the new business, the corporation continued to be successful in securing new order bookings for both
domestic and international customers. In the fourth quarter, we achieved a strong 130% book-to-bill ratio for contract
awards above sales and finished the year with a backlog of nearly $81 billion. This marks the fourth consecutive year
that we have maintained our backlog in excess of $80 billion.
Our new business success is aided by having the best positioned portfolio programs in the sector with direct and unique
alignment to many of the essential programs identified by both international and domestic customers. These factors
have enabled us to build the strong backlog consisting of multiple years of longer-cycle production program and
provide the strategic differentiation and financial foundation of future work.
I was also pleased with the international content of our backlog, grew to more than $20 billion, representing over 25%
of our total year-end backlog. The international component has us well positioned to achieve our stated goal of
expanding sales from international customers to at least 25% of total corporate sales in the next few years. This
expected international growth also provides a significant benefit to our domestic customer by enabling economies of
scale and additional cost leverage achieved through higher production volumes on programs across our portfolio.
Strategically our corporate-wide emphasis on fostering and expanding customer relationships and focusing on how we
may best support their critical needs, continues to provide a pivotal role in securing new business awards. This past
quarter, I had the opportunity to expand our international relationships by traveling to the Middle East and meeting
with key customers. My activities in Abu Dhabi included participating in the opening of our Center for Innovation and
Security Solutions in Masdar City, further strengthening the corporation's nearly 40-year relationship with the United
Arab Emirates.
I also travelled to Bahrain for discussions with high-level representatives on our products and how we can best help
them satisfy their critical national security requirements. The common theme across my meetings was that, all parties I
spoke with, reaffirmed their unwavering desire to secure the most effective solutions and products essential for national
security, in spite of any volatility in world oil markets and price levels.
Another strategic focus area where we have a long record of success is the generation and deployment of annual cash
flows. In 2014, we generated almost $3.9 billion in annual operating cash after making $2 billion in pension
contributions. This strong cash generation enabled us to provide a return of over 120% of our annual free cash flow to
stockholders in 2014.
As we entered 2015, we are solidly on the cash deployment plans we outlined during the October call, where we
identified our goal to make at least $2 billion in share repurchases in 2015 and to reduce our total outstanding share
count to below $300 million shares by the end of 2017. Share repurchases of this magnitude, coupled with our annual
dividend payments would result in returning virtually all of our annual free cash to stockholders over the next three
years.
Beyond the significant returns of cash to stockholders, our increasing cash flow also enables us to invest in the future of
the corporation in areas such as research and development. We continue to expand our focus and allocation of
resources on next-generation technologies and products.

In 2014, we increased investments in independent research and development activities to over $750 million, reflecting
the third consecutive year of significant increases in the strategically important area. We are constantly pursuing new
technology-based solutions as we design and develop leap-ahead technologies to help address some of the world's most
complex challenges faced by domestic and international customers. These efforts will ensure we stay at the leading
edge of technology and create potential foundations for future new business and important strategic positioning.
Moving to operations, one of the highlights of this past quarter was the near flawless inaugural test flight of our Orion
spacecraft. This flight successfully tested key systems of the capsule to help pave the way for future missions into deep
space and capture the imagination of people around the world. The flight successfully tested a number of technologies
that are fundamental to future deep space missions and included environmental and safety elements essential to the
future of human space travel.
We are extraordinarily proud and pleased to be the prime contractor of the Orion vehicle and look forward to
improving this unique exploration vehicle – I'm sorry, look forward to providing this unique exploration vehicle to
NASA and our country for decades to come.
In addition to the Orion operational achievements this past quarter, key milestones were also achieved on the F-35 Joint
Strike Fighter program with progress in developmental testing and increased production quantity and tempo.
On the development program, a major milestone was accomplished with the F-35 carrier variant, successfully
completing on-ship trials aboard the USS Nimitz. The maturity and performance of the aircraft enabled achievement of
100% of the threshold test points and also included multiple successful night landings and launches during the aircraft's
first test deployment at sea. Beyond the Carrier Test for the U.S. Navy, we are also on track to provide the capabilities
of this revolutionary fighter to our armed forces with initial operational capability of the F-35 STOVL variant for the
U.S. Marine Corp later this year.
In the production arena, I am very proud of our aeronautics team, as they achieved the delivery target of 36 aircraft in
2014. This was particularly noteworthy as the team was able to overcome a nearly one-month program hold for the
engine anomaly that occurred last June and still achieved annual aircraft delivery goal. This achievement is further
illustration of the program's growing stability and production ramp-up.
Overall, the F-35 aircraft fleet continues to expand with 109 production jets delivered since program inception and fleet
operations now surpassing 25,000 flight hours. Customer support and funding for the program is strong and growing.
Finalization of the LRIP 8 contract was completed this past quarter for 43 aircraft, reflecting a significant increase in
order quantity above the 32 to 36 annual aircraft awards we received during the previous four fiscal years. This new
award helped bring year-end 2014 backlogs of aircraft on the program to 100 planes.
Looking forward domestic and international customers order phasing outlined a planned procurement of 61 aircraft for
the upcoming LRIP 9 contract, further expanding the solid growth curve in aircraft quantity. This increased rate of
aircraft orders is an essential component to our ability to ramp up production levels and achieve the reduced price of the
planes outlined in our Blueprint for Affordability agreement with the F-35 customer.
I'd like to conclude my remarks with a brief status of government budgets. Last month, the U.S. government passed the
fiscal year 2015 Omnibus spending bill to finance most federal activities through the end of the current fiscal year.
Passage of this bill eliminated much of the procurement uncertainty caused by operating under the prior continuing
resolution constraints.
Looking forward, the White House is scheduled to provide Congress a proposed fiscal year 2016 defense budget next
week on February 2. The proposed DoD based budget is widely expected to be higher than the FY2015 level and above
the mandated sequestration caps. The higher budget request is in response to increased global security threats and
military needs. The FY2016 proposed budget will then undergo congressional deliberations on final spending priorities
and funding levels over the coming months.
While the impact of the likely higher FY2016 proposed budget on future fiscal years is unclear at this time, a higher
FY2016 spending authority could signal bipartisan recognition of the critical need to increase DoD budget levels above

the currently constrained limits established by sequestration. These recent budget actions are positive steps in the
creation of a more predictable and strategic approach to budget allocations while addressing the fiscal challenges we
faced as a nation.
I'll now ask Bruce to go through the details of fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial performance, our financial
outlook for 2015, and then, we'll open up the line for your questions. Bruce?
Bruce L. Tanner
Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. I hope you're all warm and dry this stormy day. As I highlight our key
financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we provided with our earnings release today.
Starting with chart 3, in an overview of our year-end results, we had a stronger finish to 2014 than we were expecting
when we last spoke in October. Sales for the year were $45.6 billion and I'll discuss that in more detail on the next
chart.
Segment operating margin was 12.3% for the year about in line with our expectations and the combination of higher
sales and segment operating profit drove our earnings per share to $11.21, higher than the guidance we provided in
October, but there were two unplanned items that had a net negative impact in the fourth quarter that I'll discuss in a
few charts.
Cash from operations was nearly $3.9 billion after making $2 billion in pension contributions, including $1 billion in
the fourth quarter, as we discussed at that time. And finally, orders for the fourth quarter were little higher than
expected resulting in our ending backlog of $80.5 billion. So overall, we had a good finish to a strong performance
year.
On chart 4, we'll discuss our sales results in more detail. In the fourth quarter, sales grew by almost 9% compared to the
same period in 2013 with four of the five business areas showing strong growth in the quarter. Aeronautics growth was
driven by volume increases on the F-35 production programs. Missiles and Fire Control had higher deliveries of PAC-3
Missiles, as well as higher tactical missile deliveries.
Mission Systems and Training had higher radar volume, including the start-up of the Space Fence program. And Space
Systems grew primarily due to the Orion flight tests that occurred in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter performance
led to full year of 2014 sales achieving slight growth over the 2013 results.
On chart 5, we'll review our earnings per share for the quarter and year. Fourth quarter EPS was a $1.32 higher than the
prior year driven primarily by three items; the change in the FAS/CAS adjustment from an expense in 2013 to income
in 2014; the absence of the restructuring charges taken in 2013; and a lower goodwill impairment charge in 2014 that
occurred in 2013.
I'll describe the goodwill impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter in more detail on the next chart. For the year,
EPS was more than $2 higher than in 2013, driven again primarily by the FAS/CAS adjustment change and the absence
of the restructuring charge in 2014.
Turning to chart 6, we'll reconcile our actual earnings per share results with the guidance we provided in October. In
October, we projected our EPS for the year to be around $11.15 per share. And as I mentioned previously, we had two
unplanned events that were not considered in the EPS outlook we provided last quarter, the first of which was a special
charge we took for goodwill impairment in our tech services line of business in Missiles and Fire Control.
This charge reduced our EPS by $0.33, and this is the second consecutive year we've had an impairment charge against
this business, and again it reflects both the reduction in support activities in theater as well as the increased level of
competition we are seeing for this business. The second unplanned event was the passage of the R&D tax credit
legislation in the quarter, which generated a $0.14 benefit to EPS. These two events lowered our outlook for EPS by
$0.19, but were more than offset by the higher sales and segment operating profit in the quarter.

Chart 7 provides more detail into our cash deployment actions in 2014. With cash from operations of nearly $3.9
billion and capital expenditures of around $850 million, our free cash flow for the year was a little more than $3 billion.
And after making dividend payments of nearly $1.8 billion and share repurchases of $1.9 billion, we returned 121% of
free cash flow in the year. Over the last 10 years, we have made $30 billion of dividend payments and share
repurchases to our shareholders or 108% of free cash flow over that same period.
On chart 8, we show our backlog results over the last four years. Our backlog levels have remained above $80 billion in
each of the last four years despite the budgetary pressures that our customers are facing. As has been the case in prior
years, a strong fourth quarter in 2014 enabled us to achieve these results.
Chart 9 provides significant assumptions in our 2015 guidance. Our FAS/CAS adjustment for 2015 will be income of
$475 million, $175 million less than we anticipated in our trend information in October. The largest reason for the
lower adjustment was a reduction in the discount rate to 4%.
You'll recall that when we re-measured our pension liabilities in the second quarter of 2014 as a result of our plan
changes, we reduced the discount rate to 4.25%. Since then, interest rates have continued to drop, resulting in the lower
discount rate at year end. Asset returns in 2014 of 6% rather than 8% assumed in October make up the remainder of the
lower income outlook. While affecting GAAP EPS, these pension changes do not create the need for any additional
cash contribution over the next three years.
As I noted in the October call, we do not expect to make pension contributions from 2015 through 2017, and our
expectations of generating more than $15 billion in cash from operations over the next three years remains unchanged.
Consistent with our longstanding practice, our guidance does not assume an extension of the R&D tax credit until
legislation is enacting. If legislation, similar to what was enacted in 2014, is passed in 2015, we would expect the EPS
benefit to be comparable to the 2014 amount. And consistent with what we discussed last quarter, we plan to make at
least $2 billion in share repurchases in 2015.
Turning to chart 10, we provide our current outlook for 2015. Our guidance today is consistent with what we provided
in our trend information in October except for the lower FAS/CAS adjustment. We expect both orders and sales to be
in a range from $43.5 billion to $45 billion and we expect our backlog to remain above $80 billion at year end for the
fifth consecutive year. We expect our segment operating profit to be between $5.1 billion and $5.25 billion. Our EPS is
expected to be between $10.80 per share and $11.10 per share, and our cash from operations is expected to be greater
than $5 billion.
Chart 11 shows the ranges for sales and profit by our business areas. And finally chart 12 is our summary. 2014 was a
strong year both operationally and financially. We're confident that our portfolio has us well positioned for the future
and we remain focused on the cash deployment actions that our shareholders expect.
With that, we're ready for your questions. Shannon?

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jason Gursky of Citi. You may begin.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning. Hi, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Marillyn, I just wanted to ask you about R&D and acquisitions. You made some comments
earlier about R&D and investing in next-generation technologies and then it also appears net of disposals that you've
spent the most on acquisitions this year that you have since 2006.

I wonder if you could just provide a little bit more detail on the strategy with regard to R&D where the spending might
be going and how the customer is behaving these days with regard to independent R&D versus then paying for your
R&D and whether we are to view the acquisitions that you've been making here of late as kind of an extension of R&D,
you're acquiring technologies that perhaps you didn't have and where you find the growth areas and just kind of the
strategy behind R&D and the acquisitions going forward holistically.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Sure. Thanks for the question, Jason. I guess just first to talk a little bit about R&D and
new technology, we have been increasing our R&D expenditures over the past three years. This year we were up – for
2014, we were up another 8%. And we're doing that because we're not going to cut back on R&D even though our sales
are not growing at the same trajectory that they have maybe for the past decade or so, because it's really the lifeblood of
our company and we are a technology company and we have to continue to invest.
From our customers' perspective, we do spend time with our customer on our R&D plans. A lot of credit to Secretary
Kendall in bringing us into the Pentagon to talk about our top IRAD expenditures and areas to make sure that we're
well aligned with what the priorities are for the Department of Defense. And moreover, as we look at our customers
around the world, we're looking at how do we invest in research and development that will allow us to secure new
business and to grow our current business.
Beyond that we're a long cycle business, so we're constantly looking at how we can continue to invest for the long-term
as well. So it's a balance of both of those areas to make sure that we're looking at things that would be giving our allies
and our customers an advantage over their adversaries for the long-term.
In terms of how we address R&D and cooperative research and development, we kind of look at both of those elements
as being an important part of investment, but we also are doing things that are beyond IRAD investment. For example,
we use other avenues to develop next-generation products and solutions.
If you look at what we're doing on the U.S. Air Force's T-X competition that's coming out in 2017, we actually have
teamed with the South Korea to develop the T-50 supersonic trainer for their air force under an offset program and
we're able to take that investment that we made in another offset program and point it towards the T-X competition.
So that's a great example of where you might not necessarily see it in the value of an R&D investment as we're making
those investments. I think if you look back years back, we did a similar thing on the C-130J, which is just paying
dividends for us in the markets that we're operating in with the C-130J program, where we made investments in our
business along that line.
Taking it on beyond that into acquisitions, yeah, we did more historically than we have done this year in 2014. There
are areas that we're continuing to penetrate into our core such as our Zeta Associates acquisition and that being a very
much aligned with our core some areas that such as the healthcare IT arena, and Systems Made Simple is an area that is
a part of our IT work with the U.S. government where we've been frankly, for the past 20 years, the top supplier of IT
support and this is an opportunity for us to bring more to markets like the VA medical, DoD medical et cetera.
The Astrotech acquisition we made in space launch is very much aligned with our core with services there, but then
we're also looking at areas to bring in additional capability to the corporation and in places where we want to take our
core into the markets like [indiscernible] (25:19) with the IT work we're doing in airports and things along that line.
What I will say is that as we said, we have a very strong cash deployment plan that we're going to follow, but we also
are generating cash and we also have a lot of financing capability as a company. The bad debt capacity allows us to
have the flexibility as we see additional opportunities for acquisition that makes sense for us that will allow us to
continue to invest in M&A. So we'll be looking at acquisitions that are, as you said, able to add capability but also ones
that open up new markets for us that are closely aligned to our core capabilities.

<Q - Ron Epstein>: Yeah. Good morning. And I'm sorry if my connection's a little weak, just working remotely here.
Maybe just a follow up on Jason's question. By my calculations you guys will spend – you spent something like 1.5%
of sales on R&D. Is that enough? I mean, when you look at other technology companies, they'll spend multiples of that.
I mean how do you think about that, Marillyn?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, I don't think you can look at the absolute dollars honestly, because I think when you
look at our portfolio, when you look at what we've done over the years, it's not a matter of percent of sales, so much of
it is the efficient expenditure of R&D dollars.
So we've made choices in things such as JLTV, the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, which is a large opportunity that we're
pursuing that hopefully will be awarded later this year will bring to us an opportunity that is a significant new growth
market for us, and that started with an acquisition some years ago that brought some technology and then we built on
that technology. So it's not just the dollar level on a percent of sales.
And the other thing is if you look at things that – if you look backwards, I mean, I don't think we've missed anything in
terms of a portfolio and things that we have won, because we haven't invested in research and development for the long
term.

Thank you. Our next question is from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Your may begin.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning, Pete.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning, Pete.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Hey. Maybe one for Bruce. Bruce, I was wondering if you could help us again maybe
update us like you did in the last quarter on the cash from ops bridge from 2014 to 2015. Just because it looks like
maybe cash taxes were a little higher than expected in 2014. You've got obviously zero pension cash needs in 2015. It
seems like maybe $5 billion is good as it is, might even be conservative. Can you help us understand why that could be
what you do?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, Pete, let me try that. I tried to give some of this in the October call, but I think it's
probably worth repeating just to make sure everyone is on the same page. So I think the simple math, let's say, gee, you
did $3.9 billion in 2014, you did $2 billion of pension contributions, seems like it should be around $5.9 billion versus
the $5 billion.
I think there's kind of two or three pieces, probably two that drive most of that. One is, we have additional – because of
the $1 billion contribution we made at the end of the year 2014, we're going to get actually a tax deduction that's worth
about $350 million in 2014 that won't carry over into 2015. We also had in 2014 a tax refund of about $0.25 billion or
$250 million-ish or so I think was the number. So that's what $600 million or so sort of bridge from just the cash taxes,
if you will, either refunds or cash out for taxes.
And then lastly, if you just look at our, at the level of income that we're projecting from 2014 to 2015, we are down a
couple of hundred million dollars. So if you just translate those earnings into cash, that pretty much makes up the
difference to about the $900 million. And again I'll remind you, Pete, we keep saying we expect to be a little greater
than $5 billion and I think that potential is still there.

<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Marillyn, I really appreciate the comments on international post the – posture visit, but I
wondered if you might give us a little bit more color about how you think about, how much of your business is those
sort of core strategic capabilities that you are delivering to those customers versus, you know on the stuff that is
perhaps more support oriented or perhaps commoditized in some way. Is there a way to kind of rack and stack your
international business and say this portion applies the key capabilities like THAAD and PAC-3 and the like and how
should we think about that?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: So, I'd say first off that, the key areas of growth for us internationally are certainly in the
missile defense area in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East. Just as you mentioned, it's THAAD, it's Aegis for sure,
Patriot potentially means we hope to sell and in addition to that F35. I mean those are core and that's the majority of our
growth in the international. It's our core business that we're growing. Now we are – we are having some additional
areas of growth and things like cyber which is an expansion of work that we've been doing for years for the U.S.
government that we're able to grow into other areas, our IT work. But the big dollar items within our growth in the
international are core business that we have. C-130J's continue to fill F-16, the air and missile defense, the UK, Turret
for the Scout vehicle and for Warrior, things of that nature. Hopefully that answers your question Carter.

Thank you. Our next question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi, good morning, everyone.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning, Noah.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: So I wanted to ask about two bigger programs, new programs on which you are competing and
just kind of get a broad update from you. Maybe on LRSP, I was specifically wondering if you could talk about where
work would theoretically be done and if capacity were needed to be added? And then if there is any worthwhile update
on JLTV and on that one if you could potentially size, what that could ultimately be for the company if there was a
win? Thanks.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, first of all on LRSP, I can tell you that we are team with Boeing. We think we have
a very strong position on that program and pursuing it and there will be award sometime this year and that's about all I
can tell you about it. I am sorry. But that's that all I can say.

And in regard to JLTV, it's a very significant opportunity for us. The RFP is out, our proposals are due early in
February and the award for that is projected again this year. We think mid-year, we don't know if our guess is as good
as yours as to which quarter, because as we know a lot of times protest emerge and things of that nature. But in terms of
the program itself, it's a big opportunity for us.
Bruce, in terms of size, I think you could add.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yes. I think Noah – I think the RFP came out and they're asking for various production
quantities over various years, sort of the stated number of vehicles is somewhere around 17,000 vehicles and you can
probably do the math, as well as anyone as far as what that total production program would be for. But as you think
about, it's a multibillion-dollar sort of award for the initial proposal, which is the development program in the first few
LRIP contracts. And then it's got potential obviously well beyond that for both additional domestic vehicles, as well as
the international marketplace. So this is although the initial award that we're expecting to have happen this year
hopefully without protest pushing it out is not all that sizable. The strategic opportunity is very great.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: I could add on that one, Noah, where we're going to produce it. I can talk about that. So
it's in Camden, Arkansas we have a facility there where it just this past year we went through the production readiness
review with the U.S. government and it was very successful and so we're excited about the opportunity on the JLTV.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. You may begin.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Doug.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I'm interested in your thoughts around how you work with the changing budget? By that I
mean, if you look forward, we're at a point where there's prospects for rising budget, rising base budget certainly. But at
the same time, we're seeing the end of a lot of operational activity in theater that's been going on for many years. So
when you look at this, how do you think about your exposure to some of the ConOps that have been going on? Is there
much left and where is it? And then at the same time, how do you think about investing where there is going to be
growth in not just R&D, but BMP, potentially facilities. How do you manage this transition?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Thanks for the question, Doug. I would say that we spend a lot of time on our strategic
planning as a company and keep a bead on what's happening in the environments that we're operating in. And we look
both in, where the opportunities are relative to growth in this DoD budget, as well as, as you know, our focus on the
international marketplace. And as we look at the – sure there is a drawdown in regions where we are bringing our war
fighters home and that has some impact on things like our services business and things of that nature.
But where the real opportunities for ours are is to not only continue to grow with the F-35 program, which today
represents 17% of our sales and will continue to grow to a larger percentage in 2015 and beyond. But as we just talked
about the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, JLTV, is a big opportunity for us. We are looking forward to C-130J multiyear
opportunity related to our combat ship. And as the U.S. Navy moves forward with their 52-ship buy on the small
surface combatant, so going beyond the current Littoral Combat Ship. Those are all areas for growth.
We believe that we do have the strongest portfolio. So we are constantly looking at, as the U.S. government determines
where they have to recapitalize, they can't sit still either, even though in this current timeframe maybe the situation in
terms of a war environment is not as high. Well, they used up a lot of aircraft and lot of systems and vehicles in those
wars and they've got to recapitalize. I mean, we believe we're well-positioned to take advantage of that, because we are
continuing to focus on providing greater capability and new technology and taking advantage of that advanced

technology. So that's where our R&D, our bid proposal et cetera.
On facilities, we have looked at how we take capacity out. We've taken out over 7 million square feet of capacity since
2009, but at the same time, we have opened up some new labs, we've opened up some new areas. So I think what we
try to do is adjust our capacity to not only the business space, but to the areas where we need to invest to continue to
grow the business.
So I think we do a good job of assessing the changes in the environment that we are operating in. And we adjust our
facilities, our investments and our pursuit of acquisitions and research and development funding accordingly.

Thank you. Your next question is from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your may begin.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning. I wanted to actually somewhat follow up on that last question, which is that
the guidance has topline down in 2015 a few percent at the midpoint. You did make some $900 million worth of
acquisitions. So I guess, first part which is what is the organic sales trend in 2015? But then also, given budget trends,
can you see positive year-over-year sales in 2016 at this point and if not what does it take to get there?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Sam, I'll take that one on. So you're right, we talked about roughly $900 million in
acquisitions in the year. I think the inorganic growth in the year 2014 was about little less than $250 million. And you
should think of that growing to about $0.75 billion or so, about a $0.5 billion increase in inorganic growth
year-over-year from 2014 to 2015. So that's sort of where we see that playing out there.
I think it's important to note that our planning for 2015 and what we've talked about up to this point, is all based on the
current Budget Control Act, without consideration of what Marillyn was talking about in her opening remarks about the
potential increase in the FY2016 budget.
And as we look at that, the interesting thing – and I know I've talked to you guys about this in some of the investor
conferences, I think the interesting thing is not necessarily what happens with FY2016, it's what happens with the
budgets beyond FY2016, because if you just get the spike in FY2016 and when you go back down to the Budget
Control Act, you really go back down to levels that cause sort of an aberration in 2016 and then you're back to sort of
square one in FY2017 and beyond. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense from a strategic planning perspective.
I'll say even with that scenario – again we don't have either the spike in FY2016 in our planning outlook nor do we
have anything in FY2017 and beyond. We do believe we will start to see growth in FY2016, and particularly within the
Aeronautics business areas, where we're expecting to see growth. And I'll say, as I sit here today, Sam, I feel pretty
comfortable actually saying we're going to see some growth, organic growth, starting in FY2016 or 2016 above the
2015 level. And at least our planning, Sam, for years beyond 2016 assumes that that growth continues. So we're sitting
actually looking forward to that with the potential for hopefully some good news coming out of the President's budget
process in the not too distant future.

<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, we're really not seeing any pullback on their expenditures on national security,
because that in terms of their priority that's very important. And it's true that for a lot of our key country, that's an
important source of revenue for them. But when you look at countries like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar
and others, they have a very substantial government reserves.
And so, what they are looking at – as long as the prices don't stay down for a long extended time, which we, none of us
know how that'll play out, but we have not seen anything that would impact our portfolio and what we bring. So no
change so far in their critical needs. They still have and still operate in dangerous neighborhoods and they still have
needs for missile defense and tactical aircraft and range of communication systems. Perhaps there may be some
pressure on some of our less priority programs, such as IT upgrades or services or things of that nature, but in terms of
the big ticket items and the items that I'm having the dialog with them about, it has not come up. I think they're very
much focused on their highest priority requirements and those happened to be the things that we can bring to them as
we move forward.

Thank you. Our next question is from David Strauss of UBS. You may begin.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Looking specifically at the F-35 program, it looks like last year you had about an $800
million increase in sales, but no increase in profit related to the production program. Can you talk about what you've
got baked into your number this year in terms of any sort of EBIT increase out of the production program? And then as
a second question, Bruce, could you talk about the advanced line, I think it was like about $500 million drag. Can you
just talk about the outlook for advances from here? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, David, I think your math is pretty accurate. We were a little bit flat. I'm just
looking at some numbers here in terms of the production program. We actually had an overall profit – actually – let me
just take a peek here. Overall profit actually was up slightly on the F-35 program in total, the production program, and
that's primarily because of the lack of the SPD write-off that we took in 2013.
But the production program was fairly flat in terms of total profit dollars and actually the margin was down. I think
that's the point that you're poking at. We had some step-ups on the production early LRIP contracts in 2013. We had
some planned step-ups in 2014, some of which we took but not all of which that we had planned did we take in 2014.
So those got pushed out to the right, and that caused the situation that you're describing in 2014. As we look forward to
2015, I'm still expecting – and I know we talked about this as recently at the investor conference we had in Fort Worth,
I'm still expecting a 100 basis points or more improvement in the F-35 production program margins between 2014 and
2015 and we're hopeful that that trend will continue at least year-over-year sequential increase in the margins on the
production program in years thereafter, but the biggest spike we're expecting is between 2014 and 2015.
And I think a big reason for that, David, we closed the year pretty strong from a production perspective on the F-35
program. We had a month – almost a two-month delay in production activities or at least delivery of the aircraft
because of the engine anomaly that occurred in 2014 yet we made all 36 aircraft deliveries. We actually had a chance to
exceed that number. So I think as soon as we closed out the year things were looking and feeling better on the
production program than say when we started the year, and I'm hopeful that trend will continue into 2015, and that's
what we're baking on with that margin increase.
On the customer advances, I think the actual burn is about – we're expecting it to go down about another couple of
hundred million dollars or so. You're right, it was down about $0.5 billion from 2013 to 2014. Some of that is simply
the nature of – we're actually seeing a little bit of conversion from – and I think we've talked about this from some of

our direct commercial sales contracts to more and more FMS contracts that tend to get negotiated concurrently with the
U.S. government buyers. We're seeing that, for instance, on the F-35 program with aircraft and we're seeing that also in
a lot of our missile programs, be they HELLFIRE missiles, JASSMs, PAC-3 and the like. So a lot of the historical –
this was just in large part due to the customer change, the large part because of the F-35 growth, which is all going to
be FMS in the near term. We are seeing some burn down of sort of the legacy direct commercial sales as not being
replaced by new commercial sales, down payments in part because those are in fact FMS contracts. Kind of a long
winded answer to that question, David. Hope that made sense for you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Joe DeNardi of Stifel. You may begin.
<Q - Joe W. DeNardi>: Yes. Thanks. I guess just another on the F-35. If you could just kind of talk about what caused
some of those step-ups to get pushed out of 2014? And how the budget outlook for that program, which seems to be
improving kind of plays in to how you think about the margin profile improving on the production side?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, so, Joe, I'll take that one as well. So we always go through at every year thinking that
there is a planned level of booking rates, especially on programs that are early in their lifecycle as is the F-35. And in
2014, we had plan to have some increases on the production program and again for the reasons that I described to
David, some of that was simply in the early part of the year it made no sense, whatsoever, to have margin increases
when we were actually sitting idle because of the engine anomaly. And that did cause some disruption overall to the
performance at about the first half of the year, leaking into the second half of the year. And so that caused some of
those increases to get pushed out, just as I described, that's the reason I was making the point.
I think where we ended the year was a good point for us on the production programs and that does give us the
confidence that 2015 you will see those step-ups made; and that's the reason for the margin improvement that I talked
about with David. And again our expectation is a little big spiky from 2014 to 2015 in terms of a pretty good size jump
in the margins on the production program. But thereafter we continue to expect that margin to increase year-over-year
as we go through the production program.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. You may begin.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Hey. So on aeronautics ex-F-35, I was wondering, Bruce, if you might give a little bit of an
update. Obviously, we had our meeting a couple of months ago in Fort Worth, but just a little update on what your –
where you stand on deliveries this year for specifically for F-16 and C-130. And then key pursuits, little bit about the
multiyear in particular on the C-130 side? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, thanks, Joe. I'm going to give you sort of maybe again a long winded answer to the
question. So F-16 deliveries I think we'd keep this up in the past. We're going to drop – I think I'd teed up in the
October call. We had about 17 aircraft deliveries – not about we had 17 aircraft deliveries for the F-16 program in
2014. We're building about one a month, you should think of it. So we're looking at about 11 or 12 deliveries probably
in 2015. I think the current contract schedule it's just 11 aircraft there.
On the C-130, we're at a pretty steady build rate between years. We did 24 aircraft in 2014. We would expect to do 24
aircraft in 2015 as well. And that's – again that's the expectation. That's sort of a good build rate. In fact we'd prefer to
sort of build it at that steady rate as opposed to having sort of spikes that would cause us to have a little bit of
disruption. We'd rather build it at that steady rate. And with the backlog that we have in the program we're able to do

that.
C-130 multiyear, so we got, I'll say, some partial funding on that at the end of 2014 and we expect to close the rest of
that, the balance of that in 2015. But the value is not as large as it was, say, last year, because we got a little bit of
funding at the end of the year that was sort of partial funding on a fiscal year basis towards that multiyear.
So maybe inherent in the question – I'm sorry, I didn't talk about the F-35 program. So we did 36 aircraft deliveries in
2014 that number is going to increase, probably in the 40 aircraft deliveries maybe a couple more than that. We're
actually working with the Joint Program Office later in the month of February to sort of finalize the production delivery
plans. We do that because it actually does require resources on both sides, both the government resources as well as
company resources to do that.
So we'll have a better idea, a more definitive idea of the F-35 deliveries, probably next time we talk to you in April. But
I would expect that will be somewhere in the – again the 40 aircraft deliveries or maybe a couple more than that as we
sit here today.
And then the last aircraft program, I guess, for the aeronautics business area, we delivered seven C-5s in 2014. We
expect that number to go up to 9 deliveries. And I think we stay at about that level probably until the program winds
down through the last delivery of the C-5 modernization program.
Hey, one thing while we're talking aircraft and deliveries and quantities, Joe, I want to make sure that everyone
understands this. At least as we look at sort of the phasing of our revenue in 2015, it's going to be a bit of an odd year.
We're very heavily weighted in the second half. The first quarter, in particular, is very unusually low or we expect it to
be very unusually low on a compare basis, because of our delivery phasing, and that's both associated with the
aeronautics aircrafts that I just talked about. I think the – I think we've got too fewer F-16s in the first quarter, and too
fewer C-130s both in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014.
But combined that with the fact that Missiles and Fire Control is going to have a pretty significant drop-off in the first
quarter of deliveries of the missile programs both tactical missiles, PAC-3s and the like, we could see the first quarter
revenue being down as much as, say, 5% year-over-year compared to the first quarter of 2014, and then obviously it'll
build from that point on to the levels that we're seeing for the full year for 2015. So it's a little bit of an unusual pattern
for us. We always have the pattern where the fourth quarter is higher than the rest, but we're starting off 2015, or at
least expectation, probably a little lower than we normally would.

Thank you. Our next question is from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. You may begin.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning, Myles.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: First, one of the clarification, I might've missed it, but the international sales in
2014, I think last few years have been about 17% of sales, if you can just give that number for 2014. And then
Marillyn, as you look at the Middle East as kind of a customer base and you think about the threats that exist there,
that's one aspect, but the foreign policy and what we choose to do, there's another. And just hypothetical, if the U.S.
does move more towards the normalization with Iran over the nuclear activities does that in any way impede what you
see as progress in the foreign military sales front there from a DLS perspective? Thanks.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Thanks, Myles. Well, first let me answer to your question, we achieved 20% of our total
sales on international sales in 2014, so we're very pleased with that and we have over $20 billion in our backlog at year
end to that. We've set a new goal to get to 25% over the next few years. Our growing international area is an important
element of our strategy and growth for the company and we see a lot of expanding demand for international growth,
expanding demand on missile defense, on aircraft program, and a range of things.

To your question about foreign policy and normalization and things of that nature, in my discussions with our
customers that that really isn't coming up. I mean it's very clear to the Middle East region that dialog is going on, but
front and center for them are the needs that they have today, what their critical national requirements are today. So our
discussion is around those national security needs that they have, and there're certainly plenty of threats in the region,
just the volatility, even if there may be some kind of deal done with Iran, there is volatility all around the region, and
each one of these countries believes they've got to protect their citizens; and the things that we can bring to them help
in that regard.
So similarly that's the Middle East, and I know that's what you asked about, but you could take that same argument to
the Asia-Pacific region, which is another growth area for us. A lot of volatility, a lot of instability, a lot of things that
are happening both with North Korea as well as some of the tensions between China and Japan. And so in both of those
regions, which are growth areas for us, we expect that there is going to continue to be opportunities for us to bring our
capabilities to them.

Thank you. Our next question is from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. You may begin.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yeah. Bruce, I noticed that all the margins that you project for 2015 in each of the sectors
are down relative to 2014. Aero is explainable with mix, space may be explainable with less venture income, but can
you go through why they're down in all the other sectors? And if you could maybe layout what you think would be kind
of the normalized number that we'd wind up reaching in terms of these margins, because it will be the second year that
we'll have seen a decline.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: George, I'll try to take a shot at; that's a good question. So even though you kind of gave the
answer for a couple, I'll go ahead and try to hit all five business areas from my perspective, maybe from what we're
seeing in 2015 and then sort of the longer term view. So Aeronautics in 2015, in part because of the discussions we've
had up to this point on the F-35 production program and the fact we expect to see some increases there, 2015 is really
looking fairly comparable from a margin perspective for Aeronautics. Longer term, we've talked about the fact that as
F-35 increases, even in the scenario that I described with year-over-year margin increases, those will still be lower than
the composite average margin for Aeronautics, if you will. So that will still be dilutive just because of the growth of the
F-35 program and that's what we expect to see there longer term.
Missile and Fire Control is maybe slightly lower than 2015, but I'll say that's probably pretty comparable when you
look at it big picture wise, and we still think we have some of the same opportunities in 2015 as we had in 2014.
Longer term, I'd expect some reduction in the higher margin business that we've got there, particularly if we're
successful, for instance, winning the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, you would expect us to have that program start off at
a lower booking rate than some of our legacy long production programs, long production missile programs at Missile
and Fire Control. And so I'd expect to see, again longer term, some reduction in the margins in Missiles and Fire
Control from the level we experienced in 2014 and probably 2015 as well.
Mission Systems and Training is down slightly in 2015 compared to 2014. You should think of that really, primarily as
a result of new program starts. So programs like Space Fence, like the Combat Rescue Helicopter, like the new
presidential helicopter. Those are all early starts on larger programs that are actually driving a lot of the organic growth
of MST there. And that's coming with lower margins than some of their heritage production programs, just like I talked
about on Missiles and Fire Control.
There's also within MST, in 2015, some of the last of the restructuring charges that remember we talked about in 2013,
we took the severance charges, but there were still ongoing restructuring charges for things like facility closures and
facilities rearrangements and so forth. There's about $20 million or so higher restructuring cost in MST in 2015 and
2014. So that's putting a little bit of pressure there. Longer term, I think it's going to be fairly comparable to where we
end up 2015, maybe a little bit higher as some of that restructuring expense goes away. And hopefully, we'd start to
have some increases on some of those early program starts that I talked about.

IS&GS, we teed up in the October call that we thought it'd be down about 30 basis points or so from 2014 to 2015, and
I describe that as about half of that just being sort of the increased level of competition, re-competes, disaggregation,
breaking down contracts and so forth, and the other half of that 30 basis points was – we changed some of the backlog
within IS&GS to have a number of longer term international programs that extend over multiple years, a little bit
different than the sort of the heritage IS&GS business. And those were starting off, just as any new program would,
with lower overall margins to the composite, and that was sort of the other half of the 30 basis points that we talked
about.
So if you rewind back to the end of the October call, I would have said we should be looking at probably somewhere in
the 8.7%, 8.8% range for margins at IS&GS. We're a little lower than that. And all of that, George, is because of the
transaction expenses associated with the acquisition we made at the end of last year for Systems Made Simple. So that's
bringing another 30 basis points or so reduction to IS&GS's overall margin.
So while that acquisition is EPS dilutive, it is actually cash accretive in year one, so that's something we're happy to
take those charges. And again longer term for IS&GS is that as those transaction costs start to play out, we expect to
see some slight increases in the IS&GS profitability margin levels from where we are today.
In Space, you talked about the ULA earnings, we teed that up in the October call that the equity earnings associated
with United Launch Alliance are down pretty considerably in 2014 versus 2015. A lot of that was just a mix of the
launch vehicles we have there. And that's driving the biggest single piece of that. The other piece that may not be
evident again is we also made couple of acquisitions for Zeta and the satellite processing business that we acquired last
year. Those also are bringing transaction expenses in 2015 that were not in 2014. You should think of that as about a 20
basis point or so impact in the margins of Space Systems Company in 2015.
And just as I described on the Systems Made Simple or the acquisition for IS&GS, while they're a little bit EPS dilutive
in 2015, both those acquisitions are cash accretive in 2015. So we're happy with that. Longer term for Space Systems, I
think we'd get back at about the 12% margin. We're a little bit light of that in 2014. But as some of these, again,
transaction expenses go down, and as by the way some of the restructuring costs that we have in the Space Systems
start to wind down, I think you'll see the overall margins getting back to sort of a normal run rate with the ULA equity
earnings at about the 12% level.
Jerry F. Kircher
Shannon, this is Jerry. I think we've run over the hour a little bit, so I'm going to turn it back over to Marillyn for final
comments.
Marillyn A. Hewson
Sure. Thanks, Jerry. I just want to wrap up the call by, again, saying that the corporation achieved another excellent
year in 2014 and we continue to be well positioned to deliver substantial value to our customers and our stockholders as
we move strongly in 2015. So thanks again for joining the call today. We look forward to speaking to you again in our
next earnings call in April. Shannon that concludes our call today.
Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation and have a
wonderful day.
