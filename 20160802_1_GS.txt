MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone
to the Goldman Sachs Fixed Income Investor Conference Call. Also, this call is being recorded today, August 2, 2016.
Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.
Dane E. Holmes
Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our Fixed Income
investor conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's
belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual
results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking
statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the
description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2015.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it
relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets and
supplementary leverage ratio. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial
measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.

Thanks, Dane. I want to thank everyone for dialing in. Given that we recently reported our financial results for the
second quarter, our comments today will focus on our financial profile, particularly capital, liquidity and funding.
Robin will take you through the slides, and then we will both take your questions. Robin?
Robin Vince
Thanks, Harvey. Look, as you know, I started transitioning into this role mid-fall last year and took over as Treasurer
on January 1. I know I haven't met everyone yet, but it's been great seeing many of you. And I certainly look forward to
staying connected. I want to thank you for the insights and perspectives so far and I look forward to meeting more of
you in the future.
With respect to managing the firm, we are well positioned with a significant pool of excess cash and term and
diversification. Our approach is centered on conservative asset liability management, with term liabilities supporting
our high turnover balance sheet. And as you know, our equity capital is near record levels providing a robust
foundation for our balance sheet. Consistent with the update we provided last year, you'll see throughout the
presentation that our financial position is exceptionally strong.
With that, let me take you through the slides. We'll start with our balance sheet on slide 3. Year-over-year,
accrual-based lending is nearly $10 billion higher as we continue to lend more to our private wealth and investment
banking clients. Our global core liquid assets, or GCLA, increased by more than $20 billion which we'll discuss later.
And our institutional client services inventory declined by more than $13 billion.
Our second quarter balance sheet of $897 billion is up approximately $37 billion with our deposit platform acquisitions
driving nearly half of the increase. When thinking about our assets, our de-risking efforts over the past decade have
reshaped our balance sheet composition in a meaningful way. Our GCLA and cash comprises nearly 25% of our
balance sheet. Our secured client financing, primarily associated with our match-book and prime brokerage businesses,
represents 26%. Taken together, approximately half of our total assets either relate to our excess liquidity, cash or
collateralized client activity.
Even when you look at our balance sheet excluding our excess liquidity and secured client financing, the remainder is
largely comprised of liquid assets that are primarily marked to market. The largest portion is institutional client services
which supports our global market-making franchise.
Within ICS, inventory is the most significant driver of the assets and remains very high velocity. In fact, over 80% of
our ICS cash inventory has been aged for six months or less over the past four quarters. A high turnover,
mark-to-market balance sheet ultimately provides the firm with increased flexibility.
With respect to the liability side, we continue to fund our assets conservatively which we'll discuss in more detail
starting on slide 4. As I mentioned at the outset, given our focus on a conservative funding structure, we maintain a
significant emphasis on diversification and term. We actively monitor our maturity profile and have further
strengthened the diversity of our primary funding sources.
Since the end of 2007, the financial footings of the firm have been significantly enhanced. For instance, deposits have
increased by more than $100 billion. Today, we benefit from a better balance of deposits and secured funding.
Additionally, our long-term financing has also improved, with shareholder's equity doubling over this timeframe,
increasing $44 billion. Long-term debt has also increased and now stands at $184 billion.
As our balance sheet and funding sources have evolved, the firm is now well positioned for metrics like the net stable
funding ratio or NSFR. Based on the current proposal, which is not effective until 2018, we believe the firm is
approximately at the NSFR requirement today. Obviously, this is based on estimate, given the U.S. agencies have not
yet finalized the rule and things could change.
Let's switch gears and dig slightly deeper into unsecured funding on slide 5. As you know, our strategy remains
opportunistic, and we've been active in the first half given that markets have been conducive to issuance. To date, we

have raised approximately $20 billion compared to roughly $23 billion of maturity for this year. As we sit here today,
we expect to generally match our maturities this year, but we will remain opportunistic with respect to market
conditions.
Diversification across currency, channel and tenor is a priority. For example, 55% of our vanilla issuance to date has
been in non-U.S. currencies compared to just 27% in 2015 and 38% in 2014. This represents a significant mix of
non-U.S. funding and highlights how we'll be dynamic and opportunistic with our funding plan to respond to investor
demand and market conditions. We have also tapped a variety of tenors and remain vigilant on our maturity
concentrations.
As always, we maintain a conservative tenor profile with a weighted average maturity in excess of nine years for our
long-term unsecured debt portfolio.
As it relates to TLAC, we are still awaiting a final rule from our regulators, but given our historical approach of
funding primarily out of our holding company, we believe that we are well-positioned for both TLAC and the
long-term debt requirement.
Turning to slide 6, let's spend a moment on our approach to liability management. While we have always been
opportunistic about sourcing our funding, we are also opportunistic about managing our outstanding liabilities. We
continually look for ways to create a more conservative and cost-effective funding profile, and we thought it might be
helpful to walk you through our thought process.
Three broad considerations impact our decision-making. Our maturity profile and regulatory capital treatment, which
are linked, are the first two. These are the primary factors we consider. And of course, third, we also consider
economics.
First, our maturity profile. We are focused on maintaining a well-constructed distribution of maturities, and where
appropriate, we will respond dynamically to achieve that goal.
Second, on capital requirements, we regularly analyze our senior, sub and preferred securities. To the extent rules
evolve and if certain securities lose regulatory capital treatment, we may respond through liability management. In
2014, the firm tendered for our trust-preferred securities, which no longer would count as Tier 1 capital and were
beginning to phase out of Tier 2. We ultimately purchased $1.4 billion of the securities as the loss of capital credit
turned the securities into inefficient debt.
Finally, on economics. Although subordinate to our first two considerations, we are focused on achieving a
cost-effective funding structure. For example, this year, the firm has tendered for a preferred stock offering, a senior
debt offering and a sub-debt offering. All of these repurchases made sense from a corporate finance perspective.
However, I want to emphasize that our principal focus is ensuring that our financial footings remain strong. Going
forward, we'll continue to look for opportunities to pursue sensible liability management across the capital structure.
Let's now discuss our deposit growth on slide 7. As we mentioned earlier, deposits have become a more meaningful
share of our funding as part of our efforts to diversify and reduce funding costs. Our growth has primarily been organic,
although we recently closed on the GE online deposit platform, which provided a further boost to our cash and
increased our deposits by more than $16 billion. This transaction was attractive, as it provided access to a new deposit
channel for the firm.
Along with the transaction, we added over 140,000 retail customers. And in the past two and a half months, between
the closing and the end of the quarter, we onboarded in excess of 20,000 new accounts, a 15% increase to the total
account base. With respect to the future, we continue to see opportunity for deposit gathering, and we're confident that
we'll be able to raise deposits to the extent asset side opportunities present themselves.
Moving on to slide 8, we'll now provide more detail on our secured funding. If structured conservatively, we believe it's
a prudent way to finance a portion of the firm's market-making inventory. Like all of our primary funding sources, term
is important as is diversification. As you can see on the bottom of the slide, 75% of our non-GCLA secured funding
book is either collateralized by liquid equities or made up of transactions that provide flexibility to post a broad range

of collateral. We are very focused on ensuring that our weighted average maturity, or WAM, is appropriate by asset
class. Taking a very conservative approach means that our WAM is well in excess of the underlying liquidity profile of
the assets we are funding. The WAM of our non-GCLA book remains greater than 120 days.
We currently source this financing from more than 80 funding providers, which is consistent with last year.
Additionally, we continue to be flexible in terms of product by sourcing funding away from traditional repo. This
includes products like secured notes and loans.
On slide 9, we delve into our liquidity profile, which, as you know, is conservative. More than 20% of our balance
sheet is in GCLA and we remain above LCR requirements. We sit here today with exceptionally robust levels of GCLA
and are very well positioned to meet the needs of our clients.
I'll now briefly touch on our capital position on slide 10. From a capital perspective, we remain conservatively
positioned across risk and balance sheet requirements. With multiple capital considerations, we continue to leverage
our return on attributed equity framework which weights our various requirements including advanced, standardized,
supplementary leverage and CCAR. Both our standardized and advanced common equity Tier 1 ratios are well in
excess of our 9.5% fully phased-in requirement. We are also well above our supplementary leverage requirement of
5%.
In addition to our strong position in common equity Tier 1, we are in a strong position on Tier 1 and total capital which
we discuss a little more on slide 11.
As you know, there are a variety of inputs to how we size our capital levels. Although CCAR is just one input, it does
factor into the sizing of our Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital levels. Since the introduction of the CCAR test, we've issued
nearly $12 billion of perpetual preferred and subordinated debt. Based on all the elements that we consider, we might
choose to have greater than the 1.5% that might be considered optimal for the spot Tier 1 metric and 2% for the spot
Tier 2 metric.
On sub-debt, we also highlight on the slide the amount phasing out of Tier 2 capital through 2021, based on the Basel
requirement. If we want to maintain our current balance of qualified sub-debt, we would only need to issue
approximately $2.8 billion over the next five-and-a-half years.
Let me conclude with a few broader comments. We have a robust financial profile, as you can observe through our
metrics. This fundamental improvement in our financial footings has transpired over the past decade. This
transformation has included a reduction of our systemic footprint, with a smaller balance sheet and reduced leverage.
Liquidity and capital are at or close to record levels, and we believe that we are well-positioned, including for the
various regulatory requirements that we are subject to. Our current financial profile provides us with a strong
foundation to deliver superior value for our clients, debt investors and shareholders in the years ahead.
With that, Harvey and I are happy to take your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Donna Halverstadt with Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Donna Halverstadt>: Good morning.
<A - Robin Vince>: Hey, Donna.
<Q - Donna Halverstadt>: Hey. Robin, I forget the exact wording you used, but I think you said something along the
lines that you at points may decide that you want to go above the 150 bps and 200 bps markers. What sort of factors
would cause you to decide to go above those levels?

<A - Robin Vince>: So, let me just reiterate the point that I made in my prepared remarks, Donna, which is we feel
good about our current positioning. We currently have about 2.2% in terms of pref as a percentage of RWAs under the
standardized transitional approach. And then on the sub-debt side, as you saw in the materials, although we have $17
billion outstanding, $14.7 billion of it receives capital credit and that's about 2.8% of RWAs under the same
standardized transitional approach.
So, as we think about it, we're obviously targeting not only spot, but also stress. And so as you know, the way in which
we think about stress tests is dynamic as is the way that our regulators think about stress tests. But we try to take into
account all of those different variables when we size it.
<Q - Donna Halverstadt>: Okay, great. And I had a question for Harvey as well, and it's a question on expectations
for industry quarterly patterns. And as we all know, when we look historically over a number of years, the first quarter
tends to be by far the best, with quarters two, three and four trailing off below that. This year, obviously, has been very,
very different with the industry broadly posting horrendous first quarter results and great second quarter results. And
when you look at everything that's going on in the world right now, what sort of expectations do you have for third and
fourth quarters? And I'm obviously not asking for GS-specific guidance, I know you won't go there, but I'm just
looking for your general sense around how quarterly patterns may play out over the rest of this year given all that is
going on on the macroeconomic, political, et cetera, stages.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah. So I think to the extent to which there is – just to use different language, the
extent to which there's any seasonality, I think the first quarter has historically just represented the fact that as markets,
debt, equity and advisory transactions in maybe, generally speaking, in four quarters, December was generally a more
quiet month, you might see a shift of activity into the beginning of any calendar year. I think that was just sort of a
natural seasonality. And then the summer is the summer. And so, typically, you might see a slowdown. Obviously,
there were some unique factors in terms of the macroenvironment in the first quarter, which may have pushed out
activity levels.
I think in terms of expectations about debt structure, my base case would be that over many cycles, debt structure
probably is the same over many, many years.
In terms of the near-term outlook, I think, look, we'll see how things evolve in the current macroenvironment.
Obviously, there's a lot of focus on just economic growth and the direction of interest rates across the globe. But I think
in terms of seasonality, I think this year may have been an anomaly. We'll see how it looks in the future.
<Q - Donna Halverstadt>: Okay. And the last question I had is would you speak to each of your major fixed income
lines of business addressing the extent to which you think – to which each of those businesses has seen any change in
market share as the industry continues to restructure?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So I won't go through each of the business lines. I would say that, generally
speaking, the long-term trend is that when we look through it, particularly when we see peak volumes in the underlying
businesses, we see pickup in market share. And so, for example, if you look at the couple of days following the Brexit
vote, we felt like our positioning and our ability to engage with clients and execute on their behalf and provide content
put us in a very good position. And I would say that the most critical factor, away from execution, is really just about
being there to provide content and mindshare for them. But, to us, it feels like, when we see activity levels pick up or
there's market events, we feel like we're having an increase in impact.
<Q - Donna Halverstadt>: All right. Thank you, guys.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thank you.

<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Sure. Good morning.
<A - Robin Vince>: Yeah. Good morning, Hima.
<Q - Hima B. Inguva>: Thanks, Harvey. Good morning. Good morning, Robin. A couple of questions here. First is,
so you've issued $18.7 billion in seniors, that in our models you're at the tail end of issuance. Just wanted to know, I
know you'd be opportunistic, but are you pretty much done for the year for seniors and subs? And how are you thinking
about preferred?
<A - Robin Vince>: So you're right that we're opportunistic, and I think that that's very important in the context of
answering this. So our base case is that we would be matching maturities for the year. But this year is a great
illustration of our desire to try to be opportunistic and the fact that we're prepared to be quite dynamic, including
geographically, when it comes to thinking about diversification of funding, and you've seen the conditions in Europe.
And so, we've certainly been taking advantage of the fact that there's been a significant appetite there.
And the other thing I'd say just generally, more as a cautionary note, is while we do talk in calendar years and your
question was sort of framed in calendar years, we think about this over extended periods of time. In fact, we think about
it over very long periods of time, but we don't see a particular break in terms of the calendar year. And so that's not a
sort of a magical point.
In terms of sub and preferred, I think I covered that actually in the prepared remarks. I'll take sub first. We feel very
well positioned and able to deal with a variety of different evolutions of the test or other considerations that bear on
that. And similar is true for preferred.
<Q - Hima B. Inguva>: I guess the reason for my question on preferred specifically was in the context of SLR
inclusion in CCAR. So comparing DFAST and CCAR results, it looks like – first, it looks like you don't plan to issue
preferreds, just based on the numbers. Correct me if I'm wrong. And if SLR is included in CCAR at 5% minimum and
OBS assets grow at the same pace as Tier 1 leverage denominator, you'll have to issue a lot, in the order of $20 billion
of additional preferreds in that models, to meet the next year's CCAR requirement. Just wanted to make sure that all
those numbers are correct and how we should be thinking about that.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: It's Harvey. So, with respect to CCAR, the way you've seen us approach it really
won't change for the future. So, we will wait to see whether there's confirmation about any changes in the test. The test
has been dynamic and we'll respond when we see technical changes to the test. And so, we'll approach it the way we
have in the past.
<Q - Hima B. Inguva>: Okay. Great. Thank you. And last question from me. Are you in a position to provide the
estimated impact of FRTB either in terms of CET1 or market risk RWAs, given your market risk RWAs are a
significant portion of your total, in both advanced and standardized?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So, given the nature of where that proposal stands, we can't at this stage. Again,
we'll see ultimately what the final rule looks like and there may even be ongoing discussions at Basel regarding the
rule. So, we'll see how it evolves.
<Q - Hima B. Inguva>: Okay. Great. And any color or any expectations around timing of TLAC? It's not out yet. I
guess people are expecting that to come out in this quarter.
<A - Robin Vince>: So, TLAC, obviously, you'd have to ask the agencies about the timing of the rule. But we're
looking forward to seeing it.
<Q - Hima B. Inguva>: Great. All right. Thank you very much.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thanks, Hima.

Your next question is from the line of Brian Monteleone with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Hey. Thanks. Robin, I think you mentioned that, yeah, your estimated NSFR approximates
the minimum standard under the proposal. Can you talk about where you see the lowest hanging fruit to build a buffer?
Is it on the asset side, the liability side, the mix across legal entities, how do you get from where you are today to a
buffer?
<A - Robin Vince>: So, first thing I would say is it's probably a mix of all of the above. But I'd just remind you that we
don't have a final rule yet, and that's very important. And I'm always super cautious about reading too much excess
precision into something given the fact that we don't have the final rule. So, as you've seen, we've been conservative in
the way that we've approached asset liability management broadly. This rule absolutely hits at the center of that. And
so, we feel very well positioned.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Got it. And then in terms of do you have any initial thoughts on what kind of a buffer you'd
ideally want to operate at under this new constraint?
<A - Robin Vince>: Yeah. Brian, I understand the reason for the question, but it really just is too early to tell in the
process. We really need a final rule, and like everything, we have to live with these things for a little while as well.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Got it. On the insurance side, I know you guys have been issuing opportunistically and
above and beyond maturities, and at the same time there's a slide that points out the ICS balance sheet has come down a
fair amount over the last couple of years. So, in terms of how you think about use of proceeds, to the extent that you –
if you were to continue opportunistically issuing, how do you think about – what does the business do with those
proceeds?
<A - Robin Vince>: Gosh. The way we think about this is always asset-side driven. And so, ultimately, our liabilities
and the use of our liabilities is going to be driven by the opportunities that we see in the business and the demands of
our clients on us. If your question is sort of asking if I'm happy to have excess liquidity at this particular point in time,
very happy to have that.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Yeah. Fair enough. Thank you. And then maybe one for Harvey. I know Craig and you and
team, everybody over there, was very focused on Brexit going into Brexit and had a view it was more likely to happen
maybe than the market was pricing. And can you talk a little bit about how you set yourselves up going into Brexit and
how you performed versus how you thought things might play out? And then also, I know you talked a fair amount on
the equity earnings call, but any update in terms of client activity and pipeline since then?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yeah. So, I think everything you said is pretty accurate. I would make one
technical modification. I don't think we necessarily ascribed any higher probability. But I think culturally, it's just our
conservative bias in terms of how we manage these types of tail events. So, we just started very early in our planning in
terms of reviewing all the relative risks, and also preparing things for capacity because we thought although we
expected the vote to come out differently, we wanted to make sure that we had sufficient capacity to be there for our
clients.
So, some of these things are obvious, but we had obviously planned to have our teams working 24 hours around the
clock. All of our federation support teams were ensuring that when we expected to and inevitably ran at either peak or
near-peak volumes in a number of our businesses that we were able to process that capacity front to back for our clients
and, as I mentioned earlier, obviously be there for our clients in terms of content and discussion. And that's why I don't
know if you heard the earlier question, that's why when we looked at it, we really felt like those couple of days right
after Brexit, we able to see a pickup in our market share.
But that's really how we thought about it, and that's the way we'll think about all I think low-risk outlier events in terms
of how we manage the firm.
<Q - Brian Monteleone>: Great. And then on just the pipeline, any changes over the last couple of weeks or pretty
much in line with what was said on the equity earnings call?

<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Pretty much the same. Obviously, I think we've seen some merger activity that's
UK-based. I think that might have surprised the market a little bit. But I think the markets responded quite well in terms
of the rebound to Brexit. And I think everyone is now digesting that this is going to be potentially a long process with
some uncertainty.

Your next question is from the line of [ph] Scott Cavanagh (29:29) with APG. Please go ahead.
<Q>: Thanks, guys, for holding the call. Much appreciated. I had a question for you on TLAC. Not necessarily what
the rule is, but once we get the final rule, how have you been looking at internally what tweaks you're going to make to
the indenture going forward and how you might be looking to work with investors on this?
<A - Robin Vince>: Got it. Thanks, [ph] Scott (29:55). So, look, first of all, let me just say, TLAC is obviously a key
rule and we're looking forward to seeing the final details. Like everything, until we see that final rule, it's really hard to
comment. I will just say one thing on indentures. I mean, you raise an important issue, but this is an issue that's bigger
than Goldman Sachs. We fully appreciate the nature or the importance of indentures to investors and to the debt
markets overall. So we've been engaged on the topic as I know others have as well. And we look forward to seeing the
final rule, and we'll adapt as we always do because that's how we approach these things.
<Q>: I would note that I think there's an investor concern out there that you get the rule and then the next issue is
issued – whether it's grandfathered or not, we can put that to the side, but that it might have completely stripped of all
covenant protection. I think this is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity for the industry to align covenants
across all the money centers and to kind of really improve creditor protections on this. And I think are a lot of people
out there who would be willing to meet with the industry to discuss this and discuss how we might streamline this
going forward.
And then the second question I had is on the foreign laws. What is the actual percent of your [ph] LTD (31:16) that's
foreign law? And if you can give that on a dollar basis, that would be great.
<A - Robin Vince>: Well, like on the first part of the point that you raised, thank you for raising the concern. I don't
want to leave you with the impression that we are anything other than very focused on this. We recognize that it's an
important issue to you and to other investors, and it's certainly been part of our process of engagement and
commentary.
In terms of the second one, I don't have that number off the top of my head, but we can certainly come back to you with
some additional information if that's helpful.
<Q>: That would be. And I think most people would love to see that. So maybe just put it in the Q. That'd be great.

Your next question is from the line of Robert Smalley with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for doing the call. Just following up on [ph] Scott's (32:10)
comment there. The foreign law question is one that I think is on a lot of people's minds. So wide-scale disclosure
would be very much appreciated.
Just two quick questions. On slide 5, when you talk about the WAM, which is now nine years, we've seen your WAM –
and at seven years, not in the too-distant past, and at that time, it was said that you were very comfortable with seven

years. Now we're up to nine. Is this the range we can expect? Is nine a goal? Is it just – it happens to come out that way
this quarter and you're as comfortable at seven? Could you give us an idea of how you feel around this? This is my first
question.
<A - Robin Vince>: Sure. So we like tenor. So, let me just start by emphasizing that. And so, we've obviously seen a
very interesting environment in terms of interest rates as well, which is also a factor. Like I said earlier on, we're
dynamic about these things. And you saw us borrow, just as one example, in fixed rates in euros in 10-years just a very
short while ago where we saw a good opportunity. But, look, we manage the profile of our liabilities according to what
we think is appropriate for our asset. And so, the amount of tenor that we actually end up with in any portion of our
liabilities is really just an output of that process.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Okay. So, that seven or nine years or whatever it comes out to be is not really a metric
you use to plan, it's really an output.
<A - Robin Vince>: It's an output, not an input. That's the right way to think about it.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Okay. Secondly, just a quick question on page 11. I think you said that these capital
numbers are transitional numbers.
<A - Robin Vince>: On page 11 – let me just quickly pull the slide.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: It's the Tier 1 and total capital slide.
<A - Robin Vince>: Tier 1, yes, they are standardized transitional.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Transitional. Okay. So do you have the equivalent end-state numbers?
<A - Robin Vince>: I don't have the equivalent end-state numbers in front of me for those. But we should follow up
with you.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Okay. Yeah. I'll call Jared and Dane.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Great. Thanks.
<Q - Robert Louis Smalley>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of David Jiang with Prudential. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Jiang>: Hi, Robin. I had a question on also slide 11 on capital. So, given the Basel fundamental review of
the trading book, what is actually going to change here? Is it the market risk component of the RWAs? And do we have
any sense of what that would potentially go up to?
<A - Robin Vince>: So, obviously, Harvey commented on fundamental review of the trading book a moment ago. And
we really can't comment given the fact that we haven't seen the final output from that process. It's obviously an ongoing
process.
<Q - David Jiang>: Okay. But it still would only be the market risk portion of the RWAs. Correct?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Again, as Robin said, it's a proposed rule, so we'll have to see when we get the final
rules.
<Q - David Jiang>: Okay. And then regarding TLAC, do you anticipate issuance of TLAC eligible bonds that
potentially might have call structures built in, senior debt?
<A - Robin Vince>: I think this goes back to the same point about needing to see the final rule. And so, when we see
the final rule, we'll obviously make sure that our issuance is appropriately structured to comply with that and we're

going to look at all of the options that we think make sense armed with those final requirements.
<Q - David Jiang>: Okay. So, you would wait for final rules before any type of – inserting any calls into your new
issuance.
<A - Robin Vince>: I'd prefer to wait and see the final details, but we're obviously dynamic about these types of
things. So, I'm not going to commit either way.
<Q - David Jiang>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thanks, David.
<A - Robin Vince>: Thanks, David.
