Frederick Wallace Smith
Thank you, Mickey. Happy holidays to everyone, and welcome to our discussion of results for the second quarter of
fiscal 2014. FedEx posted solid second quarter earnings, reflecting improved performance at FedEx Express, as the
profit improvement initiatives that we introduced more than a year ago continue to gain momentum. We are very
pleased with the excellent work by the entire Express team in improving their results.
While a later start to the holidays shipping season contributed to a decline in operating margin at Ground, on a
year-to-year basis, we expect the full year operating margin at Ground will be consistent with the FY 2013 margin of
nearly 17%. FedEx Freight results were affected by a shift in customer mix and the shipment attributes.
Overall, we believe our strategy is working well and we are confident we will achieve our goals. We expect revenue
and earnings growth to continue into the third quarter and the remainder of 2014, driven by ongoing improvements in
the results of all our transport segments. Our balance sheet is strong, giving us the flexibility to initiate the significant
stock repurchase program announced in October, while continuing to execute our strategic growth initiatives.
The profit improvement program and the stock repurchase exemplify, I think, our commitment to deliver outstanding
value to our shareholders. I'd like to thank our more than 300,000 team members around the world, many working in
very challenging weather this very day, to deliver the holidays to our customers. The past three Mondays, December 2,
December 9 and December 16, were record days for average daily volume, with this past Monday setting a record of
more than 22 million packages.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike Glenn and following that, Alan Graf. Mike?

Thank you, Fred. I'll cover economic commentary, as well as some commentary on yields per package. The FedEx
economic forecast calls for moderate growth in the global economy. We see real GDP, industrial production and
consumer spending better sequentially in both calendar 2014 and calendar 2015 in the U.S. and globally.
Our U.S. GDP forecast is 2.4% for calendar 2014 and 3% for calendar 2015. For industrial production, we expect
growth of 3.1% in calendar 2014 and 3.6% in calendar 2015. Policy risk remains high, but improvement is ongoing in
Europe and China. We estimate global growth of 2.8% in calendar 2014 and 3.2% for calendar 2015.
Turning to yields, excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic yield per package increased 4.3%.
The increase was primarily driven by rate and discount improvements, followed by increased weight per package and
service mix. The Ground package yield increased 3%, excluding the impact of fuel. The year-over-year increase was
driven by rate and discount improvements, as well as an increase in extra services charges.
Excluding fuel, international export Express package yield increased 3.2% year-over-year, primarily due to service
mix. And finally, excluding the impact of fuel, FedEx rate LTL yield per hundredweight declined about 1%
year-over-year. The decrease was driven by changes in shipment attributes and heavier quarter-end revenue deferrals
due to the timing of Thanksgiving in the month of November.

Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter earnings increased to $1.57 per share, and operating
income increased 15% to $827 million. Yield improvement and cost management at Express were the primary drivers
of the profitability improvement. Results also benefited from the favorable comparison to last year's Sandy-impacted
results, lower pension expense and a modest benefit from the voluntary employee severance program.
During the second quarter, the company repurchased 7.2 million shares of FedEx common stock for a total of 10
million shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date. The second quarter share repurchases had no effect on the quarter's
earnings per share, but will have an estimated $0.04 per share impact for the full year.
Express had a wonderful quarter. Operating income increased to $326 million and margin increased to 4.8%, despite
slightly lower revenue. The profitability improvement was driven by stronger base U.S. and international package
yields, lower pension expense and lower net expenses from ongoing cost reduction activities.
International Priority revenue per package increased 3% while average daily volume declined 5%. Important to note
that within the IP category, average daily volume for the lower yielding distribution services declined, while average IP
average daily volume, excluding these distribution services, increased 1%. International economy average daily volume
grew 10%.
Fuel cost decreased 8%; due to 6% lower jet fuel prices and fewer flight hours. 3% fewer gallons were used
year-over-year, as we optimized our network and flew more fuel-efficient aircraft. Fuel price did not impact income for
the quarter, based on a static analysis of the net impact of year-over-year changes in fuel prices compared to changes in
fuel surcharges. Express is implementing a 3.9% average list price increase effective in January.
Turning to our Ground segment, revenues increased 10% to $2.9 billion and operating income increased $424 million,
due to volume and yield growth at Ground and volume growth at SmartPost. Average daily volume at Ground
increased 8% from continued growth in our commercial business and Home Delivery Service.
The increase in operating income was partially offset by higher network expansion cost, as we continue to invest
heavily in our growing high-margin Ground and SmartPost businesses. Operating margin declined primarily due to this
year's later start of the holidays shipping season, as Fred mentioned, as Cyber Week occurred in December this year
versus November last year. The seasonal increases in volume, revenue and operating income related to Cyber Week
will be realized in this year's third quarter versus the second quarter last year. Ground and Home Delivery will be
implementing a 4.9% average list price increase effective in January. SmartPost rates will also increase.

At Freight, revenues increased 4% from higher weight per LTL shipment and higher average daily LTL shipments.
Operating income increased slightly as higher revenue from increased demand was partially offset by higher purchased
transportation. Weight per shipment increased 2% due to freight's priority service offerings. Average daily LTL
shipments increased 4%, as economy and priority services both grew.
Turning to the outlook, we expect revenue and earnings growth to continue into the third quarter and the remainder of
2011 FY 2014 from ongoing improvements in the results of all of our transportation segments. Based on these
improvements, plus our to-date share repurchase results, we're raising our earnings per share guidance for the full year
to 8% to 14% from the FY 2013 adjusted results. This compares to our previous growth range of 7% to 13%.
This outlook reflects share repurchases made to-date, but does not include any benefit from additional share
repurchases. We plan to continue purchasing shares under the program, but have no specific timeframe for completion.
We have 32.2 million shares under our current authorizations remaining.
We're continuing to execute on a profit improvement programs we announced in October of 2012. The majority of the
benefits from our profit improvement programs will occur in FY 2015 and to a greater extent FY 2016.
Given our economic outlook, that Mike discussed, coupled with continued execution of our profit improvement
programs at Express, and earnings growth at Ground and Freight. I see increasing earnings, returns and cash flows over
the next several years.
I too would like to thank all of our team members for their hard work and dedication during a very busy peak season.
They are truly an amazing team. And lastly, remember that Monday is the last day to ship your presents overnight and
have them delivered before Christmas. And, Dave, can use the business.
Now we will open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Art Hatfield. Your line is open.
<Q - Art W. Hatfield>: Good morning, everyone. Just on the IP category, if you could discuss the reduction in
volumes through distribution services. Is that something that you guys are focused on that you want to reduce exposure
to? And if so, how could we think about that going forward from kind of a modeling or thinking about volume in that
segment on the go-forward? Thank you.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Art, this is Mike Glenn. We made a specific decision and elected not to participate in some
product releases that would have traveled in our distribution services capability. That decision was driven by our
revenue management yield improvement programs, and that was the primary issue there that affected those volumes in
the quarter.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah. Hey, Art. This is Dave Bronczek. Alan mentioned it, and it's a good point, the
majority of our IP, of course, is not the distribution services product; and that actually grew 1% all around the world,
led by the U.S. and Europe. And on top of that, our International Priority yields grew 4%. So we're very pleased with
that category.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yeah, good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit more on the Ground margin
commentary both in terms of the second half, and I don't if you want to offer any kind of medium-term comment just

on how we think about that. But I kind of thought that in Ground margin sometimes when you went through the peak
and you had the maximum volume going through that actually made you stretch the network and that was sometimes a
little bit of a margin headwind.
But I guess you're characterizing the Cyber Week timing as being a factor that hurt your margin in the second quarter
and maybe helps you going forward. So just wondering if you could give a little further perspective on Ground margin
near-term. And then if we think about it, medium-term as being kind of stable in the high teens or however you want to
comment on that? Thank you.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Tom, thanks for the question. This is Henry Maier. So let me give you a little bit of color here
as to what's going on. First, I think it's important to realize that not only is e-commerce increasing our volumes during
peak, it's making holiday volumes spikes peakier. And you need to understand that over a four to six week period of
time each year, our business typically more than doubles.
And preparing for this phenomenon, and ensuring we're able to handle it with the level of reliability and services
customers expect, is a year-long activity that starts in January of every year. And yes, it means every year that we
invest increased operating expense in the second quarter. This year, we had to do some unprecedented things to
prepare, which is just another indication of how we're enabling this new e-commerce economy. For example, our
network expansion costs increased to ensure we have capacity for the forecasted volume.
This is not only a peak phenomenon, but it's just building the base capacity we need to handle the growth we see
coming year-round. Our purchase transportation cost increased to ensure we have the resources to pick up and deliver
all the packages. This happens every year and it includes rental equipment and purchase line haul transportation.
This year, we incurred some increased vehicle maintenance costs in Q2 that we've historically spread out throughout
the year. We decided this year, in preparation for the peak season, given the fact that it's so compressed as opposed to
years past, it made sense to incur these maintenance costs now. And again, the focus on that was ensuring outstanding
service for our customers during this holiday season.
Now we operate our network seven days a week during peak, allowing our fixed assets to truly sweat and avoiding the
cost of carrying capacity the rest of the year when we don't need it. These decisions afford a significant flexibility to
manage our network in the busiest time of the year, while providing unparalleled service to our customers.
Now all these things that I've mentioned are not atypical to what we do every year. The only thing that is different this
year is the timing of Cyber Monday, which begins a week that typically reflects some of the busiest volumes we see
throughout the year; and the fact that this year peak is compressed into three weeks rather than four. And we call that
the compression of the calendar, which by the way will be the same next year. And then in 2015 we go back to
something more normal, which is a four-week period of time. So I hope that answers your question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens.
<Q - Jack Atkins>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. I think it is pretty clear from your results that you guys
are making some significant progress here on your profit improvement plan. But I guess just to kind of step back and
kind of see where we are over the course of the last year, of that $1.7 billion that you expect to generate in incremental
profit, where are we to-date as far as the run rate that you've as far as cost taken out of the business or incremental
profit that's now in the business that wasn't there this time last year?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Hey, Jack. This is Alan. Let me just say that we're on track to be where we need to be by the end
of FY 2016. I think you could see, in the Express results, that we're making some significant progress. We're also
managing the business as we go. As I mentioned in the last call, the five buckets that we talked about back in October
of 2012 are likely going to change, but we're still committed to the number. We're managing very aggressively the trade
down in international. We were glad to see our pure IP grow and our yields go up this quarter. I think it was a very

good sign. So we're not going to give you benchmark measurements on where we are until we get further into the
program. We're only two quarters in, but we are on track to be there by the end of 2016.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Scott A. Schneeberger>: Thanks. Good morning. I know it's early in both, but on One Rate and Delivery
Manager, would love to get any commentary on how those are progressing? Any quantification would be great.
Thanks.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike Glenn. We're very pleased with the response to Delivery Manager. Of course,
it's a key enabler to e-commerce this time of year by allowing consignees to really take control of the shipment to
manage the signature requirements, to redirect that to a hold location or schedule a future delivery. So it's a big bonus
to have that active and up and running during the peak season and it's critical to our e-commerce strategy.
I will just say that our registrations are way ahead of expectation and we're pleased with the customer response to the
program. One Rate is still relatively new. Again, we're pleased with the response to that. Customers love the
convenience and simplicity of the service, and we expect a future positive response as well. So we're very excited about
both of those opportunities and both of them play a part in e-commerce, which is especially important this time of year.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. SmartPost only was up in the upper-single digits for, I guess its
second non-double digit growth in the past 19 quarters. Is there a change here and did this impact the margins at
Ground? Can you talk a little bit about that as well?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Thanks, Ken. This is Henry Maier. Volume at SmartPost was affected by the calendar and the
later start to the holiday shipping season. The yield was impacted by lower fuel in the quarter. Everything else was in
line with what we historically see. Once again, it was all about the calendar.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey. Good morning, guys. I had one follow-up on Tom's question and then I had a
question for you on International Economy. Just if you guys could quantify any numbers around that Cyber Week shift
in Ground it would be helpful. And then similar to the question Ken just asked on SmartPost, I was curious on
International Economy. Since this is a newer segment and it obviously ties in with the whole program you guys have on
using third-party line haul. We had I think a 15% growth rate last quarter, we had 10% growth rate in volume this
quarter. How should we be thinking about growth in that product going forward and your capabilities in terms of
offloading to that third-party line haul network?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Justin, this is Henry Maier. More than a quarter of the volume that we see in peak comes in
Cyber Week. And if you think about it, that volume and revenue and profit was all shifted to the third quarter.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah, this is Dave Bronczek. On the IE question, we've had double-digit growth in IE for
many, many quarters now. But don't forget the IP product, the pure IP product, is still the dominant product that we
have. It's over 70% of all of our international packages around the world. So IE, yes, it's going into other networks. It's
in a network that makes us more money, but the IP is really the key going forward.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Alan, can you provide some perspective of the 32 million
share repurchase authorization was incremental relative to last quarter? Can you just give us some perspective in terms
of how you're thinking about prior comments regarding the dividend and trying to take the dividend yield up to a
1%-ish type yield versus thinking about buy backs on a shorter and intermediate term basis? Can you provide some
perspective on that capital allocation strategy?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Well, I thought we were very aggressive in the second quarter, accumulating 7.2 million shares in
that quarter alone. We don't have a specific timeframe for completion, but we will continue to be buying shares. And as
for our dividend policy, of course that's a board decision. Our board generally takes that decision up in the June
meeting, which has been what we've done for several years. And my expectation is that's when we will address it again.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about capacity in the international
lanes, sort of where you stand and any – is there further progress or need to move towards third-party capacity,
particularly on the trans-Pacific route? So sort of where you need to be I guess relative to what the volume flows are
right now is there any more to do in the short-term?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah. We're very pleased with where our capacity is right now. The customers are as well.
And we've mentioned, in several quarters now, in the past, that we've made some trans-Pacific adjustments. And going
forward, we'll see how things go, but right now we're very pleased with where our network is.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Thanks. Good morning, guys, how's it going? So my question is on the Express side and kind
of following-up on Justin's question a little bit. How much of the economy business or how much of the overall
business has been moved at this point out of FedEx aircraft onto third-party aircraft? And where do you think that can
go? And then just along those lines, when we look at CapEx for the year, I know you kept the guidance unchanged, but
you're kind of below the run rate of $4 billion. Do you think that there is any flexibility to cut that $4 billion down a
little bit?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: This is Dave Bronczek. I'll answer the first part of the question, then I'll turn it over to Alan.
Our customers sit down with us all the time, and they kind of tell us what kind of services they're looking for from
Express; and we've balanced our network right now to achieve those goals for our customers and for ourselves. And so,
yes, we have opportunities to move more IP. We have more opportunities for more IE as well. As you know, the global
marketplace for underbellies around the world keeps increasing. So we see that there is really no end in sight for what
our customers want from us, and we of course have a great product offering in our FTN ocean business, and that keeps
growing. We do a tremendous amount of business in FTN now as well. So...
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Scott, this is Alan. On your first question, that Dave just addressed, let me just say that we're
continuing very hard to continue to work on our international networks. And as you know, we've taken down two
trans-Pac flights since the announcement of our profit improvement program, going from 10 to eight. Recall that we
retire a lot of airplanes early, and accel depreciation on a lot of others.

And we are in a process, and we are managing our customers' needs with our continuing to get to the right place on our
networks, and that's going to continue all the way through 2014 and all the way through most of 2015 before we're
going to probably be exactly where we need to be. But having said that, it's an integral part of our profit improvement
program.
Now, as to CapEx, I'm very happy with where we are in our CapEx. We've got a very strong balance sheet. It's very
important that we do the two things that we're mostly doing with our capital. One is the fleet modernization has to
continue at Express. It's an integral part of our profit improvement program. We're seeing significant benefits and you
saw those in the second quarter, particularly in fuel burn and maintenance. That's going to continue as we continue to
add the 767s and 757s.
And the other big piece of this is we've got to continue to expand the Ground network, and we are in the process of
building three to five major hubs over the next several years. These are going to have very high ROIC. We're going to
continue to grow round at a nice growth rate and maintain those high teens margins, and that's an important part for
what we're doing as well. So we are as steely eyed as ever on CapEx, but we are intentionally spending a little bit
higher than our 6% to 8% range right now in order to get the benefits to the bottom line.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask a question on LTL. If you exclude the impact of
weight per shipment and the shorter length of haul, what would the core pricing run rate look like just within the
context of some of your peers' reporting numbers in the roughly 3% range?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Well, clearly customer mix impacts that. What you typically see is smaller customers tend to
have lighter weight shipments and shorter length of haul. And we've been very successful diversifying our customer
base for LTL. So it certainly had an impact, and it certainly has a drag on yield per hundredweight when you do see the
change in mix of traffic.
Now we also had some stronger growth in other customer segments, stronger than anticipated, which provides an
opportunity for some yield management activities which we have initiated and will be conducting going forward. So we
think we've got a good handle on yield per hundredweight and where the levers are, and we will be managing that
along with the FedEx Freight operating company going forward, to continue to improve our margins.
<A - William J. Logue>: Hey, Al. This is Bill. Let me jump on that. Again, as Mike said, we're really pleased with our
volume across all the segments, and particularly the priority and economy mix. We saw very good growth in both. So
we're excited about that. And also, the year-over-year fuel surcharge came down, so that kind of was a big impact as
well on the yield. So look at that. And then, again, as Mike said, we're very focused on our yield management process.
So we're in a good position.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from William Greene with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - William J. Greene>: Hi, good morning. Fred or Mike, can I ask you to comment a little bit on the evolution of
the e-commerce space? There's lots of time some discussions about what Amazon is doing and could they ever sort of
become a transportation company themselves with some of the logistics efforts they're trying? You don't have to speak
to Amazon, but how do you see that space evolving? Do players in that world become a competitor to you? How do
you make sure you're kind of guarding against that kind of outcome? Thank you.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith. I'm going to make a couple of comments and then I'm going to
ask Mike to amplify on this and maybe some of my other partners can jump in here too, Henry or whomever, because

this is a big subject and quite frankly I don't think I've seen more mythology in the press about anything than I have
about the e-commerce space over the last year or so.
The first thing I will say to you is, there are two enormous transportation networks that are built around moving light
packages and freight and they are FedEx and UPS. And the size and scale of these operations are so big that it's almost
amusing some of the comments about delivering items by drones and we have a drone expert on the staff, its Rob
Carter, our CIO. He actually owns a drone and he reported that it can operate about eight minutes and carry four
Budweiser beers at his farm.
Now that's not to belittle UAS technology, because we've got a lot of studies underway in that area ourselves, but at the
end of the day, the intercity transportation networks of FedEx and UPS and to a lesser degree the Postal Service, which
is designed around delivering very lightweight items, all you have to do is look in your neighborhood with the small
jeeps the drive down the road and the right-hand drive and so forth. That network is designed to move very lightweight
things and publications and correspondence or letters.
Now, the whole issue about e-commerce at the end of the day is it's very expensive to deliver things to residences. Not
every residence gets a package every day, and it's quite unlikely that every residence will start getting an item every
day. So in certain situations, an amazon.com or some very large e-tailer, they can unquestionably do local deliveries
should they choose to do so, and I think in the case of some of them they use various local delivery options today.
But for the vast majority of products moved, it's almost certain that they will, if they're going to be delivered, be moved
by one of those three large networks and then some of the smaller regional players for as far as the eye can see. Mike,
do you want to amplify on that?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Yeah. I would say the important point to understand here is e-commerce has a very long
runway both domestically and internationally and FedEx is well poised to benefit from both of those. Clearly,
e-commerce is growing at a multiple of overall retail sales. But having said that, based upon the Forrester Research, it
will be 2017 before online sales represent a total of 10% of all revenues. So we're still at the tip of the iceberg here in
terms of e-commerce and its potential.
I think another issue that is a big driver is mobile devices now account for about 11% of online transactions. Free
shipping is part of about 50% of the transactions. SmartPost is particularly poised to take advantage of that. So there are
a tremendous amount of emerging trends in e-commerce before you even get to looking at how big box retailers are
starting to respond picking at the store level to facilitate efficient next day delivery on a cost-effective basis, which
FedEx is well-positioned to take advantage of.
So I would say even though there's a tremendous amount of talk about e-commerce, we're still in very much the early
stage development of this channel. And we sit right in the sweet spot of it. We talked about Delivery Manager earlier in
the call about enabling our consignees to really take control of the transaction. Our retail network enables people to get
their packages when they want to and we've got other technology out there that we're working on to further facilitate
this.
So FedEx is extremely well-positioned with our broad portfolio, but I think the important point here is that we are again
very early in the overall stage of this channel, and again, I'll just refer you back to that Forrester Research, which states
that it'll be 2017 before we reach the 10% point of all retail sales been generated online. So a lot of runway here and
we're well-positioned to take advantage of it.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah. I'll just jump in. From Express' point of view, obviously, the globalization of
e-commerce and our global powerhouse network around the world with over 200 countries and all these customers and
they're all global reaching now. And this is a synchronization around the world that takes – it's an art form and we've
been doing it successfully for decades now.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yeah. Good morning, everyone. I want to come back to the discussion around
capital priorities, especially in light of the share repurchase announcement back in October. Alan or Fred, is that really
a change in strategic direction for the company?
And I know you have a lot of aircraft renewals to go over the next couple of years, but when you look out beyond fiscal
2016 and you think about CapEx relative to revenue, should we be thinking longer-term that's going to trend closer to
that 6% range rather than the 8% you're running today?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Hard to say. We'll have to see what the opportunities look like there in terms of Ground's growth
rate and how far along we've come on the Express profit improvement program. But certainly, we probably will be high
for the next couple of years and if we have the ability to move a couple of things around, we could – one or two planes
comes in May instead of June, it can change these numbers.
But I think at least through fiscal 2016 we're going to be probably about where we are and then we'll see how well
we've done with our profit improvement program and how well we've improved our returns, which I think we will be
successful at. So as long as we can see that modernizing the fleet and Ground growth continue to improve our returns,
we're going to keep investing in them.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Wolfe with Wolfe Research. Mr. Wolfe, please check your mute
function. There's no response. We'll move to our next question. Comes from Helane Becker with Cowen.
<Q - Helane R. Becker>: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for the time. Alan, I think this might be
for you. You've mentioned that you're continuing to expand the Ground operations and you were building, I think, you
mentioned three to five hubs over the next couple of years. I'm just wondering, are you comfortable that you're able to
expand these operations fast enough and that you're ahead of the changes that are taking place in delivery requirements
or are you still kind of chasing change? Thank you.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Helane, I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Henry. One of the great things about our company is
our operations and engineering group and OR groups are brilliant in determining where the forecasted future traffic
flows are going to be, where hubs need to be and how much capacity we need to have. And even though we've
significantly stepped up our investment and we'll continue to do that in Ground to keep up with its growth, it's going to
remain tight. And it's going to remain tight by design. We'll be able to handle those 50% increases that Henry talked
about for the three to four-week periods of peak, but the rest of the year it should be running fairly close to full. And I'll
let Henry give you some more information about that.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah. Helane, this is Henry Maier. We manage between 150 and 200 real estate projects a year
typically. We take a five-year to seven-year view of the marketplace when we plan these facilities. We are very careful
not to add capacity we don't need 11 months out of the year and in – at peak, in month of December, we plan to add
operating expense as best we can to handle the volume surges so we can dismantle it when the volume leaves. And
that's essentially the way we've run the company for the past 20 some years and it's worked out very well for us.
Now sometimes, we might get a little bit ahead, sometimes we might get a little bit behind, but as Alan said, we are a
highly engineered and highly automated operation and we have incredible flexibility to be able to flex up or down in
the short term to handle customers' volume as it comes. So I think you should be confident going forward that we have
a good plan to handle anything that happens in this business.

<Q - David G. Ross>: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Bill, can you talk about the reacceleration in FedEx Freight
shipment volumes? Was that driven by bundling, increased sales force size? What was going on there to kind of show
the best growth rate you guys had there in a couple years?
<A - William J. Logue>: Yeah. David, obviously, we're very pleased with the volume growth and, as I said earlier, it's
across all segments, the small, medium and large customers in focusing on Priority Economy. Volume coming out of
both segments is really showing the value prop is kicking in. We went through a couple of quarters there that we had
some volume challenge the last two quarters so the team really responded well, went out there and brought in some
excellent volume for us, and as we go forward, as I've always said, our goal is double-digit margins and to get there we
need really good balance on both volume and yield and that's our focus going forward.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Dave, it's Mike Glenn. We have terrific collaboration between the freight operating company
and our sales team. And let me remind you that the entire FedEx sales team in the U.S. sells our complete portfolio of
services and that is a strategic advantage for us. It allows us to target and provide coverage for customers that are not
typically seen by an individual when dealing with LTL transactions.
And again, combined with the power of the bundle and the terrific collaboration that we have with the operating
company has really been a plus. We've also had enhancement to our automation systems, which has made it much
easier for our customers to do business with us and the outstanding service levels that the Freight team is providing
really gives us an industry-leading value proposition.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Thanks. I have a couple questions with regard to Express. First off, can you give us a guide as to the
air freight demand outlook by region based on your forward bookings and on your discussions with your customers?
And I'd also just like to follow up with regard to one of the earlier questions with regard to your third-party capacity
utilization. Can you give us a sense of what percentage of your IE is going on your planes versus third-party capacity
just in terms of the relative context, let's say, at the beginning of year versus where you think it might be at the end of,
say, next year? Thanks.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah. This is Dave Bronczek. I can tell you that and I mentioned this before, the U.S.
International as was reported this quarter was up. Europe was up. Asia was off a little because of the distribution
services primarily and the release of some of the product launches. Other than that, though, they were up in Asia and
really across the world. So where our volumes and our yields and our network capacity sits, we are very pleased with
where we were and we are this quarter as well.
In terms of third-party distribution, we're using FTN, which is a sister company inside of Express very much now and
we're using it for some of the launches quite frankly as well. And we just have a lot of opportunity around the world to
continue to move lower yielding traffic into the right networks to make us more money.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Van Sciver with Hedgeye.
<Q - Jay Van Sciver>: Good morning. Looking at the intercompany charges line for the different segments, why is
Express seeing its cost decline relative to sales while Ground and Freight have seen probably less progress there or
slight increases? And should we expect that shared overhead to be down in the second half of fiscal 2014 and into
2015?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Well, obviously, that's one of the big places that we're working and it's part of the profit
improvement programs to get our overhead down not just in services, but in every operating company and I think we're

doing a very good job of that. Our inter-segment charges are very complicated. Some are directly based on revenue,
which would explain little bit of why Ground is getting a little bit more and Express is getting a little bit less. Others are
directly charged and others are just using good old cost accounting to arrive at what the appropriate ones are. I can tell
you that one of the good things about our company is the great debates we have in this subject and we have the right
amount of tension in there and I think it makes us focused to keep them all as low as possible in total.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much. Hey, guys. Well, congratulations on the quarter. Alan, I want to focus
a little bit on the capital for the ground fleet and the air fleet. You mentioned you're taking capacity down and I know
we've got fewer trans-Pacs, we're bringing on new aircraft.
Two questions. One, what are we doing with the MD-11s that we might not be using in some of those markets? It
doesn't look like you're planning on taking those planes out of the system just based on what you have in the release?
And number two, could you talk a little bit about your thoughts on alternative fuels, particularly as it pertains to the
domestic delivery fleet?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Let me direct the fleet MD-11 question to Dave and then we'll talk about who's going to answer
the alternative fuels, but there's a lot of work going on in that regard. So Dave?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah. Thanks, Jeff. We're obviously putting our 777s high reliability, low fuel, better
operating cost airplanes, the 777s, in our international network, bringing back the MD-11s into our U.S. network.
They're replacing the older MD-10s, some of our older planes. Some of those MD-11s are on lease as well. So we're
going to be continuing to cycle this through our global network, but where the global service improvements and cost
improvements are coming from is the 777s are going there, the MD-11s are coming back here.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Jeff, over time we're going to be an all twin operator. So that's longer-term and I'm not going to
give you specific time frames on that, but that's where we're headed. And I'm going to ask my boss to talk about
alternative fuels.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Well, regarding alternative fuels, we have efforts underway in all of the operating
companies. In FedEx Freight, they're the lead on natural gas powered vehicles. We're operating two test LNG
over-the-road rigs and two compressed natural gas over-the-road tractors. They're performing very well as I understand
it. We have lots of focus on fuel improvement at FedEx Freight with aerodynamics in FedEx Express, because they
tend to use the lighter smaller pickup delivery vehicles. They are the lead company on electrification. We have about I
think almost 500 vehicles maybe more of all electrics and hybrids, and Ground has pioneered a lot of things, hydraulic
vehicles and so forth.
On the specific question of biofuels, our aviation department has a lot of work underway in advanced projects of all
types, including autonomous aircraft, as I mentioned, or augmented aircraft, which is what I think is going to happen is
just improved assistance for the flight crews. I think it's going to be a long time for you're going to see a lot of
autonomous airplanes operating.
And there's no question that you can produce biofuels, FedEx Freight is buying biodiesel and FedEx Express is
involved in a number of things with BioJet. The problem with all of them is that while they are technically drop-in fuels
and interchangeable with petroleum, they simply have not been produced at scale at a cost competitive price, but we're
pretty confident that that will happen over time using a number of feedstocks.
The one contract that FedEx Freight has for instances is for biodiesel made of wood chips, I believe, produced at a
refinery in Columbus, Mississippi. So we've got a lot of work there, but at present there's no large scale biofuels that
are available to us. But I suspect that will probably change as you get into the 2020s. A lot of work going on and a lot
of progress.

<A - Henry J. Maier>: Hey, Jeff. This is Henry Maier. With respect to Ground CapEx, 90% of our capital expense in
2014 is to expand capacity. And included in that are expenditures for the new hubs Alan mentioned, building
expansions and relocations, material handling and rolling stock.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein Research.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask you, maybe Dave or Fred, on the
international network strategy some of the other investments that you guys have lined up and help capacity in Osaka
and Shanghai and get a sense for how those investments play into the future development of the international network,
are you guys changing that thought process around those investments given the changes in market conditions? If you
could comment on that I'd appreciate it. Thanks.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Well, this is Fred Smith. Let me make a couple of comments here, because I want to
make sure there's no confusion on the part of the investors then I'll last Dave to specifically talk about Osaka and
Shanghai.
Regarding the network FedEx Express, the current system of eight trans-Pacific flights and seven trans-Atlantic flights
and of course we have some Asia to Europe operations as well, in all likelihood that's not going to materially change
for some period of time. That network is designed to offer competitively superior cut off times and transit times and it
is performing very, very well. And the facilities, which Dave will talk about, are an integral part to speed up those
processes and make them more automated and more efficient and handle the volumes that sometimes have been
inefficiently handled just because facilities are very difficult to put together in certain parts of the world. And the two
you mentioned are going to be huge improvements.
So what you can anticipate based on what the customers are telling us is probably relatively slow growth in the IP
sector with customers opting to take a day or two longer in transit in the International Economy sector. And both
Priority and Economy have three flavors: There's a door-to-door package IP and IE, the door-to-door freight IPF and
IEF and then we offer a distribution service in both categories, which is a large shipment the clears a border on a single
clearance document and then it's exploded and goes to many different destinations. And that can be either packages or
freight.
And sometimes that lexicon, those terminologies get misunderstood. So that's why it's important and Dave and Alan
have both mentioned this to you that IP, which is the real key product line, is actually growing and the yields are going
up. The IPD, it's hard to make money with that product. So I think what you're going to see is not very much change in
the near term in the backbone network and a lot of growth in the Economy traffic, which lends itself to being put in
underbelly, which is going to grow next year according to the last report I saw about 5 – the capacity is going to grow
about 5%.
The 787, the 777-9, the A350s, there's going to be a tremendous amount of that underbelly capacity out there, which is
very attractive in terms of cost per pound and we are very effectively utilizing that and Dave's plans are to do even
more of that. So I didn't want anybody to be confused about those terms and about the backbone Priority network,
which is working very well. It's going to work even better here with a couple of things that Dave's going to tell you
about.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks, Fred. That's exactly right. Osaka opens in April. We're really excited about it. It
lets us flex up and flex down off of our main backbone network without adding to that network with change of gauges,
flights from Asia feeding Asia into the rest of the world over Osaka. It's going to be terrific. So as the volumes grow,
we just add change of gauge in Asia or if they have – if they decline, we can flex down as well. So it's a terrific flex up
and down.
Shanghai is, I was just out there recently, a new facility. It's tremendously automated, very efficient, right in the heart
of a lot of our business opportunities in China. So we're very excited about both of those hubs that are opening here

Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks. I'm asking about longer term use of railroad, and I believe you've recently
mentioned using rail for about 17% of Freight line haul. Do you envision this increasing through the next couple of
years? And maybe even beyond the Freight segment, are you connecting anything through Trade Networks using rail?
And maybe even stretching at a bit more does rail make sense for SmartPost line haul at some point?
<A - William J. Logue>: Keith, this is Bill Logue. Yeah. On the Freight side, we've – over the past three years, we've,
as you've noticed, we've grown our rail usage substantially particularly on our Economy offering. So it's worked out
very well for us. We continue to look at lanes and adjustments we made from this past July. And again, going forward,
we'll continue to look at our network. You saw some of our PT growth purchase trends growth this year and again that
was due to our rail increase has come up in July. And again, we'll tweak and adjust our network as we see appropriate
for the most efficient way to run our business.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Hey, Keith. This is Henry Maier. We use a little bit of rail throughout the year. In the month of
December, our rail usage jumps up. In fact, I think this month it's about 7% of the miles that we run and that would
include Ground and SmartPost. We use it where it makes sense. We won't use it where it degrades our service. So that's
how we think about this in our network.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take a final question from Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Good morning. Thank you. If I look at FedEx Express on the expense side excluding fuel,
you did a nice job year-over-year, but you're still up a fair amount versus fiscal 2Q 2012. And part of that looks like it's
in SG&A despite the fact that you've made some changes there using more purchase transportation as the mix changes.
How much of that was pension year-over-year? And how much of that is pension versus, say, fiscal 2012?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: This is Dave. On the purchase transportation, remember, a lot of the FTN expenses are in
the purchase transportation and the revenues are up in there too and then we made that change last year. In terms of our
overall expenses, as you can see, they're actually performing very well. Pension should have been a positive for us in
the quarter.
Operator
Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to
