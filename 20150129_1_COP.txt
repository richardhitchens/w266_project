MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2014 ConocoPhillips Earnings Conference Call. My name is Christine and I will be
your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question
and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, Vice President Investor Relations and Communications. You may
begin.
Ellen R. DeSanctis
Thanks, Christine, and greetings to everybody. Joining me in the room today are Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO;
Jeff Sheets, our EVP of finance and Chief Financial Officer, and Matt Fox, our EVP of E&P. Really three quick very
administrative points before we launch into our remarks here. We will make some forward-looking statements this
morning. The risks and uncertainties in our future performance are covered on page two of today's deck and in our
periodic filings with the SEC. This information can also be found on our website.
Next if you haven't done so, save the date for our 2015 Analyst Meeting on April 8 in New York City. We will be
providing some additional logistical details on that event soon. And then finally, during Q&A this morning we're going
to limit questions to one with a follow-up so we can accommodate the call queue. We appreciate your support there.
So now let me turn the call over to Ryan.

Ryan M. Lance
Thank you, Ellen, and thanks to all our call participants this morning. So I'll start by making a few quick comments
about 2014, then I'll jump into our view of 2015 and the actions we're taking to manage through this current period of
very low prices.
Of course were also spending a lot of time thinking about the future beyond 2015. It's a bit early to talk about that today
but as Ellen mentioned, we'll speak to that in our April Analyst Meeting where we'll be ready to address our
longer-term view of the sector and how we're positioned to succeed.
So if you turn to slide four, this is our company-level said/did chart that we show during every quarterly call. Certainly
2014 seems like old news but I think it's important to spend a minute recapping our results for the year.
Operationally we hit our volume targets and achieved 4% year-on-year growth and I think that's a pretty big
accomplishment for a company our size. The growth came from the startup of five major projects, ongoing ramp up in
the Eagle Ford and the Bakken and a successful turnaround season across our operations. We also discovered two new
oil plays in offshore Senegal.
Financially we generated $6.6 billion of adjusted earnings, or $5.30 per share for the year. This includes fourth quarter
adjusted earnings of $742 million or $0.60 a share, obviously reflecting weak fourth quarter prices. We ended the year
with $5.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet and also exceeded our price normalized cash margin growth target with
more than an 8% improvement.
On the strategic front we achieved a strong organic reserve replacement ratio of 124%. And by the way, the three-year
average organic reserve replacement ratio is 153%.
We completed the final piece of our announced asset disposition program with the closing of the Nigeria sale and we
increased our dividend by 5.8%.
That's a quick summary. The key takeaway here is that we did what we said we'd do, not just in 2014, but also over the
past three years since the launch as an independent E&P company. We executed our stated plan almost to the letter and
in the last quarter, oil and gas prices began their accelerated decline. So let me discuss what that price decline means
for our company in 2015, if you'll turn to slide five.
There's a lot of debate right now about the duration of the current low oil prices. But we're assuming that they'll stay
low for 2015, and we're taking decisive actions accordingly.
Our actions are driven by our priorities which are unchanged since the time of the spin. The dividend remains our top
priority for capital allocation. The next highest priority remains getting to cash flow neutrality in 2017. With these
priorities in mind, we're going to use our capital and our balance sheet flexibility to manage through this downturn.
So first, CapEx. This morning we announced a further reduction in 2015 capital to $11.5 billion. That's $2 billion lower
than the $13.5 billion that we announced in early December. This means we cut capital by a third relative to 2014
spending. In making these cuts, we're exercising flexibility we've built over the past few years, coring up the portfolio,
adding scalable, unconventional inventory with a low cost of supply and executing the vast majority of our major
project spending. And that's why we can adjust our capital program while preserving future investment opportunities.
And in 2016 you'll see more capital flexibility as additional major project spending continues to roll off. At our revised
capital level, we still expect to deliver 2% to 3% growth in 2015 versus 2014.
Now in addition to conserving capital through scope reductions, we're aggressively identifying and capturing cost
savings through our supply chain efforts. At this time, our revised $11.5 billion budget anticipates capturing about $500
million of deflation in 2015. Most of this will come from our Lower 48 unconventional business. Now, my
management and myself, we review two dozen categories of costs globally every month and we're actively pursuing
additional cost reductions for this year and beyond. As one of the largest purchasers of industry goods and services

globally, we expect to benefit significantly in future years before any sustained deflationary cycle.
We're also looking beyond supply chain to reduce costs through self-help efforts. As an example, in Europe we recently
announced operating costs and G&A reductions and we'll see additional cost reductions that are being implemented
across the rest of the company.
In addition to managing OpEx and CapEx, one of the flexibility levers we're prepared to use in 2015 is our balance
sheet. We're coming into this cycle in a strong position and that will serve us well. We have cash on hand and a
significant capacity that we can use and Jeff will provide more detail on those plans.
So we're taking the 2015 challenge head-on. We're conserving CapEx, we're aggressively pursuing supply chain and
self-help cost reductions, we'll utilize our financial capacity as needed. We've adjusted rapidly to avoid jeopardizing
our dividend or our ability to achieve cash flow neutrality by 2017. These decisive actions combined with our
flexibility should put us in a good stead to manage through this downturn.
So now let me turn the call over to Jeff and Matt, and then I'll come back for a few closing comments.
Jeff W. Sheets
Thanks, Ryan. As Ryan mentioned, our full-year 2014 adjusted earnings were $6.6 billion. Our full-year earnings slide
is in the appendix, but I'll quickly cover fourth quarter earnings.
Fourth quarter 2014 adjusted earnings were $742 million or $0.60 a share. Our operational performance was
overshadowed by a roughly 20% drop in realized prices compared to prior periods and a previously announced dry hole
in Angola.
A segment breakdown of earnings is shown on the lower right with more detail provided in the supplemental data on
our website.
There's one special item to note. In the fourth quarter, an agreement to terminate our long-term obligations at the
Freeport LNG Terminal took effect. The ins and outs for the income statement and cash flow are shown in the
Appendix, but as a result of the transaction, the company anticipates saving about $50 million annually over the next 18
years. So this was a good long-term economic decision.
On slide eight, I'll cover our 2014 production from continuing operations. We achieved two important milestones in
2014, namely hitting our growth targets for production and margin growth. Our production growth for the year
excluding Libya was 4% from 1,472 million to 1,532 million BOE per day. The impact from down time and
dispositions was small, and compared to last year, our net gross was over 60,000 BOE per day, primarily from liquids,
an area with favorable fiscals.
We also achieved our cash margin growth target and that's shown on slide nine.
For 2014, we achieved an 8% cash margin improvement when normalized on 2013 prices. Despite lower prices, we're
not going to lose our focus on cash margins and, in fact, it's as important as ever.
Next I'll review our 2014 cash flow waterfall on slide 10. We started the year with $6.5 billion in cash and short-term
investments and generated about $16 billion of cash from operating activities. We cashed at about $1.2 billion of net
proceeds from dispositions, mostly from Nigeria. Our 2014 capital expenditures were about $17 billion. After
accounting for dividends and debt, we ended the year with $5.1 billion in cash.
Next I'll address the balance sheet flexibility we're prepared to exercise in 2015 as needed, so if you'll turn to slide 11.
We've consistently spoken in the last several years about our plans to grow at a moderate rate while paying a strong
dividend to our shareholders. The growth in our cash flow was moving us to a position where cash from operations
would fund our capital and the dividend in 2017 with the shortfalls in cash flows funded largely by asset sale proceeds.
With much lower commodity prices, we, like the rest of industry, need to manage in an environment with reduced cash

flow. As Ryan mentioned, even with this dramatic downturn, we remain committed to our strong dividend and reaching
cash flow neutrality in 2017, and that's true across a wide range of commodity prices.
As Ryan also noted, the first action we've taken is to exercise flexibility in our capital program, which becomes more
flexible over the next couple of years. To achieve our priorities, we will also be using our strong balance sheet capacity,
both cash balances and increased borrowings, to provide funding this year and next. So let me tell you how we're
thinking about this.
We ended 2015 with $5.1 billion of cash on our balance sheet, and we need about $1 billion of that cash to operate the
company. We don't have any issues with trapped cash that prevent us from accessing our cash balances.
We have ready access to the credit markets, and our debt continues to trade at levels between those of A and AA rated
companies. The chart on the right shows indicative borrowing rates for any new issuances in today's markets.
For short-term funding, we have a $6 billion of revolving credit facility capacity that can serve as a backstop for the
issuance of very low cost commercial paper. We don't have any debt maturities in 2015. As we assess commodity price
environments, both in 2015 and for the next few years, we think it's unlikely that we'll need to increase our debt to a
level that would cause our credit ratings to slip out of the single A credit rating range, although it could move lower
within the A range if we stay at current commodity price environments for a prolonged period. Our current
debt-to-capital ratio is about 30%. We're willing to let that rise, if necessary, as we move the company to a balance of
cash flows, capital expenditures and dividends in 2017.
So to summarize, we intend to maintain our strong dividend and continue exercising our increasing capital flexibility to
move the company to cash flow neutrality in 2017. Our level of capital spending, rate of growth and the level of debt
that we maintain will be the variables that will be influenced by commodity prices.
Now I'll turn the call over to Matt for his operational comments
Matthew J. Fox
Thanks, Jeff. I want to begin my comments with a brief recap of 2014, beginning with a review of our reserves
performance. These are preliminary numbers, but we don't expect any material changes from the final reserves that are
published in our 10-K.
We started the year with 8.9 billion BOE of reserves. We produced 598 million and added 742 million organically.
These additions came primarily from our Lower 48, APME and Canada assets. This resulted in an organic reserves
replacement ratio of 124%. We also sold 159 million BOE, mostly from Nigeria, and ended the year then with 8.9
billion barrels of reserves. That represents a total reserve replacement ratio of 97%. Over the past three years, our total
reserve replacement has averaged 129%, and that's after selling assets which generated about $14 billion of proceeds.
So let me put this all in perspective. We launched as an E&P three years ago with 8.4 billion barrels of reserves on the
books. Over that time, we've produced more than 1.5 billion barrels and sold over 400 million barrels, and yet we'll exit
2014 with 8.9 billion barrels of high-quality reserves on the books. That's pretty impressive for a company of our size.
Now I want to recap the 2014 operational highlights that contributed to our reserve performance and our 4% production
growth. As Ryan and Jeff mentioned, we achieved our production growth target both for the fourth quarter and for the
year. Our base assets continue to perform well with strong safety performance and successfully completed several
major turnarounds across the portfolio. We achieved another strong year in the unconventionals with 35% annual
growth in the Eagle Ford and Bakken. We also conducted multiple pilot tests and progressed exploration and appraisal
activity across our whole unconventional portfolio. And as a result of this work, we're confident that we have an
extensive, profitable inventory in these plays for many years to come.
We achieved startups of five major projects across the business: Britannia Long-Term Compression in the UK, Foster
Creek Phase F in the oil sands and Gumusut, Kebabangan and SNP in Malaysia. And we made significant progress on
our largest major projects at APLNG and Surmont 2 in preparation for startup this year.

We saw progress in our deepwater program, in particular with two discoveries in a new working petroleum system,
offshore Senegal and we continue the appraisal on our three major discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico.
Yesterday it was announced that we signed an agreement with Chevron and BP to jointly explore and appraise a 24
block area in Keathley Canyon that includes the Tiber and Gila discoveries. This agreement allows our companies to
combine our technical strengths and financial resources to achieve efficiency through scale, reduced sub-surface risk
and improve the likelihood of commerciality. So this is a great deal for all three parties.
Next I'll review the capital reductions we just announced and the implications for 2015 activities. We'll start from the
$13.5 billion capital guidance we issued in December.
We're not reducing our base maintenance capital because we don't want to jeopardize the strength of our base
production or the integrity of our assets.
Our development program spending will be lower by about $1.4 billion. Most of this is coming out of Lower 48
unconventionals where we have a lot of flexibility and where there's a sound economic rationale for slowing the pace of
development. In 2015, we'll reduce rigs in the lower Eagle Ford and, sorry, in the Lower 48 by over 60% versus 2014.
We plan to run six rigs in the Eagle Ford, three in the Bakken and two each in the Permian conventional and
unconventional. At these levels we maintain our land position, meet our longer-term rig commitments and can continue
to progress key pilot tests. We retain the flexibility to increase activity in these plays if we choose to.
We're also reducing capital for our major projects by deferring final investment decisions in several conventional
assets. And just as a reminder, our initial budget of $13.5 billion already reflected a significant reduction in this
category compared to 2014 as projects were completed and as we near startup at APLNG and Surmont. We also
exercised $300 million of flexibility in our exploration and appraisal spend primarily in the emerging Lower 48
unconventionals.
As Ryan mentioned, our $11.5 billion capital guidance assumes about $500 million of cost deflation. This is what we
have a clear line of sight to capture in 2014 but it's early in the year and you can be assured that we have a significant
focus on the effort across the whole value chain. In 2016 and 2017 the flexibility of our capital portfolio continues to
improve as more major projects are completed and we believe this flexibility combined with a strong base portfolio
positions us well for a potentially volatile few years ahead.
Next I'll quickly cover our operational priorities for 2015. We expect to grow production by 2% to 3% from 2014 to
2015 and this includes an expected first quarter production rate of between 1.57 million and 1.61 million barrels per
day. Walking through the segments, in Alaska we're focused on progressing our development drilling programs and
major projects of CD-5 and drill site 2S. Both projects are expected to start up in the fourth quarter of this year. We
intend to sanction the first phase of the Northeast West Sak development, the 1H NEWS project and we'll continue to
progress a new rotary rig and new coiled tubing drilling rig to optimize our long-term development drilling inventory in
Alaska. But we have decided to defer the final investment decision on the GMT1 project.
In the onshore Lower 48, unconventional activity will slow across the portfolio relative to 2014. We'll continue to
evaluate pilot tests including the Upper Eagle Ford with our triple stack development concept. In the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico we'll continue to appraise existing discoveries. We have wells drilling at Gila and Tiber right now and
anticipate additional appraisal well drilling in Shenandoah later this year. In Canada we're reducing our conventional
and unconventional development drilling activity. Oil sands production from Foster Creek F will continue to ramp up.
Surmont 2 is on track for first steam in mid-2015 and we'll commence exploration drilling offshore Nova Scotia later
this year.
In Europe, Ekofisk South and Eldfisk II continue to ramp up and we'll continue progress on the Enochdhu and Alder
projects. In the Asia-Pacific and Middle East segment APLNG is on track for startup in the middle of the year. We're
ramping up Gumusut in Malaysia and we're awaiting third-party pipeline repairs to allow production to ramp up at
KBB, which we expect to start in the middle of the year. We'll also complete appraisal at the Barossa field, offshore
Australia.

In our Other International segment we'll continue to monitor circumstances in Libya, evaluate result of our recent
testing in Poland, begin appraisal work offshore Senegal and continue to execute our exploratory drilling programs in
Angola and Colombia.
So we've got another busy year ahead of us and in any price environment, we're committed to safely executing our
programs and delivering flexible growth while retaining high-value future options and inventory.
Now I'll turn the call back to Ryan for his closing remarks.
Ryan M. Lance
Thank you, Matt. So let me recap what you've heard today. I think we delivered again in 2014. But certainly that was
then; now it's all about 2015 and it's all about flexibility and resilience which we believe we have both.
Our priorities are clear: dividend and cash flow neutrality and we're taking immediate actions to defend them. We're
cutting CapEx, capturing cost improvements and exercising our balance sheet if needed. And we're also thinking about
the timeframe beyond 2015. We're asking ourselves, what's changed in our industry, if anything, for the longer term?
We're testing our portfolio under different scenarios and again, we'll see that we have a resilient portfolio with
flexibility to adapt if circumstances warrant.
Now some things might change. But here's what's not going to change. We're going to allocate capital prudently, we'll
continue to migrate our portfolio to a lower cost of supply, we'll maintain capital and financial flexibility and we'll pay
our shareholders first. That's our formula for creating long-term shareholder value. And I look forward to seeing you
and describing that in more detail in April in New York. So with that, now let me turn the call back over to the operator
and we'll take some Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
And our first question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Folks, I wonder if I could dig into
the cash flow neutrality question a little bit, because obviously the dividend is still a big commitment for you guys.
When you separated Phillips, I think Jim, at the time, had talked about a maintenance capital level of around $10 billion
to hold production flat. Well, I guess what I'm trying to understand is, to Matt's comment. Obviously that was $100 oil
so one assumes that costs are going to drop at some point. But also had a slightly different portfolio and you've had a
bunch of new projects come online that are longer life, or will come online, rather. So what is that number today, as it
stands today and maybe assuming some cost reductions over time? And I've got a follow-up, please.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So I think, Doug, a number of $9 billion to $10 billion to keep production flat is a good go-by
for now. I mean, clearly it's going to be a function of how much deflation we see, that's sustained deflation across the
industry. But a number of that sort of magnitude is a good go-by for the time being.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So when you talk about cash flow neutrality, I don't know if this is either Jeff or Matt, but what
commodity deck are you assuming when you think about that for 2017?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Like the comment that Matt made about capital, that also depends on what kind of cost deflation
we see in both capital costs and operating costs. We don't expect that prices are going to maintain at current levels for
that period of time, so we would be at cash flow neutrality at some improvement over current price levels but not at a
level as high as what we've experienced recently.

<A - Ryan M. Lance>: So, Doug, what I would say as we see a modestly rising price deck over the course of the next
few years but certainly not back to a level that we've seen the last two or three years.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Got it. My follow-up if I may, Ryan, it's probably one for you or it's really more of a high-level
strategy question because we could debate over the years what the market looks for out of Conoco. Your unique
offering obviously is the dividend but top line growth for a company of your size is always going to be relatively
modest at best. So when you think about the trade-off between portfolio high grading, bringing new projects on and
perhaps monetizing or exiting other areas, with the potential to buy back shares when you do get a windfall of oil prices
as we may have just had over the last several years, how do you see the strategic rationale of continuing to pursue top
line growth in a volatile oil price environment as opposed to continue as high grading with a very strong yield and the
option to buy back stock? I'm just kind of curious as to how this low oil price environment changes your thinking.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah. I think as I look out, we probably should expect with some of the modest growth that
we're seeing in demand and really the resiliency that we see in the unconventionals having an impact on the supply,
we're going to be in a more volatile world as we go ahead. So as I think about that strategically for the company, we're
trying to build a company that has a solid base of legacy assets, low production decline, the things that you can
underpin the dividend with over time. So as we bring on the oil sands our legacy assets in Alaska, what we're doing in
Europe and the North Sea, what we're building in Asia-Pacific. And then on top of that, we're moving to a lower cost of
supply in the portfolio through the addition of the unconventional portfolio that we're developing here in North
America.
And that provides us a lot of resilience and flexibility to the capital. So we'll see what the commodity price gives us.
We'll protect the dividend first and then with what's left over in the cash flow, we'll fund a capital program that will set
the growth that we see coming out of that, because we know the growth is directly related to that capital program.
When it comes to share buyback, we'll just assess what we have in terms of capital opportunities in the portfolio. If
they're good, strong returns, which we think they're going to be with the unconventional inventory that we have, we'll
judge that against the opportunity for share buyback down the road.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Good morning, Doug.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Ryan, one of your competitors indicated today that service calls have not declined as much
as might be expected given the decline in oil and gas prices, and while there's always going to be lag effects and
different contract durations and other things, I wanted to see if you would elaborate further on what ConocoPhillips has
seen in the market and whether service cost lag effects were an important factor in today's reduction in spending or
whether it was really lower prices. And then also some of the specific initiatives that you guys are undertaking that led
to the $500 million benefit that you talked about a few minutes ago.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah. Sure, Doug. I can chime in and Matt's even closer to it than I am, so I can let him add
some color to it if he would like. But yeah we've – so what we've said is we are seeing reductions as rigs start rolling
off, onshore rig rates will be coming down. We're seeing pumping services and some of the commodities, and we're
tracking each one of those. We have 20 different categories that we track on the supply chain side, and we're looking at
them pretty closely. Now a lot of those are coming to the capital side, some go to the OpEx side. What we said is we've
got pretty clear line of sight to the $500 million of reductions that we've factored in, but those are going to continue as
this commodity price environment continues into 2015, and depending on the recovery that we see coming into 2016.

We're all over it. We're looking to try to capture as much of that as we can. The interesting sort of piece that you get, all
the reductions and the flexibility that we're exercising is in North America, and that's where we expect to see a lot of
the first reductions from capturing the deflation. So, I don't know, Matt – I think that's where – we're all over it, Doug,
and we're going to get as much as we can out of it and as quickly as we can.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Sure. Okay. Well thanks a lot, guys.

Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Thanks. I'd like to dig into the CapEx and flexibility just a little bit more, and you did cite your
maintenance CapEx is around $9 billion to $10 billion. But when you step back and look at major project spend, as I
think you cited, you're seeing a reduction in 2016, 2017. Can you give us a sense of what the size of that might be and
how much you guys think you need to spend annually on those longer dated projects, whether you have them today or
you need to build them for long-term growth opportunities?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Well as we move from 2015 into 2016, we'll see about $2 billion coming out of our major
capital projects CapEx requirements just from Surmont and APLNG. So that's why we're referring to a significant
increase in flexibility from 2015 to 2016, and that trend continues. There's several hundred million. It's not billions of
barrels as we go from – billions of dollars as we go from 2016 to 2017, but that trend of reducing capital going to major
projects and increasing capital going to the flexible low cost of supply and development programs, that's an underlying
part of the strategy that we've been executing for the past three years, and we're in the middle of that and an adjustment
to our overall investment portfolio right now and for the next couple of years.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. So if I can clarify, if I look at that $11.5 billion 2015 budget, call it you take out $2.5
billion for some of these major projects, and that gets you to somewhat that maintenance capital level?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: That's a good way of thinking about it. Yeah. That's close enough.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. I appreciate that. And one follow-up question then. On your rig count reductions,
obviously they're pretty meaningful in the U.S. onshore, and when you look at plays like the Bakken, the Eagle Ford
and Permian, can you give us then when you're drilling your projects today, and you sit there and look at three, four,
and six rig counts, do you assume that these will be economic at current spot prices, strip prices or a better price? And
just to give you some context, I know there's a lot of debate whether or not the Bakken is economic today so why
should there be any rigs drilling there today?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah. So we're in the sweet spot of the Bakken. With the rig rates and the rates that we're
getting, it's economic at current conditions, but we're actually taking that all the way down to a three rigs this year. We
do have some commitments within some of the units in the Bakken where we have to run some rigs in the Bakken. The
Eagle Ford is still very economic even at the current prices. But having said that, it makes more economic sense to
defer. So what we're dealing with in the Eagle Ford is that a balance of -- we have some commitments. We need to run
probably three rigs to meet commitments on our leasehold. We're also keen to continue to learn in the Eagle Ford
because we have a huge inventory there that we could develop over the next couple of decades, and we want to make
sure that we're capturing all the learnings.
So we're choosing to continue with some of our pilot tests as we go through 2015. And our expectation is, as some of
the capital flexibility appears more into next year, that we're likely to increase our rig counts and take advantage of
what may be higher prices but certainly will be deflated costs.

Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Please go ahead.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yes. Hi. Addressing the services costs another way, are you getting discounts from book rates?
Or are you going to be able to get longer-term rates at discount or is it too early regarding fracking rigs, et cetera?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So there's a mixture of both going on, John. I mean, this isn't a great time to enter any
long-term commitments, until we see how the deflation works its way through the system, but we're working with the
suppliers. We've got a great relationship with the suppliers and we're looking at across a spectrum of things, influence
of capital and operating costs and making judgments every day on what the most prudent thing to do is in terms of
contract duration and commitments against the reducing costs that we're seeing.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Thanks, Matt. One other question. Ryan, you said it's a more volatile world. Given the
short cycle nature of shale-based activity, would you ever institute a hedging program in the shales, or just given your
size it's not realistic?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, I think the latter is the case, John. It's our size. We're naturally hedged a bunch across a
lot of commodities in the markers. So given our size and where we're at, we don't see that as a useful strategy right
now.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Guy A. Baber>: Good afternoon everybody.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Hello, Guy.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Hi.
<Q - Guy A. Baber>: I had a question on your 2015 production and I was trying to get a better sense of the general
trend as we progress through the year, especially for the U.S. unconventional portfolio. So could you help frame for us
perhaps what kind of the 2015 exit rate production expectations might be for the Lower 48 on the current capital
spending plan? And then any early expectations on 2016 with current rig count levels would be much appreciated, and
then I have a follow-up.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Well, Guy, I think you're really trying to focus in on the unconventionals in our portfolio. So
to give you a sense of that, we expect our production from the Eagle Ford and Bakken will grow from about 200,000
barrels a day in 2014 to about 225,000 barrels a day in 2015, so somewhere between a 10% and a 15% increase. That
production growth is all going to come through the first half of the year. And then if we stay at the rig counts that we
said just now, we're going to go into a slow decline in both the Bakken and Eagle Ford. Not a rapid decline, but a slow
decline and that's going to continue into early 2016. So where our 2016 average rate will be is going to be a function of
the number of rigs we decide to run. And as I said earlier, we do expect to increase our rigs in the Eagle Ford and
Bakken in 2016. So production may be flat from 2015 to 2016 but time will tell. So growing production on average,
year on year from 2014 to 2015, all of that growth is seen in the early part, in the first half of the year and then a slow
decline through the third and fourth quarter.
<Q - Guy A. Baber>: That's very helpful, Matt. And then my follow-up, I wanted to kind of walk through some of the
implications of the lower rig count. And you'd partially addressed this in your prepared comments, Matt, but how do
you think about reduced investment levels materially but still retaining the practical ability to quickly flex those activity

levels higher if the commodity price improves? And then secondly, can you just address, just with the focus on
minimizing spending and maximizing efficiencies, your ability to still continue with some of your experimentation to
drive long-term resource upside? I mean, are those plans still going to be in place in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken as
well with the lower rig count? Any comments you could provide there would be great.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, so the organization that we have in the Lower 48 is flexible enough to bring the rigs
down and bring the rigs back up if we want to do that. So that flexibility exists and we're exercising that flexibility now
on the way down and we'll be ready to do it on the way back up again. So the organizational flexibility and the
relationships with the suppliers and so on, that's all in-hand to go both ways. In terms of the continued experimentation,
yeah, we have to choke back somewhat on the pace of learning. We can't do all of the pilot tests that we'd like to do,
because you need to be drilling a lot of wells to do some of those. But the critical pilot tests that really have the biggest
implications for a long-term resource understanding, we're going to continue with those sort of pilot tests through this
downturn because of the implications of the value of that information for the long-term we think is worth continuing to
collect.

Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Hey, folks. Good morning. I have a question on slide seven. It looks like you provide the
regional breakout of your adjusted earnings, and I hate to put too much emphasis on just one quarter, but it looks like
the Lower 48 actually saw a loss compared to the other regions and obviously your cutting CapEx in the Lower 48 as
well. I guess my view was that that was one of the main drivers of margin expansion going forward. So could you
maybe elaborate a little bit on the economics that you're seeing there compared to the other investment opportunities
that you have?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Blake, in the Lower 48 in the fourth quarter, there were around $100 million or so of
impairments that happened between, and then also some dry hole costs related to the Shenandoah appraisal well that we
wrote off as well, which impacted that loss somewhat. But having said that, it will be a challenging year coming
forward for Lower 48 based on the fact that there's still a fairly heavy natural gas waiting in the Lower 48 production. It
is, as Matt mentioned, the economics are still there for continued investments that we're making, and those are good
cash margin investments. But it is going to be a challenging 2015 at current commodity price levels in the Lower 48.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Sure. Understood. Okay. And then the second question is on the commitment to the
dividend. I fully appreciate the differentiated strategy and having that as a top priority. But you mentioned debt to cap
would increase, and potentially investment grade could go below AA or A. Is there a level that we should think about
where you begin to have to rethink that strategy and emphasis on the dividend, whether it be investment grade rating or
a certain debt to cap level?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: As we mention in our remarks on the calls, we look at a lot of different scenarios that might
happen over the next couple years. We think between the capital flexibility that we have, the potential that we could
have some level of asset sales in the mix, and the cash balance that we're starting with, that we don't think we're going
to be having to face the question of having more borrowings than will take us out of that A credit rating range. And
again, that's part of the overall message here is that's baking in the dividend is the first priority for how we're using our
cash flow.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Couple quick questions, if I could. Maybe this is for Matt and Jeff.
If you're looking at your supply cost, what percentage, how much of that supply cost is currently under contract longer

than two years?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Supply costs, you mean like our rigs and so on?
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Yeah. Rig or anything that relate to your upstream operation.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Well in our North America business and certainly in Canada and the Lower 48 there's very,
very little that extends beyond one year in terms of rig contracts. Most of them are 30 days. If we move out to the
international business, there are some in the UK and Alaska and Norway that are on longer-term contracts than that.
But typically it's not common for us to have a significant amount of our drilling development-led portfolio constrained
by long-term contracts.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: So, Matt, should we assume that more than 50% of your supply cost base that you could
potentially start seeing cost reduction in a relatively quick timeline?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Oh, I see what you're getting at. You're looking at the opportunities to get deflation into that?
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: That's correct. How quickly we would, because if you have a lot of your services under
long-term contract and maybe that you can negotiate even though that you're still under contract, but normally that
people don't like you to allow that, but so that's why I'm trying to understand how quickly is that saving will be able to
pass through?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: We're going to see it most quickly in the onshore North American business, and that's in
particular in Canada and the Lower 48. We're not going to see it, for example, in the APLNG project. We're now
almost 100% labor costs. We're not likely to see labor costs in Australia decrease over the next year. The same applies
really to the Surmont 2 project in Canada where that's all labor just now, and we don't anticipate any significant labor
cost reductions over the next few months as we complete the project. So the short answer is that the major projects are
going to see limited and slower deflationary forces act on them in the development programs everywhere; but in
particular, Canada and Lower 48 are going to see it more quickly.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. Second question, this is for Ryan. Ryan, I understand your priority in protecting
dividend. What if, as the industry under stress and as a great opportunity arise and you have to make a choice between
making an acquisition but that have to dramatically cut your dividend subsequently to ensure that you have sufficient
cash flow going forward, how that choice will be made from your standpoint? I mean how you balance that?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, Paul, it's an interesting scenario to try to think about but it's a tough one to pontificate a
little bit over because we're focused on executing the plan that we have. We watch the M&A market, we see the assets
that are out there. The issue with M&A and our portfolio is it's got to compete against investments that we have in the
portfolio already today, and it's a pretty big hurdle for it to climb over. So I wouldn't speculate on where that might go.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Good, thanks. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Maybe one follow-up on activity levels and balance
sheet. I guess as we look forward into 2016, implied on reaching the 2017 cash flow neutrality target even at the current
CapEx balance and dividend rate would imply a relatively significant ramp in cash flow potentially from commodity
prices into 2017 as is. So what would you need to see I guess in the market either from a cost or from a commodity
point of view to actually start adding capital back to the budget as opposed to just letting things play out through 2017?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So what we've said is that we're going to allow our capital to be flexible to manage within our
cash flow and maintain the dividend. So the capital is going to flex and we have the portfolio to allow that to happen.
So when we say that we're going to get to cash flow neutrality in 2017, there's a bunch of different ways that that could
transpire. It could transpire through higher prices with more capital and more production or lower prices with less
capital and less production growth. So we model all of these scenarios and we're planning to talk more about this,

Ryan, when we have our Analyst Day in April.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: The capital, Ryan, is the flywheel. So again, we start with dividends being the number one
priority. We'll fund that out of the cash flow. The growth will come from whatever capital level that we set, and the
commodity price and the cash flow informs that and then we're setting that level to make sure that we reach cash flow
neutrality by 2017. And as Matt said, across various scenarios of combination of capital and oil price projections, we're
focused on getting there in 2017.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great. I appreciate the lots of moving pieces in the equation. Just trying to get an idea if there is a
level that you would think about that you would have to see at least to actually start putting some money back into the
business incrementally from what you have now.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: We won't let cash flow neutrality move out beyond 2017, so I think that's the stake you can put
in the ground, Ryan.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Okay. That's helpful.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: And it could move closer, depending on the commodity price levels and what the market gives
us.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: That's helpful. And then if I could ask on what you're seeing on the cost environment. I know
you've talked a little bit. Am I correct in understanding that the vast majority of the $500 million CapEx cuts that
you've implied in the budget to date have come in U.S.? And either way, can you talk a little bit – we have a little bit
more visibility I think generally in what we see in the U.S., but can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing
globally on costs across deepwater major capital projects, those type of things in the current environment?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well I think Matt's tried to address that. We see it'll be slower in the major projects, and those
like APLNG and Surmont that have a large labor component, that's going to take a long time to work through the
system depending on how long the down cycle is. We do see deepwater floater rigs coming off quite a bit, so the
market today is quite a bit less than it was just a couple or a year ago, maybe this time a year ago. So we do see pieces
of that. Tubular goods, oil country tubular goods, we see that coming down, and that's a commodity that we use across
the world. So where we have development drilling programs and we use workovers and stuff, we see some of that
flowing through as well. So it is a by category; it's different by each category, and it's different around the world. And
the $500 million that we're talking about is something that we've got pretty clear line of sight on to capture this year,
and that will continue into 2016.

Thank you. Our next question is from Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Yes. Good morning. A good discussion so far, and I'm going to have to stick with
CapEx, then ask some smaller questions. Just on the $4.5 billion of major project spend, given that you do have
APLNG, heavy oil, and some large projects in Malaysia that are going to finish hopefully at some point in 2015, it
might be a help to ask to maybe give us some color as to, just on the existing projects, how might that look in 2016?
Forget cost deflation but just the timing of the CapEx cycle.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So roughly speaking, we're going to see – well let me give you some specifics. So APLNG
will go from something like $1.6 billion this year to $0 next year. Surmont will go from about $800 million this year to
about $250 million next year. There, so there's a [ph] few bins (50:44) are high-level and...
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Yeah.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Views of those biggest projects. There are a few projects that are increasing in capital
year-on-year. As the Clair Ridge project moves towards closure, we'll see a slight increase in capital there next year,
and the same with the Malachi project in Malaysia. But overall, we're going to see something greater than $2 billion

coming out of the – in the mix between those larger, the biggest projects we're executing coming to an end, and some
smaller projects that are already in execution ramping up a bit.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: With the cash flow from those, and then that provides more confidence to add back
rigs into shale? So I can see how that would...
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Well, actually you make a good point there, Ed, because one of the things about the projects
like APLNG and Surmont, for example, is they'll start producing this year, but they won't actually get to peak rates for
a full year until 2017. So they're going to be continuing to contribute to growth long after the capital's spent. As the
Surmont project takes three years to ramp up, APLNG won't actually get to peak production until sometime early in
2016. The KBB project in Malaysia, we might only get half of year. Despite the fact that the project's complete, we're
waiting on this pipeline being repaired. We might only get half a year of production from KBB this year, but we'll get a
full year of production in 2015, and so on. So we're happy that these major projects are now getting to completion, not
just because we don't have to spend the CapEx, but because now we're going to reap the reward over the next several
years of contributing, growing our base production through these long-life – many of them long-life flat production
projects.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: But...
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: But to put a little bit more point on what Matt said as well, if you go back to our Analyst
Presentation last April, we talked some numbers about how much cash we can expect to see coming out of APLNG and
out of FCCL once those things are up and running, kind of at full rates by 2017. And those are lower numbers at lower
commodity prices, but that's still a pretty significant source of cash for us, and that is an important part of the equation
of getting to cash flow neutrality in 2017.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: And just on APLNG though, just as a follow-up, how will you be treating I guess
the CBM drilling costs? Would that be in CapEx or you put that in OpEx, just more of a modeling question? The
maintenance CapEx on that project?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, the...
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Which can be quite significant, I think.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, because of the fact that APLNG is done with equity accounting for, I said, you don't end
up seeing the capital expenditures for APLNG or the operating costs for it. You just see contributions in a current state.
The contributions in are going in as capital and we'll just see distributions coming back out in the future.

Thank you. Our next question is from Alastair Syme of Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alastair R. Syme>: Hello. I wonder if I could ask to what extent in this environment that OpEx and overhead
might be the flywheel in terms of that cash neutrality. If you could put some granularity around the comments you
made about G&A costs, it would be useful.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah. And Alastair, yeah, we've talked a lot about capital, but we're equally focused on
operating cost here as you'd expect. And just like we're focused across the whole value chain for capital deflation
opportunities and capital, same thing's happening in operating costs. First of all, in costs that are externally driven like
contract labor, materials and chemicals, and there's some price sensitivity to transportation costs and some of our
transportation contracts. So we've got to look inside, too, for self-help reductions, looking at our internal operating
costs and G&A. So we're already taking action there. We're going to have no salary increases in 2014. We've got a
hiring freeze in place across most of the company. We've already announced plans to reduce head count in Europe
that's quite significant. And we're likely to see more head count reductions in other parts of the business as we reassess
the implications of lower prices on our future plans. So we have the whole company focused on minimizing our
operating costs and we're not going to leave any stone unturned but we're not going to take any measures that reduce

And this is one of the things, Alastair, that we intend to talk about in more detail at the Analyst Day in April, our

percentage? Roughly?

Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Yeah, good morning.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Hello, Roger.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: I guess coming at the OpEx question a slightly different way, we talked a lot about CapEx
flexibility. As you think about the cash margin potential here, I mean, I think about the shale play, certainly where they
were, probably a little more on the higher cash cost side, certainly looking across the industry. So as you pull back a
little bit on your drilling there as we look at some of the projects and probably more of a 2016 than a 2015 impact from
APLNG and Surmont, what do think about cash margins as you look into the latter part of 2015 and 2016?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Well, we expect – the absolute level of the cash margin will come down with the commodity
prices obviously, but as we look across the portfolio, most of the portfolio is quite resilient to – on a cash break-even
basis, is pretty resilient to these prices. So as Matt said, were going to continue to drive operating cost reductions as
well as the capital reductions, and while the absolute level of the margin will probably come down, we're still going to
try to drive to see those margin improvements over the course of the next couple of years.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. Thanks. And then maybe a better question in April, but as you think about the
exploration program here as part of the overall CapEx discipline and keeping the dividend in mind, flexibility
obviously on the growth projects, what is the flexibility on exploration? And what is the maybe incentive here, as you
mentioned, with lower rig rates to shift things out another six or 12 months where you can?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: On the short-term aspect of that question in terms of the flexibility in our exploration spend,
there's relatively limited flexibility in the short-term on our conventional exploration activity. We have rigs under
contracts, we have agreements in place with governments and partners. So over the next year through 2015, that's why
we haven't taken as much as you might expect out of exploration. We've really had to go through the parts of the
exploration portfolio that are flexible. So we're going to find that 2015 is actually quite a big year for exploration in
Angola, Senegal, Gulf of Mexico, Nova Scotia for example, and Australia. And so then there's a longer-term question
about the role of exploration in the growth of the company, and that's one of the things that we are going to talk about
more in the Analyst Day in a couple of months.

Yes?
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Sorry, Christine. I'm seeing it's the top of the hour we'll take one more question if you don't
mind, okay?
Operator
Okay. Our last question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: Hey, thanks for sneaking me in. Two quick ones. One is just the budget for this year. Is it fair to
say that the $11.5 billion is set in stone at this point absent further deflation given that you have $2 billion rolling off
into next year and that $9.5 billion is the core required to spend? So if you cut anymore this year it would be cutting
into the meet-it so to speak?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes, I think we've got to set the scope that we want to execute with the $11.5 billion. There is
some certainty as to how much deflation we'll capture this year. We've added some in; it could be more than that. We're
certainly trying to drive to more than that. But yes, we've set the scope associated with what we want to execute on the
$11.5 billion.
<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: Got it. And then just a follow-up just on the asset sales topic, maybe any additional color you
could provide around how you might approach a process like that. What parts of the portfolio might be something
you'd want to monetize in this type of environment?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, we continue to look. I've said we won't have another large announced asset disposition
program, but you should expect us every year to be pruning the bottom part of the portfolio. Obviously it gets tougher
in this kind of commodity price environment, but we set our new base case, we know what the assets are worth to us
internally, and if there's interest out there in certain assets we'll entertain those and look at them. So I think you should
expect some modest amount. It'll be tougher over the next couple of years, but there'll still be some pieces of our
portfolio that we'll be taking a hard look at.
<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: So you think you could get $500 million to $1 billion in cash a year out of asset sales? Any kind
of target you're thinking about?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: I don't really have a target in mind. We'll do what makes sense.
<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: Okay, okay. Fair enough. Thanks.
Ellen R. DeSanctis
Thanks, Phil. Okay, Christine, why don't you wrap it up here? Thanks, everybody, for your time, and by all means call
IR if you have any other additional questions.
