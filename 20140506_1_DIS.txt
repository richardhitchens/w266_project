Lowell Singer
Good afternoon, and welcome to the The Walt Disney Company's second quarter 2014 earnings call. Our press release
was issued almost 45 minutes ago and it's available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also
being webcast, and the webcast and a transcript will be available on our website.
Joining me in Burbank for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jay Rasulo,
Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off followed by Jay, and then of course we
will be happy to take your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob and we will get started.
Robert A. Iger
Thanks Lowell, and good afternoon. We are extremely pleased with our performance in Q2, with revenues up 10%, net
income up 27%, and adjusted EPS up 41% to $1.11, the highest in the history of our company. And once again, all of
our business segments achieved double-digit increases or more in operating income. Our continued strong performance
reflects the strength of our brands and the quality of our content, our extraordinary creative success and our unique

ability to leverage it across the entire company.
The unprecedented global success of Disney Animation's phenomenal Frozen continues and it's now the world's highest
grossing animated film of all time and the best-selling title ever released on Blu-ray and digital. The demand for Frozen
merchandise remains extremely high, and the soundtrack was the number one album in the U.S. again last week. And
as previously announced, Frozen is headed to Broadway.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier has far surpassed the first Captain America in total global box office, which
obviously bodes well for our Avengers franchise. We've had enormous success releasing Marvel movies on the first
weekend in May, including the two biggest domestic openings of all time and will continue this tradition with The
Avengers: Age of Ultron next year and Captain America 3 in 2016. Avengers: Age of Ultron is currently shooting, and
early footage looks great.
This August 1st we're look forward to introducing the world to more fantastic Marvel storytelling with a great cast of
new characters in Guardians of the Galaxy, which was screened last week. We believe it has strong franchise potential.
Also on the Marvel front, we just announced that Disney Interactive's Infinity 2 will feature the Avengers as well as
other Marvel and Disney characters when it's released in the fall. Since the first version of the game launched last
August, more than 3 million Disney Infinity starter packs have been sold, and it was the best-selling interactive gaming
toy of 2013 in the U.S.
And we made some other news last week when we announced the cast for Star Wars: Episode VII, which includes
some very familiar faces as well as some exciting new talent, and the reaction has been tremendous. I was at Pinewood
Studios with J.J. Abrams a couple of weeks ago and left more confident than ever that Episode VII will be the
extraordinary movie Star Wars fans have been waiting for.
Our Parks and Resorts had another record quarter, and we've completed the roll-out of MyMagic+ to all guests, which
Jay will get into in a few minutes. Guest reaction has been very positive, and we believe the new program is delivering
nicely on its promise of improving guest experience.
Internationally Hong Kong Disneyland set new attendance and occupancy records in Q2, and construction on Shanghai
Disney resort continues to go well. There are an estimated 330 million potential guests within a three-hour travel radius
of the Shanghai resort, and by the time we open the gates in late 2015, China's travel market is expected to be 34%
bigger than it was in 2012. And the number of upper middle class and affluent households is expected to grow by 18%
a year for most of the next decade. These trends factored into our recent decision with our partners in Shanghai to
accelerate expansion with an additional $800 million investment.
Turning to Media Networks, both our cable and broadcast businesses had a solid quarter. We showcased the strength
and long-term potential of ESPN at our investor day last month. It's an incredible brand that continues to drive
tremendous value for us. And we've got a lot of reasons to be excited about what's coming up, including a great NBA
postseason culminating with the finals on ABC, the World Cup from Brazil, a very promising Monday Night Football
schedule, and ESPN's first foray into the NFL postseason.
Finally, I'd like to share a few thoughts about our acquisition of the top online video network, Maker Studios. We're
excited about entering the short-form video space in a much more assertive manner to boost the presence of our brands
and franchises in this increasingly valuable and fast-growing arena. Maker's production talent and leadership will create
exciting new opportunities to drive value from our content and create new content as well.
By any measure we had great success in Q2 creatively, financially and strategically. In addition to our unique ability to
leverage content across the entire company to create maximum value, our unparalleled portfolio of incredibly strong
brands is a clear, strategic advantage that we expect will be evident in our results for years to come.
Now I'm going to turn this call over to Jay so he can walk you through the details of our results in the second quarter.
Jay?

Jay Rasulo
Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great first half of fiscal 2014. In fact, it's the best first half in the
company's history. Our second quarter results once again reflect the significant benefit we derive from our strategy of
investing in high-quality content. As Bob mentioned, adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were up 41% to
$1.11.
Each segment delivered meaningful increases in operating income, and in the case of the studio, operating income was
up over 300% to $475 million, representing one of the studio's best quarters ever. During the quarter, the growth in
operating income at the studio was due primarily to the domestic home video release of Frozen and the film's strong
theatrical performance overseas, where it has generated approximately $770 million in international box office to date.
Higher operating income from television distribution also contributed to growth in the quarter.
Media Networks delivered higher operating income in the second quarter due to growth at both cable and broadcasting.
At cable, growth in operating income was driven by ESPN, domestic Disney channels, and higher equity income from
our investment in A&E television networks.
Growth in ESPN's operating income was due to higher affiliate revenue and lower programming and production costs,
partially offset by lower ad revenue. ESPN continued to benefit in the quarter from the absence of losses at our ESPN
UK business, which was sold in the fourth quarter last year. Programming costs at ESPN were lower than in the prior
year as contractual rate increases for college basketball were more than offset by the absence of costs for UK sports
rights.
During the second quarter, ESPN deferred $80 million less in affiliate revenue than in Q2 of last year due primarily to
the signing of a new affiliate contract. As we look to the third quarter, we expect ESPN to recognize approximately
$190 million less in previously deferred affiliate revenue compared to the prior year. I'll remind you these changes have
no impact on full-year results.
Ad revenue at ESPN declined low single digits in the second quarter due to a decrease in units sold and lower ratings
partially offset by higher rates. The marketplace was not particularly robust in the second quarter. So far this quarter,
ESPN ad sales are pacing up mid-single digits, driven by demand for the World Cup. The broadcast of those matches
gets under way in late Q3 and runs through the first two weeks of Q4.
Domestic cable affiliate revenue growth was up low double-digits in the quarter, which was aided by the timing of
program covenants. Adjusted for the timing of deferred revenue at ESPN, growth in domestic cable affiliate revenue
was up high single digits.
Broadcasting operating income was up in the quarter driven by higher affiliate revenue and lower expenses, partially
offset by lower advertising revenue. Ad revenue at the ABC network was down in the quarter due to lower ratings,
partially offset by higher rates. Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at the network is running mid-single digits above upfront
levels.
At Parks and Resorts, our Q2 results reflect strong, underlying trends in the business. Total revenue was up 8% and
operating income was up 19%, as a result of continued strength at our domestic operations. Results at our international
operations were comparable to the prior year, as growth at Hong Kong Disneyland was offset by a decline at
Disneyland Paris. Total segment margins were up 120 basis points in the second quarter and were adversely impacted
by about 200 basis points, due to new initiatives.
The second quarter also included one less week of the Easter holiday compared to last year. Adjusted for the timing of
the Easter holiday, operating income would have been up an estimated 31%. Growth in operating income at our
domestic operations was driven by higher guest spending at Walt Disney World and higher attendance at Disneyland
Resort, partially offset by higher costs primarily related to the continued roll-out of MyMagic+.
We made MyMagic+ available to all on-property guests during the first fiscal quarter and to all other guests at the
beginning of the third quarter. We are pleased with some of the changes in guest behavior and park dynamics we are

already seeing.
Guest adoption of our MyMagic+ pre-visit planning tools is encouraging. Roughly three-quarters of our resort guests
are using them to plan their visit. And just one month after making pre-arrival planning of FastPass+ available to our
day guests, more than 25% of them are pre-engaging with us. Historically guests who pre-plan spend more time at our
parks, so we like these early trends.
MyMagic+ has also increased the engagement with FastPass + by 40%, relative to the legacy FastPass system and
allowed us to increase the number of guests we can accommodate during peak periods. Our research indicates that
these benefits are driving higher overall levels of guest satisfaction.
During the second quarter, per capita spending at our domestic parks was up 4% on higher ticket prices, food and
beverage, and merchandise spending. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 3%, setting a second quarter attendance
record. Per room spending in our domestic hotels was up 3% and occupancy was up 6 percentage points to 86%. So far
this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 3%, compared to prior year levels, while booked rates are up
6%.
At Consumer Products, operating income increased 37% and margins were higher by almost 500 basis points,
reflecting continued strength in our merchandise licensing business and retail. Growth in licensing was driven by
higher revenue for Disney Channel, Mickey and Minnie, and Planes properties. On a comparable basis, earned
licensing revenue in the second quarter was up 8% versus last year. That's three consecutive quarters of mid-to-high
single digit growth in earned revenue, which is pretty impressive.
Results at Disney Interactive were significantly better than we anticipated when we reported Q1 results, due to the
continued success of Disney Infinity. We had another profitable quarter, which makes it three consecutive quarters of
profitability, a first for the segment. In addition to success of Disney Infinity, growth in our Japan mobile business also
contributed to higher operating income, albeit to a lesser extent.
We continued to repurchase our stock during the second quarter, and we are still on pace to repurchase between $6 and
$8 billion for fiscal 2014. During Q2, we repurchased 19.9 million shares for about $1.5 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we
have repurchased 58.2 million shares for $4.3 billion.
And with that, we're now ready to take your questions
Lowell Singer
Okay, thanks, Jay. Eric, we are ready to open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Michael Nathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks. I have just one for Jay and Bob. Can we talk about Consumer Products for a
second? You didn't call out Frozen in either the press release or comments. So can you talk about the impact Frozen
had this quarter on Consumer Products? And then if you think about it more broadly given the shortages of inventory,
how big can Frozen be and what – can you benchmark it to some other one of your franchises? When's the timing of
Frozen in terms of hitting if there's a catch-up trade on the inventory side? So let's start with that for a second.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Hi, Michael.

<A - Jay Rasulo>: In terms of the impact of this quarter of Frozen, we saw that impact much more heavily at the
Disney Store than we did broadly in the merchandise area. In fact, 9 out of the 10 highest selling items at the Disney
Store in the quarter were Frozen merchandise. So it not only had great sales, but increased footfall at the stores, and
they had a very, very strong result.
Obviously, with the release of the DVD, I think you'll see the impact – the second part of your question, the impact on
our licensed business with the impact we see in general, high periods like back-to-school and obviously Christmas in
Q4. Q1 of next year you'll see the biggest impact. But whether it's music, whether it's interest in the DVD, or general
interest in this franchise, it will continue to be a driver, we believe, for some time into the future. It was not in our
licensing business, as obviously, one of the top three franchises in terms of driving as you mentioned.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay, and I just wondered could Bob, I know you spent time in the past, sizing some of
the franchises. How would this rank in terms of what you're thinking about compared to Princess and some of the other
things you've done on the Investor Days in the past? So is this a billion dollar franchise, you think, in the next couple of
years?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: This is definitely up there in terms of our top probably five franchises, so you can expect us to
take full advantage of that over the next at least five years, I would guess. We're already taking a number of steps, for
instance, to increase the characters' presence at our parks and developing some concepts around that. We're developing
a Broadway show. We're talking about other forms of storytelling relating to Frozen, whether it's publishing or
interactive or the like. So I think this is going to be – given the passion for this film and these characters is so
extraordinary, so well beyond what we ever even imagined that it would be hard to believe that it wouldn't sustain itself
over a fairly long period of time.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. Thanks, Bob.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Thank you, Michael. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Hi, thank you. Just a question on the parks. You've had such great success lately at the
parks, and it looks like you have a few more tailwinds ahead, going into the June quarter and beyond, a little bit of
benefit from the late Easter, the earlier pricing at Disney World. And, then the opening, I think it was the final bit of the
San Fran (sic) [Fantasyland] (17:52) renovation there.
I guess, could you give us any color how we should think about can that growth continue? And any color maybe on the
cost side with the launch cost, if there is anything significant to this last phase of the opening? And I guess additional
costs of MyMagic+, or is most of that behind us?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Taking the back half of your question first, Alexia, I don't think you should look for any
extraordinary costs as we, you know, continue to market the opening of Fantasyland with the mine coaster. I would say
that, and we've been saying that, you know, the only extraordinary costs, which, of course, we expect to taper over
time, is our launch of MyMagic+, which in Q3 we launched to all day guests, in fact all guests now who visit Walt
Disney World and we're still very much in the process of communicating its benefit, and I think guests are picking up
on that very quickly.
In terms of the business overall, you mentioned the one week of Easter. That will, you know, give us about a $45
million lift in Q3. Looking forward, you know, it's very hard to look in a crystal ball, but we gave you the pacings on
bookings and rates. You're right that we have the price increase earlier at Walt Disney World. That will continue to
help us year-over-year, relative to when we took that price increase last year, and you know, we don't have any crystal
ball that we haven't revealed to you that I want to talk about any further.

<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: And then, just a follow-up, staying on the parks. I don't know how much you can say on
this front, but given your past experiences, is there any sort of general commentary you can give us on how we should
think about the profitability ramp when Shanghai opens?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: You know, I don't think it's prudent to talk in advance of an event that's over a year and a half away.
I think that we are, obviously, very happy with the progress we're making in the construction of that project. We're very
excited about the market trends that we see in terms of, you know, the general ability of the traveling and the increase
in the ability of the traveling middle class in China, the proximate population that we feel we can market to. But, I don't
want to make any predictions about what will happen post-opening.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
The next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thanks. Actually the first one's for Bob. It's clear that this branded content strategy in the
film division is unique and obviously it's a huge success. So, I was just hoping you could give us some color or your
views on where you think you are in this strategy. Is it fully rolled out, and are you comfortable now? Are you
confident that Marvel is at a new higher level? It seems like each division is given the few films and very focused are
really working and working throughout the organization. So I would love to get your views on kind of how far you are
on that strategy.
And then for Jay, you mentioned that the new FastPass, part of the MyMagic+ roll-out that capacity – that you can get
more people in and out of the parks. How much did capacity increase?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: I'm obviously, biased, Jessica, but I think the strategy of making branded movies is definitely
working, and I think that we really are just seeing the beginnings of it in terms of their impact on the company,
particularly since we have a fair amount of visibility about the pipeline from all these great brands.
It's clear, for instance, that we've continued the great success of Pixar since that acquisition, and that that acquisition
has had a great impact on raising the quality level and the success of the films at Disney Animation, not just with
Frozen but Tangled before it and Wreck-It Ralph and films coming up. Marvel, as far as we're concerned, is just getting
started.
The results of Captain America, though, I think are very, very telling. Because when you look at a film that is
approaching almost $700 million in global box office, I think $680 million and you compare that to Captain America 1
which did under $400 million worldwide and you even look at it versus Thor movies, a few of the Iron Man movies,
you're looking at a film that has actually done substantially better than a lot of the Marvel films that we put out. Now, it
was a great film, but it's clear that momentum is building for that franchise. With Avengers 2 in production and coming
up and characters from Avengers still very much in favor with audiences, I think there's huge potential there.
In addition to that, we've got a new film, Guardians of the Galaxy, coming out August 1 in the United States this
summer, which we've seen – I mentioned it in my comments. We feel quite good about that, too. That's a whole other
Marvel realm or universe in terms of where it takes place, the characters that populate it and the stories that you can tell
for those characters. I think – I'm not going to predict that we've got another Avengers on our hands, but that's certainly
the goal.
And then, of course, you layer into all of this other Disney live movies, motion pictures like Maleficent coming up;
Cinderella, which is in the final stages of production; Tomorrowland, another film we feel quite good about. The
pipeline is rich there and the brand is strong.

And then, obviously, I won't forget Star Wars. We would be the first to admit that even we're surprised at the fervor and
the level of interest, the passion for this property. We knew that it was strong when we made the acquisition, but as
we've gotten into it more, we've gotten closer to it. As the film essentially starts filming, it's just amazing to us just
what kind of pent-up demand there is. And we feel great about where it is creatively. We feel good about the script. We
feel great about the director. We feel really good about the cast, and we couldn't be more excited about it.
As we mentioned on earlier calls, we intend to make at least three of the Star Wars sagas: 7, 8 and 9 at a cadence that
should be roughly every other year, and then we're in development on spin-off films, which we have not gotten specific
about, but we feel that we've got at least three that we're targeting to go into production. So that pipeline is going to be
rich certainly through the end of this decade.
Lastly, I know I'm getting wordy, but when you look at the world today, we actually see growth in the motion picture
business. That is largely due to huge growth in international markets, China being probably the biggest one. The
Chinese movie market has tripled in the last four years. It's the number two market in the world. We think it's going to
become the number one market by 2020, and our films are doing very well in those markets, Captain America, the most
recent example.
So there's also – so there's great opportunity. There's also a lot of competition globally, and we think that when you've
got these brands that are well-known and in demand, you are in a much better position competitively than you would be
without them.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: In terms of your second question on FastPass+ and MyMagic+ in general, in my opening remarks I
talked about what's happening. I want to emphasize that whatever I say about both of these new products that we are in
very, very early days. And we have to sort of calibrate what our findings have been by the fact that we're only a few
months in. But what we have found – and of course, capacity increases only really matter in our peak days and weeks.
But because of FastPass+, the ability to basically plan your day as it relates to top attractions in the park in advance has
had huge pickup by our guests. It allows a better distribution of guests around the park, and quite often the amount of
capacity we can let into the park is highly driven by pinch points in particular areas of the park that we don't want to get
too overcrowded. So when guests are better distributed around the park, we can often allow more in.
And I don't want to get into the specific numbers. It is in the thousands, but I don't want to get into the details about
what that might ultimately mean financially, but we know that from the guest experience when you're down at Walt
Disney World on peak days for Easter, Christmas typically, some weeks in the summer, it is a huge enhancement in
your experience when you can go to the park you want to go to on the day you want to and not fear that it's going to be
closed out.
So we see this as all great stuff. Again, very early in the process, but we're very, very encouraged across all the
variables that we had hoped to achieve with MyMagic+ and FastPass+.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thank you.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Thanks Jessica. Operator, next question please.
Operator
Your next question from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Bank>: Thanks very much. A question I guess on Maker Studios, and your successful acquisitions of scale
I think historically certainly since, Bob, you've been running the company, have tended to focus on brands that you
simply can't build, right? They're – they had to be bought. They had incredible value. And most of them have turned
out pretty successfully. So how do you put Maker in that context? What couldn't you build? What is the world-class
brand that you've acquired here, and how does the Disney difference kind of make it a more powerful platform?

<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, I think Maker has established itself as a bit of a brand in what is clearly a fast-growing
space of short-form video online or on mobile platforms. But as we look at Maker, we see it first and foremost as a
distribution platform and a very successful one. One that not only can command more eyeballs and more consumption,
but with that more advertising revenue, more revenue in general.
We did not believe that we had the ability in the company near term to distribute as effectively and to sell as
effectively. We also thought they had an expertise from a production and a creative perspective on creating short-form
video that we didn't think was as deep as it could have been at Disney. So we bought a lot of different capabilities, but
mostly distribution.
As we look at it, we believe that by creating access for the Maker people to some of our big brands and characters and
storytelling, Star Wars would be a perfect example of that, Marvel another one, then we can actually allow the Maker
people to substantially improve the distribution or the reach of shorter-form video using these characters and stories,
but also add their expertise on the production side.
They also have great access to data and algorithms that you wouldn't have unless you had volume. It would take a long
time to build the kind of technological expertise in that regard, to essentially maximize the potential of a video online,
they've got all that. So we look at this as a great opportunity both for Maker and Disney, Maker using our IP, Disney
using their expertise to distribute our product much more effectively.
The other thing I want to add is this is also potentially a great marketing opportunity for the company. More and more
we're taking advantage of short-form video and distribution for marketing messages for our movies, our theme parks
and our television shows. And you can see the marketplace with a fair amount of it, but getting maximum traction from
a distribution perspective takes a lot of expertise and a lot of experience. And they've got that. So we think there's a
huge marketing opportunity for this company.

The next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thanks. Jay, I just wanted to confirm that you're still expecting cable expense growth
I think in the high singles on programming this year. That's still the expectation? I know first half was quite a bit lower.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Yes. We've said from the outset and I said to many of you at the Investor Day that we always
expected those programming costs to be back loaded in the second half of the year, and it is simply related to the
calendar of sports rights as they roll in. I ticked a couple of them off. I guess I'll do it again: Major League Baseball
being one, the new NFL contract, which kicks in in Q4 of 2014 and we've got the World Cup this year in the third and
fourth quarters. Those are the biggest drivers. There's also some college football in there. And lastly, as I had
mentioned before, the launch of the SEC Network, so that is what is driving the somewhat back-loaded nature of our
increase in costs for the year.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: And this might be a bit of stretch tying these together, Bob. But when you look at the
bet you've made with Maker and the bet on online video and maybe the agreement you've made with DISH, which at
least it seems allows them to move towards an online streaming bundle, it seems like the company is taking a view that
they want to be – you want to have Disney present for the future of television or future of streaming, and I'm wondering

if you look at that as a hedge against pay TV and what will be happening in pay TV? Do you view them as
complementary? I know this is probably a 10-year view than a six-month view, but how are you looking at those
decisions in the context of your business, which as you outlined a few weeks ago in ESPN, the media networks throw
off a lot of cash flow for the company and the pay TV bundle drives that. So any color there would be helpful.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: I view them as complementary. You're throwing a lot of different concepts into the mix there.
Maker and the streaming video that's possible through the new DISH deal. Now on the Maker front, we think short
form is a frontier opportunity for us, meaning huge growth in consumption. We'd like to take advantage of that growth
by essentially generating more revenue and more consumption of our product not just for marketing messages I
mentioned a few minutes ago.
So we really believe in essentially growth in entertainment on new media platforms. Short-form and long form too, if
you look at what we did with Disney movies, the DMA product, Disney Movies Anywhere, that we launched recently
is another example of that. We think that you're going to see continued growth of consumption of media, entertainment
in particular on mobile platforms, smartphones and tablets. And we feel we need to be present in that space.
On the DISH side, that's a completely different story. The bet that's being made there by us and by DISH is that that
product has the ability to attract people who may not have already signed up for multi-channel service. And getting
them to sign up for something instead of nothing, we believe would be of real value to us. There, I guess, is an example
of something that is very complementary to what you call the pay TV model. The same as we've been doing with the
WATCH apps that we've been pretty aggressive with, a complementary product to make the pay TV model more
attractive for subscribers.

The next question comes from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Well, hi. Thank you. I've got a question on ABC and then a follow-up on the parks. From ABC,
according to our numbers it looked like prime time ratings were down, I don't know, maybe double-digits
year-over-year, which by the way, was not unique among broadcast networks, and yet you had total revenue that was
flattish and the profitability was up.
So, my question is, as you think about that business going forward, how do you think about – I'm sure your plan is not
to continue to have ratings erosion of that degree, but how do you think about putting capital at risk pursuing higher
audiences versus the reality perhaps that there might be some audience erosion that's inevitable and the new economic
formula that might suggest you focus more on profitability?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: First of all, ABC is still profitable. As we look at the year that they've had, we look at, first of
all, the C3 rating, 18 to 49, because that's the primary driver of revenue. Because the network – ABC has very little
sports, some of it provided by ESPN, but less than certainly some of the other networks. We tend to look at non-sports
programming, and as we see it, we're down high single digits in the C3 18 to 49 number ex-sports for the season, a little
bit more than that for the quarter that we just reported.
The name of the game, obviously, is strengthening our programming, which is what ABC is just in the middle of with a
lineup of pilots that have just been screened and decisions that are being made this week to populate the schedule for
the fall. It is our hope that we will reverse the tide of some of that ratings erosion with better shows on the air, quite
frankly, and that's what the mission is.
In addition to strengthening programming and raising ratings and hopefully revenue if the marketplace cooperates, the
goal is also to own a substantial amount of that programming. And, in today's world that can create huge value for the
owner of that property as we've seen in many, many different cases both with our programming and programming that

is created by others, thanks to, obviously, many new entrants into the marketplace, Netflix and Hulu among them.
So we're still viewing this business as a profit-generating business and a business that can generate substantially or
acceptable returns on invested capital for the company.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Okay, that's a perfect segue to the follow-up I wanted to ask on Parks. Jay, I don't know if you
or Bob want to take this, but let me take another run at the parks, because return on invested capital is a metric that in
the early days of the latest cruise ships is a metric you actually, I think, shared with us a couple of times. If I recall
correctly, you talked about ROICs in the mid to high teens for the new cruise ship operations. I would think that at least
for Disney California Adventure you'd have enough time now to have measured that. In fact, I'm quite sure you
measured it. I wondered if you'd share with us what you think the returns on that capital deployment have been. And
then put that into context now of the future to come openings, including, of course, Shanghai and the new capital you
decided to put on top of that and sort of what your hurdle rate and thoughts around ROIC on that is. Thanks.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Sure. You may remember – actually, Todd, I'm not sure you were following our company then, but
when we announced the expansion of Disney California Adventure, we said that we believed that the returns would be
attractive, i.e., above our cost of capital at that time.
In fact, so far – and, you know, of course, returns in the parks business are based over long term, but so far we've been
absolutely thrilled with the results of that investment that we put in place. And to a large extent on some variables
meeting and others exceeding our expectations for what that investment could bring. So we still are very, very bullish
that the returns that you and we are both going to feel very good about those returns, although I'm sorry, I'm not going
to share the explicit numbers with you, but when I say "Pleased," I certainly mean above our cost of capital.
Similarly for Walt Disney World, we don't – the expansion there, we don't take on projects that we don't believe will
exceed our hurdle rate. The signs are absolutely go forward great on Walt Disney World. Bob talked earlier about the
world's interest in Frozen. That is very focused on Anna and Elsa. You remember that the expansion of Fantasyland
was very focused around Princess meet and greets, and we can only expect great things there.
You've seen the numbers quarter after quarter at Walt Disney World including the last quarter where we've been able to
price behind these investments and still feel very strong about our volume going forward. So we feel very good about
it. I wish I could be more forthcoming with the numbers, but as I say, they will work themselves out or pay back over
time. All signals so far are very strong.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: If I could just add-Thanks, Jay – just a very quick follow-up. When you think about China, I
think I understand your cost of capital philosophy. Is there an extra hurdle rate or sort of a risk factor that you throw in
on top there that makes your expected returns need to be higher? Is that a fair statement? Any color you put on the way
you think about it would be great. Thanks.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Well, the China situation, because it's a shared investment, is a little more complicated situation.
First, we don't like to take on projects that on a total ownership basis don't have returns that we would like to see for
our investors, but remember, we have a much more limited investment and the flows are complicated between our
partners and ourselves, so we also look at the return to Disney's investment in that and in both cases we feel very good
about it.
We do risk adjust our hurdle rates in general. I don't want to get into the details of that, but I think you know that most
companies, you know, based on relative inflation rates and other risk factors adjust international hurdle rates
appropriately, and we do as well.

<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Hi, thanks. A couple questions. First, Jay, I think, on ESPN, on the last quarterly call,
you had said pacing was up. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that the ad market has been soft. I mean, we've
seen that in the other media companies' earnings reports.
How would you really explain the slowdown in the markets, since your comment? Does it seem like something
temporary that happened towards the latter part of the quarter, or is it something that, perhaps, a little bit more ongoing
or permanent, be it budget shifts to digital or anything – any other call-out in terms of the ad market more broadly?
And then, second question for Bob, I just had a question about Shanghai, in terms of your decision to accelerate the
CapEx. Should we think of that as more of an acceleration or an addition to the existing plan? And then, just wondering
if you can give us more color on the updated cadence of CapEx for Shanghai as we get closer to the opening? I'm just
wondering if that acceleration or addition has any impact on potential capital returns in 2015. I know that you've not
given guidance on that, but would love to hear any incremental color, given your decision on the $800 million. Thank
you.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Okay, Anthony, let me take the first half of that, which is – which was the ESPN ad sales.
Obviously, when we spoke to you all last quarter, we gave you what our pacings were. That was a fact. I think that
what happened in the quarter, there are a couple of complicating factors that are not typical of any quarter for ESPN.
First, you know, every four years we have the perturbation in the sports market of the Winter Olympics or the Summer
Olympics in the other years. It's very hard to predict what the impact of that is going to be. We took a guess at it. The
impact turned out to be a little more than we thought.
We also – when you're broadcasting live sports, you know, the match-ups and the cities involved in the match-ups, and
now I'm speaking specifically about the NBA – have something to do with the ads you sell behind them. Whether it's
Los Angeles, New York, or Boston, three very big markets for basketball are not involved in the NBA postseason. So,
you know, they affect our ratings.
We already mentioned that we thought the ad market was a little bit soft, and look, I don't think this is a permanent
situation. We've seen it this quarter. I don't expect it to be a long-term phenomenon.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: The question about Shanghai and CapEx, we always anticipated expanding that park. In fact,
the property that we've been allocated for the project provides ample opportunity for expansion.
As I said last week or early this week and as we indicated earlier today, what we're doing here, after basically seeing
some rather dramatic changes in the marketplace that we believe were positive, is that we're accelerating investment.
The $800 million, which is what we announced we were accelerating it by, is, obviously, shared with our partners in
the Shanghai government. So its impact from a capital expense perspective is relatively modest for us.
It is our hope that, with this expansion, which increases capacity, that most of it will be available to us at opening. It
puts a little more pressure on us because we're essentially building something that is bigger, but that's certainly the goal.
And then you can expect that in success, which we have every reason to believe will occur, that there will be continued
investment in this park, because of the size of the property and the size of the market, most populous city in the most
populous country in the world, which, as we've said a few times, 330 million people that we believe are potential park
guests, living within a three and a half hour trip, it's pretty compelling circumstance or opportunity for us and our
partners and probably will deserve an infusion of more capital investment because we think the returns are going to be
rather significant for us from this project.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Anything you can tell us on the buyback? Okay, thanks.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: On your question on the CapEx, so I want to, first of all, what Bob just talked about, what you
asked about is really a 2015 and 2016 event. It won't affect our capital expenditures in 2014. In fact, previously, what I
had told all of you was that we expected our CapEx in 2014 to be $1 billion higher than it was in 2013, and when
adjusted for the Shanghai partner's contribution, it would be $600 million higher. In fact, I want to update that. I think
our CapEx in 2014 will actually be $800 million higher, not $1 billion, and $400 million, not $600 million on an

adjusted basis, after the contribution from Shanghai.
And that simply has to do with the timing. Obviously, when you put a big project in place, you have all kinds of
planning and you map against how that money will be spent. It's slightly different. In fact, it's slower. It's a little bit
slower, which means that spending will be out in 2015 and 2016.

The next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citibank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Just a question for Mr. Rasulo. I think in the past you mentioned that for the total
CapEx outlays for Shanghai, you take them out of the investment activities and then you see an add back under the
financing side for the portion that is not yours. Are we already seeing those add-backs under the financing line of the
cash flow statement?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Yes, we are, Jason. Those are being added in. Look, they're not day per day obviously. We expend
the capital, and there's a process by which our partner reimburses the share of the spending, but it is lock step, it's not
delayed.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Okay, and that's just under Financing Other in the numbers that you give us...?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Yes. Yes, that's correct, Jason. Thank you.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question please.

The next question comes from David Miller with Topeka Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - David W. Miller>: Yeah. Hey, guys. Congratulations on the stellar results. Just another question on Shanghai.
Bob or Jay, just correct me if I'm wrong. I remember maybe five years ago, four years ago, five years ago or so, when
Hong Kong opened, kind of the core criticism, if you will, against the park at the time was just that it was too small.
And indeed, I think crowds just sort of overwhelmed that property for the first six or nine months or so. Is the residue
left over from that memory part of the reason why you guys accelerated this investment in Shanghai because you just
want to be sure that it's not too small? Or what led to this specifically? Was there another market study done or another
sort of demographic study done to maybe determine that the eligible patrons, as you alluded to, will get into the park
quicker? If you could just answer that, I'd appreciate it. Thanks very much.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: We've learned a lot from Hong Kong. Actually, the problem that we had was a good problem to
have, in that demand was greater than we had expected initially. This is a different circumstance in many respects, but
it doesn't mean that some of the learnings that we gleaned from Hong Kong can't be applied. And we are doing that and
have every reason to believe we're going to continue to do that.
So I guess that's a way of my saying that we have – as we have looked at this market, since we made the decision to
build, since we broke ground and we've seen further development, more development than we expected, we clearly are
reacting to what we believe will be greater demand than we initially anticipated for the park in its first year of operation
or its early years of operation. And we want to make sure that we build enough capacity to meet that demand.

There are other things we're going to resort to, to manage expectations in terms of visitation. For instance, it's likely
that when we go to the market selling tickets, there will be tickets that have date specific – that are date-specific tickets,
so that we can manage, in effect, traffic or visitation much more carefully than you would if you just sold tickets and
didn't have a date and had no idea when the people who bought the tickets were going to show up.
So we're going to apply a number of things that we've learned over the years both from Hong Kong and other parks in
what we build, how much we build, and how we operate.

<A - Lowell Singer>: Thanks, David. Operator, we have time for one more question.

Okay. And the last question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. One on the DISH personal subscription over the top
service. What is – how important is it to you that they reach the critical mass needed for that service to take off, and is
it a situation where the ball is really in their court to go out and get partners? Is it something that you can actively
support in some way and bring other content companies on board? And are you looking at a similar service with any of
your other distribution partners? And then I have one on parks. Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: It's DISH's responsibility to get critical mass from a program perspective. I saw Charlie Ergen
last week, and he's doing just that. I'm not going to give you an update on how he's doing, but it's their responsibility.
We don't intend to participate in that pursuit at all. We'd like to see this product rolled into the marketplace because we
think it's a smart thing for us to do, something that we should certainly try. Is it critical? No. But it's certainly critical
that he gets critical mass from a programmer's perspective in order to bring it to market.
The second part of your question...?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Second part on DISH.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: On DISH was?
<Q - Michael Morris>: Other distribution partners. Whether you're -?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Are we going to sell it to others?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, yes. We're open to selling it to others, but we have not engaged in any of
those discussions yet.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Okay, great. And then at parks, Comcast is committed to investing in both the park and the
resorts, the hotels down in Orlando. And I'm curious, what have you seen in the past when competitors have invested
locally? Is it a drag, or does it actually generate more traffic in the region? How does that usually shake out? Thanks?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: What we've typically seen is it drives more traffic to the region. Basically business goes up in
Orlando or Central Florida. And so we don't necessarily view it as negative for us, because it drives more people to the
area.
And we not only have great product, but we have new product, too. Fantasyland is the most recent example of that.
We're developing Avatar for that park, looking at a variety of other things to add in Orlando. Opening up a hotel, Four
Seasons is opening up this summer as a for instance.
So there will plenty more that we put into the marketplace that will take advantage of any growth the marketplace has.
