Now I'll turn the call over to George.
George A. Scangos
Okay, thanks, Claudine. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Biogen Idec had an excellent start
to 2014, with successful milestone accomplishments and solid financial performance. We secured approval for
TECFIDERA for the EU, launched in Germany, some other countries. ALPROLIX was approved for hemophilia B in
the U.S. and Canada. We continued to move two of our late-stage pipeline candidates, ELOCTATE for hemophilia A
and PLEGRIDY for MS through the registration processes toward anticipated approvals this year. We strengthened our
pipeline through new collaborations with Eisai and Sangamo in areas that fit within our strategic therapeutic focus. And
our first quarter financial performance reflected 51% growth in revenues and 25% growth in non-GAAP EPS
year-over-year.
So this month marks the one-year anniversary of the U.S. introduction of TECFIDERA. Its induction has dramatically
shifted the U.S. market for MS therapies. We've seen an expansion of the MS market and, within that, TECFIDERA is
the number-one oral MS therapy in the U.S., achieving over $1 billion in revenue during the first year of launch. We
launched TECFIDERA in initial European countries beginning in February and already there appears to be broad
interest among physicians and patients. Based on the continued strong demand in the U.S. and the encouraging early
signs in the EU, we believe that TECFIDERA's attractive product profile positions it well for the long run.
The approval and anticipated launch of ALPROLIX marks an important milestone for our company as we expand into
the hemophilia market. ALPROLIX is the first hemophilia B therapy to reduce bleeding episodes, with prophylactic
infusions at least a week apart. We believe that this therapy has the potential to change the standard of care in
hemophilia and significantly improve patients' lives. As we've done for so many years in multiple sclerosis, our goal is
to bring a diligent patient-centric approach to addressing the hemophilia community. Our keen focus on patients
permeates everything that we do, from our direct interactions with patients to our assistance programs to our continuing
R&D efforts. We remain focused on making decisions that are right for patients.
Last month the FDA extended the PDUFA date of PLEGRIDY, our subcutaneous peg interferon beta-1a candidate for
relapsing forms of MS, to allow additional time for review of the application. While obviously not the news we were
hoping to hear, a three-month PDUFA extension is not uncommon, particularly for applications involving MS
therapies. We look forward to the potential launch of PLEGRIDY in the second half of the year.
We've continued to make strides to expand our global presence beyond Europe and the U.S. In Japan, we obtained
marketing approval for TYSABRI and have filed a marketing application for ELOCTATE. Japan is the second-largest
pharmaceutical market in the world, with attractive dynamics, and it is an important long-term priority for the
company. So in summary, I think we're off to a great start for 2014.
And I'll turn the call over to Doug.
Douglas E. Williams
Thanks, George. We're excited about the approval of ALPROLIX. ALPROLIX is a recombinant DNA-derived
long-acting coagulation factor IX concentrate indicated in the U.S. for both adults and children with hemophilia B. In
the U.S., ALPROLIX is indicated for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes, perioperative management and
routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes. Starting dosing regimens for prophylaxis

are 50 international units per kilogram once weekly or 100 IUs per kilogram once every 10 days. Dosing can be
adjusted based on individual response. The safety and tolerability information, including in the U.S. label, is consistent
with data from the Phase III studies. The most common adverse reaction observed were headache and oral paresthesia.
In summary, we're pleased to have obtained what we believe is an attractive and differentiating product label for
ALPROLIX.
Earlier this month, we, along with our partner Sobi, announced top-line results from the ELOCTATE Kids A-LONG
Phase III study in pediatric patients with hemophilia A. These data demonstrated that twice-weekly prophylactic dosing
with ELOCTATE maintained low bleeding rates in children. We believe these results support the potential for
ELOCTATE to address a significant need for children with hemophilia A by providing prolonged intervals between
scheduled prophylactic infusions to protect against bleeding episodes.
The tolerability, safety and relative half-life were consistent with those with those observed in previous clinical studies,
and no inhibitors were detected. These data support applications for pediatric indications globally and are a necessary
step to obtaining marketing authorization in Europe. The ALPROLIX Kids B-LONG study remains ongoing, with data
expected in the first half of 2015.
Transitioning to our neurology programs, we continue to generate new data to support our products and better
understand our pipeline candidates. At next week's American Academy of Neurology Meeting, we'll be presenting
important new data for several of our programs. Specifically, we'll present TECFIDERA data that demonstrates strong
efficacy in various patient subgroups, including those with more active disease. Results from the TECFIDERA Manage
Study show that G.I. symptoms experienced by some patients are often transient in nature.
For PLEGRIDY, we'll present post-hoc from year one of the ADVANCE study demonstrating a higher proportion of
patients taking PLEGRIDY achieved freedom from measured disease activity. We'll also present final two-year data
providing further support for this product candidate's efficacy and safety profile. Finally, new TYSABRI data
demonstrate its efficacy benefits in patients switching to TYSABRI versus maintaining the use of alternative therapies.
This quarter we also completed a number of transactions that provide Biogen Idec with access to promising new
clinical candidates. Our collaboration with Sangamo BioSciences is focused on an innovative gene editing technology
with the potential to treat sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. Our agreement with Eisai expands our efforts to
develop disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease. In recent years, meaningful advances have increased our
understanding in both trial design and target selection for Alzheimer's disease. The optimal therapeutic approach for
AD remains uncertain and we believe it's prudent to evaluate multiple therapeutic methods for treating the disease.
For the Eisai transaction, we've gained access to two mid-stage clinical candidates for AD: a small molecule BACE1
inhibitor and a monoclonal antibody targeting beta amyloid. Combined with BIIB37 and our anti-tau program in
pre-clinical testing, we now have four potential Alzheimer's disease candidates with three different mechanisms.
Looking forward, we also anticipate data from several clinical studies, including the Phase III daclizumab HYP
DECIDE study in relapsing MS patients. Rather than a placebo-controlled study design, the DECIDE study sets a
higher standard with a compelling two-year to three-year head-to-head design versus interferon beta treatment. Primary
endpoint is the reduction in annualized relapse rate. We remain on track for obtaining DECIDE data around the middle
of this year.
I'll now pass the call over to Tony.
Stuart Anthony Kingsley
Thanks, Doug. During the quarter, we continued to grow total MS patient share across our franchise. Starting with
TECFIDERA, performance in the U.S. remains strong and the global introduction is underway. After one year on the
market, over 65,000 patients have been treated with TECFIDERA globally.

In the U.S., we continue to be pleased with how broadly neurologists have adopted TECFIDERA. As of Q1,
approximately 7,000 physicians have written TECFIDERA in the U.S. And we're also encouraged by deeper usage
among writers, as approximately 75% of all TECFIDERA prescribers have written multiple prescriptions. According to
our market research, TECFIDERA is the leading therapy for newly-diagnosed MS patients. One year into the U.S.
launch, we believe TECFIDERA is continuing to stimulate higher switch rates. While we anticipate the patient start
and switch dynamics in the U.S. market to remain strong, we continue to believe that the overall market growth rates
will moderate toward historical levels during 2014.
Outside of the U.S., we believe TECFIDERA is also performing well in other launch markets. In both Canada and
Australia, our market research suggests that TECFIDERA uptake has outpaced other orals on the market when
comparing the initial months of launch. And in Germany, we're encouraged by the early signs.
In addition to driving strong execution on promotion and education, we're actively engaging with reimbursement
authorities across multiple markets. Australia gained full reimbursement in December and we expect to gain
government reimbursement in Canada later this year. In Europe, we have secured full reimbursement in Norway and
Scotland. Our local market access teams are executing well and we continue to expect a series of reimbursement
decisions across European markets in the latter half of the year.
AVONEX continued to perform well globally the in first quarter. In the U.S., as the injectable class continues to
decline, the demand for AVONEX is softening, as we anticipated. But within the injectable class, we believe
AVONEX is emerging as the interferon of choice.
Outside the U.S., we are maintaining strong AVONEX promotional efforts in advance of the anticipated TECFIDERA
launches and we remain committed to maintaining strong relative position for AVONEX among the platform therapies
as that segment of the market declines. We continue to believe that convenience remains the key differentiator for this
segment.
Moving on to TYSABRI. In the U.S., demand for TYSABRI remains solid as physicians continue to choose this
therapy for patients requiring higher efficacy treatment. We're also encouraged by a recent uptick in patient retention
rates. Importantly, in patients who have discontinued TYSABRI, approximately 70% have stayed within our franchise
during the first quarter. In Europe, we believe that as TECFIDERA is launched across individual markets, TYSABRI
may experience similar dynamics that we saw in the U.S. Overall, we continue to believe in TYSABRI as a leader in
the high efficacy segment.
Now turning to our new hemophilia business. We're currently in launch mode for ALPROLIX in the U.S. and
anticipate having patients on commercial therapy starting in early May. Based on NHF guidelines, traditional
hemophilia B therapy requires prophylactic infusions two or more times a week. Given the clarity of our label, we
believe our value is very clear for the majority of patients. 50 international units per kilogram will cover a patient for a
week or 100 IUs per kilogram starting every ten days and adjusting the dosing based on individual response. Our
market research suggests that reducing infusion frequency is the largest unmet need for this community and we expect
ALPROLIX will directly address this burden.
With the approval of ALPROLIX in the U.S., we are focused on two immediate objectives. First, to initiate
comprehensive education to physicians, payers and advocacy groups. And, second, to facilitate access to patients
starting on ALPROLIX. Our commercial team is actively establishing contracts with specialty pharmacies, finalizing
the supply chain and establishing the financial and patient support programs which we believe will enable a smooth
launch. We believe that patients and physicians are anticipating the entry of long-acting therapies to the market and we
are excited to be first.
Our commitment is to transform the care of people with hemophilia and facilitate expanded use of prophylactic
treatment. A successful launch will require extensive promotional and educational efforts and our commercial
organization is executing on this strategy. Our goal is to become market leaders in the mid to long term and we believe
in the product and our ability to execute. Overall, I'm very pleased with the performance of the commercial
organization; across an expanding portfolio of therapies we are demonstrating strong execution and good results.

Paul J. Clancy
Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.02 in the first quarter and our non-GAAP diluted
earnings per share were $2.47. Before we walk through the P&L, there are a number of items to remember with respect
to the year-over-year comparisons. These include the TYSABRI asset purchase, which impacted revenue and COGS,
the RITUXAN arbitration charge in Q1 of last year and an unusually low effective tax rate from Q1 2013. Also this
quarter, our results were impacted by $118 million R&D expense related to our Eisai transaction, as Doug reviewed.
This agreement impacted EPS in the quarter by approximately $0.35.
Now walking down the P&L, I'll start with revenues. Total revenue for the first quarter grew to approximately $2.1
billion. First quarter AVONEX worldwide revenue was $761 million. In the U.S., Q1 AVONEX revenue decreased 3%
to $476 million, and outside the U.S., Q1 AVONEX revenue was $285 million. TYSABRI worldwide revenue net of
hedging was $441 million in the first quarter. These results were comprised of $234 million in the U.S. and $207
million internationally.
Global TECFIDERA revenue was $506 million in Q1. U.S. TECFIDERA was $460 million. We ended the quarter with
approximately five weeks of inventory in the channel, which includes specialty pharmacies and wholesalers. We
estimate that U.S. TECFIDERA revenue includes an incremental inventory build of approximately $45 million versus
the end of last year. International TECFIDERA revenue was $46 million in the first quarter, with Germany being the
primary contributor. We estimate approximately $10 million to $15 million of Germany sales in Q1 were related to
inventory build.
Turning to our anti-CD20 franchise, RITUXAN and Gazyva U.S. profit share was $275 million for Q1. Royalties and
profit sharing sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $22 million. The result was $297 million of net revenue from
unconsolidated joint business.
Now turning to the expense lines of the non-GAAP P&L. Q1 non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $279 million, or 13%
of revenue. The increase year-over-year was primarily driven by TYSABRI contingent payments and royalties. Q1
non-GAAP R&D expense was $527 million, or 25% of revenue. The increase year-over-year was primarily driven by
our recently announced agreement with Eisai, where we recorded a $118 million R&D charge. This amount consisted
of a $100 million upfront payment and $18 million reflecting the value of options for certain programs and geographic
rights.
Q1 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $509 million, or 24% of revenue. We continue to make significant investments
associated with TECFIDERA in the upcoming hemophilia launches. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately
27%. Weighted average diluted shares were 238 million and we ended the quarter with almost $2 billion in cash and
marketable securities, of which approximately 70% is within the United States. This brings to us our non-GAAP
diluted earnings per share, which were $2.47 for the quarter, an increase of 25%.
Now turning to our updated full year 2014 guidance. We now expect total revenue growth between 26% and 28%, an
increase from prior guidance owing to AVONEX and TYSABRI buoyancy compared to our prior expectations. Our
2014 guidance continues to exclude the impact of a settlement with AIFA, as the timing of the final approval of this
agreement remains uncertain.
R&D expense is expected to be between 20% and 22% of sales, unchanged from prior guidance. Our full-year R&D
forecast continues to earmark approximately $200 million for new early-stage business development opportunities, of
which the Eisai transaction is included in in this amount. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 22% to 23%
of total revenue, also unchanged. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $11.35 and $11.45 and
GAAP EPS to be between $9.85 and $9.95.

George A. Scangos
Thank you, Paul. So in closing, we're off to a strong start for the year. And looking forward, we have several crucial
milestones and activities that require our intense focus. First, expanding TECFIDERA into new markets as we seek to
serve more patients with MS. We're launching three additional products, ALPROLIX for hemophilia B and other
potential launches this year, including ELOCTATE for hemophilia A and PLEGRIDY for relapsing MS.
We're advancing the next wave of new potential medicines. In the coming 12 months to 18 months, we anticipate a
number of data readouts, including Phase III results for daclizumab HYP in relapsing MS and for TYSABRI in SPMS,
as well as early and mid-stage data for a number of compounds in the pipeline, including LINGO, and continuing to
focus on innovation. We believe that Biogen Idec scientific acumen, robust pipeline programs gives us the opportunity
to not only expand our leadership position in MS, but also contribute to new treatment options for patients with other
serious diseases.
These activities are at the very core of our mission and require determination and perseverance. We believe that our
team is ready to meet these objectives and we look forward to providing updates on our progress throughout the year.
I'd like to thank the patients and physicians who are involved in our clinical development program and our employees
who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives and all of you for joining us this morning.
So, operator, we can now open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Hi. Thank you. Good morning, guys. Congrats on the progress, especially TECFIDERA's
launch. It's obviously not a Sovaldi launch, but it's okay.
My question regards biomarkers in MS, can you just remind us of the work you've done or are doing to look at the
potential of biomarkers to predict response rates or treatment selection in MS patients? And specifically on LINGO, is
there any clinical data historic or ongoing to support the hypothesis that LINGO expression or activation is increased in
MS patients?
And perhaps just a very quick follow on on the hemophilia. How should we think about gross to net revenues? Thank
you.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: Okay, Ravi, this is Doug. I'll take the first two and then let either Tony or Paul handle the
gross to net question. So, biomarkers, obviously, that's a very important part of the ongoing research activities here.
There's really two major questions that we're trying to approach with the biomarker activity that's part of our clinical
trial program. One is really trying to characterize patients who have either a more or lesser in terms of aggressiveness
disease course, to really try to match them up with certain therapies that may have greater activity and a higher level of
disease activity. So, for instance, a TYSABRI-like molecule in patients with more aggressive disease.
So we're looking at things like RNA profiling. We're looking at all the laboratory tests that are collected in these
patients. We're looking at MRI activity, clinical relapses, EDSS progression and really looking across those data sets to
try to see whether or not there's a signature. And that signature can be one or more of those parameters that I just
named that correlate with a greater level of disease activity. That information at the time of diagnosis may help
physicians choose the appropriate therapy for their patients at the time of diagnosis.
The sort of bigger question we're trying to get at with respect to our own portfolio of drugs is can, in fact, we use
similar types of algorithms to predict patients who will have a greater or lesser response to our therapies or potentially

may experience a safety event that we want to steer them away from. So all of our studies have very extensive sampling
embedded in them now. That's true of our MS studies. It's actually true of all of our clinical studies now; probably not
unlike all of our compatriot companies out there as well.
And, again, the idea here is to try to match up the appropriate patient with the appropriate drug, either in terms of the
best response to therapy or steering them away from a potential safety event. A lot of work still to be done, but I think
there's progress being made and you can expect that we'll have data reading out over the course of the next months and
years that will be presented at major medical meetings to describe what we've been finding.
With respect to LINGO, a lot of the hypothesis around the use of LINGO is based on some data from several years
back that was based on autopsy specimens from patients with MS showing that in lesions there were, in fact,
pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes. So, the cells that are capable of remyelination are actually present in the lesions, but
they are blocked from maturing by one or more factors. LINGO is clearly one of them based on the experimental data
that we've accumulated.
I don't know that there is specific data in autopsy specimens that show an increased level of LINGO versus what's
present in sort of normal brain tissue, but it's clearly present. And if you think about what's happening, we've got
essentially a targeted delivery of the drug because of the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier in and around those
lesions.
So, where we're going to be able to reverse the inhibition of myelination and allow the maturation of those
oligodendrocyte precursor cells is specifically in the area where the blood-brain barrier has broken down. And you can
see this very clearly happening in the animal model, so our expectation is that that's what's going to happen in the
human situation as well, the targeted delivery of the anti-LINGO molecule releasing the block on myelination and
hopefully a sufficient level of remyelination taking place to show clinical benefit in these patients.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: And, Ravi, on your question about channel discount, look, at steady state, our
research suggests that the gross to net in the hemophilia space tend to run higher, probably meaningfully higher, than
what we're used to seeing in MS. There's really two big pieces to that. One is the channel; so you have specialty
pharmacy, specialty distributors and home health. The second is there's a meaningful portion of the patients that go
through 340B designated hemophilia treatment centers. We're going to have to see how that evolves. It will depend a
lot on the mix of the patients and I just think we'll have to look over the next handful of quarters. I think mix will be a
big driver.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hey, thanks. Congratulations on a good quarter. You just launched TECFIDERA in Europe.
I'm just trying to understand based on your feedback so far or your research whether you think there's different demand
dynamics in the three different pools: newly-diagnosed versus switchers versus the quitter pool versus say the U.S. And
are there differences there that we should consider, obviously other than price versus the U.S.?
And just as a follow up to that, you've mentioned now multiple times in slides and your 10-K about BIIP61. So as I
think about the trajectory and longevity of your oral franchise that you're working on, can you say anything about that
drug as to whether it's remyelinating or anything about BIIB61? That would keep me out of suspense. Thanks.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Okay. Thanks, Michael. It's Tony. So, on Europe, I think we've said before, continue
to believe in the product, looking forward to launching it. We highlighted a couple of differences in general in Europe,
which were third oral to market, the other orals that may have more traction, perhaps less clear anticipation by the
community given the uncertainty and the regulatory delays. What we said before is that's going to take hard work.
We're working hard.

If I look at Germany, we're getting great execution. We're getting reach and frequency, we're getting access to
customers and we're seeing interest and we're getting patients on therapy. So we're encouraged by the signs in
Germany. In terms of talking about the trajectory and the mix across pools, it's a probably a little early to make that
call. As I think you know, in Germany the data is more lagged from an IMS basis. We're looking at shipments and
various things like that. So, probably a little early to make a more specific mix of pools. But I think the message is
getting access to customers and seeing interest and encouraged by the early signs.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: And BIIB61, yes, that is an oral remyelinating drug. In much the same way disease
modifying therapies are moving towards an oral platform approach, we see the same thing happening in the
remyelinating space. So as LINGO is the biologic and is the first generation of what we hope will be a successful
remyelination franchise, BIIB61 is working through a different mechanism which we're not prepared to disclose at this
point, but does very much the same thing that LINGO does in the experimental model. So we're quite excited about
initiating the clinical program with that molecule.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I really appreciate it. Couple questions.
One maybe for Paul. Hey, Paul, I just thought I'd take this opportunity – so you guys choose to include these upfront
R&D payments in your non-GAAP EPS numbers. A couple of other companies out there don't do that. I'm just
wondering why – it creates volatility in a quarter like this. So that's an old school CFO question. So, I appreciate it.
And then also, if there are any BG-12 contingent payments that were made in the quarter, would it be possible for you
to tell us?
And then for Doug, how does the BACE inhibitor from Eisai differ from Merck or AZ's drug, which I think are already
in Phase III? So you guys are pretty far behind, I guess, and I'm just wondering why you think you've still got a shot at
being competitive? Thank you.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: I'll start, Mark. The delineation we generally make is purchase accounting items are in our
GAAP P&L and not our non-GAAP P&L, so that has been our practice. And essentially what we view as these
upfronts and milestones are part and parcel to the business. They come in lumps, as we saw in this quarter, as we've
seen in past quarters, but it's essentially part and parcel to the business. But we do make that one delineation.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: And the BG-12 contingent?
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: The question on the BG-12 contingent, Mark, was what again?
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Oh, sorry. Did you make a cash payment to Fumaderm in the quarter?
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: We did. It was a cash payment that was earned in the fourth quarter and paid out technically in
the first quarter of 2014.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Do you have the amount? And then I'll stop.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Gosh, off the top of my head...

perspective, with the caveat that there's still a ways to go on development to really understand that completely.
I would say the same thing is true with both the Merck compound and AZ compound. Nobody has actually gotten there
yet, so the opportunity is still very much there. We like the profile of the compound. We also like the ability
potentially, if the compound is successful in the clinic, to start thinking about combinations between the BACE
inhibitor and one or both of our anti-beta amyloid antibodies or potentially the anti-tau antibody. So, we're looking at
this from sort of a portfolio approach in addition to just the individual compound, which we like the profile as we saw
it.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<A - George A. Scangos>: Operator, why don't we move to the next one?
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Hello?
<A - George A. Scangos>: Eric, you're on.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Sorry, I think I was muted. Maybe for Paul, I was a bit surprised that AVONEX – sorry, let
me start with Tony. A bit surprised that AVONEX is doing so well within the interferon class. What do you subscribe
that to? Is there some kind of a beneficial franchise effect going on there with TECFIDERA? And then for Paul, was
there also an R&D upfront to Sangamo in the quarter?
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Very good question, Eric. So, I think the short answer is yes. I think TECFIDERA
has probably taken disproportionately from the high-dose high-frequency interferon relative to AVONEX. I think that
makes sense when you take into account those tend to be more switch to products relative to AVONEX. So if
TECFIDERA gets in front of that switch, I think you're seeing a positive benefit. But I would add with increased focus
and promotion, we think we're putting some very good effort and see the continuation of that story behind AVONEX.
So a little of each. Thanks.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: And, Eric, there was a Sangamo payment in the first quarter, that was for $20 million, upfront
payment. That was actually in our original press release with Sangamo. The Eisai was actually, if you recall, the
financial terms weren't disclosed until today just because of the partnership at the time.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Just a follow up on just, first of all, the Eisai deal. Paul, could you confirm whether, if
the products are successful, you will report the revenue or whether that will simply be a profit sharing that reports
below the line? And then further, to the $200 million that you allowed for BD activity, with what you've spent in the
first quarter, should we assume that there's only $50 million to $80 million left for the balance of the year?
And then lastly, with your step-up in your revenue guidance and keeping the expense guidance the same, it certainly
implies that your expenses will be higher than you'd previously anticipated. Is that the right way to look at it? And
should we be expecting this higher level of SG&A spend to be the baseline going forward? Thanks.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Yeah, okay. All good questions. With respect to the first part of the question, Geoff, Eisai
essentially is about $118 million of the $200 million earmarked. And so what is the balance is exactly as you noted.
And we obviously had an eye towards the Eisai deal when we set up the original guidance. We actually continue to
work on business development transactions. But, I mean, quite frankly, the pipeline was far more advanced right before

the Eisai transaction than it is right now. So, I think that is much closer than to an earmark. I don't know if it will be
$100 million or $60 million or $80 million, but we'll update people along the way as we go.
The Eisai transaction is essentially a 50/50 split, with the exception of certain geographies that are really dependent on
Eisai, and specifically a Japan geography, of whether or not they want to bring that into the collaboration or not. And
50/50 from a perspective of development, 50/50 with the respect from a commercialization and 50/50 in terms of
profits, assuming the products – one or two of the products get to market. We haven't yet determined who would be
taking the lead on different geographies, and I think at this point in time, that would probably guide our revenue model.
So it's a little bit early to tell how the geography lands in the P&L, but it is in essence a 50/50.
And then your last part of the question, yeah, I think you're right that implicit is a little bit of increase that's probably in
the $30 million, $40 million, $50 million range for SG&A spending. We have consciously, over the last 12 months and
this year, we've consciously made the decision on SG&A spending not to be pennywise and pound foolish. We're kind
of at an unprecedented period of time in what we've gone through in 2013 in launching TECFIDERA in the U.S. We're
very excited to be launching TECFIDERA in Europe after a lot of hard work in the back end of the year. And same
thing on hemophilia.
So I think that what we're doing right now is making sure that we really appropriately fund these launches. And as we
move into 2015, we'll take a much more critical eye toward really trying to get SG&A leverage. We've talked about I
can really exactly tell you the amounts at this point, but we're going to be taking a much more critical eye. So I think
we pivot mentally from really thinking hard about making sure we fund these critical launches to kind of pivoting
towards looking to make sure we're actually making sure we're not overfunding and over expensing on any items in the
P&L.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Great. Thanks very much for taking the question and congrats on the progress. Tony, you
mentioned the five weeks of inventory for TECFIDERA. We understand that weekly demand is still growing, but are
we getting to the point in the launch in the U.S. where we need to think about normalization of that inventory as we
think ahead to second quarter and second half of the year?
And then also, you guys have recently commented on the pricing approach for ALPROLIX, which on the net basis
looks to be about parity. Just wondering if we should assume that you'll adopt the same philosophy with ELOCTATE
well? Thanks.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Matt, this is Paul. I'll take the first part of that. I think that's overall correct, is that we probably
will likely see not as much increase in terms of inventory in the channel. We keep a watchful eye on that. We are a bit
of a player in that, but what's most important is to make sure the specialty pharmacies have product for the patients and
the wholesalers don't have any kind of excessive product. So I think if you just look at the run rate, I think there may be
a little bit of upward inventory over the next few quarters; I think it certainly moderates in terms of the impact.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Thanks. On the ALPROLIX pricing, as you know, the math can get complicated.
But I think your read of the basic intent is right. No comment at this point on how that might translate to others, TBD.

are coming on today and how is that compared to when you launched?
And then a question for Doug. I know it's tough on the LINGO opportunity to say specifically. I don't know if there's a
lot of data out there, but how does a compromised blood-brain barrier correlated to disease severity or progression or,
say, progression or relapse frequency, things like that, to try to correlate that outcome to a clinical benefit or
worsening?
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: So, thanks. Yeah, Tony. Look, I think the interesting thing is there's not a dramatic
change in the profile and it speaks a little bit more to the start the product got off to. As I think we pointed out early
days, we got a meaningful portion of newly diagnosed pretty much out of the gate and captured a nice portion of the
switch pool. At a broad level, I think those dynamics are still true today. There's probably a little shift in the switch
pool in terms of the nature of what patients were getting, what reasons between tolerability and efficacy. But it's
actually a little bit more of the same.
The only other wrinkle I'd add to it, which is interesting, is we think TECFIDERA is keeping people from leaving the
market. The market as a group of people that quit therapy every year and a group of people that return, what our
research suggests is that there are fewer patients – there are patients who might have quit the market absent this
alternative who are staying in the market. And I think that's encouraging.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: And as far as, Geoff, the LINGO question and the relationship with the blood-brain
barrier, what happens when there's a new lesion that develops, a relapse, if you will, is that you get local breakdown of
the blood-brain barrier. That's because of the release of all the inflammatory mediators that takes place locally. The
point I was alluding to is that, because of that localized impact on the blood-brain barrier, you're going to get a
relatively higher concentration of the drug in those lesions at the time the barrier breaks down, which is not to say that
you're not going to get drug to other older lesions. That should happen as well.
And, in fact, the Phase I data confirms that we are getting sufficient quantity of drug to match the sort of IC90 level in
the animal models in patients with MS in their cerebral spinal fluid. We're getting drug into the brain in quantities that
sort of match up with what we saw to be efficacious in the animal models. But on a relative basis, just because of the
physiology of the blood-brain barrier with a new lesion, you'll get relatively more delivered locally to a new lesion.

Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Thanks for taking the questions. First on the top-line raise, I was wondering if you can give
us any more color on the drivers there, if that's solely TECFIDERA or anything else you're seeing?
And then a kind of follow-up question to Eric's on AVONEX resiliency in the U.S. Is there anything different on the
European side that we should consider as we think about that franchise and its resiliency in Europe? Thank you.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Tony and Paul will tag team. This is Paul. The color on the raise that I give you – and this is
versus our expectations in our kind of original guidance, is around the buoyancy in AVONEX and TYSABRI. So, it
isn't per se that we see a different forecast on TECFIDERA. I think the U.S. and TECFIDERA is kind of marching
along our expectations and we're really five weeks or six weeks into Europe in Germany. So a little early to call for that
on TECFIDERA. But what we have seen just one quarter in is just AVONEX and TYSABRI not being as impacted as
much in the last 90 days, 120 days.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: So on AVONEX, the answer actually differs market by market. It depends on – there
are some markets where we have higher AVONEX share or where the high-dose high-frequency interferons have lower
share, et cetera. So, I think it's going to be the sum, as Europe is a bunch of different parts.
We believe, similar to the U.S., that AVONEX should do as well or better on a proportional basis as the injectables
portion of the market declines. Again, that will differ market by market, on average that remains our belief. And we'll
have to see as TECFIDERA rolls out across market to market what the individual impacts are.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is
open.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Everybody, thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones for me. So, one, on
TECFIDERA in Europe, you told us you've gotten reimbursement in Norway and Scotland and that you expect
reimbursement in a bunch of other geographies. I was wondering if you might be willing to help us think about what
those geographies are.
And then, second, on TYSABRI, sequential growth in the U.S. looks, by from when I looked over the last couple years,
what you saw in this quarter was actually the second worst, and the first worst was sort of when TECFIDERA
launched. So I'm just wondering if you can help us think about what was going on there and was it
TECFIDERA-driven or something else? Thanks.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Okay, Matthew. It's Tony. Thanks. We haven't laid out a very specific schedule of
what sequence we think the countries will get reimbursement. As you know, it's multiple independent events. We've
said that a lot of these markets it's a kind of 12-month to 18-month timeframe. The generalization is the Northern
European markets tend – you'd move on a little faster pace, Southern European markets tend to move on a little slower
pace. But there's some – we think toward the end of the year and around the turn of the year we'll start to see some
meaningful reimbursement decisions if you look at where each of the national reimbursement processes typically goes
on a timeline.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Matt, this is Paul on the TYSABRI question. Thanks for the question. I would want to point out
there's a little bit of noise in the last five quarters that you kind of see even on the graph in the earnings slide deck. And
what I'd point out is in Q1 and Q2 of last year, there was inventory movement that arose out of the transaction. So Q1
actually kind of moved revenue up by about $25 million or $26 million. And as a result, Q2 was depressed by that
amount in the United States. I believe it's in one of the footnotes.
And then as it relates to Q1 2014, one thing I would point out is that just the uniqueness of the way we ship TYSABRI,
Q1 2014 actually had 12 shipping weeks versus all the prior quarters last year had 13 shipping weeks. And it just is a
function of we essentially ship on Tuesdays, it's essentially a function of the number of Tuesdays in a quarter so it's
quite peculiar.
Now, if you rise above all that, when we look at our patient data, when we look at our discontinuations, when we look
at our patient adds, we're actually – we still believe there's a fair amount of homework to get TYSABRI moving in the
right direction, but we believe those metrics are moving in the right direction. Discontinuations were meaningfully
impacted through the second and third quarter last year, as patients, many patients moved to TECFIDERA. But we're
seeing discontinuations come back to a more normal level and we're seeing actually patient adds coming into the
TYSABRI franchise that is a solid performance. Thanks for the question.

<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: I've got a couple of quick questions. One, Tony, just housekeeping. We're hearing that the
TECFIDERA dropout due to the typical G.I. is around 15% to 20%. I think it was around 10% initially; it sounds like it
went up a little bit. Is that what you're seeing?
And then, secondly, for – I don't know if it's for Doug or for Al, but it's a question on LINGO. When you're looking at
your primary end point, whether it's optic neuritis, the full-field visual evoked potential, or in MS, where you're using
this neurofunctional, neurocognitive decline or stability in three or more months, my question is how validated sort of

are these end points in terms of your ability to adequately power against the control arm? Just help me understand a
little bit how validated have you been in other studies just so we really understand kind of what to expect. Thank you.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Thanks, Yaron. It's Tony. So short answer to your question, I don't think we have
any strong signal that GI is moving up or down. We're obviously monitoring that on regular basis through a whole
bunch of different data sources. No signal that there's a meaningful trend in one direction of the other.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: And, Yaron, with respect to the end points, I think the end points that we've chosen to use
are well validated end points. Certainly not only visual evoked potential, it gives you a hard number in terms of nerve
conduction velocity but also the low-contrast visual acuity end point in that study is one that's been used for other drugs
for registrational purposes. So the end points I believe are hard.
I don't think we've released the power calculations, but suffice it to say that these studies are large enough and well
powered enough for us to feel comfortable about whether or not we would make a go/no-go decision based on the data
that comes out. I should also point out that the other end point in the MS study is ESS progression as well. So we're
looking at well validated, tried and true end points in these studies on the basis of which to make our decision to go to
Phase III.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question and congrats on the continued strong
execution on TECFIDERA. On the Alzheimer's front, you're looking primarily at imaging end points with 037 and
clinical end points with 2401. So I'm wondering, how do you put all that information together to determine which
antibody to move forward with and what population you might proceed? And then real quick, wondering if you're
expecting any shifts in U.S. reimbursement dynamics in the MS space given some of the concerns out there on pricing
on other specialty drug classes? Thanks.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: You know, with respect to the two different antibodies and Alzheimer's disease, you're
correct that there's a cognition, a straight cognition end point with the Eisai molecule. We've also built that in as
exploratory end points in the BIIB37 study. So the primary end point of the study is based on imaging, as you point out.
But we've also built in FDG PET as sort of a surrogate for improvement in synaptic activity. We consider that to be sort
of a surrogate clinical end point, but we're looking at cognition and we hope to see a trend in cognition in that study as
well. So there are a number of end points that will help drive the decision making with respect to BIIB37, including
both imaging and clinical end points as well.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Brian, this is Paul. On the second part of your question, I mean, no real additional color to
provide. I mean, certainly we're cognizant that it could be a challenging environment. In multiple sclerosis, the patient
mix is 80% private. At this point, we're very comfortable with our formulary status, so we'll just have to continue to see
where the landscape takes us.

<A - Douglas E. Williams>: With respect to LINGO, you're correct that there are some patients that do respond to
steroid therapy and show an improvement. The natural history studies that have been done looking at the kinetics of
that improvement were taken into account when we actually powered the study to hopefully see a treatment effect in
LINGO versus placebo. So remember this is a placebo-controlled trial that's randomized. It is on top of standard of
care. And so we took the natural history data into account when we designed the study, both in terms of duration and in
terms of the design of the end points.
<A - George A. Scangos>: Robyn, on the trial question on hemo, we're a little bit searching each other for that answer,
so I don't think we have it handy. But what I'd point out is a couple of things. It was only about 120 or 125 patients.
And, in fact, it was a worldwide trial and part of the rationale of the worldwide trial was the worldwide approval, but
also because we just needed to get to sites around the world in order to get to those patient numbers.
So fundamentally we don't believe the gating issue on launch is going to be the dynamic that you're poking at. I think
we just fundamentally believe that there's a big unmet need in the marketplace for longer-acting factors and that will
probably carry the weight.

Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions as well. First of all, we know that there's
a potential FDA could approve a generic version of Copaxone in May. I was wondering your thought on the impact on
the pricing for the whole MS therapy class?
And then, secondly, on your collaboration with Eisai here for the BACE inhibitor, it looks like there's encouraging
CSF, a better level lowering, which is also dose dependent. But then, how much faith do you have in that there's a
correlation between that and then the clinical end point in the trials, for example, the ADAS-Cog scores? Thank you.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Good. Thanks. This is Tony. I'll go first on generic Cop. We've said before, our
expectation and our business plan has assumed that there will be generic Cop in the market this year. Obviously, there
remains some uncertainty around that, but we planned for it. Short term we think the impact is on branded Copaxone in
itself. We've also said, look, it adds pressure to gross to net in the overall market over time because it becomes an
additional option that payers can use. But we think it's a very tough thing for payers to force a step edit or a switch to
generic.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: And with respect to the BACE inhibitor, as far as the target, itself, there is some pretty
strong genetic evidence that the enzyme itself is an important target in Alzheimer's disease. That's based on some recent
data from an Icelandic cohort showing that patients who had a specific mutation in and around the cleavage site where
the BACE1 enzyme clips, those patients had about a 40% reduction in the amount beta amyloid peptide that they
produced and that was completely protective for those patients if they had that mutation.
Even in the face of ApoE4, that was a protective mutation. So 40% seems to be the target, at least in terms of life-long
inhibition of the enzyme. The Eisai data from Phase 1 shows that you can dose escalate the compound and get to levels
of inhibition sort of north of 90% at safe doses. So we think that we have a compound that's capable of blocking the
enzyme at levels that are sufficient to be meaningful.
And with respect to the ADAS-Cog end point, it is an accepted end point for clinical trials and we think it's probably
the most sensitive and most validated measure to use for these studies. So the target's good, the end point is good and
appropriate and we'll wait to see the data.
