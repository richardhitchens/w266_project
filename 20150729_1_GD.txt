MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Quarter Two 2015 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call.
My name is Matthew, and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will
conduct a question-and-answer session toward the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this
call is being recorded for replay purposes.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed,
ma'am
Erin Linnihan
Thank you, Matthew, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter conference call.
As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These
estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the
company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.

Thank you, Erin, and good morning. Well, as you may have observed from our press release, we enjoyed a particularly
strong second quarter with revenue of $7.88 billion and net earnings of $752 million. We reported EPS of $2.27 per
diluted share, $0.39 ahead of earnings from continuing operations in the year-ago quarter. We were also $0.21 per share
better than consensus. Revenue of $7.88 billion is $408 million higher than the year-ago quarter. That represents
year-over-year revenue growth of 5.5%.
Earnings from continuing operations of $752 million is a $106 million higher on the strength of 13.7% operating
margins, a 100 basis point improvement over the year-ago quarter. I should note that our earnings include a modest
gain on the sale of our commercial Cyber product business in the IS&T segment. Excluding that gain, operating margin
would be 13.4% and EPS would be $2.22, still substantially better than all comparative quarters and consensus.
Sequentially, revenue is up $98 million or 1.3% and net earnings are up $36 million on a 50 basis point improvement in
operating margins.
Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2015 and compare it to the first half of 2014. Revenue is up 6.3%. Operating
earnings of $2.11 billion are up 15.6%. Net earnings from continuing operations are up over 18%. In short, we're off to
a very good start. Well ahead of our internal plan and ahead of external expectations. That leads quite naturally to the
guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide some additional color on that guidance shortly.
Let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and then the half, and then I'll conclude with
some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and tie that into our EPS guidance.
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a good quarter with revenue of $2.3 billion, $263 million higher than the year-ago
quarter and a $55 million improvement in operating earnings. Jet Aviation once again made a strong contribution with
double digit operating margins.
For the first half of 2015 compared to the first half of last year, Aerospace revenue was up $246 million or 6%,
operating earnings are up $82 million or 10.4%, on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in operating margins.
Let me spend a moment on the business aviation marketplace. There has been much speculation about it in the lot of
what I would call rumor intelligence or rumint. From an order perspective, Gulfstream enjoyed its best discreet second
quarter since the second quarter of 2008. The end result is an approximate $1 billion increase in the Aerospace group
funded backlog with Gulfstream as the primary reason.
The U.S. economy remains strong particularly compared to others in the world. So it should be no surprise that North
America dominated the order book in the quarter. The sales pipeline remains steady across all models. We see no
decline in the level of interest and a particularly encouraging return of S&P 500 companies as they seek to replenish
aging fleets. I should add that the first flight of the G500 occurred in the quarter and the test program is proceeding on
schedule.
Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a great quarter. Revenue is $1.41 billion, $57 million less than the second quarter
last year. However, a 110 basis point improvement in operating margins to 16.1% resulted in a modest increase in
operating earnings over the year-ago quarter. All-in-all, a very strong performance.
For the first half, revenue increased 1.8% against the first half of 2014. Operating earnings are up $71 million or 19.8%
resulting in 230 basis point margin expansion against the first half of last year. Pretty impressive.
Marine group revenue of $2 billion is higher than second quarter 2014 by $150 million or 8.1%. Operating earnings are
up $13 million or 7.5% against the year-ago quarter. Revenue was up nicely on a sequential basis and operating
earnings are constant on a 40 basis point reduction in margins.
For the first half, Marine group revenue of $3.94 billion is up $492 million against the first half of 2014. This is a very
strong 14.3% growth. Operating earnings are up $35 million, 10.3% on slightly lower margins. Margins were still a
very respectable 9.5% for the first half.
Marine Systems has been a compelling story for us and will continue to be so. We have a little work to do, however, on
margins in the second half.

You may recall that IS&T is the place where we expected a 5.5% contraction in revenue for the year. Well, fortunately,
we are doing materially better than that. Revenue of $2.2 billion is up $52 million or 2.4% against 2014 second quarter.
But the real story is operating earnings. They are up $49 million on a 200 basis point improvement operating margins
against the year-ago quarter. As I previously noted, the sale of our Cyber products business provided some profit in the
quarter. On a normalized basis, without that gain, margins would have been 9.7%, an increase of 100 basis points over
the year-ago quarter.
The story for the first half is much the same. Revenue was up $141 million or 3.2% and operating earnings are up $83
million over 22% on a 160 basis point improvement. Once again, on a normalized basis, operating margins would have
been 9.4%, a 110 basis point improvement over the first half of 2014. This is a very good news story, and as you're
going to hear in a moment, it will continue.
So let me provide some guidance for the year for each segment, compare this guidance to what we told you in January,
and then wrap it up into our EPS guidance.
For Aerospace, our guidance to you in January was to expect revenue of approximately $9.4 billion and operating
margins around 18%. We now believe revenue will be off by about $250 million to $300 million. On the other hand,
margins are expected to be about 18.5% for the year, resulting in about the same as the anticipated operating earnings.
The 18.5% margin guidance for the year implies some pressure on margins in the second half, due largely to mix shift,
increased R&D spending, building airplanes for use in the test program and a planned reduction in production at Jet
Aviation Basel. To that point, we are performing the engineering work at Basel necessary to induct a full complement
of airplanes into production in the first quarter of next year.
For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue similar to 2014 or about $5.7 billion with margins
around 15%. We continue to expect revenue consistent with prior guidance. Margins, however, will be in the 40 basis
point to 50 basis point higher range, resulting in higher than predicted operating earnings for the year.
In Marine Systems, we previously guided to revenue growth of 2.5% or approximately $7.5 billion and a margin rate in
the 9.5% range. We now expect revenue of approximately $7.8 billion, which translates to growth of 6.7% against last
year. Margin rates will be about 10 basis points better than previously forecast. The higher revenue and somewhat
better margins will once again result in higher operating earnings than earlier forecast. By the way, the operating
margin result will be driven by a double-digit fourth quarter.
For IS&T, we previously guided to a revenue decline of 5.5% or about $8.7 billion of revenue and a margin rate around
9%. It now appears that revenue will be between $9 billion to $9.1 billion and the margin rate should be about 70 basis
points better than guidance. Once again, this will result in higher than previously expected operating earnings for the
year.
In summary, all of this rolls into revenue for the year of $31.7 billion to $31.8 billion, an operating margin around 13%
and a return on sales from continuing operations slightly in excess of 9%. So higher than previously anticipated
operating earnings, a modestly lower tax rate and a lower share count permit us to increase our EPS guidance for
continuing operations to between $8.70 to $8.80. The progression through the remainder of the year is that we will see
a third quarter that's weaker than the second and a fourth quarter that looks very much like the second quarter.
I'd like to now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken.
Jason W. Aiken
Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I've got just a couple of quick financial items to go over before we start the
question-and-answer period. First, I'll follow up on a point we addressed in last quarter's call, and that's the impact
we're seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. When you compare our second quarter results to the
year-ago period, our 2015 revenues and operating earnings would have been higher by $130 million and $20 million,
respectively, had the exchange rates that prevailed in second quarter of 2014 remained in effect this year.

Combined with the first quarter results, our revenues and operating earnings were reduced by $250 million and $40
million so far this year as a result of the strengthening of the dollar. Stated another way, absent the headwind from the
translation of our international business into U.S. dollars, our revenue growth in the first half would have been 8%.
Moving down the income statement, our net interest expense in the quarter was $20 million versus $24 million in the
second quarter of 2014. The decline was driven largely by the repayment of $500 million of debt in January. For 2015,
we expect interest expense to be approximately $85 million. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net
cash position, and that's cash in excess of debt, of $619 million. This is down by almost $400 million from the prior
quarter due to our capital deployment activities, which I'll address in just a minute.
Our effective tax rate was 29.1% for the quarter, slightly lower than expected as we continued to see the benefit of
higher international earnings. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate in the low 29% range. We continue to
expect cash contributions to our pension plans for 2015 to be $185 million and most of that funding is expected to
occur in the third quarter.
A quick point of color on the cash flow statement that's included in our release. One item you'll note is cash proceeds
from asset sales in the first half of just shy of $260 million. We've mentioned from time to time some of the small-scale
portfolio shaping we've been doing and that's what you see there. So that's primarily the divestitures of our commercial
Cyber business, which Phebe mentioned just a few minutes ago, and AxleTech, which closed earlier in the year.
And on the subject of share repurchases, in the quarter we purchased slightly less than 7.5 million shares for just over
$1 billion. We've purchased a little more than 12 million shares in the first half for just shy of $1.7 billion. And in total
when combined with dividends paid, we returned approximately $1.2 billion in the quarter and $2 billion year-to-date,
well ahead of our free cash flow for the first half. At the end of the second quarter, we have $4 billion of cash on the
balance sheet and are well positioned to continue to execute our 2015 capital deployment strategy.
Erin, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the mic back over to you for the Q&A.
Erin Linnihan
Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to

Thank you, Erin. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein of Bank of
America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Hey, yeah. Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Just maybe a quick question on the bizjet market. The way you characterize it sounds great.
But other suppliers have said maybe not so. So my sense is, are you guys picking up share? I mean, you have a primary
competitor who's kind of wounded out there right now and I'm just curious if you're picking up share in the large jet
market.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So there's been an awful lot of discussion about purported weakness in that large cabin
market but not from us. And you know it's not axiomatic that the factors that are impacting others are impacting us. We
really don't think about share. The way we conduct our businesses is that we look at our order book, which was robust,

and our pipeline, which remains strong. So I'm not in a position to comment what others are seeing, but we are
continuing to see interest across all of our product lines.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Okay, great. And then, if I can, just a quick follow-on. Something you didn't talk about too
much on your prepared remarks is, where – how's it going on the Ohio Class program now in the ship business, and if
you can give us an update on that of how the outlook for that looks.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So, Ohio engineering and Virginia construction are really the two main drivers of
increased revenue, which is not what you asked, but it gives us a certain context. And let me give you some color.
We're in the middle of the Ohio replacement design development program, and it's progressing on schedule. We're the
prime, and we are working on all the ship arrangement systems, components development, missile system compartment
in order to support the start of the lead ship, which is in 2021. So we're going very, very well, by all indicators, in our
engineering and design efforts.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Phebe, during the quarter, I guess last couple of quarters, we've seen some of your
competitors make some moves in terms of M&A. Lockheed with Sikorski, and then Raytheon with Websense. Can you
talk about how you view M&A today and how you're thinking about capital deployment overall? Thanks.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So I see M&A today the way I have been seeing it. There is nothing that we are looking at
now. Our capital deployment strategy is consistent with what we've been talking to you about. In the absence of
accretive and good acquisition candidates in our space, we're going to continue to return cash in the form of dividends
and share repurchases.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: As a quick follow-up to the Gulfstream order activity in the quarter, could you give us any
color in terms of by product line, what you saw maybe on the G650, and what the order activity looks like on the new
products of G500 and G600? Thanks.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So, look, we're not going to dissect for you the demand by product and by airplane. But
let's just suffice it to say that we had good demand across our entire portfolio. And that means our entire portfolio. And
when we look at the pipeline, the interest that we see in the pipeline likewise translates to demand signal across our
portfolio.
<A - Erin Linnihan>: Matthew, can we take the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thanks so much. Good morning
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Phebe, just a point of clarification, did you cut your Aerospace revenue forecast by $350
million versus your previous guidance? And if so, what has changed there?

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Look, we reduced, I think, between $250 million and $300 million. And there are an
awful lot of moving parts in this business that as we get half way through the year, we get some additional clarity. It's
really nothing more than across the whole line of products and services. It's just really some moving around among
quarters between maybe – between fiscal years. But the business is still growing. I don't particularly see the reduction
of the increase in estimate from 8% to 6% as particularly dispositive for any market factors. It's simply the management
of the business.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Any particular models that have come off more than you originally anticipated? I know you
don't like to give a lot of detail on this, but is this generally what's happened?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: No. No. It's just as we – look, we've got a whole series of moving parts in that business,
including building additional airplanes for the test program, mix in our service business, and then a mix in any one
particular quarter over the fiscal years of deliveries in large cabin and medium cabin. So we are likely to see some
medium cabin, about three or four of them, move into next year, but that's largely a question of preference on the part
of the customers. So there's nothing material here. It's simply an update as we get half way through the year to give you
just some more clarity of what we see.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Okay. That's great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Wanted to go back on the Marine side. I mean, normally, a fairly predictable business to go
from 2% growth to 6% growth seems unusual. So I'm assuming it's Ohio Class. And then wouldn't that cause kind of a
negative margin shift rather than a 10 basis point increase? And I don't know if you can highlight – you said they have
a lot of work to do in the second half on the margin front. What needs to happen there?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah. So it's a couple of things that are driving – couple programs are driving our
revenue. One is increased Virginia Class construction. Ohio engineering revenue has increased quite a bit over last
year, both of those. And then the commercial ship construction at NASSCO is increasing as our backlog of the ECO
tankers enter construction cycle. So those are the three factors that are increasing our outlook for the year.
On margins, we just have some work to do across the portfolio. If you think about what the history has been on blocks
of submarines. Block IV is still in its early stages. And so, as we continue our reengineering efforts, we expect to
realize some cost savings, which will improve performance and margins on Block IV. That's going to be a longer term
proposition.
Because we, historically, throughout that program have recognized higher margins as progress further into the
construction. So we see some long-term margin expansion opportunities there and we're seeing some – we're seeing
very good performance at NASSCO on their ECO tanker construction and on the MLP for the Navy.
And then we've got some margin compression at Bath Iron Works that we need to continue to work through on our
DDG-1000 program. Not unexpected. But often typical of a new class of ships, particularly one that is a powerful and
transformational warship as DDG-1000 is. So we've got a little ways to go on that. And we're working with our Navy
customer and our vendors and their vendors to get that first ship into sea trials. So more to come.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Phebe, I wondered if we could turn to IS&T, or back to IS&T for a minute, talk about
what's driving the strength there. How you look at that business over time and particularly on the margins, how much
of this is just volume-driven versus cost reduction as we go forward?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: You know, there's an interesting correlation between volume increases and cost reduction.
As you may recall, we have integrated two of our previous standalone businesses in IS&T and created Mission
Systems, and they had a particularly strong quarter across the board. So – and I am continuing to see good continued
strength in those areas. And I'm particularly pleased with their margin improvement, which is driving the higher
earnings, and frankly, allows them to increase their win rate. Their cost cutting efforts have been exemplary. And
there's more to come in that business.
On our service business, it's steady year-over-year, and sequentially. They just need to work their margins hard, which
is always their challenge in their highly-competitive business. But all-in-all, IS&T is doing extremely well and I think
will continue to do well. And, again, our win rate is better because our performance operationally is good and our costs
are coming down. And the pace of which is increasing in cost cutting, so very impressive.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Yes. And then just as a second question or follow up, maybe for Jason on the cash flow
conversion for the year. How are you thinking about that relative to before, especially now that the forecast is a bit
higher from a performance standpoint?
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: I think our expectations for the full year are consistent with what we've said right from the
beginning, a softer than typical year. Our priority is always to pull cash forward so we had a pretty decent performance
in the first half. I think we had a close to 80% conversion rate free cash flow to net income. But we had predicted
before and are still looking at a softer second half as we profile a lot of the supplier payments associated with the
advances that we got on some large contracts last year and the year before flowing out in the balance of the year. So I
think our expectations are essentially consistent from where we started the year.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: And bonus points for using the word axiomatic, Phebe.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: I'm sure you didn't have to look it up.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: No, no. I'm an engineer. So the one question I have for you was on the backlog in
bookings at Gulfstream in particular. Some other manufacturers have seen the fleet buyers come back and place orders.
How much of the strength here is fleet buying? It sounds like it's not, but I just want to confirm that. And also as it
relates to your search for upward bias on the G650 rates, how comfortable are you with where the supply chain can take
this?

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So let's first define our terms. When we say fleet, what we mean is Fortune 500
companies coming back in and replenishing their entire fleet. And so, not surprisingly, the preponderance of our
backlog is in public and private companies and high net worth individuals. They comprise the majority of our backlog.
I don't track our, what you can call fractional owners, fractional buyers. But it's not significant and I don't really worry
about it too much. It's a very steady backlog when we look at it. We know these people in the backlog, they've been
here before and a lot of strength and consistency.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: And then the supply chain for the G650?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, so the supply chain for the G650, we are thinking about feathering in the G650 over
additional ones and two units over time and the supply chain can easily manage that. We've been in discussions with
them and we're not talking about massive changes in the production rate, but simply onesies and twosies to smooth the
transition period.

<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Hi. I just wanted to follow up on the G650 question because, as you've talked about
potentially feathering in some earlier, what are you looking for as a trigger to make a decision to bring some G650s
forward?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, when we look at our plan for the next couple years and get some clarity around that,
then we'll have the ability to ramp up again, not in large orders of magnitude numbers, but in ones that are easily
manageable. So it'll be largely our planning process that we do in the fall and that will set the guidance that we will
give you in the fourth quarter, first quarter of next year. So there's no catalytic trigger. It's more our internal planning.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: But when you think about this also in terms of margins, you had said recently that the
margins on the G650 hadn't quite reached the level of the G550. How do you look at the margin trajectory now and
how does that tie into potential changes in rate?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So the margin potential in the G650, I think we've got another year to 18 months before it
eclipses the G550. So I don't really think about bringing forward G650s to boost our margins. I'm thinking about
bringing them forward to just smooth the entire business and so there are less perturbations as we go through our
transition. But we've talked about this quite a bit. The margin performance on the G650, we haven't seen how good we
can get there.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jonathan Raviv>: Hi. Good morning. It's actually Jon Raviv on for Jason.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Jon.
<Q - Jonathan Raviv>: Hey. I have a question about Jet Aviation and the planned reduction at Basel later in the year.
Curious what's driving that and what you're doing to manage that, and to what extent that's driving the lower Aerospace

sales outlook?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Think about it this way. We added significantly to the backlog of Jet Aviation with single
aisle and double aisle airplane completions in the first half. So we need to – and in the process of doing the engineering
work so that we can induct these airplanes in the first quarter and second quarter of next year into the production cycle.
So this is a – when you have an inflow of orders – and the completions on these airplanes require a fair amount of high
level engineering on the front-end engineering and design. So to integrate that, get that engineering design done-done,
so we're ready to move into full rate production at a very efficient rate is, I think, judicious and was part of our plan all
along. You need to do that in order to produce these things that are at an effective margin level and profitability. The
Jet Aviation has some impact in the second quarter, as you will imagine, particularly given their double digit
contribution the last few quarters.
<Q - Jonathan Raviv>: Great. Thank you.

Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please
go ahead.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes, good morning
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Phebe, if I look at the Aerospace margin for the six months, it's 19.9%. And I would
venture, for the second quarter, if I took out maybe $75 million or $100 million of probably zero margin pre-owned
sales, it would have been north of 20%. So what gets the margin down to 17.5% or so on average in the second half, or
even 17%, to get you to average only 18.5% for the year?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: George, for years, I've enjoyed your complex questions that are built on a series of
assumptions. Let me try to simplify this in the way that we think about it. In the first half, we had a number of factors
that contributed to higher margins. One was a fairly significant settlement that we had with a supplier. The second was
some R&D tax credit. And then, going forward, we're going to increase our R&D spend. Jet Aviation is going to have
significantly lower in the half earnings and margin rate as we just discussed. And we've got a whole lot of mix shift
issues in the service and when airplanes come into green delivery and final delivery. So it's an awful lot of moving
parts. Did that help you?
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yeah, that helps some. Also is it fair to say that revenues in pre-owned were $75 million to
$100 million in the quarter with probably zero profit contribution?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So I don't really follow that, but that would feel about right. But look, the way to think
about this, there is nothing happening in the second half of this year that should cause concern for the underlying
structure of the business. It's simply a matter of different moving parts with mix in the business, the R&D spend as we
build more airplanes into the test programs. So I think the way to think about this holistically is there is no underlying
systemic issue here. It's just the normal puts and takes.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. Thanks very much.

<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Could you give us a little more sense of the low quarterly in Aerospace in the third quarter
and the fourth quarter and maybe you have two quarters here where you've beaten kind of the cautious guidance you've
given us. And maybe the specific variances in the second quarter as to why in that quarter you were so much better than
you kind of – you kind of indicated you might be. Thank you.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, we had a wholesome mix on the service side. Service revenue is up and the mix was
very wholesome. And Jet Aviation had a terrific quarter. So, all-in-all, that helped drive our – what you might think of
as outperformance. But look, I think we've tried to talk over the last few years about the futility of attempting to get and
predict precise quarterly margin rates at this business that has so many different moving parts. Different products,
different services mix is an issue, you throw Jet Aviation in there. So we're comfortable that we're directionally correct.
Do we have with exact precision what third quarter margins are going be? They're going to be less. And they're going
to be significantly less and a little bit better in the fourth quarter. So I think that's reflecting – that flows down into the
overall guidance that we gave you in terms of progression of EPS, which is a lighter third quarter compared to second
quarter, and a fourth quarter that looks a lot like the second quarter, and Gulfstream contributes to that.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: That's very helpful. And then on the order front, you talked about the strength in the U.S. and
Fortune 500 companies. You didn't mention emerging markets. I guess there's been some talk of weakness in China,
Russia, Latin America, could you talk about the foreign markets? And are you seeing just overall in your Aerospace
business requests for push outs or deferrals or requests for accelerations of plains? Thanks so much.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah. So, we have very carefully controlled and monitored our exposure to emerging
markets because of their great volatility. So we're cautious and I think you've seen that behavior in our dealing and in
our interchange with emerging markets. We have some very good reliable customers in each of those markets, but they
tend to be hyperbolic in their demand. They're in one quarter, out the next quarter. So there really hasn't been much
activity in the emerging market space for a number of quarters now. I would add that the Mideast continues to be pretty
wholesome for us. And – but the real powerhouse here is North America. And by the way, it's nice not to have too
much exposure to highly volatile markets. You can get yourself down a box canyon in a big hurry.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you very much.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you very much.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Howard.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Good morning, Phebe. When you became CEO, the agenda was relatively clear. Set some
standards. And if we kind of look back for a moment, the numbers are pretty darn good today. And we get the bar and
the increase right now, but when we look at sort of the numbers going forward, they're pretty darn good. So how do you
raise the bar from here and what are sort of some of the agenda items? Because in some cases this year is well
understood and it's really the challenges beyond that.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So let's give a little bit of retrospective since this management team took over. In 2013,
we were inwardly focused on improving our operations and retiring a considerable amount of risk that we found in the
company. We did all of that. So 2014 and continuing into this year, was about building that backlog, taking the lower
cost structure that we had invested in and the costs reductions that we'd made along with our strong operating discipline
and increasing our backlog very significantly. And that worked. And we're not done. You never can take your eye off
of operations. Without solid operating performance, everything else becomes ephemeral.
So we've got to continue to focus on taking costs out. Our continuous improvement reengineering efforts aren't done.
So we take those, that low cost basis, and given the backlog, we are poised for growth this year, next year and through
my current planning horizon. Our defense companies are growing. We've talked about the transition in Aerospace. But

fundamentally these defense companies across the board, they have the backlog on Combat and Marine and IS&T to
continue to grow. So now it's about growing, it's about growing earnings, it's about growing EPS based on increases in
revenue. And then it's our productivity. So I think you're going to see more of the same. Focus on the core, blocking
and tackling. Might not be the sexiest thing, but, boy, it really makes all the difference in performance.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Well, I don't think you're going get too many complaints. You talked about or Jason
talked about the strength of the dollar. But that's a strength of your European operations, they now become lower cost
on the international market. And we did see a recent order, I think it was out of Denmark.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: But could you talk for a moment about how that integration has worked and what kind of
aperture that has opened up in terms of opportunities both there and you do a little bit of IS&T also and how that's
being pulled through, please?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So when we look ex-U.S. and ex-North America, our efforts in the UK and in our
European Land Systems have been exemplary. And they really are the sort of the parable that describes the journey that
General Dynamics has been on.
Take ELS, for example. We always knew that we were going to have to invest in that business because when we
purchased it, it had excess infrastructure. So we made that investment and their cost structure and their wrap rate now is
at highly competitive levels. That with the competency of that management team, they are really performing. And all of
our expectations were realized because they did what they needed to do and we supported them in that. So they have
increasingly won every bid that they've been in.
The Denmark win was significant for them as the replacement of the M113 fleet at about $500 million. We've been in
Denmark for a while, but it was European Land Systems, both their design excellence, their operating performance and
their understanding of that very important customer that allowed them to execute and win.
In the UK, that's really been out of the ashes rose the phoenix.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Yes.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: We had to dismantle that entire business and turn it over to Land Systems to run the FC
program. So the guys who knew how to build combat vehicles actually were building the combat vehicles. And we
turned over the remaining IS&T businesses to Mission Systems, and both have done a superb job of taking costs out,
increasing their competitiveness.
So I think you may just have heard, I think it was earlier this week, maybe even last week, the UK government
announced another $630 million service and support contract for the FC program. You don't get that unless you
demonstrate your performance and with very affordable cost structures so that you can support the needs of your
customers. So that to me is, like I said, it's a parable of what can go right when you do what you need to do.

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: I noted that Myles liked the word axiomatic, but I preferred the phrase purported weakness. I
thought that was quite concrete.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes. Well, it helps to have been Liberal Arts major. I do know the English language and I
meant it quite specifically.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: I like it. I wondered if you might expand a little bit on the brief comment you made around
DDG-1000 and the work you have there. Is your plan and the rates -the booking rates there dependent on holding
schedule or is there the potential for re-work of significance there? Any color you can give us about what remains to be
done there in terms of milestones and where the program stands?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So, the next major milestone for the first ship – class ship is going to sea trials. And the
Navy, we have worked very, very closely with. They have, by the way, retained the integration responsibility for this
class of ships. So, we work very closely with them to work schedule and production so that we minimize any re-work,
which is particularly challenging on a first to class ship, but we're not seeing enormous amounts of re-work.
This is simply integrating, building and integrating a significantly – this is a huge, huge warship with an array of new
technologies. And so that's some of the challenge. That said, the fleet is anxious to get it because of its clear war
fighting capabilities. So this is a three class – three ship class. And our close relationship with the Navy has been
important in all of us working together to get this war fighting battle star out to the fleet.
