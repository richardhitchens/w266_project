MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter-end conference call.
P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will
refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the
company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.
Also, as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion the company
will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these
measures provide investors with valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business, and has posted
on its website, www.PG.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.
Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.
Jon R. Moeller
Good morning. In the quarter we just completed, we continued reducing costs and reinvested in growth, reaccelerating
our top line and delivering strong earnings and cash flow. Organic sales increased 2%. Core earnings per share
increased 9%, with constant currency core earnings per share up 21%. We delivered meaningful triple-digit basis point
improvements in gross and operating margins on both a constant currency and all-in basis. All-in GAAP earnings per
share were up 37%, and adjusted free cash flow productivity was 117%. This was a reasonably strong quarter, which
reflects our efforts to accelerate organic top line and earnings per share growth, fueled by productivity savings.

We continue to operate, though, in a very challenging and volatile macro environment. Market growth rates on both a
volume and value basis have decelerated, due mainly to slower growth in developing markets. We entered the year
expecting the market to grow close to 3% to 4% globally. We now expect 2% to 3%.
There are more flashpoints across the globe than at any time in recent memory, with significant economic and political
instability impacting incomes and consumption in many large and important markets, Russia, the Ukraine, Egypt, Saudi
Arabia and the balance of the Middle East, Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, Venezuela, and Brazil.
Currencies are weakening across the board, more than $0.75 billion since the start of the fiscal and over $1 billion after
tax versus year-ago. This is on top of the $1.5 billion impact last fiscal year and nearly a $1 billion impact the year
before. Across three years, FX has been a $3.5 billion impact, over 30% of fiscal year 2013 core net earnings after tax.
Since the start of December, the current-year FX headwind has increased by $300 million after tax, with a 40%
devaluation in Argentina, an additional 15% devaluation in Russia, and nearly a 10% devaluation in Mexico.
The relative strength of the dollar weighs heavier on us than our euro and yen functional currency competitors. The
dollar has more than doubled against the ruble over the past two years, while our euro functional competitors are facing
about 50% to 60% of that impact. We expect these dynamics, slowing market growth, geopolitical hotspots, and a
stronger dollar, will continue to be part of our reality going forward.
Against this backdrop, we're staying focused on big opportunities in our control, executing what is the largest
transformation in our company's history, step-changing productivity, transforming our portfolio, and strengthening
category business models and innovation plans. This transformation strategy, as we'll explain more at CAGNY, is
fundamentally a growth strategy. I'll talk briefly about each of these focus areas, productivity, portfolio, and business
model and innovation plans, before getting into the details of the quarter.
We continued to dramatically improve productivity, with significant upside still ahead. Our original five-year cost of
goods savings target was $6 billion. We expect to deliver over $7 billion by the end of this year, 15% above our initial
target. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 15% over the last three years. This includes new staffing necessary
to support capacity addition. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment is down nearly 20%. We're targeting 25%
to 30% cumulative reduction by the end of fiscal 2017.
In February 2012, we announced we would reduce non-manufacturing overhead by 10% over five years. As of
December 31, we've reduced these roles by 23%, more than double the original target, and are well on track to meet our
revised target of 25% to 30% by the end of fiscal 2017. In fact, we currently expect to reach our 25% to 30% objective
this year, one year ahead of schedule. These figures, including divestitures, will reduce non-manufacturing roles by
over 35%. Continued digitization has been and will be a big enabler of our overhead and manufacturing enrollment
efficiencies.
We're reducing non-working marketing expenditures, costs that do not impact reach, do not impact frequency. Last
year we reduced the number of agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by
about $370 million. We're aiming for an additional $200 million of agency-related savings this year. These are
non-working savings that enable us to invest in advertising and in trial of consumer-preferred products. We're
strengthening our working marketing programs, greater reach, higher frequency, greater effectiveness, at less overall
marketing cost.
Last fiscal year in the U.S., we increased total marketing and merchandising support behind Pantene by 440 basis
points, increased Tide brand spending by 220 basis points, and invested an additional 150 basis points in Fusion behind
the new FlexBall innovation. This year we've made similar increases to advertising programs in the U.S. of Shave Care,
Fabric Care; in Brazil on Baby Care and Fabric Care; in China on Fabric Care and Oral Care. In North America alone,
we've added nearly 100 basis points to advertising and in-store merchandising budgets since we started the fiscal year.
In addition to cost of goods sold, overhead, and non-working marketing cost reduction, we're driving balance sheet
productivity. Inventory days are down. Payables days are up. The moves we've made on the balance sheet have enabled
us to extend our long track record of very strong adjusted free cash flow productivity, 102% last fiscal year, 101% in
Q1, 117% in Q2. We continue to maintain our position as one of the strongest cash generators among competitive peers

and comparable mega-cap companies.
We're also among the top companies in returning cash to shareholders. In fiscal 2015 we increased our dividend for the
59th consecutive year and returned $11.9 billion in cash to shareholders, 105% of adjusted net earnings. Over the past
five years, we've returned $60 billion to shareholders and intend to pay dividends, retire shares, and repurchase shares
worth up to $70 billion over just the next four years.
In addition to transforming our cost structure, we're transforming our portfolio. As you know, we're centering our
portfolio on 10 category-based business units where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands, and consumer
meaningful product technologies. These 10 categories have historically grown faster with higher margins than the
balance of the company. We'll be a company of consumer-preferred brands and products in these 10 product categories.
Within these core businesses, we're also focusing our offerings to maximize value creation. We're making smart
choices for short, mid, and long-term value creation. We're going to add business, even when these choices create
short-term top line pressure. In our Mexico Family Care business, we made a choice to discontinue low-tier
unprofitable products in favor of very profitable higher-tier products, albeit with lower sales. The top line drag from
this choice will dissipate over the next few quarters, and we'll have a solidly value-accretive business going forward.
In India, we've made a choice to deprioritize several unprofitable lines of business which negatively impact short-term
top line growth rates, but will lead longer term to a much more profitable business that will grow strongly. Last fiscal
year, organic sales growth slowed by several points, but we made significant progress in improving local profit
margins, up 700 basis points. We went from losing money in India to triple-digit profits. In the quarter we just
completed, India organic sales growth was only 2%. The strategic part of the business, the part that we're maintaining,
grew a healthy 10%. Sales in the portion of the business we're fixing or exiting, which is about 15% of the portfolio,
were down 35%. Profit is running significantly ahead of even last year's improved levels.
As we come out of this, we'll have strong top line growth that is really worth something. There's really no point to
growth if it isn't worth something. Choices like this impacted our organic top line growth rate by about one point in the
October – December quarter, but will enable us to increase profitability on an ongoing basis.
As we've improved productivity and sharpened our portfolio, we've been strengthening business unit strategies,
business models, and product offerings, putting particular priority against our four largest categories, Fabric Care, Baby
Care, Grooming, and Hair Care, in our two largest markets, the U.S. and China. We're focusing our Laundry business
on consumer-preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium-priced unit dose
detergents and our market-leading and market-expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We're launching better
performing and more profitable new compact liquid detergents in Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil, and China. In Russia
and Turkey, where we relaunched superior compact liquid detergents early last calendar year, P&G's share of liquid
detergents is up seven and 11 points respectively.
Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrate what is possible when we get the strategy balanced and the innovation
program focused on what matters most to consumers, superior value from best-in-class performance at a modest price
premium. The U.S. laundry detergent category is continuing to grow, up more than four points on a value basis across
all outlets over the last three and six-month periods. Within this, our share is growing. P&G's U.S. laundry detergent
value share was up a point last fiscal year and was up 0.5 point in the December quarter.
We will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. In North America, we're introducing a new regimen on
Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to athletic wear. Seventy percent of consumers wear
athletic gear multiple times each week. The Odor Defense collection, anchored by innovation on Tide Pods, brings the
proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues for a great,
clean, and fresh scent. Paired with the added cleaning power of Tide Odor Defense Rescue laundry booster and Downy
Fresh Protect Odor Defense beads, this regimen promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of athleisure
clothes people are wearing far beyond the gym.
In U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communication, trial programs, and a robust online presence have led
to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers value share of U.S. diapers was up more than 1.5 points last fiscal year and was

up a point in the December quarter. The progress was particularly encouraging considering our latest Pampers
innovation with extra absorb channels was on shipment allocation for much of the quarter as demand succeeded (sic)
[exceeded] our initial supply. With increased capacity in place and continued strong demand, we expect a good start to
the new calendar year. We're increasing our investments in Luvs diapers in the second half of the fiscal year to address
share declines following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor.
Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, we've strengthened our value proposition in
several markets and accelerated premium innovation on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness at
the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby stores, and we're improving
our point-of-market entry programs to deliver higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms.
The Gillette FlexBall innovation continues to deliver strong results in Grooming. Globally, an estimated 25 million
men have tried FlexBall in the 18 months since launch. FlexBall has been an important catalyst of growth of ProGlide
cartridges. ProGlide cartridge sales grew 18% last fiscal year compared to a 7% decline in the overall male cartridge
market. ProGlide cartridge share is up two to three points in each of the past three, six, and 12-month periods through
December.
The strong ProGlide results set a very positive stage for our next cartridge innovation, Gillette Fusion ProShield.
ProShield, with lubrication before and after the blades, shields against irritation during every shave. Retailer response
to ProShield has been outstanding, delivering launch orders and display levels well above targets.
We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder, from our best product, Fusion FlexBall, to MACH3 systems, to
premium-priced and superior performance disposables, with strong consumer value communication. We're innovating
in store, helping retailers move out of the lockboxes on shelves and at checkout with the use of hard tags. Hard tags
make Gillette much easier to shop. They take up less space on shelf so more product can be on a peg, reducing
out-of-stocks and improving sales closure rates, and they're very effective at reducing shrink. We've already made the
change in several hundred stores with excellent results and are rolling out hard tags as fast as we're able.
We're also innovating online. With more men purchasing their blades and razors through e-commerce, we're
establishing Gillette as the online leader. While we were admittedly late to build out our online offering, Gillette Shave
Club launched in June and is off to a very good start. We've increased our e-commerce share of blades and razors more
than six points and nearly doubled online consumption since launching Gillette Shave Club. We're building
partnerships with e-tailers and retailers who are offering their shoppers subscription tie-ins for the Gillette Shave Club
which have enabled Gillette to deliver record online sales in each of the past three months.
In Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the U.S. earlier this month. Pantene's new
breakthrough conditioner technology delivers weightless conditioning, addressing the most significant consumer trial
barrier for conditioners. The new conditioner innovation is a consumer blind test winner versus our best competitors in
North America, China, and Japan. We recently launched two new Head & Shoulders variants in the U.S., Instant Fresh
and Nourishing Care, and are upgrading Head & Shoulders' consumer message with a new campaign, use daily to stay
100% flake-free for life with Head & Shoulders Scalp Shield technology.
Driven by these interventions in Laundry, Baby Care, Grooming, Hair Care, and other categories, and by our
investment in category-dedicated sales coverage, we're making sequential progress in our largest and most profitable
market, the United States. The U.S. business rebounded from a two-point organic sales decline in Q1 to deliver three
points of organic growth in Q2. The U.S. improvement was despite product allocation driven by demand in excess of
supply in two of our largest categories, Baby Care and Feminine Care, and despite a record light cough/cold season
impacting the Vicks brand. Sales are probably a point or so ahead of consumption for the October-December quarter,
but the progress is encouraging nonetheless.
Our second largest market, both sales and profits, is China. Here too, organic sales were again down high single digits,
in line with the Q1 trend. We've gotten behind in premium innovation, which has been a contributor to our soft top line
trends over the last several quarters. [audio gap] (16:44-16:50) myself, and several other members of our leadership
team spent the last week in China. We're working with the team there and with the global business units to expand our

offerings in the premium-priced tiers, which are the fastest growing, to invest in trial of consumer-preferred products,
and to transform our go-to-market operations.
We've launched premium Baby Care innovations in both the taped and pull-on segments. We're launching compact
Ariel liquid detergents that consumers prefer over competition. And we have new upgrades coming soon on Tide.
We've made meaningful product and packaging improvements in Hair Care that launched last quarter on both Head &
Shoulders and Pantene.
In Oral Care, we're launching Oral-B Gum Care, a new super-premium gum repair line of Oral-B toothpastes. The line
includes a two-step paste and other single-step paste variants. Consumer tests show the new line winning against top
competition in the super-premium tier.
We're importing our best Feminine Care product, Infinity, to China with premium power toothbrushes and our best
Braun razors. We're increasing our investment in consumer awareness, point-of-market entry sampling, and trial across
categories. We're strengthening our relationship and presence with key e-commerce and specialty retailers, the
fastest-growing channels in the Chinese retail market. We're investing in coverage of these channels and are working to
simplify, standardize, and strengthen our overall go-to-market approach. These moves will take time to fully implement
and the go-to-market changes may actually result in pullbacks before progress, but we're confident they will result in
stronger growth over time.
Stepping back then and looking at things on a macro level, the environment continues to be very challenging, slower
market growth, stiff foreign exchange headwinds, and a volatile political and policy environment. Against this
backdrop, we continue to improve productivity, to focus our portfolio, and to invest in superior consumer-preferred
brands and products. We're putting particular priority against the four largest categories – Baby Care, Fabric Care, Hair
Care, and Grooming – and against our two largest markets, the U.S. and China.
With that context as background, let me get into the details of the quarter we just completed as well as the outlook for
the fiscal year. Two housekeeping items before I begin: first, the organic sales and core earnings results we're reporting
today are based on our 10 core product categories. The results of the Beauty and Batteries businesses that we're in the
process of exiting are reported as discontinued operations. In late October, we provided a restated 10-K for fiscal 2015,
presenting historical results on this same basis. Second, starting last quarter, we're no longer consolidating the results of
our Venezuelan subsidiaries in our reported numbers.
Organic sales were up 2% for the quarter versus the prior year. Each segment was at or ahead of year-ago. As I
mentioned previously, sales were slightly, slightly ahead of consumption. Organic sales in China and Russia were
significantly lower versus last year, negatively impacting total company sales growth by more than a point. The
category and SKU cleanup efforts drove up to another point of organic sales decline. These impacts were more than
offset by progress in the United States and growth in Latin America. All-in, sales were down 9%, including an
eight-point headwind from foreign exchange and three points from the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand
divestitures.
Core gross margin and core operating margin each improved on both an all-in and ex-currency basis, driven by
productivity savings. Core gross margin increased 210 basis points versus the prior year. Excluding foreign exchange,
core gross margin was up 290 basis points. Core SG&A costs improved 140 basis points, driven primarily by overhead
cost reductions. We continue to invest in marketing, reinvesting non-working cost savings. Marketing expenditures
were in total equal to year-ago as a percentage of sales.
Core operating margin was up 350 basis points versus the prior year, behind 270 basis points of productivity savings.
On a constant currency basis, our core operating margin was up 390 basis points.
The core effective tax rate was 23.6%, up nearly a point versus last year.
Core earnings per share were $1.04, up 9% versus the prior-year quarter. This includes a 12 percentage point foreign
exchange headwind, approximately $300 million after tax. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share grew
21%. On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $1.12 for the quarter, up 37% versus the prior year.

We generated $3.8 billion in free cash flow, yielding 117% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We returned
approximately $3.9 billion to shareholders this quarter through a combination of $1.9 billion in dividends and $2 billion
in share repurchase.
Moving to guidance, we're maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth of in line to up low single digits versus
fiscal 2015. We've been investing to increase awareness and trial of our brands and products in North America, which
is a key catalyst for growth in categories like Fabric Care and Baby Care. We're launching a number of new
consumer-preferred premium innovations over the next few months in both developed and developing markets.
We're investing in selling capabilities to capitalize on opportunities in the fastest-growing channels and strengthen our
presence in our most important markets. We've also invested in targeted price reductions to narrow consumer value
gaps in several categories. All of these efforts along with annualizing some of the most significant impacts from last
fiscal year give us confidence we'll continue to grow organic sales in the second half.
The level of growth could be impacted by our access to dollars for finished product imported into Venezuela. About
60% of our Venezuelan business is imported. The sale of imported products from the importing subsidiary is still
reported in our consolidated results. Failure to continue this business would result in up to a 0.5-point impact to top line
growth in the fiscal year.
The headwind from foreign exchange has increased since the start of the year. We now expect FX will have a seven
percentage point impact on all-in sales growth. Also, the combined effect of the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor
brand divestitures will have a two to three percentage point drag on all-in sales growth. Taken together, we expect
all-in sales to be down high single digits versus restated fiscal 2015 results. We're also maintaining constant currency
core earnings per share guidance of mid to high singles, with our internal outlook currently at the low end of this range.
Given the magnitude of the foreign exchange impact, I thought it might be helpful to again recount how FX impacts
our earnings. I'll use the example of the Argentinean peso. We were most pleased to see the early decisive approach of
Argentina's new leadership and believe the actions they are taking will create long-term benefits, for which we're
well-positioned to participate. But the nearly 30% to 40% devaluation of the peso will significantly impact our reported
earnings in three ways.
First, transaction impacts increase the cost of non-peso-denominated inputs. We import, as an example, Gillette blades
and razors from Mexico into Argentina. Widening of the cross-weight between the two peso currencies increases the
Argentina unit cost of razors and reduces profit.
Similarly, the local cost of plastic bottles, which are denominated in dollars and imported into Argentina for the
production of Fabric Care and Hair Care products, have increased significantly. These transaction costs impact – affect
all manufacturers, multinational or local, whose materials or finished products are imported from similar sources and
are similarly denominated. We attempt to recover these cost increases through pricing when local legal requirements
and market realities allow it, though there's a lag between the time when a currency devalues, the costs are incurred,
and the pricing is taken and executed through our channels of distribution.
The second impact is balance sheet revaluation. We need to revalue transaction-related payables and receivables
balances at the end of each quarter. This includes the revaluation of balances related to transactions between P&G legal
entities that operate in different currencies. To continue the prior example, while razors produced in Mexico are being
transported and are moving through the customs process into Argentina, our Argentinean business holds a Mexico
peso-denominated payable on its books. At the end of every quarter, payables and receivables balances are revalued at
current spot rates. Gains or losses from revaluing transactional balances flow through SG&A and are included in core
earnings per share.
Third, income statements of foreign subsidiaries like Argentina that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional
currency are translated back to U.S. dollars at the new exchange rates. As we adjust the Argentina peso transaction,
balance sheet revaluation and translation impacts have been and are projected to be significant, at about $70 million,
$50 million, and $20 million after tax respectively, for a total of $140 million after tax for the year. Across all
currencies, foreign exchange hurts total nearly $300 million after tax in the December quarter, $700 million fiscal year

to date, and are forecast to be a $1 billion impact after-tax product hurt over the course of the fiscal year.
When we talk about foreign exchange impacts, we're sometimes asked why we don't simply hedge these away. It's a
very valid question and something we look at internally and with a different set of outside eyes every year as we
prepare our financial plan. There are three reasons we typically don't end up choosing to hedge. Up to two-thirds of our
foreign exchange losses and a significant amount of our forward exposure is in currencies that are either
non-deliverable or are very difficult to hedge. The Argentinian peso, Venezuelan bolivar, and the Ukrainian hryvnia are
three examples.
Second, hedging is neither free nor cheap. Currency volatility in itself increases sometimes in significant ways this cost.
So when you want it most, it becomes difficult to afford.
The last shortfall of hedging as the answer is that it solves nothing longer term. It also does nothing to help restore the
margin structure of the business. Ahead simply defers volatility. When the instrument expires, you have the same hit
with the same margin impact you would have had had you not hedged.
While it takes time and there's a lag between the hurt and the help, we typically look to pricing, sizing, mix
enhancement, sourcing choices, and cost reduction to manage FX impacts. We have historically recovered about
two-thirds of our FX impacts with pricing over time. We think this time given differential impacts for euro and yen
functional currency competitors, it will be somewhat less than that.
I said on our last call that we would invest where it was appropriate to do so. I said we would not cut smart investment
to offset foreign exchange impacts, which meant we could very well end up below the earnings per share guidance
range. FX is a near-term reality that has gotten significantly worse. We're doing our best to offset FX impacts with
productivity savings and pricing while continuing to make investments in brand equities, innovation, trial, and value
equations. We think we've struck a reasonable balance of investment to improve the long-term health of the business,
even though it requires we moderate our short-term earnings outlook, including foreign exchange.
We're reducing our core earnings per share guidance to a range of down 3% to 8% versus last year's core earnings per
share of $3.76. This earnings per share guidance includes headwinds of eight to nine percentage points from the
combined impacts of Beauty, deal, and transition expenses. These are for the businesses moving out to merge with
Coty, Venezuela deconsolidation, lower non-operating income, and a higher tax rate. Adjusting for these items, our
guidance translates to modest core earnings per share growth, with meaningful growth excluding foreign exchange.
Our key assumptions on items below the core operating profit line have not changed. The core effective tax rate should
be about 24% for fiscal 2016, about three points higher than last year, roughly a four percentage point headwind on
core earnings per share growth. The core tax rate in the back half of last fiscal year was below 19%. We expect a tax
rate of closer to 24% in the back half of this fiscal.
We continue to expect non-operating income will be a two to three percentage point drag on core earnings per share
growth, mainly impacting the fourth quarter. We had nearly $440 million of non-operating income gains last year, with
over $400 million coming in the second half, including $355 million in the fourth quarter. We expect modest
non-operating income gains in the back half of this fiscal.
With most of these impacts hitting in the back half, the core earnings per share growth headwind across Q3 and Q4 is
roughly 13 percentage points or about $0.24 per share. FX adds another 7%, or about $0.12 per share headwind in the
back half. So while the midpoint of our new guidance range points to roughly a 15% core earnings per share reduction
in the back half versus last year or roughly flat excluding the tax and non-operating headwinds and up mid-singles if we
adjust for currency. Given very strong progress to date, as I've said before, 101% in Q1 and 117% in Q2, we're
increasing our free cash flow productivity target from 90% to 100% of earnings.
We continue to expect to retire shares at a value of approximately $8 billion to $9 billion through a combination of
direct share repurchases and shares that will be exchanged during the third quarter in the Duracell transaction. In
addition to the shares we expect to retire, we expect dividend payments of more than $7 billion, in total $15 billion to
$16 billion in dividend payments, share exchange, and share repurchase. We now expect all-in GAAP earnings per

Going forward, we are committed to balanced top and bottom line growth and strong free cash flow productivity to
drive total shareholder return. We will continue to address value gaps if and when they emerge. We will defend our
positions, and we will invest behind brand trial and awareness programs, and of course, consumer-preferred innovation.
We'll do everything we can from a productivity standpoint. We'll smartly invest to accelerate top line growth, and we'll
continue delivering on our commitment of strong cash return to shareholders.
David [Taylor] and I both look forward to talking with you at CAGNY about the plan and priorities to deliver balanced
growth and value creation beyond this fiscal year. I'll provide an update on our productivity progress and the significant
opportunity that remains in front of us, which can help fuel investment in growth. David will discuss our strategic
choices, how we plan to sustainably improve top line growth, and the organization and culture changes we'll make to
accelerate our progress.
That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our
press release and will be available in slides, which we posted on our website, www.PG.com, following the call.
With that, I'd be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hey, good morning. Jon, I wanted to focus a bit more on the top line results. Q2 was a
solid sequential improvement despite some of the retail inventory cuts you mentioned in the release. And your full-year
sales guidance on org [organic] sales looks like it's moving up given the all-in guidance is unchanged despite the
greater FX pressure. So what's driving that more favorable expectation? Are the factors behind it more longer-term in
nature or temporary to this year?
And then also, can you help explain? If we look at Nielsen scanner data, we haven't seen improvement in the U.S.,
Europe, or emerging markets. So if you could help explain the dichotomy between the improved expectations but a lack
of scatter data sales improvement, that would be helpful.
And then last, last quarter you mentioned second-half organic sales growth would likely be above Q2. Is that still the
case? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So first of all, Dara, we have maintained our organic sales growth guidance for the year, which
is flat to low singles, so there's really no change in the overall outlook, which as you rightly say was for acceleration in
Q2 and then further improvement in the back half of the year. As I mentioned, the extent of that improvement in the
back half of the year is going to be potentially impacted by what happens with access to dollars for imports into
Venezuela, and it will obviously be impacted by other things as well. But even with that, we remain confident that we
can continue to grow in the second half.
In terms of the businesses in the U.S. and the comparison to scanner data, as you know, we pretty dramatically
accelerated our growth in the U.S. from minus 2% in the quarter before to plus 3% this quarter. I mentioned that there
was about a point of sales that's ahead of consumption. That's on things like the ProShield razor that we shipped into
the market; but still even adjusting for that, acceleration as we expected.
It's getting increasingly difficult to look only at scanner data as a measure of a market's health or a business's health.
That's particularly true in markets like China, where a huge portion of the growth of the market is coming in the
e-commerce channel, which doesn't cross a scanner. And you have some of that same dynamic in the U.S. So for
example, the Shave Club sales, depending on how they're executed, may or may not cross a scanner, and I think that's
part of the dichotomy. But generally, if we look across several quarters to dampen out some of the short-term volatility

and the noise, we continue to be pleased and encouraged by increasing strength in the North American business, and
we expect it to grow going forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson, Citi Research.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi. First question, just on housekeeping, I think you said that China, your sales were
down high single digits. Do you have a sense for what the category growth was, just so we can compare that?
And then second question more broadly on pricing, I guess two components. Number one, in emerging markets, where
we continue to see currencies devalue like Russia, like Brazil, how far are you into your price increases? Are you going
to continue to take price increases to keep in line with inflation, or what's the outlook there?
And then, second part of that with regard to pricing in North America, it's surprising to me that there is still so much
positive pricing across the whole sector in light of the lower commodity prices. And I don't know whether that's just a
reflection of a stronger U.S. consumer or more innovation. But if you can comment broadly on your outlook about
pricing in North America and whether you think the price increases you've taken are sustainable. Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Wendy. So first, China, it depends on the individual category, but the market growth
rates range roughly from, call it, 5% to 8%, so mid to high singles across the categories. And as I mentioned, we see
significant opportunity remaining in China with those very attractive growth rates, albeit somewhat slower than they
were two and three years ago, with the conversion from a manufacturing to a consumption-based economy, with the
dramatic potential that exists as a result of larger family sizes from the possibility of two children versus just one, and
with the premiumization of the market which, as I indicated, admittedly we have not been as agile as we need to be in
exploiting. But really, as I mentioned, I was there last week. I was there the week before the Christmas holidays, and I
walked away with a tremendous sense of encouragement while acknowledging that we have work to do.
In terms of pricing, the pricing dynamic should continue to be a favorable contributor to top line growth as we move
forward, even if all we do is take forward the price increases that have already been executed. They're not fully
annualized yet. And so that should continue to be a positive on the top line.
The pricing calculus or algebra is fairly complicated. You really have to look at the combination of currencies,
commodities, and competition to determine a course of action going forward in any individual product category or
market. And the sum of those three things is very different depending on what markets you're in, as influenced by both
currencies and by competition. In general, the companies in our industry continue to price at some level for foreign
exchange. I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we expect our ability to price to be somewhat lower than it has
been historically, and we'll make up for that over time with productivity and other savings.
And in the U.S., first of all, the commodity impacts aren't as significant as you would assume just looking at the
headlines on oil prices, for example. If you look at everything from diesel to resin to other inputs that are derived from
the petro complex, while pricing benefit or cost reduction has occurred, it is not anywhere near the level yet of the
crude price reductions. So I think that's a potential source of disconnect as people think about this.
Generally, we're taking pricing behind very strong product innovation. We're looking to improve the strength of our
overall value equations, the combination of pricing, product performance, consumer usage, experience, aesthetic. And
done in that way, I think that continues to be a contributor to growth and value creation.

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Great, thanks so much. I just have a question on SG&A and reinvestment level. So we
keep track of the moving pieces you share each quarter, and it looks like reinvestment in the business decelerated a bit

in the second quarter. And then also to tie it to your full-year outlook, SG&A probably needs to go up in the back half.
So can you just tell me if that's on the right track; and if it's going up, what the specific areas of reinvestment will be
versus the pace of the overhead takeout? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So we expect, for example, our media spending to be up double digits in the second half versus
year-ago. So as reinvestment as compared to the prior year, that will definitely be increasing. As we look at those
choices, we're obviously not encumbered by the math. We're looking at the value creation potential that exists behind
those investments in both the short and importantly the mid and longer term, and we'll invest where we have
opportunities to do so. So I think that you should think of the level of investment – reinvestment sequentially increasing
as we go forward. I know that will be the case this fiscal year. I expect that will be the case next fiscal year.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thanks. Just to follow up on that, Jon, it seems as though you've delivered upside on the
FX-neutral earnings growth year to date, particularly today, and yet you're going to the low end of the range. Is that
because of some of the incremental investments you're talking about? Is that ad spend incremental to what you were
thinking before?
And then separately, thanks for the color on the FX piece. It's a pretty wide range if we look at that over the balance of
the year in terms of the FX impact. It's probably something in the neighborhood of like $0.20. And so I guess I'm just
wondering what drives those differences in outcomes from an FX standpoint, just so we understand where we need to
go within that range. Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: In terms of the over-delivering and then maintaining the constant currency guidance, yes, that's
definitely reflective of additional investment. I mentioned in our prepared remarks that in North America, for example,
we've increased our budgets by about 100 basis points since the start of the year, most of that occurring relatively
recently. That's driven both by our encouragement from a response standpoint to the spending that we have in the
market and the acceleration of growth, particularly in the U.S. And so yes, your interpretation is correct in terms of the
various moving pieces.
The guidance range is really reflective of what the underlying constant currency range of outcomes could be, and then
we just apply the current FX math on top of that. And there's a lot of – we're operating in a more volatile environment
than we ever have, and I think our range is reflective of that reality, as it should be.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Hey, thanks. Jon, I hate to make you rehash this a little bit, but I guess I'm not totally
understanding why the back half EBIT would decline. So I think I understand you have the below-the-line impact of
tax rate and other, but it looks like FX probably gets less bad in the back half of the year. I think you said that, yet your
guidance range really implies a deceleration in EBIT and a reasonably substantial one from this past quarter. So I guess
correct me if that's wrong. But do you guys expect the gross margin acceleration to slow in the back half of the year
maybe? I guess what might I be missing?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Some of those impacts in that eight to nine-point impact of things like Venezuela
deconsolidation and the Beauty transition costs and the non-operating income difference are all in the EBIT line. So
that's a significant driver of lower EBIT comparisons second half versus first half. As I mentioned, most of those hit the
second half disproportionately.

In terms of currency, there is some letup but not a lot in the back half, and I expect our margin progress to continue to
be reasonably strong, certainly constant currency on both gross and operating. So it's really – the comparison is most
dramatically driven by FX and by things like the Venezuela deconsolidation, the transition costs associated with the
Beauty business that are not in discontinued operations. For example, if we have employees in our global business
service organization that are working to stand up the new company in terms of building the systems that are required, et
cetera, those are employees that are going to remain with Procter & Gamble. And therefore their costs are not in
discontinued operations; they're in continuing operations. And then as I mentioned, the divestiture gain in non-op is a
big driver as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hey, Jon. Good morning.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Good morning.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: A couple questions, just a housekeeping one. Do you still think Duracell is going to close
roughly any day now? And then is Coty still set to close July – August?
And then my real question is when does market share really start to matter? Because I know you downplayed it and
said we're about expanding categories and protecting the structural integrity of our categories. But it just seems that
some of share declines that some others mentioned, especially in some of the emerging markets, are pretty significant.
So can you just tell me if you're going to have a point in time where the focus is going to shift and you're going to start
focusing on market share again? And then just in the quarter, what percentage of the business is gaining market share?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Bill. Duracell, as I mentioned earlier, should close this quarter. The exact date will
depend on work that still needs to occur, but that's on track. Coty is currently scheduled to close as well on the timing
that we initially indicated, which would be in the back half of the calendar year; so no changes on either of those, both
progressing towards the desired endpoints, as we would hope.
In terms of market share, our objective is balanced growth and value creation, with the growth objective being over
time at to slightly ahead of markets. So market share does matter, but particularly in a time when we need to restore
structural economics in response to currency moves, we can get ourselves in big trouble if that becomes the driving
metric.
And so as we've said, we're prepared to lose some share in two situations. One is where we're restoring structural
economic attractiveness, and having a higher market share with a negative gross margin isn't helpful to anyone. And
also, where we're doing some of the portfolio cleanup that I mentioned on the core categories, where we'll be in a much
better position longer term from both a growth and value creation standpoint if we can focus on the parts of our
portfolio that are really working for us. And if you look at the percentage of business that is holding or growing share,
it's about 45% globally. Currently, we would expect that to be higher going forward. In the U.S., where we're further
ahead in the strengthening of our portfolio, et cetera, we've got about 60% of business holding or growing share.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Thanks and good morning, everybody. I wanted to go back to China, Jon. So does the sales
growth guidance for the back half of the year anticipate an improvement in current trends? And then related to that,
given the time that you talked about being in the market, do you think it's realistic you can be competitive in all the
categories in which you compete today?

<A - Jon R. Moeller>: The current guidance does expect an improvement in China in the back half, and that should be
very doable just based on the math alone; in other words, the annualization of some of the changes that we made in our
go-to-market and inventory levels in the back half of last year. So we do expect that will improve. And again, as I said,
our view on China is an opportunistic one, not a pessimistic one. We really think that there is significant continued
opportunity there, both top and bottom line.
And I think – we picked the categories that we're going to compete in, in the new portfolio based on our view of our
capability to be more than competitive, to win. These are categories that we have won in. We're global leaders in
almost every single one, I think seven out of the 10, and we're among the leaders in the balance. There's a margin
structure that allows for significant investment in growth in each of these businesses. These are higher-margin
businesses, and they're businesses that importantly leverage our core capabilities as a company. So they've been
deliberately chosen for success.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Thanks, Jon. So I guess on the one hand, I think we're all very pleased with the return to
positive organic growth, especially alongside the strong cash productivity and margin progression that you called out.
And then on the other hand, volumes were still down 2%, I guess 1% if I exclude the businesses you've chosen to exit,
but negative essentially across the whole business nonetheless, and market share sounds like it was down in aggregate.
So I guess just some further comments there would be helpful in terms of how and when you're likely to come out of
this negative volume phase. Because if I go back over the last 15 years or so, we're in this anomalous period where last
year and it sounds like this year we're in negative volume territory. The only time that's ever happened was the financial
crisis. So I guess again, how and when can we inflect positive on that key volume number? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So the two drivers of the volume reduction, one, as you indicated, is the portfolio cleanup
within the core categories that are still reported within continuing operations. And as you rightly indicated, that's had
about a point worth of impact. And the other is the market reaction from a consumption standpoint and, in some cases,
the share price evolution as we take pricing to offset foreign exchange impacts in large devaluation markets.
So if you take Russia or the Ukraine as an example, where devaluation has been 70%, 80%, 110%, we have negative
gross margins. We need to price over time as well as do everything we can from a savings standpoint to restore those
margins or at least to a positive level so that growth is meaningful. And during that process, both at a market level, the
markets tend to contract in response to higher price points. And sometimes from a share standpoint, and Russia and the
Ukraine are good examples where we're competing against strong European competitors, and in the case of Russia,
Japanese competitors as well. And sometimes there's a modest share impact that comes with the pricing that we deem
necessary to take.
We are not prepared to lose share indefinitely. Our history in this area is that it takes six to nine months to work your
way through this. Some of the pricing that we've taken has been recent because a lot of the devaluation has been recent.
So I haven't actually looked at it quarter by quarter to see what's the quarter where volume will re-inflect positive. We'll
have to work our way through this pricing. I don't believe – if you go back to the comments on market share, we fully
intend to grow at market growth rates or slightly ahead of market growth rates over longer periods of time. That
requires volume growth. I mentioned markets growing 3%-ish. We're not going to be able to take 3% pricing
indefinitely, nor is that our intent in any way.
So we will – also, we're not in markets where competitors don't respond from a pricing standpoint. Remember, we,
because we're the market leaders, typically have to lead or nothing happens. So we're exposed for that period of time,
and competitors can take six to nine months sometimes before they respond or they cannot respond at all. And in the
cases where they don't respond to the levels that are necessary to maintain our value equation comparisons, or where
they don't price at all, we will reduce price. We're not going to be uncompetitive. We're not going to lose share on a
sustained basis.

Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Good morning, guys, just two quick questions. Jon, can you maybe provide just a quick bridge on
the volume when you talk about the U.S. going positive and helping us reconcile how you got to the total consolidated
number just so we can get a geographic viewpoint?
And then the bigger-picture question is, as you push responsibility closer to those 10 business leaders, how long does
that take to really start affecting business decisions and on-the-ground results? I'm just trying to get a sense of what the
time lag typically you would expect after making a move like that. Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks for the bigger-picture question, Nik, and that's actually something we'll spend some
time talking about at CAGNY.
It's interesting. The market on a relative inflections standpoint that's growing the strongest, which is the U.S., is one
where these changes were made first. They were made about a year ago. We're basically, in addition to the 10
categories and their ability to operate somewhat independently, we've sectorized our sales force. And so we're going
end to end from the GBU all the way through to the customer with dedicated sales support. We're not moving people as
rapidly across categories. The GBUs have full decision rights on the amount of resources that are supporting their
business from a go-to-market operations standpoint, which has led to some choices, quite frankly, to increase coverage
in some channels. That's led to choices to hire mid-career talent that has experience in a category that extends beyond
the experience of our current employees, so it's having a dramatic impact.
Every change has a slightly different timeline in terms of, one, it gets reflected in business results. But I think we're
making good progress in this area. I think we have more to do. Again, we'll talk about that at CAGNY. And I don't
think it takes a long period of time to make a difference.

Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante, Consumer Edge Research.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Hi, good morning, everyone. Coming back to Nik's question, which I don't think – at least I
didn't hear the response, is that could you break out geographically the growth in emerging markets between – also
between volume and pricing?
And secondly, it is true that volume has been negative four quarters in a row. And to what extent you feel that this has
been problems in the way you execute pricing as it happened in Russia and Mexico and whether those execution issues
have been resolved? My understanding is that you have removed some of the heads of China and Latin America. All
these changes are over. Shall we expect pricing to be less disruptive going forward? Thank you.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So first, I'm sorry, I did miss the first part of Nik's question, thanks for bringing that back. The
relationship of organic volume to organic sales in the October-December quarter, developed markets organic volume
was plus 2%; organic sales were plus 3%. If you look at developing, organic volume was minus 6%; organic sales were
flat versus year-ago. If you look at those comparisons, they are indicative of exactly what I've said a couple times on
this call in terms of what's driving the volume reductions. It's pricing in developing markets to offset FX. Where you
don't have as much of an FX impact, for instance in the developed markets, our volumes grew at 2% on the quarter.
In terms of – you mentioned Mexico as an example. We actually had a very good quarter in Mexico. The changes that
we've made there we're very pleased with. Organic sales were up 4% in Mexico on the quarter. And remember, I talked
about the tissue towel impact or the tissue change in the portfolio which has negatively impacted organic sales; that's in
Mexico. Excluding that, Mexico organic sales were up 8% in the quarter and volume was up as well. So again, there's a
bit of noise as we work through the combination of the portfolio and foreign exchange. But we expect volume will

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James.
<Q - Joseph Nicholas Altobello>: Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question is on Brazil. I apologize if I missed this.
But what were the Brazilian sales in the quarter? I think last quarter was down 12%, and you were hoping for a little bit
of a bounce back this quarter.
And secondly on commodities. Jon, you mentioned earlier that you're not seeing the benefit that some would think you
would, given the move in oil. But obviously, it is a positive for you this year. So what kind of boost do you see from
commodities to earnings this fiscal year? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Joe. Brazil for the quarter, organic sales were up 11%. That compares to minus 12%
the prior quarter. I think that again is another good example of the volatility that's going to occur here as we get the
right pricing set in the market and as well our ability to pull that through and generate growth on a sustainable basis. So
again, Brazil was up 11% on the quarter.
In terms of commodities, looked at as a single variant, so just the reduction of input costs, that impact is about $500
million on the fiscal year. Some of that we anticipated going into the year, of course, but that's the amount. I would
argue that in total, in other words inclusive of consumption impacts in oil-producing countries where there's been
massive disruption and instability, if you think about markets like Saudi Arabia, markets like certainly Venezuela, I
would say that the net impact on our P&L is likely neutral to negative, but the pure cost impact is $500 million.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: Thanks, good morning. Hey, Jon, just wanted to follow up, since you highlighted the
changes made both in Mexico and India and not worth gaining sales if they're not worth anything. I think you said that
costs about a point to organic growth in the quarter. And if that's right, is that the expected impact for the next two,
three quarters, and is this a program that may accelerate as we move into fiscal 2017?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: The amount is the correct amount. You're right, it was about a point on the quarter. We would
expect – we really started this work in terms of execution in July-September, maybe some in the latter part of last fiscal
year, so we would expect this to continue through the next couple quarters, but then it should dissipate going forward.
There may be a few additional choices we need to make but, in general, you'll see it for the next couple quarters, and
then it should start to dissipate.

Your final question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys, thanks for fitting me into the call. Believe it or not, I still have a few questions. One is
just go deeper on volumes. Look, your compares clearly get easier over the next couple quarters, so that should
certainly bode well. But can you elaborate a little bit more and perhaps even quantify the inventory management
change by retailers and the trade turn change that you mentioned in the press release, which is mentioned as a negative,
particularly in the context of what you said on your prepared remarks, which is that sales being slightly ahead of
consumption? So give us a sense of the ongoing effects of those, if you could, number one.
Number two is on your FX multiplier between the top line and the bottom line impact. Why did it change so
dramatically versus your 2016 guidance? So what I mean is that in July, your FX impact was going to be negative 4%

to 5% top line, negative 3% to 4% bottom line, so less than one ratio. But now it's a negative 7% on the bottom line and
negative 10% on the bottom line, so very quickly shifting to a greater than one ratio, despite your efforts to localize
more, et cetera. So is that all Argentina devaluation, or is there some forecasting math that I'm not getting? Or can you
give us a sense of how you're structured or levered differently than we would have expected because it's a big switch in
a short period of time?
And the third question is more in terms of running these conference calls. Should we infer that the decision was made,
because I know you guys were thinking about this, that your CEO will not be on these quarterly calls and will only be
at things like CAGNY and the annual calls like A.G. [Lafley] was doing, or are you still in the deciding mode? Thanks
for those few questions.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: On the FX multiplier, as you can imagine, the different currencies that have – we have no
ability to forecast which currencies are going to move and how much they're going to move. And the top and bottom
line relationship between currency movements is very different depending on the market. It depends on how the market
is sourced. It depends on the balance sheet of the market. I mentioned balance sheet revaluations. So for example, in
Argentina, we talked about the balance sheet revaluation that occurred there. So it's really a function of what actually is
happening in the marketplace country by country, how we source the markets, and what the balance sheet exposure is
in different markets. So I guess I'm saying we don't really have a good ability to forecast exactly what the currency
impacts are going to be on either the top or bottom line. And frankly, we spend very little time thinking about the
relationship between the two.
In terms of the comments on trade inventory reduction, that is largely a China dynamic. I mentioned in prior calls that
our inventory levels were too high, particularly in the wholesale channel in China. And as a result, our pricing was too
low, which was driving a bit of distortion and difficulty for our distributors. And so we have made some choices to
address that, and that has a short-term volume impact. That's really what that comment was designed to indicate.
Relative to senior executive engagement with the investment community, we intend to be fully engaged with the
investment community through a combination of quarterly conference calls, investment conferences, meetings here in
Cincinnati. David will be on the road frequently as well interacting with the investment community. And so again, our
strategy is one of very high engagement.
