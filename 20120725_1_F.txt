Molly Tripp
Thank you, Katina, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us either by phone

factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors and other key
information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our Annual, Quarterly and Current Reports.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ford Credit CFO, Michael Seneski. Michael?
Michael L. Seneski
Thanks, Molly. Consistent with last quarter, today's presentation will cover Ford Credit's profit and credit loss
performance, Ford Credit funding and liquidity highlights, Automotive cash, debt and liquidity and then we'll wrap
things up with a summary of the quarter.
So, let's start off with Ford Credit's operating highlights on slide two. Ford Credit had another strong quarter with
pre-tax profit of $438 million and net income of $296 million. Managed receivables were $86 billion at the end of the
second quarter, up $1 billion from year end 2011 and equal to the first quarter.
When it comes to credit losses, we've had several consecutive quarters at or near historic lows. Second quarter charge
offs were $17 million, down $49 million from last year and the loss receivables ratio was 8 basis points. At June 30, the
allowance for credit losses or reserve was $406 million or 47 basis points of receivables. We paid distributions of $100
million in the second quarter and $300 million year-to-date. Managed leverage was 8.1:1 at June 30, 2012, compared to
8.3:1 at December 31, 2011. And at end of second quarter our equity was $9.1 billion.
Slide three shows $166 million decrease in second quarter pre-tax results compared with a year ago by causal factor.
The results are more than explained by fewer lease terminations, which resulted in fewer vehicles sold at a gain and
lower financing margin. The decline financing margin is explained primarily by the runoff of higher yielding assets
originated in prior years. As shown in the memo, Ford Credit's pre-tax profit decreased by $14 million compared with
the first quarter.
For full year 2012, Ford Credit continues to project full year pre-tax profit of about $1.5 billion and total distributions
to the parent of between $500 million and $1 billion. Ford Credit now projects managed receivables at year end to be in
the range of $85 billion $90 billion and managed leverage of 8:1 to 9:1 for the foreseeable future. This is a decrease
from the prior mid-decade target of 10:1 to 11:1 and is consistent with the goal of maintaining a strong investment
grade balance sheet. Lower leverage will result in a reduction in our mid-decade return target from low double-digits to
high single-digits.
Moving to slide four, this shows our quarterly trends of charge-offs, loss-to-receivables ratios, and credit loss reserve.
Our second quarter credit losses continue to be at historically low levels. Charge-offs were $17 million, down $32
million from the same period a year ago, reflecting lower repossessions in the United States. Charge-offs were down
$18 million from the first quarter 2012, reflecting the same factor just mentioned.
The credit loss reserve was $406 million, down $267 million from a year ago and down $73 million from the first
quarter of 2012, reflecting the decrease in charge-offs.
Slide five shows the primary drivers of credit losses in the U.S. Retail and Lease Business, which comprises
approximately 70% of our consumer portfolio. Over 60-day delinquencies were 13 basis points in the second quarter,
equal to the same period a year ago. Repossessions in the second quarter were 7,000 units, or 1.19% of average
accounts outstanding, down 52 basis points from the same period a year ago.
Severity of $6,700 in the second quarter was up $200 from the same period a year ago but equal to the first quarter. As
discussed on the prior slide, the charge-offs and the LTRs have declined on a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter
basis due to lower repossessions.
Slide six shows the U.S. Lease residual performance. As we've been highlighting for the past several quarters, Lease
return volumes in the second quarter were 40% lower than the same period last year, reflecting primarily the lower
Lease placements in 2009. The second quarter Lease return rate was 59%, up 4 percentage points compared with the
same period last year, reflecting a higher mix of 24 month contracts, which typically have higher return rates than

longer-term contracts.
In the second quarter, our auction values for 36-month vehicles declined by $325 per unit from the same period last
year. Compared with the first quarter, our 24-month and 36-month auction value performance was mixed.
Our worldwide net investment in operating leases was $12.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, up from $11.1
billion at year-end 2011.
With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.
Neil M. Schloss
Thanks, Mike. Turning to slide seven, the big news this quarter was that Ford and Ford Credit were upgraded to
investment grade by both Fitch and Moody's. It is an important proof point of our continued progress the team is
making with our One Ford plan. In addition to the release of collateral securing Ford's revolving credit facility, the
second investment grade triggered the exchange of Ford Credit's FUEL notes for unsecured notes.
We are on track to achieve our 2012 funding plan. In the second quarter, we completed $5.5 billion of funding in the
public markets and an additional $1.6 billion in July. We have completed $15.3 million of public term funding
year-to-date. During the quarter, we issued our first public investment grade unsecured debt transaction since 2005. Our
funding strategy remains focused on diversification, and we plan to continue accessing a variety of markets, channels
and investors.
We ended the quarter with about $33 billion of committed capacity, renewing about $10 billion in the second quarter,
including renewal of our 364 day FCAR facility. Our liquidity remains strong and we will maintain cash balances and
committed capacity to meet our business and funding requirements in all global market conditions. Moving forward we
are focused on achieving and maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet.
Moving to slide eight, which shows the trends in funding of our managed receivables. At the end of the second quarter,
managed receivables were $86 billion. We ended the quarter with $11 billion in cash and securitized funding was 48%
of managed receivables, which reflects the FUEL note exchange. Since the first quarter review, we have narrowed the
year-end 2012 managed receivables to a range of $85 billion to $90 billion. The change reduces the upper end of the
range reflecting uncertainty in Europe. Securitized funding is expected to represent about 49% of total managed
receivables at the end of the year. It is our expectation that securitized funding as a percent of managed receivables will
decline going forward.
Slide nine shows our 2012 public term funding plan for Ford Credit, excluding our short-term funding programs. Year
to-date, we have completed $15 billion of public term funding in the U.S., Canada and Europe, including about $6
billion of unsecured debt. This reflects well over half of our public term funding needs for the year. We project full
year public term funding in the range of $20 billion to $24 billion consisting of $8 billion to $10 billion of unsecured
debt and $12 billion to $14 billion of public securitizations. The public securitization range is up about $2 billion from
the first quarter reflecting a shift from private ABS to public ABS as a result of the success we have had in the public
markets.
Turning to slide 10, our liquidity remains strong at $21.6 billion, up about $3.5 billion from the prior quarter. The
increase primarily reflects lower conduit utilization and the FUEL note exchange. We expect liquidity to reduce
between now and year-end closer to the level we reported in the first quarter. Ford Credit sources of liquidity include
cash, unsecured credit facilities, our FCAR asset-backed commercial paper lines and asset-backed bank capacity. As of
June 30, we had $44 billion of cash and committed liquidity sources, down slightly from the first quarter, reflecting
lower cash and FCAR lines, offset partially by increases in conduit facilities. Utilization of our liquidity totaled $18.4
billion at quarter end, down $3.9 billion from the first quarter, primarily reflecting lower usage of our private capacity.
We ended the quarter with gross liquidity of $25.6 billion, which includes about $4 billion of capacity in excess of
eligible receivables, providing funding sources for future origination and flexibility to transfer capacity among different

asset classes and markets. Our liquidity remains strong and we are focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet our
business and funding requirements in all global market conditions.
Slide 11 summarizes our Automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of the second quarter. Automotive debt
was $14.2 billion at the end of the quarter compared to $13.7 billion at the end of the first quarter, reflecting additional
draw downs of low cost loans for advanced technology. We will make our last draw on these loans in August, with
repayments beginning in September.
We ended the quarter with net cash of $9.5 billion and Automotive liquidity of $33.9 billion, both increased when
compared to prior quarter.
Now let's close with a summary of the second quarter and I'm now on slide 12. Ford delivered our 12th consecutive
quarterly pre-tax operating profit, which was $1.8 billion. Net income was about $1 billion. Ford also generated
positive operating related cash flow and ended the quarter with Automotive net cash of $9.5 billion and liquidity of
$33.9 billion.
Ford and Ford Credit returned to Investment grade with upgrades from Fitch and Moody's during the quarter. As a
result, collateral securing Ford revolving credit facility was released and Ford Credit's FUEL notes were exchanged for
new unsecured notes.
Ford Credit had a strong second quarter with pre-tax profit of $438 million. Managed receivables at the end of the
quarter were $86 billion and credit losses continued at historically low levels. Year-to-date Ford Credit has completed
$15 billion in funding, well over half of our public term funding needs for the year. Ford Credit's liquidity was about
$22 billion for the quarter, which is in addition to Ford's liquidity of about $34 billion.
Ford Credit continues to support Ford's business with $100 million in distributions during the quarter. Total
distributions for 2012 are still expected to be between $500 million and $1 billion.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Molly to begin the Q&A session.
Molly Tripp
Thank you Neil. With that we'll start the question-and-answer session. Katrina can we please have the first question.
Q&A
Your first question comes from the line of Mark Altherr representing Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Mark Altherr>: Thank you. What was the change in the leverage driven by since Ford Motor Credit and Ford are
effectively combined for rating agency purposes, was that maybe driven by the one rating agency comment about the
standalone credit quality?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Yeah, actually thank you for asking that. As you know, as we've said in the past we believe
the underlying quality of our assets support actually a significantly higher leverage than what we've been running at.
However, we do like to look at our business separately and when compared with the competition and our goal to have a
strong investment grade balance sheet versus just BBB-, we believe that this is a prudent move and is consistent with
where we want to be in the future. So for the foreseeable future we'll be between 8:1 and 9:1.
<Q - Mark Altherr>: Okay. And great loss experience there, is that going to drive any loosening of your credit
standards maybe to bump up your share of overall Ford business?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: No. I appreciate that, but our underwriting standards have remained remarkably consistent.
I wish I could explain why customers are paying the bills, an 8 basis point LTR is something we've never really seen
before in the past, but we continue to underwrite three out of every four subprime customers who buy a Ford vehicle

are financed by Ford Credit, that hasn't changed and we expect that to continue going forward.
<Q - Mark Altherr>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Doug Karson representing Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Doug Karson>: Great, guys. Thank you for being in the queue here. One of my questions kind of focuses on
something that was chatted on the call earlier, I'm not sure if it's out of scope but it was regarding Europe capacity
utilization, there have been kind of some reports that with kind of contradictory information, some had said that
capacity utilization in Ford Europe is high and some in the 60% area. I'm just not clear on it?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yeah. Doug, thank you. This is Stuart Rowley. I think Alan responded to the question.
You're correct, there are numbers being quoted in the media and we're refraining from quoting capacity utilization
numbers. There are many different ways to measure capacity utilization, whether it be on a two shift basis or three shift
basis.
<Q - Doug Karson>: Sure.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: For the installed or manned capacity, so it can be somewhat confusing to make
comparisons. What we did confirm is clearly given the downturn in Europe, industry volumes are at a lowest level
since the mid-1990s, and as a result it's very clear that we have excess capacity. So that is clear, as does the industry as
a whole. But we're not quoting specific numbers.
<Q - Doug Karson>: Okay. And I guess the concept would be is that capacity unchangeable in the intermediate term
given the environment there and the unions and the issues surrounding some of those countries where capacity is
underutilized or just going to have to have volume grow to get the capacity back in the right area? Like how do we fix
that, is it fixable?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: So as Bob commented in a call earlier, we do view the situation in Europe as being
structural and not cyclical in nature. That's how we think about it and we have our plan, a key element of our plan is to
match production to demand and as we said we're reviewing all parts of our business, but we don't have anything cash
specific to share further today.
<Q - Doug Karson>: Okay.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: When we do we'll communicate with all stakeholders at the same time.
<Q - Doug Karson>: And back to Ford Credit – thank you for that answer. Ford Credit, I'm looking at Appendix 5 of
7, that's got Ford Credit operational highlights and we have a Europe line item that looks like contract placement
volume was 104,000, which was about flat, you are actually up year-over-year. I mean how has Ford Credit done in
Europe?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Doug, it's actually, we've been doing very well there. If you think about it from a share and
contract perspective, you can see that we continue to work closer and closer with the Motor Company, have improved
our share year-over-year. From a credit quality perspective, we continue to be at or near historic lows. Just to give you
a couple of data points, all of the big five markets showed improved 60-day delinquencies, both year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter. Their version of the repossession ratio improved both year-over-over and quarter-over-quarter for
all the big five except for Italy, which was a very small movement. And overall losses were down 32% year-over-year
and flat quarter-over-quarter. So all the metrics there for the portfolio are continuing to perform.
<Q - Doug Karson>: That's great. All right. I think that's it for me.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: And, Doug -

<Q - Doug Karson>: I appreciate it.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: And, Doug, just on the funding side, I think the other piece of the balance sheet, we continue to
renew the capacity. It's a market that, other than the Sterling deal we did earlier in the year, has been a market
dominated by ABS because that's the market that continues to be cost effective for us.
<Q - Doug Karson>: Right.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: And we're renewing capacity as it comes due. So, so far so good on that as well.
<Q - Doug Karson>: So liquidity is good there, too. Okay. Excellent. All right. Thanks a lot for taking my questions.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Selle representing JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Hey, good morning. A couple of housekeeping things. You guys had the variance in North
America, there was an other of $200 million. Could you guys give us the big stuff in that number? There was a positive
variance in other just year-over-year.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yes, Eric. Stuart Rowley here. Obviously, given a business of the size, there are a number
of other items that you get a large number of small items in there, but a couple of key pieces in that were improved
results in our FCSD business year-on-year and some improvement in our ACH business, lower losses, and other
component-related improvements. So, those two things accounted for about half of it, the other half -
<A>: OSC.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: – there is a raft of other minor items.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: That's great. And then on the cash slides, another other of $600 million coming in, can you guys
kind of give me the big components of that as well? It was right before cash before other actions?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: So, yes, there's one significant item in there which was release of a cash collateral related
to our business in Kaioba. That was the one major thing and there were also some affiliate transfers coming into the
Automotive business related to OPEB obligations.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: That's great. And don't mean to be anal, but you guys are giving kind of a $9.5 billion equity
year-end estimate for Ford Credit, EBT's going to be around $600 million, dividends to Ford are going to be around
$400 million, that gets you about halfway there. Is there anything I'm missing or it's just kind of rounding error or am I
being too anal on it?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Actually, I think the dividends, Eric, are going to be somewhere between $500 million and
$1 billion, so that's kind of you're movement.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: For the year, right?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Yeah, for the year, right.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: So that's about – I was just talking back half, your guidance for earnings is like $600 million EBT
and then backing out that $750 million midrange there is about $400 million in dividends in the back half alone?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Yeah, that would put you to the middle of the range and then, as we've said, our leverage
will fall out somewhere in the eight to nine range.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Okay. That's what I'm missing. And then you guys had a comment -I think Shanks had a comment
of earlier today he said Asia, Europe ended the quarter slightly better. It was an interview, obviously, didn't hear it. I
didn't hear that on the first call. I mean is it slightly better on incentives or are the competitors acting more rational

towards the end? Are we getting better foot traffic? Or is – am I reading into a quote on Bloomberg?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yeah. The – I think Bob was – this is Stuart Rowley, again, Eric. Bob was referring to, we
came out slightly better in those two regions. In our actual close, there was a raft of items, many small items, obviously
exchange rates at the final close vary from what we're forecasting. So nothing materially significant of itself. We just
had a strong close in those operations.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: And it's really referencing, Eric, the interview he did back the end of June, which said that the
international affiliates were going to lose about three times what they lost in the first quarter, and it was 190 in the first
quarter. And so the better than was referencing the fact that it wasn't as bad as we thought it was going to be.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: That's great. And then this is kind of a broader brush question and it's meant to be an offhanded
compliment, but you guys are investment grade. You guys could hit the market – our market's wide open. You guys,
you're generating cash under below trend volumes, you're a cash flow machine, and your focus is paying down debt. If
I look at your capital structure, I would argue one of the best returns is potentially buying back stock. Why wouldn't
you guys now look to that stock being so depressed on a multiple basis, obviously given your restructuring efforts – has
a very bright future in my mind. Why wouldn't you use some of that excess liquidity and take advantage of this here?
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Well, I think there's a broad question there on the overall capital strategy and we've got a lot of
things that we want to do with pension contributions, with funding the business and the growth, continuing to pay the
dividends that we started and I think we will continue to evaluate sort of the trade-offs on how that all works from a
standpoint of which actions we take when. But at this time we really don't have anything to add to what we're already
doing.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Sounds good. And I always appreciate your time. It was a good quarter.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Thanks, Eric.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brian Jacoby representing Goldman Sachs. Please
proceed.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Hi. Good morning, guys. I just have a few housekeeping items and then one kind of bigger
picture question. I'll start out with the big picture question. It was kind of touched on in the earlier call, but obviously
comment around a potential for a plant closure in Europe was made a few weeks back, and I mean at what point do you
guys feel you have to decide whether you'll need to actually close a plant or not? I mean is there a timeframe that you
feel that kind of you'll update the market on that or is this something that you're still kind of assessing and it could be a
year from now, it could six months from now? Any type of color there would be helpful.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: So, this is Stuart Rowley. So to answer that first question, we shared – we haven't made
any specific comments around plants, and as Bob Shanks described in the call earlier we're reviewing all parts of our
business. We do view the issues in Europe as being structural in nature and not cyclical but we don't have anything
further to share at this point in time and we are not providing any timeline for that. We will, of course, though
communicate any plans when the time is appropriate and we'll do that with all of the stakeholders involved.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Okay. And a few of the housekeeping items, just you've lowered the target leverage to eight to
nine times for the Credit business, is there the potential here, are you going to change the support agreement at all or is
that still based on an 11.5 times leverage?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: At this stage, Brian, I don't see us changing a support agreement. We're just changing our
guidance.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Just the guidance. And then pension versus paying down DoE loans, I mean, I would think that
your cash flow, you would probably peg towards more to the pension, because de-risking and so forth and given the

rate on the DoE loans is so low but I mean, can you kind of give us – is there any type of preference there for where
future cash flow will go when you're kind of looking at debt items and deciding between pension and DoE? I mean, I
would have to think it's pension.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: And I think we would agree with you on the fact that pension clearly is a higher priority
versus the DoE loans. We're making the final draw on the DoE loan this month, so it will be done in August, and then
per the agreement we actually start paying it down, amortizing it over the next 10 years, starting in September by
quarter. And so that'll just happen naturally. The average rate on it is less that 2.5%, so it's very, very cheap long-term
debt, which we would intend to keep and continue to work the balance sheet, both on the other debt as well as pensions
as we go forward.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Okay. And then last housekeeping question, can you break out how much – what the DoE loan
was, the Ex-Im and the EIB loans were separately for us? Is there any chance can you do that now or is that
something...
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: In the quarter or in total?
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: What the actual balance was at the end of the quarter for each?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Yeah. The end of the second quarter the DoE loan was $5.8 billion. And if you recall, from
the very beginning we had an allocated amount of $5.9 billion, so there's another $100 million to draw in the third
quarter. And I think the Ex-Im loan outstanding was about $250 million.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: And how about, do we have an EIB number? We could do it offline – it's fine.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Let us get back to you on that, but I think I have the – I think it's like £400 million – dollars,
yeah. So, it's about £400 million.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Okay. I appreciate it, guys. Good quarter.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Thanks.
