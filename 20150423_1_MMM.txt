Please turn to slide three and I will hand off to Inge.
Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. 3M executed well and delivered
another solid quarter of operational performance. We once again posted broad-based organic sales growth and
continued to improve profitability. Importantly, we achieved this against a more challenging first quarter economic
backdrop. The rising U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenues and profits, offset in part by hedging gains. In addition,
global economic growth slowed, which we saw a bit in our growth figures. As 3M always does, we continued to
manage the things within our control, execute our plan and build for the future.
I'll take you through the first quarter highlights. Earnings were $1.85 per share, up 3% year-over-year. Sales were $7.6
billion in the quarter, down 3% versus last year. Organic local currency growth was 3.3%. For the seventh consecutive
quarter, 3M posted organic growth in every business group, as well as across all geographic areas. As I mentioned, the
U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against a number of currencies reducing sales by 6.5%. We expanded
companywide margins to 23%, up nearly a full percentage point from last year. And all business groups delivered
margins greater than 21%. Rising margins and broad-based organic growth are more evidence that our portfolio actions
over the last three years are paying off.
This quarter, 3M took a number of additional steps to strengthening our portfolio. We announced plans to acquire
Polypore's Separations Media business for $1 billion, which will enhance our core filtration platform. Last month, we
completed acquisition of Ivera Medical, a good addition to our Health Care business. And at the same time, we
completed the sales of our Static Control business in January.
Also in the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And finally, we
increased the first quarter dividend by 20% on top of a 35% increase last year.
Nick will now go through the details of the quarter. Nick?
Nicholas C. Gangestad
Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide four, where I'll review the components of our first
quarter sales change. As Inge mentioned, in the quarter we delivered positive organic growth in all business groups and
geographic areas. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 3.3%, with volumes up 2.3% and selling prices up 1%.
Two Health Care-related acquisitions, namely Treo Solutions and Ivera Medical added 10 basis points to growth. This
impact was offset by the divestiture of the Static Control business, which reduced sales by 10 basis points.
The stronger U.S. dollar reduced sales by 6.5%. In U.S. dollars, total sales declined 3.2% versus the first quarter of
2014. The U.S. dollar strengthened significantly versus several foreign currencies during the first quarter, continuing a
trend that began in 2014. In particular, the average euro rate declined 18% versus the U.S. dollar year-on-year. The yen
declined 14% and the Brazilian real, 19%.
Looking more closely at organic local currency growth, Asia-Pacific led the way at 5.6%. Safety and Graphics again
posted the strongest growth in APAC at 9%, followed by Health Care at 8% and Electronics and Energy at 7%. Organic
growth was 7% in China/Hong Kong or 8% excluding Electronics, similar to recent quarters. Japan was up against a
challenging comp. Recall that Japan's organic growth was 20% in the first quarter of last year leading up to the April 1,
2014 consumption tax increase.
EMEA organic growth was slightly positive in the first quarter with West Europe flat, Central East Europe up
mid-single digits and Middle-East, Africa down slightly. Organic growth in EMEA was led by Electronics and Energy
and Safety and Graphics at 4% and 1% respectively. We posted 4% organic growth in Latin America/Canada where

Industrial, Safety and Graphics and Health Care all grew 5%. Mexico delivered another outstanding result with 15%
organic growth in the quarter and Brazil was down 2%.
The United States grew 3.1% organically with Industrial, Health Care and Consumer each growing 4%. Safety and
Graphics and Electronics and Energy each grew 3%.
Please turn to slide five for the first quarter P&L highlights. First quarter sales were $7.6 billion, down 3.2%. Operating
income on the other hand increased nearly 1% to $1.7 billion, and earnings rose over 3% to $1.85 per share. Early in
the year, it became apparent that business conditions would be more uncertain, particularly given that the U.S. dollar
was moving higher. As always, we had contingency plans in place and we executed those plans as Q1 played out.
Gross margin improvements and strong SG&A productivity allowed us to increase first quarter operating margins by
90 basis points year-on-year to 22.8%. For the full year, we expect operating margins to increase by a minimum of 1
percentage point.
Let's take a closer look at this quarter's margin improvement. Organic volume leverage added 20 basis points to
operating margins. And the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 120 basis
points of margin expansion. We continued to generate positive selling price changes across our businesses, boosted by
3M's world-class material science and strong new product flow, both of which are important elements of our business
model. In addition, we have been raising prices in select countries to help mitigate the impact of currency devaluations.
On the raw material front, we are benefiting from both lower commodity prices and from our sourcing team's ongoing
negotiation efforts. We expect raw material benefits to gain momentum as the year progresses. Productivity added 30
basis points to margins, as spending remained under good control in the quarter and foreign currency impacts, net of
hedge gains, were neutral to margins.
First year acquisitions were 10 basis points dilutive to our operating margin in the quarter. In addition, we continued to
make other strategic investments, including disruptive R&D programs along with business transformation and ERP.
These investments reduced operating margins by 20 basis points year-on-year. Finally, higher pension and OPEB
expense reduced first quarter operating margins by 50 basis points. As a reminder, this year's pension increase is a
result of the adoption of new mortality tables along with a lower discount rate.
Summarizing the first quarter P&L, our teams executed well in the face of currency headwinds and a more mixed
economic backdrop. EPS expanded year-on-year and margins increased by nearly 1 percentage point.
Now let's turn to slide six for a closer look at earnings per share. Earnings for the first quarter were $1.85 per share, an
increase of 3.4%. Organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.14 to the EPS increase in the quarter. This
included a $0.04 headwind from higher pension and OPEB expense. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced
pre-tax earnings by $90 million or the equivalent of $0.10 a share. The first quarter tax rate was 29.5% versus 27.4% in
the comparable quarter, which reduced earnings per share by $0.05. The increase was due to geographic mix which was
influenced by the strong U.S. dollar. In addition, Q1 2014 included a one-time benefit that did not repeat. Average
diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% versus last year's first quarter, which added $0.07 to first quarter earnings
per share.
Now let's review cash flow performance on slide number seven. We generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow in the
quarter, in line with Q1 2014. Capital expenditures were $291 million, consistent with last year's first quarter. Our full
year expected CapEx range is $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, down $100 million versus prior estimates, all due to the
stronger U.S. dollar. First quarter free cash flow was $789 million and we converted 66% of net income to cash, in line
with last year's first quarter. Note that the first quarter is typically our seasonal low. For the full year, we continued to
expect to be in the range of 90% to 100%.
As Inge mentioned earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 20%. We paid out $652 million in cash
dividends during the quarter. Gross share repurchases were $886 million in the first quarter and we continue to plan $3
billion to $5 billion for the full year.

Now let's review our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to slide number eight.
Industrial with sales of $2.7 billion delivered organic local currency growth of 3% in the quarter. Our aerospace and
commercial transportation, automotive OEM and 3M Purification businesses all generated high-single-digit growth.
We also posted positive organic growth in Advanced Materials and Industrial Adhesives and Tapes. On a geographic
basis, Latin America/Canada set the pace with organic growth of 5%. The U.S. was up 4%, Asia-Pacific increased 3%,
and EMEA was flat.
We continued to invest for the future within Industrial. During the quarter, we announced our intent to acquire
Polypore's Separations Media business for $1 billion. This business is a leading provider of microporous membranes
and modules for filtration in the life sciences, industrial and specialty segments. The acquisition will enhance 3M's core
filtration platform and help generate new growth opportunities across the company. Wrapping up on Industrial's first
quarter performance, operating income was $598 million and operating margins were 22.5%, up 20 basis points versus
last year's Q1.
Now let's turn to Safety and Graphics on slide nine. First quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion,
increasing 4% organically. Personal safety grew high-single-digits in the quarter. Workers' safety remains a high
priority for manufacturers globally and we are gaining share. In addition, our respiratory products are continuing to sell
well in China, where air quality is an ongoing concern.
Commercial solutions and traffic safety and security each posted positive organic growth, while roofing granules
declined year-on-year. Asia-Pacific delivered 9% organic growth. Latin America/Canada increased 5%. The U.S. was
up 3% and EMEA increased 1%. Operating income was $335 million, and operating margins increased 2.1 percentage
points to 24.4%. Margins in this business continued to be boosted by strong productivity and a keen focus on
prioritization and portfolio management.
Let's now turn to Health Care on slide 10. Health Care delivered sales of $1.3 billion and organic growth of 3%.
Growth was strongest in food safety, critical and chronic care, and health information systems. Our inflection
prevention and oral care businesses also posted positive growth in the quarter. The drug delivery systems business
declined year-over-year.
Geographically, organic growth in Asia-Pacific was 8%, while Latin America/Canada and the U.S. each grew 4%.
EMEA declined 1%. In developing markets, Health Care grew 10% organically, marking the 13th consecutive quarter
of double-digit growth. This has been a high priority investment area of ours for some time, as Health Care markets
rapidly evolve in developing countries.
In March, we successfully closed the acquisition of Ivera Medical Corporation. This business will enhance 3M's
vascular access product offerings to Health Care facilities. Integration is going smoothly and we look forward to
expanding this business globally.
Health Care's operating income was $408 million and margins remained strong at 30.7%. Note that first quarter
margins absorbed 40 basis points of dilution from the Ivera and Treo acquisitions. Therefore, underlying margins were
31.1%.
Next we will look at Electronics and Energy on Slide 11. Electronics and Energy delivered 6% organic local currency
growth in the first quarter, with sales of $1.3 billion. Organic local currency sales grew 12% in our Electronics-related
businesses, as we continue to see strong consumer demand enhanced by spec-in wins at several OEMs. In our
energy-related businesses, organic local currency sales declined 3%. The electrical markets business was flat, while
telecom and renewable energy both declined year-on-year. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Electronics and
Energy increased 7% in Asia-Pacific, 4% in EMEA and 3% in both U.S. and Latin America/Canada.
The divestiture of the Static Control business, which closed on January 2, 2015, reduced sales by 90 basis points in the
first quarter. As a reminder, sales for this business were $46 million in 2014. Operating income for Electronics and
Energy was $283 million and margins increased 4.1 percentage points year-over-year to 21.4%. Recent portfolio
management actions are improving our relevance with customers, enhancing our growth capabilities, and contributing
to higher productivity and margins.

Please turn to slide 12. First quarter sales in Consumer were $1 billion with organic growth of 2%. All four businesses
in Consumer grew organically led by do-it-yourself and home care, each growing mid-single digits. Looking by
geography, the U.S. grew 4%, and Asia-Pacific increased 2%. EMEA and Latin America/Canada declined slightly
year-on-year. Operating income increased to $240 million and margins were 22.9%. Margins rose 1.7 percentage points
year-over-year. The business continues to drive efficiencies through investment prioritization and executing on
productivity programs.
Before turning to our 2015 outlook, let me comment on Corporate and Unallocated. Net expense was $100 million in
the first quarter versus $72 million in Q1 of 2014, with U.S. and pension, postretirement expenses being the primary
reason for the increase. For the full year, we estimate Corporate and Unallocated net expense to be approximately $400
million. That wraps up our first quarter results.
Please turn to slide 13, where I'll address our full year planning estimates. On organic growth, we expect 3% to 6% for
the year, so no change versus prior thinking. Foreign currency translation is forecasted to reduce 2015 U.S. dollar sales
by 6% to 7%, up from a previous range of 4% to 5%. For the second quarter specifically, we expect FX to reduce sales
by 8%. With respect to earnings, we now anticipate full year EPS of $7.80 to $8.10 per share, versus a previous
estimate of $8.00 to $8.30 per share.
In our fourth quarter business review on January 27, recall that we estimated our foreign currency impacts would
reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.20 per share. Of course since then, the dollar has strengthened further.
Today, we estimate that foreign currency impacts will reduce 2015 full-year earnings by $0.35 to $0.40 per share, or an
incremental headwind of $0.15 to $0.20 per share versus our January estimates. These figures are net of hedging.
For Q2 in particular, we anticipate that foreign currency impacts will reduce earnings by $0.13 per share. For the tax
rate, we anticipate a range of 28.5% to 29.5% versus 28% to 29% prior. The stronger U.S. dollar is impacting our profit
mix by country, which is leading to a higher effective tax rate. Finally, no change as it relates to free cash flow
conversion. We continue to expect a range of 90% to 100% for the year.
I will now turn the call back to Inge for a few final comments.
Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, Nick. I'm pleased with the performance of our team in the first quarter. We executed our playbook and
delivered solid results in a tougher external environment. Now, more than ever our teams remain keenly focused on
efficient growth, focused both on organic growth, and of course, productivity. As Nick described, we also took a
number of additional steps to carefully manage first quarter expenses in anticipation of a difficult economic
environment, clearly necessary given external realities. As we navigate short-term challenges, we also continue to
invest for long-term success. This includes portfolio investments, as I mentioned earlier, as well as our ongoing
commitment to building our core strength.
I've talked to you before about 3M's four fundamental strengths, which are leveraged across our enterprise; technology,
manufacturing, global capabilities and our brand. On technology, for example, we increased R&D investment in the
quarter, while at the same time managing our SG&A investments very carefully. We expanded 3M's global capabilities,
including breaking ground on a new customer innovation center in Chengdu in West China. As you heard from Nick,
our 3M China team continues to execute well, delivering 7% organic growth. We remain very optimistic about 3M's
future in China. And our new innovation center in West China will allow us to collaborate even more closely both with
local and global customers, and help us take advantage of growing opportunities in that region in China.
In March, we also refreshed our brand platform, which includes our new tag line, 3M Science. Applied to Life.
Through our brand work we will enhance awareness of how 3M uses science to solve problems and improve lives. So
in summary, it was a solid first quarter for 3M. Our team performed well against tough economical headwinds. We
continue to make investments for the future.

And by that, we are now open to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Inge, perhaps maybe just focusing on organic growth for a second, the 3% plus that you did
this quarter was towards the lower end of your full-year range, and yet as you progress through the year, your comps
are going to get a little bit more difficult. So, maybe you can just talk about the portfolio and the confidence in perhaps
seeing some organic growth acceleration as the year progresses.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. You're right. It was a little bit slower than we have seen in the past. And the way I look
upon it is, specifically as you came off Q4, it was around 6%. But I think overall when you look upon the economy
around the world, the fourth quarter was much stronger than what we saw in the first quarter on a global basis. So I
think first of all, our performance relative to IPI is in the same level as we have seen in the past. I think when you look
upon our performance, you could see – as you see there, you see a little bit of lower growth in Health Care, which is
related to basically one thing, but you can add them together. One, it's relative to West Europe and it's relative to our
drug delivery system that is, I will say, a project-based business. So you will have some businesses going in and out of
that business based on year-end or quarter.
So when I look upon Health Care, that's basically what you can see. Our core business in Health Care did very well
again. And as you see, we maintained very high margin, et cetera. When I look upon Industrial, we had 4% growth in
United States for Industrial in the quarter, which is acceptable and I think that was related very much to and became
maybe some uncertainty generally speaking around what will happen for export due to the dollar strengthening, and
also what you saw in oil. I think people specifically, not so much what is designed in and specked-in, but maybe on the
consumables just became a little bit cautious as you went into the quarter.
So I don't see that as an issue either. And as you know that's a big business for us and we continue to invest in IBG.
When I say big, it's our biggest; it's 33% of our portfolio. You saw again Electronics and Energy did very well. We,
after the reorganization and realignment of that business now over two years ago, we really get good traction based on
our relevance to customers and speed to market, et cetera. And Safety and Graphics had also a good quarter and
specifically in personal safety that is going into respiratory business. We're doing very well on a global basis, even if it
was maybe a little bit slow in West Europe in the quarter, but very well in Asia again and whole of APAC doing very,
very well. And then finally, Consumer that you saw had a 2% growth. 4% was in U.S., which is our bigger business. I
would say there the slowness was in West Europe and Latin America was slow for them.
So when I – as we all know, a quarter stop and end, there's always something going in and out of the quarter. I looked
very carefully on six months comparisons going back over two years. And when we look upon that over two years with
six months comparisons because you don't know always if Easter is coming in Q1 or Q2, et cetera, we have for the last
two years on that comparison been in the range of 4% to 6% always in 4% to 5% during that period. So this was on the
low end, but still in 3% to 6% that we have set for the year. And when we look upon and talk to the businesses what we
see going out for the year, I'd say that maybe Q2 will be very similar to Q1, maybe a slight improvement but we not
count too much on that, and then you will see for the rest of the year, more growth will come.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: That's really helpful coloring. Thank you. And maybe my one follow-up question for Nick.
Can you just – can you decompose the price cost for the quarter? You had 120 basis points in benefit. What portion of
it was related to FX and can you elaborate a little bit on the raw material piece gaining momentum as the year

progresses?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Sure, Joe. Happy to break that down. As I said earlier, in total, those components price
and raw materials added 120 basis points. You can split that right down the middle, half of that is coming from selling
price increases and half of that is coming from lower raw material commodity prices that we're paying. And then in
total what we reported for 1% price growth for the first quarter, Joe, about two-thirds of that is directly or indirectly
driven by FX movements and about one-third of that is driven by 3M innovation and the new product flow we have.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay, great. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: A little bit of a strange question for you, Inge, but when you think about China up 7% is a
very, very respectable number. But Consumer was up kind of 2%-ish and you seemed to be doing really well in China
in Auto and Industrial, but Consumer always seems to be a little bit of a challenge. Can you help us understand is it a
function of price points and brand or focus or is there – when we think about the Consumer build-out in China, there
seems to be an opportunity for you guys but I'm not sure your business is really that big in the grand scheme of things
over there and doesn't seem to be growing that fast.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. First of all, yes, we do well in China. We have good traction there. And again, this
quarter we had 7% growth, in fact, 8% in the core business if you take out the Electronics. As I talked earlier, the way
the evolution of businesses are going, it's starting with Industrial followed by Electronics and Energy, then Safety, then
Consumer, finally Health Care. So Consumer for us is a smaller portion in China and so is actually Health Care as well.
I think the answer to your question is that it's very much around brand awareness. And brand is in our mind. It's where
we all grew up, what we are used to, et cetera. So it take longer time in order for you to build awareness in those
businesses.
So we still see growth opportunities in China for Consumer, but in that specific market I will turn Health Care and
Consumer around and say Health Care will get faster traction for us than Consumer. So I will say, I agree with you. I
had hoped we will be bigger at this point in time. I'd hope we'd been able to grow faster, but we will over time. So it is
– we have some very strong brands. It's just that it takes time for us to get awareness and build out in the category, and
we're also very careful who we deal with in China relative to the channel partners.
So I think it's – over time it will be big. We grow faster and we just need to make sure that we get with that business
good profitability for us as well, right? So we are not, as you know, giving away things and it's not only about market
share. Need to make sure that we are investing in businesses where we get the good return. And there're some very

<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Yeah. Now that's...
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Huh?
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Yeah. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up to that, I mean, when you think about pricing
going on getting 1% price in this type of a lower raw material environment and challenging macro, in general, what is
the interplay between price and volumes? I mean, did you give up some volume this quarter to get that price? It's hard
to say with some of your markets create the category, so it seems like you should be able to get pretty good pricing
power, but clearly with the currency moves, I would imagine you have some local competitors who might be able to

keep price a little bit lower for a while and take some share. How do you think about that?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yes, Scott. We don't see that we're giving up volumes in exchange for price. And it
really comes back to 3M's business model of investing in innovation, having that strong new product flow. It gives us
the ability to reflect the value that we're creating in the markets and for our customers. So it's something we're
conscious of, we monitor, but right now, Scott, we're not seeing our stance on pricing in light of the current cost raw

Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Deane.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning, Deane.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Hey. On the topic of FX, Nick, maybe if you could help critique the effectiveness of the new
hedging program. Just you extended the duration from 12 months to 24 months, but how is that program working
versus your expectations?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Deane, it would be – thanks for the question. For those that may not know what
Deane's talking about, in the middle of 2014, we extended the tenure in our hedging program to go out from our past
policy of going out and hedging 12 months out to now hedge in addition to that 24 months and 36 months out. And to
answer your question, it's going quite well, Deane. The true impact of going out with the tenure to 24 months and 36
months, that will manifest in 2016 and if you look at the amount of deferred gains that we have in our hedging
program, that's reflective of our – of that change in our hedging program.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Great. And then a follow-up would be for, Inge, on the Polypore acquisition. And maybe if you
could just take us through and maybe this has a little bit of the boost that Ceradyne gave you was, where else will you
apply ultrafiltration across 3M's businesses? And then within your answer, maybe what does ultrafiltration give you
that CUNO did not?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. First of all, as we not have closed on Polypore I would not like to talk about that
specifically, right? So we have to respect the regulatory approvals that we are waiting for. So I will not talk about that.
But if you think about it broader relative to our filtration business, that is a huge opportunity for us. And I will look
upon that as – I will combine it if you like to think about it in terms of our non-woven technologies combined with
what we have in our purification business and then some additional technologies that will be added later on. So, if you
think about global megatrends that are related to both air pollution and clean water, that is where we will play big time
with a platform as we go ahead.
So I would say that I'm very encouraged actually relative to our current performance both in purification and in
personal safety that is around respiratory products, and we will build out those businesses as we go. So, think about it
as a good way of us to extend our technology capabilities in order to create more value in those spaces, which is both
global megatrend but also local megatrends. And as Scott and I talked about earlier relative to China, China – this is a
huge opportunity as we all know and everyone know that, but you need to be able to capitalize on it with technologies
because in the end of the day this is very much a regulatory business, and we need to make sure we have product that
meet the standards.

Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks and good morning. Did you all see any volume destocking across your
distribution in any of the business units? We've been hearing some short-term trends from some other companies on
that front.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Destocking or...?
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Destocking. Yeah.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. I think that when you look upon it, I will not say yes big time, but I suspect that all of us
leading businesses like we do at 3M and our customers, some uncertainty came in Q1 as I said earlier, both relative to
exports from U.S. based on the strength of the dollar and oil price. I think that most companies, generally speaking,
were very careful of how you build and manage your inventory in Q1. So I think I will be surprised even if I don't have
any facts in front of me to say that people managed the inventory very tightly and as tight as they could in Q1. And so
did we, by the way, right? So it's – I think that's the answer.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Steve, this is Matt. Maybe one comment in the Consumer business, which you'll see on one of
the slides. Our point-of-sale growth was good. It was higher than our actual growth. So there may have been some – a
little bit of inventory takeout at the retail channel.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And then Matt, on the Consumer side, I think that was still the lowest growth
since, what, maybe the fourth quarter of 2013. Was that related in any way or...?
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Yeah, that was the point. The out-the-door sales were actually better than that. So...
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: ...there's some adjustment there in the channel.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And then a follow-up question on pricing. You mentioned earlier that two-thirds
of the 1% pricing increase was FX related and a third was – roughly was new product development and et cetera. So
I'm just trying to get a sense, are you seeing pressure on pricing in – that you think is currency driven in other markets
from an export perspective from your competition? Is this something where people are trying to take advantage of it?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Steve, we're on – that's something we're constantly on the look-out for in this
time of volatile FX, is this changing the competitive landscape for us? And at this point, we are not seeing evidence of
it changing our competitive landscape or our ability to price in manners similar to how we priced in the past in multiple
geographies, including the United States.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. Okay, great. I'll pass it on. Thanks.

<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Maybe just a follow-up on sort of tightly managing business in the first quarter. As you
mentioned you're kind of doing that with inventories and others are as well with FX and oil uncertainty. Is that
uncertainty now viewed as – or do you view it as having lessened given some stabilization I guess in the prices of oil
and the currencies or such that you would manage those things less tightly in 2Q or how do you view that where we
stand today?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: In terms of managing our spending tightly, I don't see that changing as the year goes
on. Particularly in markets like West Europe and the United States, some of our developed markets where we're
managing our spending pretty carefully right now.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. I would say that there will not be any change as we move into Q2 here relative to
operation. I will say that the team here is on this big time, so there will be no change short term relative to what we
need to do. And we have an aggressive plan for the year and we will do everything we can in order to make sure we
deliver on that one.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: And then just in terms of how the first quarter progressed, we're getting sort of different
stories from different companies about how the year kind of started and exited 1Q. Did you see any variation across the
months of the quarter, either a slow start that improved or vice versa?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah. That's something we're always looking at is, is there a change in trend. And as
we look, as our revenue progressed through the quarter, we really did not see a meaningful trend one direction or the
other throughout the quarter. We had one-off things occurring like when Chinese New Year is and when Easter is.
When we adjust for those things, we really see no meaningful trend through the quarter.

Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah. So, Nick, just wanted to go back to the raw material commentary. I think you guided for $0.15
to $0.25 benefit for the full year back in December. And it looks like you have about $0.05 of benefits this quarter. So
are we now looking at a situation where the raw material benefits now above the $0.25 given your commentary that it's
more back-end loaded in your plan?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: We – yeah. So, in December, we laid out a range of $0.15 to $0.25 that we were
expecting for raw material commodity price benefits. On January 27, in our fourth quarter earnings call, we updated
that to say we now see ourselves at the high end at $0.25. And, Nigel, what we have been seeing is this is playing out
almost exactly as we've expected. It's from a commodity pricing, we see it fairly balanced throughout the year. The
only nuance on that is that there's some inventory channel work through of using slightly more expensive inventory
through our channel, which is what makes it just a little bit less in the first quarter, but that's all progressing right to our
$0.25 that I stated back in January.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: My math on the benefits, on the 60 bps of benefits, that's about $0.05, is that about right for the
quarter?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: 60 bps would be about approaching...

<A - Matthew Ginter>: I think it's about $0.04, Nigel, but we'll get back to you.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah. That's fine. Thanks for that. And then just secondly, on the margin bridge, I just want to
understand the neutral impact of FX because we'd assume that the hedge gains would have been a net benefit to
margins. So I just want to understand why that's flat. And if possible, if you could call out how much of the gain came
through in 1Q.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah. There's a couple of different forces there, Nigel, that in this quarter netted out to
no change to the margin. There's the hedging gain, which is an absolute upside benefit to the margin, but that's offset by
a differential to the margin where we source things, to the extent to which our international companies source product
from a U.S. dollar currency. That has a negative impact on margins. Those two things offset each other in 20 – in the
first quarter of 2015. As we look out over the remaining three quarters of the year; that will likely become slightly
accretive to our margin. Very similar to what we saw in second quarter and then a little more accretive in second and
third and fourth quarter.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Any way you could quantify that, Nick?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Excuse me, Nigel?
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Any way you can quantify that – the benefit?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Oh, when I'm saying – I'm talking small like 10 basis points, 20 basis points, 30 basis
points just to put a range on that.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Thanks. And I apologize for the nutty questions. I'll pass it on. Thanks a lot.

<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: On the hedging dynamics, I guess, when you kind of do the math on that. I'm not sure
whether it's in the 10-K or not or the 10-Q, but what are you looking at for 2016 if the euro stays where it is today? Is
there an impact there? Do you go all the way out through 2016?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Steve, we are hedged out through 2016, in fact, a little into 2017. And just to put
the numbers on it, for 2015 versus 2016, we're estimating approximately $175 million of hedge gains to our P&L in
2015. And if everything stayed right where it is that would be followed by $110 million of hedge gains in 2016.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Got you. Okay. Has anything changed with regards to how the forex is dropping
through, exclusive of the hedges? I think Danaher today talked about a higher margin on their drop through.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: No. I'm...
<A - Matthew Ginter>: I guess what I'd say, Steve, is back to the – a couple of questions ago, when we're hedging,
and the dollar is strong, net-net it should be slightly positive to margins as Nick just alluded to. And that is our
expectation for the year. So when we calculate that – when we calculate the impact, we take our numbers and pull out
the sales impact from FX and the bottom line impact from FX, recount the margin and if you're hedging by definition,
your margin should go up slightly.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Right. Right. So one last question just on – so basically similar growth in the second
quarter to the first quarter. Should we be – I mean can growth get to in this kind of economy, this kind of outlook, can
growth get to like above 6% in the second half? I mean is that should we be thinking about high end of the range type
of growth in the second half of the year? I mean, can it accelerate that much?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, we do not change our guidance for the year at this point in time. So you have 3% to 6%.
And so I think you're describing correct, as I said earlier, think about it very similar to Q2 as Q1 and then we will see
an acceleration in the last part of the year, second half. And I'd not predict at this point in time how high it will go,
right, because we are not immune to the economical environment and how that will accelerate. But our performance of
1.5x to 1.7x IPI is steady as I said, historically, when I look upon those six months period that you and I have talked
about earlier, so it's – I'm optimistic of the 3% to 6% for the year.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: And then just one last question, are you guys seeing any impact from competitors,
global competitors, given the foreign exchange movements? I think of your products is pretty defendable with good
modes but anybody getting aggressive out there on price?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Well, we have all type of competitors, right? We have global competitors. We have
regional competitors. We have local competitors, so we are working with this the whole time, and I will say as Nick
said earlier, up to this point in time we have not seen any change in the behaviors. This is where we see the whole time
when we do business on a day-to-day basis. So, answer to that is no. But of course we have competitors, right, and they
are everywhere and they are very attractive of course to come into spaces where we are because there's growth and
there's good margins. But we have not seen any change in their behaviors up to this point in time.

<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: ...couple really quick one. Good morning. Just back on FX, I would imagine those hedges are
on a handful of major currencies. My question is if you – maybe that's right or wrong, but the larger question is, if you
think about that $110 million hedge gain that you had for 2016, does that fully cover kind of the top line driven FX
headwind you'd expect in 2016, if we just run through at these rates for the rest of this year and into next year?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Okay, Jeff, a couple of questions there to go through. One is, it's largely in developed
markets and those currencies that we're able to cost-effectively hedge. So currencies like the euro, the Canadian dollar,
the yen, the Australian dollar, those are examples where we do the majority of our hedging. Other currencies such as
the Brazilian real, that's less cost effective for us to hedge, in markets and currencies like that, our approach is to rely
more on natural hedges. Meaning how much do we source locally, our ability to price to offset some of the FX
movement, our ability to manage our cost structure in those places. Those are part of 3M's playbook on managing FX
in more developing markets. To your question on does this fully cover the currency exposure going into 2016? No, it
doesn't. It's never our intent with our hedging strategy, our financial hedging strategy to offset all of the risk. We offset
a portion of it to help minimize reduce volatility, and we also do it to buy time for us to adjust our business models
accordingly. So it doesn't negate all of the risk in 2016, but it buys us more time and take some of that volatility off the
table.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right. Thanks. And I was just wondering on strategic investments, is there any change in
tempo over the course of the remainder of the year?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: No. There's not. I mean, we are working our plan and we are a couple of years into it as you
know. So there is no change in the tempo relative to our ERP program or investment in research and development, in
what we call the I3 or any small restructuring as we're doing here and there when we have the opportunity to do it. So
the plan from that perspective is working and it's working well for us.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Two quick ones. Can you characterize how you see the set up for the year in European
auto? Some companies have talked about that as being the most likely area for green shoots in terms of domestic
activity. And secondly, are there any regions or end markets where, as you look at the sequential trends into March and
April, the deceleration was sharply worse than you expected?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, on the European front, first of all, our automotive business globally is doing very well. I
mean we have 9% growth in the quarter versus 1% growth in the [ph] outer belt, (58:19) so again we are doing very,
very well. And that's a global business, so we do well with all the global players. Relative to Europe, we have good
penetration on design and spec-in there, as all other places. And you could assume, but who knows that in the later part
of the year the export, generally speaking, for West Europe will improve due to the dollar versus euro and other
currency. And by then, by definition, automotive will capitalize on that as well. So, assuming that, that is correct, as
everyone talk about, then there will be improved export from Europe generally speaking. Automotive, by definition, is
a big engine for growth in West Europe as we all know. Now many of the automotive makers, they're designing and
spec-in on certain places and they could use it to other parts of the world. But many of them in Europe are exporting
quite a bit outside of West Europe in terms of the manufacturing. To your second quarter, no, I will not say there was
any change with more than, which is a small piece, is Middle East Africa. Middle East Africa, as we all know and
understand due to geopolitical issues face challenges, so I would say that was not in March. I think that was for the
whole first quarter was total different environment to do business. And so I think that's the only place that we could see
