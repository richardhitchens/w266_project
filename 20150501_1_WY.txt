Doyle R. Simons
Thank you, Denise, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings for the first
quarter of $90 million or $0.17 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Excluding a $9 million after-tax charge
related to a non-strategic asset, we are $99 million or $0.19 per diluted share.
We were pleased with our first quarter performance in Timberlands and Wood Products as our operational excellence
efforts enabled both businesses to improve earnings compared with the fourth quarter despite weaker market
conditions. Our Cellulose Fiber business faced several challenges in the quarter including ongoing West Coast port
disruptions, a strengthening U.S. dollar and a slower than expected restart of our largest fluff mill following a
scheduled maintenance outage. Our earnings before special items also included non-cash foreign exchange losses of
approximately $0.04 per diluted share related to debt held by our Canadian entity.
We continue to aggressively execute our share repurchase program. During the first quarter, we repurchased over $250
million of common shares – it's $250 million of common shares. In total, through the end of the first quarter we had
repurchased over $450 million or 65% of our $700 million share authorization.
I'll begin the discussion of our business results with some brief comments about the housing market. U.S. housing
activity paused in the first quarter as severe winter weather delayed the spring selling season and disrupted construction
activity throughout much of the country. Although reported new home sales were lower than anticipated in the first
quarter, we're encouraged by the recent positive homebuilder sentiment regarding an improving spring selling season.
Employment growth, strong consumer confidence, and historically low mortgage rates should support improvement in
new home sales this year. Our outlook for 2015 remains unchanged at approximately 1.1 million starts.
Let me now turn to our business segment starting with Timberlands, charts three to five. Timberlands contributed $162
million to first quarter earnings, an increase of $19 million compared with the fourth quarter. Operational excellence
initiatives related to cost efficiency and log merchandizing more than offset the effect of softening Western market, and
unusual winter weather.
In the West, average log sales realizations declined. This decline is primarily due to a shift in mix as we sold fewer logs
in the export markets as the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar pressured demand and pricing for our export
logs. Sales volumes to Japan declined due to seasonally weaker demand and a slightly softer housing market following
last year's increase in the consumption tax. However, average sales realizations for our Japanese logs improved slightly
due to favorable mix. Chinese demand remained slow throughout the extended Lunar New Year period, and inventories
remained at elevated levels. The combination of lower export log demand and unusually favorable logging conditions
generated an oversupply of logs in Western domestic markets and domestic log pricing weakened during the quarter.
In the South, unusually wet weather slightly amplified our normal seasonal decline in fee harvest volumes. Average
sales realizations for Southern logs were comparable to the fourth quarter.
First quarter included earnings of $17 million from disposition of non-strategic Timberlands, an increase of $14 million
compared with the fourth quarter. The Timberlands business continues to expect $20 million to $30 million of
operational excellence improvement in 2015 from efforts related to log merchandising, harvesting, transportation, and
silviculture efficiencies in non-timber revenues.
Wood Products, charts six and seven. Wood Products contributed $62 million to the first quarter earnings, an
improvement of $6 million compared with the fourth quarter. EBITDA increased to $88 million. Results were
comparable to the first quarter of last year as benefits from operational excellence initiatives helped the business to
offset lower year-over-year sales realizations of nearly 15% in OSB and 7% in lumber.
In lumber, EBITDA was unchanged compared to the fourth quarter, as the business fully offset a 3% decline in average
sales realizations with benefits from operational excellence initiatives to reduce manufacturing costs, net of logs and
overhead expenses.

In OSB, EBITDA decreased by $3 million. Average sales realizations declined 5% compared with the fourth quarter.
This decline was largely offset by reductions in manufacturing cost.
Engineered wood products reported first quarter EBITDA of $26 million, an increase of $12 million compared with the
fourth quarter, and $18 million more than the first quarter of 2014. Sales volume rose across all product lines primarily
due to stronger demand in the West and per unit manufacturing cost improved due to higher production volumes and
operational excellence initiatives.
EBITDA for the distribution business declined by $2 million compared with fourth quarter, but improved $2 million
compared with the first quarter of 2014. This business remains focused on improving margins and lowering cost.
Our Wood Products businesses continue to target 2015 operational excellence improvements of $20 million to $25
million from lumber, $10 million to $15 million from OSB, $15 million to $20 million of additional engineered wood
products EBITDA, and $20 million to $30 million of additional EBITDA from distribution.
Cellulose Fibers, chart eight and nine. Cellulose Fibers contributed $33 million to earnings compared with $87 million
in the fourth quarter. The West Coast port dispute significantly affected our Cellulose Fibers business throughout the
quarter. Although, a tentative contract agreement was reached in late February, port activity at the ports of Seattle and
Tacoma remained well below normal due to continued congestion at the container terminals. Both ports are also
absorbing volume from carriers that have cancelled service at the port of Portland. As a result of the disruption, we
incurred 13 days of downtime at our liquid packaging facility, as well as incremental warehousing and transportation
costs throughout the segment. In total, the port disruption affected segment earnings by approximately $15 million in
the quarter. This was significantly more than we had originally anticipated.
Turning to our pulp mill system, pulp markets weakened during the first quarter as global inventories remained above
balance levels and a strengthening U.S. dollar pressured broader market pricing. Average pulp sales realizations
declined due to slightly softer pricing for pulp, weaker pricing for our premium towel & tissue grades and an
unfavorable product mix.
First quarter also included higher maintenance expense for a planned outage at our largest fluff mill. The restart of this
mill took longer than anticipated, resulting in lower production and higher per unit manufacturing costs. This mill is
now running well.
The Cellulose Fiber business remains relentlessly focused on delivering operational excellence improvements of $30
million to $35 million in 2015.
I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our second quarter outlook.
Patricia M. Bedient
Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everybody. The outlook for the second quarter is summarized on chart 13, and I will
begin the discussion with Timberlands.
In the West, log export volume is expected to improve from Q1, consistent with higher seasonal construction activity.
Log prices are likely to remain under downward pressure due to the combination of currency headwinds and higher
than normal inventories in China.
Western domestic log prices and volumes have continued to decrease through the first part of this quarter, but we
anticipate they will stabilize as housing activity begins to improve and mill inventories come back into balance. Fee
harvest in the West will decrease slightly and road costs are expected to increase seasonally.
In the South, we anticipate pricing consistent with first quarter levels. We expect typical seasonal increases in fee
harvest, and silviculture costs. In Q1, the gain on non-strategic land sales was $17 million. We anticipate only minimal
land sales in Q2. In total, we expect that earnings in our Timberlands segment will be lower in the second quarter
compared to the first.

Moving to Wood Products. Thus far in the quarter, prices for lumber and oriented strand board have continued to soften
and are currently below the average sales realizations for last quarter. However, we do expect this trend to reverse as
weather improves and building activity picks up. As a result, we anticipate that average realizations in the second
quarter for both lumber and OSB will be similar to Q1 on seasonally increased volumes. Volumes in engineered wood
products are expected to increase significantly with little change in pricing.
Western log prices should decrease compared to the first quarter, and per unit manufacturing costs will likely be lower
due to higher operating rates and our operational excellence initiatives. Overall, second quarter earnings in the Wood
Products segment are expected to be significantly higher than Q1.
In Cellulose Fibers, pulp prices have been negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates and higher than
normal inventory levels. Second quarter average sales realizations are anticipated to be lower than the average for Q1.
The effect of lower realization should be partially offset by increased sales volume.
While the disruptions caused by the West Coast port dispute have lessened, we continue to have some negative effects
in the second quarter. We will have an extended outage at one of our southern fluff mills in order to perform scheduled
maintenance and to install energy related capital improvements. These improvements include installation of a turbine
generator and upgrades of the boilers and steam and power systems.
Benefits include lower manufacturing costs through improved reliability, improved energy efficiency, and increased
outside power sales. This second quarter outage is anticipated to result in more than twice the number of outage days
compared to the 17 days in Q1. We expect maintenance expense will be approximately $15 million higher in Q2
compared to Q1.
As a result of this extended outage, overall earnings in the Cellulose Fibers segment are expected to be lower in the
second quarter compared to the first. We have only one mill maintenance outage scheduled for the second half of the
year and therefore, earnings in the second half of the year should be significantly higher than the first.
Chart 10 details the major items of unallocated costs. Q1 expense before special items increased to $41 million from
the fourth quarter level of $13 million. As Doyle mentioned, the major item was the non-cash foreign exchange impact
of $29 million resulting from the weaker Canadian dollar. In Q2, we expect that the total expense for unallocated items
will be closer to the fourth quarter level before considering the effect of foreign exchange rates.
Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial statement comments. I'll refer you to chart 11 for this discussion. Cash for
the quarter decreased $422 million. Cash flow from operations was $77 million. As you can see from the chart, the first
quarter is typically our lowest quarter due to seasonality.
Major outflows in the first quarter were as follows: capital expenditures were $89 million. We continue to expect that
total capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $500 million. We paid $152 million in dividends and
repurchased shares for $253 million. The share repurchase activity is summarized on chart 12. As of the end of the first
quarter, we had just over $240 million remaining on the $700 million authorization that we announced last August.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions.
Doyle R. Simons
Thank you, Patty. We're optimistic that housing markets will strengthen throughout the remainder of 2015 and look
forward to improving demand as the spring selling and summer building season progresses.
Going forward, our priorities remain unchanged. We're relentlessly focused on improving our performance through
operational excellence and delivering on our priorities for capital allocation.
And now, I'd like to open the floor for questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham
Research. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Thank you. I just wanted to focus in a little bit more on the Cellulose Fibers segment just
to make sure I understood what was said. I believe you said that the maintenance costs would be as much as $50
million higher second quarter versus first quarter?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Thanks for asking that question Mark, it's $15 million.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Okay. All right. That change of things, all those questions threw out the window.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Okay, good.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Shifting gears then, when looking at the first quarter, I think you originally were
anticipating that you would see lumber and presumably OSB pricing come back and it didn't. Do you think that was a
more function of the demand or supply side issues, maybe if you could dwell into that a bit?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Mark, as you know, historically we have experienced price increases in the first quarter and
the fourth quarter in lumber. As you highlighted, we thought that would happen again this year, it did not. And to your
question, I think there were two drivers. Number one is, while January was okay from a weathers perspective, February
and March were not. So clearly form a demand perspective the lack of construction activity due to the severe weather
had an impact on the demand side of the equation. I think there was also some impact from additional supply of lumber
coming from Canada due to the currency situation. So, I think it was a combination of both of those things that resulted
in pricing not improving to the level that we had anticipated when we had the fourth quarter call.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: And so, is it fair to say that the demand side should take care of itself assuming housing
continues to improve? And how do you feel on the supply side? The stronger dollar, does that change the playing field
a bit on a go forward basis? Or does – are there reasons why that will come back to normalized and the supply issues
disappear?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. I think it's the latter, Mark. I think the demand side clearly will take care of itself. And
fortunately, we're starting to see some real signs of improvements there. On the supply side, I think that takes care of
itself over time as well, as you see continue to see improvement in export markets for lumber. And as we also know
there is just a natural constraint on how much lumber can come from Canada on an ongoing basis because of the [ph]
whole (18:53) pine beetle situation. So, I think both supply and demand were temporary phenomenons in the first
quarter, and will take care of themselves over time.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Okay. I'll get back in queue. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Tyler J. Langton>: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning.
<Q - Tyler J. Langton>: I guess just on Timberlands. Doyle, I mean I think you mentioned, kind of touched on that in
your opening remarks, but I guess in general, revenues were down but profits were up. Could you just talk a little bit
about how much sort of mix maybe contributed operational excellence, and I guess the same question applied on the
Wood Products side because there is a sort of a similar trend there as well?

<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. So, as referred to in the comments, we clearly saw some benefit from operational
excellence in both the Timberlands business and the Wood Products business in the first quarter. And Timberlands to
your point, basically what happened there is, we had lower price and volume as we talked about, but that was more than
offset by lower cost in the quarter, the lower cost being both in the West and in the South and the lower price and
volume of course, being primarily in the West. In addition, we had some benefit from higher land sales, but that's what
got us to the improvement in the first quarter versus fourth despite the fact that we had weaker market conditions,
specifically in the West.
On the Wood Products side, I'd say, we were pleased with the fact that we clearly saw OpEx improvements in our
results in the first quarter because as we talked about, we did in fact have, rather than higher prices, we had lower
prices pretty much across the board. So, I'd tell you, our continued effort, for example, in lumber to reduce our cost net
of log, we saw benefit there in OSB, lower manufacturing cost. And then, in ELP, where we saw a nice improvement,
really what the key driver there was, we had lower price kind of offset by higher volume, but we had overall lower
manufacturing cost due to favorable resin. That's maintenance downtime in the quarter. But, frankly, a big part of it was
it was just running better as a result of our OpEx efforts. So, that's kind of how what we saw play out in the first quarter
versus the fourth.
<Q - Tyler J. Langton>: And then, I guess, do you think you're on track with your operational excellence goals to
exceed the targets for this year? Or are you generally in line?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. I would say, we're on track in both Timberlands and in Wood Products. We got some
catching up to do in Cellulose Fibers.
<Q - Tyler J. Langton>: That's it. Okay. Thanks so much.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Usha C. Guntupalli>: Thanks. It's actually Usha Guntupalli on for Alex. How are you?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good. How are you this morning?
<Q - Usha C. Guntupalli>: Good, thanks. Just following up on the operational excellence program, as you're working
through this program, has execution proved a bit more difficult than original expectations for any of the segments or
maybe are you even seeing opportunities for further savings in any segments?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: I would say, generally and I made this comment before, as we get deeper into our operational
excellence program, it's harder work to get it done. But with that said, as I just referred to, very pleased with the
progress that we made in our Timberlands business and our lumber business, I mean, Timberlands business and our
Wood Products business in the fourth quarter, still some additional work to do in Cellulose Fibers. But we're very
encouraged by the progress we made and I can tell you our folks are working really hard every day to deliver against
those targets and we're confident that we will reach those targets in 2015.
<Q - Usha C. Guntupalli>: Thank you.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: The one thing that I would add is on the, Doyle did a nice job of walking through the
operational excellence on the businesses. One of the other areas that we had was our G&A targets – SG&A targets and
as we said at the end of the year that we had identified the things that we needed to execute on to get that and you can
see in the results year-over-year the improvement is coming through there. So we're also equally pleased on that front.
<Q - Usha C. Guntupalli>: Thanks. And just a quick one on FX. Are you seeing a major impact on trade flows for the
log market, given all the FX moves around the world?

<A - Doyle R. Simons>: I'm sorry, will you repeat your question please?
<Q - Usha C. Guntupalli>: Yeah. Could you talk a little bit about the FX impact on the log market, like are you seeing
major changes in trade flows around the world?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. So as we talked about, we did see some impact on the trade flows in terms of our
export volumes in the first quarter. As we stated, volumes were down both into Japan and to China and as a result, there
was additional trade flow that came into the domestic market and that was part of the reason for the lower cost, lower
price logs. Overall, lower price realizations in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter.
<Q - Usha C. Guntupalli>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Yes. Yes. Good morning, Doyle and Patty.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Chip.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: First question is on the, just to make sure, I heard this right. I know the Timberland, I think
sales were top line $25 million in the first quarter, did you say the earnings impact was $18 million?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Are you talking about the gain on non-strategic land sales in the Timberlands perspective?
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Yeah. That will go away in the second quarter, yes.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah. The gain was in the first quarter was $17 million in total and that was an increase of
$14 million over the fourth quarter and we really don't expect anything of any significance in the second quarter. So...
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Okay.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: That's true that that will impact our Timberland earnings about $17 million and we would
expect that that's probably half of the decrease of Q1 to Q2. The other piece would be primarily Western logs.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: I see. Okay, that's helpful. Now switching gears, Doyle, you had mentioned coming in back in
December of 2013 that the two businesses within Wood Products set, you really wanted to see, that needed to improve
the most were engineered wood and distribution. And it looks like, at least looking at the first quarter and just kind of
watching the trend, the engineered business – engineered wood products is doing great compared to what it had done,
but it also on the same – by the same token looks like distribution is kind of still, while better it's still bumping along
break even. And how would you sort of look at those businesses strategically over the next year or two and has, for
example, engineered kind of earned its right to grow yet and what has to change in distribution?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: And so to your point Chip, we did make the comment that we needed to significantly improve
the performance in both of those businesses. And in 2014, as you will recall, we improved earnings in each of those
businesses – both of those businesses by $30 million to $40 million, so real progress. At the end of 2014, as you also
recall Chip, we made the comment that, that was good progress, but we still had a lot of work to do to get these
businesses to where they needed to be long-term.
Thank you for your comment on the progress that we made on ELP in the first quarter, and we were pleased with that,
more work to do. And on distribution, we did make slight improvements there. But what I would tell you is, we set

OpEx goal for ELP of $15 million to $20 million for 2015 and we're on track and maybe a little ahead of schedule to
deliver on that. And then on distribution, $20 million to $30 million, and I'm still confident that we will accomplish that
going forward. So, I would say, progress in both businesses, still work to do. And ultimately as I've said, we just got to
show that we can, in both of those businesses, earn above our cost of capital over the cycle and sustainably and maybe,
more importantly, out-execute our competition. So still more work to be done, but thanks for your comment on the
progress.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: And then I guess the last question is just, you have certainly executed on the buyback as you
said you would back in last August in the wake of the homebuilder sale – homebuilding business sale. As we get it out,
I would imagine in the next, to this summer or maybe early fall, and assuming you've worked through the remaining
authorization, what is your view then? Are you going to take another look to see if you should continue a buyback? I
know that obviously a lot of this buyback was funded by the sale of the homebuilding business and you also -I'm sure
what would fit in your thinking is your view toward opportunities in Timberland acquisitions although we keep hearing
there's really not much on the market. So any early thoughts on those issues?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Chip, as you know, we spend a lot of time focusing on capital allocation around here and
we're constantly reviewing our various alternatives. To your point, as we approach the completion of the current
repurchase authorization, we'll work with our board regarding the best use of our cash going forward. As we've
previously stated, long term, we believe the appropriate level of cash in our balance sheet is in the $300 million to $500
million range; and even with the completion of the current share authorization will be well in excess of that. So,
something we're spending a lot of time working on, thinking about, and we'll make some decisions as we move
forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Anthony.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Regarding the West Coast port strike, I think you indicated it was $15 million in 1Q. And I
think Patty said that there was – you're still kind of feeling the effects of that this quarter. Is there any way to size what
the impact of the West Coast port strike might be this quarter? And then, I think you indicated the oversupply of
Western logs that you saw in 1Q. You had some level of confidence that might sort of work itself out domestically as
demand improves. I'm just wondering, the inventory situation in China and the oversupply in China, do you have any
view as to when that situation sort of normalizes?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Okay. So, in terms of the port situation, that has been, as we said in our comments, has taken
longer to get resolved than we had originally anticipated. There's still some congestions at the port. We had the whole
situation in Portland and some of the traffic there moving to Seattle and Tacoma. But to your point, Patty did say that it
was $15 million impact in the first quarter and we would expect that to be $5 million or less impact in the second
quarter.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: I think it could be $5 million to $10 million in the second quarter.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Okay. And then the, your question regarding, let's talk a little bit about kind of how we're
viewing the export markets and the overall markets for our Timberlands, for our logs. In Japan, what we've seen there,
as we talked about, is reduced log demand by a lower housing activity. The strong U.S. dollar is impacting the pricings
as our customer competes with other alternatives from Europe due to the comparative FX rates. And Q2 log shipments,
as we said, should be up seasonally compared with Q1, but the price we anticipate will be down. And we expect prices

to stabilize as we go out of the second quarter into the third quarter.
China, there we are having the strongest dollar, it's having a negative impact on the U.S. log demand and pricing
relative to imports from New Zealand and Russia. Log inventories as everybody know, remain elevated at
approximately 4.5 million cubic meters. We expect our shipments to be higher in the second quarter compared with the
first quarter due to the Chinese building season. We expect continued downward pressure on pricing in 2Q and here
again, we expect prices to stabilize end of the second quarter moving into the third quarter.
I would make the point on China, despite the current situation, if you take a little bit longer term look, we believe China
will continue to be a key market for us due to continued growth in the middle class in China and the natural limitations
on additional wood supply from Russia and New Zealand. But, China has been volatile in the past and we think will
continue to be volatile going forward.
And then, finally, if you look at the domestic markets to, I think, your specific question, we think the volume and prices
that we see there will flatten as housing activity accelerates, especially in California and we're starting to see some of
that. And as log inventories normalize – a part of why the log inventory has got to the condition they are in – is because
they have the very favorable logging conditions that occurred in the first quarter.

<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. So, as I said, we are seeing signs. It comes partially from the discussions that are
ongoing with our customer base. We are also encouraged by the commentary that's coming out of the homebuilders that
we talk to and their commentary is a lot more people are showing up, even some commentary that first time home
buyers are starting to show up. So it just feels like the spring selling season is starting to shape up well. As we said, it
was deferred because of weather. But all-in-all, almost without exception, our customers and others that we talked to
are saying the demand is there; folks are interested.
And if you really look at it, that makes sense. I mean, you've got full-time employment at the highest level it's been in
many years. You got consumer confidence high. You got gas prices that are down over 30% year-over-year. You still
got very low rate mortgages. You got the FHA and HUD working together to try to bring in the first time homebuyer.
So, a lot of very positive things and we're seeing it in the sentiment that we're hearing and from our customer base.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the cost environment? You
had put out some targets based on where oil prices are. Are things targeting in that level? And maybe specifically, are
you seeing any offsets in terms of ocean freight to offset maybe some of the pressure you're seeing in export markets?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yes. We, as you referred to, Gail, we did give some guidance on what we thought the positive
impact would be from lower diesel prices. We saw some of that in the quarter. Overall, I would say the benefit was
roughly $5 million because of the lower diesel prices in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. That has helped on
the ocean freight and that has partially offset some of the pressure that's been on pricing. The other thing I would say
and I think you asked this question last time, we are seeing – partially offsetting that, we are seeing some negative
impact from our oil and gas revenue from our Timberlands side. Our best guess is that will be down somewhere $5
million, maybe $10 million in 2015 versus 2014, if we kind of continue at these oil prices going forward.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: All right. And just one last question on the fluff pulp market. We've seen another really
large supply announcement. You've got a company looking at doing hardwood based fluff down in Brazil and then
another one doing softwood in Brazil in addition to projects here. Has any of this changed your outlook? Are you
hearing anything from your customers that would make you worried as you look out to some of that supply coming on
next year?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Gail, as we look at that market, the demand for that is growing and that's why we do need
more supply overall to meet that demand. The unfortunate part is that often times when it comes on, it comes on in
chunks, so it takes a while for the market to absorb it. I think the good news that we're hearing from the folks who are
bringing that supply on is, they do have the opportunity to produce both paper grade as well as fluff. And so, I suspect
that that will come in over the course of time. But, there is no question that as we look at our own demand growing and
their customers growing that there is just more demand for fluff both in the emerging market and also in the adult
incontinence here domestically.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: It seemed a lot more bullish than what you're able to achieve and a lot of things moved in the
quarter, I mean, it's the best guess at the time. Just thinking about – I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that?
When you see prices like say, for example, lower lumber and lower OSB prices, when you guided materially higher
pricing and a material improvement in Wood Products. Would you look at revising that guidance or is that something
that's a point-in-time and you wait for the quarter?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. That's a really good question. And the way we think about it, and let me talk
specifically, about Wood Products is, we did say that we anticipated prices going up in the first quarter versus the
fourth quarter. That was based on what we were seeing in January when we did that and as I mentioned earlier, January
was a good month and we were right on track. Some things happened in February and March on the demand side
primarily, as we talked about, that impacted lumber and OSB prices. We also did make the comment on the first quarter
call that those were our best guesses and we would all watch lumber and OSB prices together and see what happens.
So, our sense is that that's something that's not unique us. It's being – is able to be tracked by our analysts and investors
and can make adjustments accordingly. So, if it was – what our experience was was dramatically different than what's
happened in the marketplace, to your point, at that point we would consider officially revising guidance. But if it's just
something that's public and what's happening in the marketplace – we typically would not revise guidance just based on
that because there is a lot visibility to those prices in the marketplace.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Yeah. That's very helpful. And then, just additionally on Cellulose Fibers, looks like you had
some operational hiccups in Q1 and probably a drag on this West Coast port issue in Q2 and maintenance. Just
wondering how much better the second half of the year is going to look? I mean, it looks quite a bit from my
standpoint, just trying to get some more color from you guys?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. As Patty alluded to in her comments, we anticipate that the second quarter will be
significantly higher than the first quarter. To your point, we've had a lot of maintenance in the first half of the year both
in the first quarter and then we have double the amount maintenance in the second quarter. We also had some – to your
point, some headwinds and small operational issue in the first quarter, all of that should be behind us. So we would
anticipate significant improvement in our Cellulose Fibers business in the second half versus the first half.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Great. Thanks very much. Best of luck.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Steven Chercover>: Hi. Good morning, everyone. These are kind of cleanup at this point, but could you please
expand on your comments on engineered wood. I think you said, flat pricing. Maybe you can tell us what the operating
rates are and when do you expect to see some tension kick in to justify higher prices?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. So, we do anticipate or we did have – well, let me start with operating rate. Operating
rates in the first quarter were in the low 70s in terms of ELP. In terms of pricing, you're right, we said that was roughly
flat currently versus the first quarter. There has been a price increase announced in Canada in for ELP of roughly 5% or
little more and we think that could pass through. We won't see the full benefit of that until the third quarter.
<Q - Steven Chercover>: Okay. And then, clearly you think that housing is going to get better and the Q1 was just
basically seasonal. Do you think that your pulse on the market is as accurate today as it was when you owned RICO
and what is your full year view for starts?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yes. I would say the first quarter was more – first quarter is always slower seasonally but I
would say it was even worse than the normal seasonal because of the weather impact again in February and March. As
I said, earlier, January was a pretty good month and then February and March were difficult due to the weather
situation.

In terms of our visibility into housing, our crystal ball is not necessarily any better than anybody else's but we have a lot
of customers that we talk to on a very regular basis. So I would say we got a good visibility into housing going forward.
I'd say in terms of what our forecast is for starts, it is unchanged at 1.1 million and actually we're really encouraged by
what we've seen over the past few weeks in terms of, again, talking to customers and their overall sentiment for
housing.
And if you really step back and look at it, and I talked about it earlier, there are a lot of really positive things happening
which should continue to drive household formation, the employment levels, consumers' confidence, the lower gas
prices, where mortgage rates are. The availability is improving in terms of mortgage for first-time homebuyers. So a lot
of encouraging things there that we think will continue to drive housing going forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Patty.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Mark.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: I got a lumber question, then I got a Timberland question. My lumber question, Patty, is kind of
two pieces. One is, typically, I think of you guys lagging what we would see in terms of random lengths in terms of the
lumber realizations you report every quarter, and I just want to kind of confirm that and see how we reconcile that with
your assumption that price will be flat kind of quarter-to-quarter? And also within lumber, it looks like Southern
lumber prices are starting to come down now even while we're seeing a little pick up in West Coast lumber prices. So
how will that affect you guys sort of Southern prices versus Western, and then just the lag between reported prices and
what you realize?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure. I think, as you think about what we report against the Random Lengths Framing
Composite for lumber, the framing composite for lumber is made up of a number of different grades, and it doesn't
equate exactly to what we are manufacturing. So, sometimes we lag, sometimes we are a little ahead. So, I don't know
that I would say we always have that same relationship.
As you think about what happens in the South versus West, of course, we have operations in both. Our Southern system
is larger than our Western system. One of the things that I think will help our Western system for lumber in the second
quarter is the log prices coming down. And as you know, log prices are a big – or log costs are a big cost of producing
lumber. So the West will get a little help on that and in the South, we would expect that those log prices will be
unchanged as well. So, little more important to us in the South just based on the size of the system, but both
geographies are important to us.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Okay. And then, over on Timberlands, I wonder, Doyle, if you can just talk a little bit about sort
of what you see out there in terms of the Timberland acquisition markets? How you're kind of seeing values right now?
And just, how you think about Weyerhaeuser's Timberland portfolio going forward? You're pretty heavily skewed right
now in terms of your earnings to the Pacific Northwest. You want to shift that over time?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. So, Mark, in terms of the deal flows, overall, it was low in the first quarter in both the
South and the West. As we previously said, we expect that to increase as we move through the year, and I'll tell you
there is still a lot of money chasing deals going forward.

In terms of our specific portfolio, as you know, we've got 4 million acres in the South, 2.7 million acres in the Pacific
Northwest. We would like to growth both areas. We like the positions where we are. We'll look at growing both the
South and the Pacific Northwest. But with that said, we're going to continue to be very disciplined in terms of our
approach and make sure that any acquisition opportunity that we looked at meets our specific criteria of having
appropriate cash flow and returns, both in the near and long term, strong market access and ability for us to add value
or synergies, and I think the Longview acquisition is a good example of where we were able to add synergies as a result
of that transaction. So, we'll look to grow both in the West and in the South. We like our position in both of those but
we'll be very disciplined in the approach that we take.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: And, Doyle, how do you think about international Timberlands because at one point this was a big
growth focus for Weyerhaeuser and I think you peeled that back quite a bit. How does that sort of fit in the equation
now?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. I think our biggest opportunities for growth going forward, Mark, will be domestic. We
will continue to look internationally. As you know, we have Timberland Uruguay. That is a really good timberland. We
got a good team in place there. The growth rates there are really encouraging. So we understand international
timberland but I think on a risk-adjusted basis, I think our bigger opportunities, going forward, will be domestic as
opposed to international.

<Q - George L. Staphos>: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for [indiscernible] (50:24).
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, George.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: How are you doing? A lot of my questions have been asked already. So maybe a couple of
bigger picture questions and not necessarily to pick on Cellulose Fibers. I guess, first of all, Doyle, if we look at the
portfolio, my guess is your strategy – your strategic view wouldn't have changed a whole heck of lot since the
December presentation. But certainly, Cellulose Fibers does operate to a different cycle than your classic housing
related businesses. And so, can you update us on your thoughts in terms of how C Fibers fits within the whole portfolio
and why it fits well?
And then, separately within Cellulose Fibers, you mentioned that you are relentlessly focused on operating excellence
over the balance of the year, which suggest that you perhaps wanted improved performance of maybe some things that
didn't go as well as you would have liked in the first quarter. Obviously, you can't control the port situation, or maybe
you could have where there some things with the port and the situation and your reaction to it as a company that you
thought you could have done better? And the mill outage and coming back from that, again, it lagged a little bit. Is that
a reflection at all of the new maintenance schedule or totally not related at all? Thanks, and good luck in the quarter.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you, George, and I'm going to take your second question first and then I'll come back
to the bigger question. So, in Cellulose Fibers in the quarter, we did not see much benefit from operational excellence.
In terms of the startup of the mill that was down, that's something that we could have done better.
In terms of the port situation and the FX situation, those just were what they were. I was actually really proud of the
way our team managed through the very difficult port situation from the fact that it really did – it had a really
significant impact on our ability to ship products. We had to move things around. We had additional transportation
cost, we had warehouse cost, a lot of moving parts there and our team was on top of it and did a really nice job of
managing through that and has continued to do that as we move forward.

So, to comment on the $30 million to $35 million of OpEx, I'm absolutely convinced we're going to get that for the
year. There was not much that showed up in the first quarter in our Cellulose Fibers business, unlike our other two
businesses where it did show up. But we've got a good team in place. We've got the right strategy. And, the mill outage,
when you take those down, you start them back up, it doesn't always go as well as you'd hope. That happened this
quarter and we will manage that better as we move forward.
In terms of the strategy overall for Cellulose Fiber, as you alluded to, we talked about that at our December meeting
and we like having Cellulose Fiber business as part of our overall portfolio partly because of the reason you said. It
does tend to be countercyclical to some of our other businesses, but much more importantly, we like the cash, the very
strong cash flow generation that we have historically received from that business and we are convinced we'll continue
to generate significant free cash flow going forward. We like that because that ties to our number one capital allocation
priority, having a growing and sustainable dividend, and we believe the cash flow that we generate from that business
will continue to allow us to grow our dividend going forward.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Hey, Doyle...
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: One of the projects that will significantly improve our operational excellence going
forward was, as Doyle said, we didn't have in the first quarter and we won't have the full benefit in the second quarter,
but is that energy installation and boiler upgrade that we're doing in one of our fluff mills in the second quarter. So
we're excited about the additional power generation sales that we'll have from that upgrade, but also it will significantly
improve the reliability of that mill and thereby lower our cost going forward as well. So that's just one example of an
operational excellence, a focus that you haven't seen show up on the bottom-line yet; but we will start to see some of
that improvement later in the year.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Thank you for that, Patty. Doyle, I guess, the fact that you didn't mention it means it really
wasn't an issue, but you have not seen the new maintenance schedule effect your ability to bring mills back up in a
timely way or have you? Again, thanks and good luck in the quarter.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: No, George, and you're right. I didn't mention it because it did not have an impact. That was a
mill that went down and as we said, when you start mills back up sometimes they don't start up as well as they should.
That's what happened on this occasion and we'll work to make sure that doesn't happen going forward.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: It's tougher than running a spreadsheet, I guess. Have a good quarter.

<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: I think that we would certainly see our second quarter significantly higher than the first
quarter, as I said. To get to the roughly a little over $100 million of a year ago quarter, we're going to have to see some
really significant turnaround in prices that we haven't seen yet. So I'm pulling for it but it's unlikely that we'll get there
unless, as I said, pricing just really significantly has an inflection point from here. But it will be somewhere south of
that but still significantly higher than what we saw in Q1.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Okay. No, that's helpful. And then, again you talked a little bit about just far as acquisition
priorities U.S. South being on the radar, but maybe just provide a little bit more of an update of what you're seeing as
far as saw log price improvement in the region, if any? I know I think in 2Q you're looking for flat pricing, but just the
outlook in that market. I know some of your peers have kind of suggested that given some of the weakness in Asia that
that tipping point as far as the supply/demand in that region may have been pushed out even further. So can you just
maybe update us on what you're seeing in that region?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. So in the South, we continue to anticipate that Southern saw log prices will be 3% to
4% in 2015 versus 2014. That's kind of what we saw in 2014 versus 2013. We think that trend is going to continue.
It's hard to know exactly what the tipping point is going to be to your question. And China, as I mentioned earlier, is
going to be volatile. So I don't get too concerned about that component of it. I think, as housing continues to improve
that's going to help on the demand side and then overall on the supply side, the constraints that Canada has in place
because of the pine beetle situation will be a key driver there. So, we're not yet to the tipping point. I think it's still in
front of us, and the key driver there is going to be what happens with U.S. housing and as I mentioned earlier, we
continue to be encouraged by the progress there. Had the pause in the first quarter, but the fundamentals are clearly in
place for continued improvement in housing as we move forward.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, just following up really quick as far as on the
Pacific Northwest, is there a good way to think about as far as you're looking at 40% year-over-year decline as far as on
log export revenue? I know there's a couple of moving pieces there but can you maybe give us some sense of how
much of that was pricing versus volume?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. I would say the biggest component and I don't have that exact breakdown in front of
me but the biggest component of it was volume as we talked about Japan slowed down due to just a general slowdown
in housing and then, we all know what happened in China. So, clearly, both were components but I would tell you,
volume was the bigger component of the decrease that was experienced.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Okay. And then, just one last one. And, Doyle, just as you think about the headwinds in the
Pacific Northwest, and again, I recognize that you think are optimistic that pricing is going to stabilize as you go
through 2Q on the domestic front. But is there a point where you really start to ratchet it down harvest activity in the
region, just with the thinking that maybe prices have overcorrected here, given some of the currency headwinds and the
slowing in China and the inventory there?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Collin, as you know, we do have the ability to flex up and down, depending on what's
happened on market conditions. We'll see how things play out, going forward, do not have any intention to do that at
this point but that is something we've done historically and we have the ability to do as we move forward.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Okay. Well, again, thanks for all the detail. Good luck during the quarter.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Thanks, Collin.
