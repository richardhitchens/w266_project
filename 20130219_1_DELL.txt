MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon, and welcome to the Dell Inc. Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I'd
like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell. This broadcast is a copyrighted property
of Dell Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or in part without the prior written permission of Dell Inc. is
prohibited. As a reminder, Dell is also simulcasting this presentation with slides at www.dell.com/investor. Later we
will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin.
Robert L. Williams II
Thanks, Regina. In light of Michael's involvement in the pending transaction, today's call will be led by Brian Gladden
and he'll be joined by Tom Sweet, our Corporate Controller. The web deck was posted to our website in advance for the
call. I encourage you to review this and related materials for additional perspective.
Next, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are
forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially
from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties, which are
discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement in our press release and web deck.
We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.

Note that we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, operating
expenses, operating income, net income, and earnings per share. Historical non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the
most directly comparable GAAP measures in the web deck posted in the Investor Relations section at www.dell.com
and in our press release and 8-K filed today. I encourage you to review these documents.
Also note that unless otherwise mentioned all growth percentages refer to year-over-year progress. As you know the
Board of Directors of Dell acting on the recommendation of a special committee of independent directors unanimously
approved a merger agreement to take the company private subject to a number of conditions. Given the nature of this
transaction, we are not going to address any questions on this matter in today's Q&A.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Brian.
Brian T. Gladden
Thanks, Rob. For the full fiscal year our revenue was $56.9 billion, down 8%. Full year non-GAAP EPS was $1.72,
down 19%. Our Enterprise Solutions and Services business was $19.4 billion, up 4% from fiscal year 2012.
For the fourth quarter we delivered revenue of $14.3 billion, down 11% and up 4% sequentially which was at the high
end of the 2% to 5% sequential growth outlook we provided last quarter. The ES&S business was up 6% to $5.2 billion
and now represents 36% of our revenue and well over half of our gross margin dollars.
We continue to execute on our long-term strategy. Our strong balance sheet and cash position have enabled almost $5
billion in investments in new capabilities and intellectual property and key assets such as Quest, SonicWall, Wyse and
AppAssure. I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures going forward.
Our gross margin was 22.8% and included an approximately $250 million benefit primarily related to vendor
settlements. We experienced a competitive pricing environment in our desktop and mobility products and utilized the
portion of the settlement dollars to fund investments in some customer accounts that we feel will drive solid cash flow
and profitability over the long-term. In addition, we did see some areas of elasticity and we were able to hold or gain
share in certain areas of the business.
SG&A increased 40 basis points sequentially to 14% of revenue while R&D was up sequentially to 2.1% of revenue.
The dollar increase in SG&A was driven by recently closed acquisitions, strategic investments in sales capabilities and
expenses related to the merger transaction. The R&D increase was driven by recent acquisitions in software
predominantly the Quest business.
Operating income was $954 million or 6.7% of revenue. Earnings per share were $0.40, which declined 22%. We
generated cash flow from operations at $1.4 billion partially driven by the sequential growth in our business and an
improved payable cycle. Our cash and investments balance ended at $15.3 billion. For the full year we've returned 34%
of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of our dividend and stock repurchase, at the high end of our stated
range of 20% to 35%.
Turning to our lines of business. Our server and networking business grew 18% representing the 13th consecutive
quarter of growth. As a reminder this business includes Dell software related to Quest, AppAssure and SonicWall.
Servers increased 5% driven by strong growth in our hyper-scale data center solutions business as we see continued
strong migration to our 12th-generation servers. 12th-generation servers now represent almost 80% of our Dell
PowerEdge server revenue at ASPs and margins that are a premium to our previous generation servers. Our networking
business continues to deliver strong growth with an increase of 42% and over 100% growth in our Force10 business.
Dell storage was down 8% to $424 million but we're seeing improved momentum as the business increased 12%
sequentially driven by a 20% sequential increase of Compellent and EqualLogic combined. The services business was
down 3% and flat sequentially at $2.1 billion. Support and deployment was flat. Infrastructure, cloud and security
services were up 2% led by our security business, which increased 17%. We had a 22% decline in our apps and BPO
business driven by select contract expirations.

Our services backlog and deferred services revenue increased 3% to $16.3 billion. New services signings increased 9%
to $2.1 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Our third party software and peripherals revenue was down 11% driven by
a continued decline in desktop and mobility-related products and the contraction in our Imaging business. We saw good
results in our Dell software business led by Quest, which delivered revenue over our stated target of $180 million to
$200 million for the quarter. We also saw good sequential growth in our security software business and continued to
add customer-centric software solutions to address critical customer needs.
Our desktop and mobility business was down 20% and up 3% sequentially. Our desktop business gained sequential
share while notebooks lost share and continued to be challenged. We made the decision to improve our relative price
position and we believe this will benefit us going forward.
We expect the market competitiveness and margin pressure to continue, which reinforces the importance of executing
on our greater than $1 billion cost-out initiatives specific to this business. Clearly understanding the dynamics of the
desktop and mobility environment, we continued to innovate and emphasize alternative compute models as evidenced
by a continued strength in our Wyse business. In the fourth quarter, we saw orders in this business increase over 25%
including tied enterprise solutions.
Turning to our business unit results, I would remind you that these numbers are not adjusted for the benefit of the
vendor settlements. Large enterprise revenue was down 7% to $4.7 billion. ES&S grew 10%, including 25% growth in
servers and networking. Operating income was up 60 basis points sequentially to 8.4% of revenue. Our public business
was down 9% to $3.5 billion.
We continue to see a challenging spending environment in the U.S. Federal business as the budgetary uncertainty has
impacted IT spend and delayed contract awards. Overall, the public business saw good growth in servers and
networking at 11% growth.
The decline in revenue combined with higher OpEx resulted in OpInc of 6.8%, which is down 130 basis points
annually and 240 basis points sequentially. Given the budgetary issues in many of these customer sets, there are fewer
desktop and mobility deals, and those that were awarded were typically very competitive.
SMB revenue declined 5% to $3.4 billion. Similar to large enterprise, we saw strong ES&S growth of 9% including
17% growth in services and 13% in servers and networking. Operating income was up 70 basis points sequentially to
11.3% of revenue.
ES&S revenue mix of 39% has improved for seven consecutive quarters in SMB. The consumer business continues to
be challenging with revenue down 24%. Operating income was $8 million or 0.3% of revenue. Growth in this space
continues to occur in tablets and in the low value desktop and notebook space. We're seeing good adoption of touch and
the supply of touch panels improved throughout the quarter. Given our pending merger agreement, we're not providing
an outlook for fiscal year 2014 or our first quarter.
Finally, I want to remind you that the 8-K that we filed January the 10th, we're going to replace our customer segment
reporting structure with a product and services group-based structure for our first quarter of fiscal year 2014.
The new reporting groups will be as follows. End user computing, which will include desktops including thin client,
notebooks including tablets, third-party software and client-related accessories. Enterprise Solutions Group, which will
include servers, networking, storage, converged infrastructure offerings and ESG related accessories. Dell Services,
which will include a broad range of IT and business services including support and deployment services, infrastructure,
cloud, security services, applications and business process services. And the Dell Software Group, which will include
systems management, security software solutions and information management.
We will restate segment reporting for comparability purposes for fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2013 at the time of
our first quarter earnings release. This aligns with how we deliver our strategy and is a natural step [indiscernible]
(11:48) better solutions for our customers.
Now, I'll turn it back over to Rob.

Robert L. Williams II
Thanks, Brian. For those of you in the queue, please limit your questions to one with no follow-ups. Regina, can we go
ahead and have the first question?
Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session portion of today's call. [Operator
Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Brian, I just had a question on the vendor settlements. $250 million is
a pretty significant amount. Was that one vendor or multiple? And then also, if you think about the reinvestment you
did, was that part of sort of the pricing you talked about on the PC side?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, it was a series of settlements that made up that amount in the quarter. And really the
way we thought about it, we had visibility to the settlement early in the quarter and we were able to use that to
selectively get more aggressive in pricing in some parts of the business. That's how we thought about it in the quarter.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes. Thank you. You talked about the $1 billion – about the incremental price aggression
that you had begun in the quarter. And I'm wondering if you could provide some color on when that was taken and how
significant. And related to that, you talked about the imperative to really get the $1 billion in cost-outs in the client
business. Maybe you could help us understand where you are in that process, how much do you think you've taken out,
and how investors should think about that?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, the – like I said, Toni the – early in the quarter, we had visibility to the settlement, the
multiple settlements in the quarter, and we really did thoughtfully think about where we wanted to apply that in some
markets, and throughout the quarter, continue to test the elasticity, places where we found elasticity, and good
long-term profitable in accounts. That's where we would have gotten more aggressive. And we did that primarily in the
commercial business, really throughout the quarter.
Regarding the $1 billion, it's really part of what Jeff Clarke had talked about last year in the June analyst meeting. I
would say, as we've consistently talked about on this, it's a long-term program. This is something we've talked about
relative to three years.
As you look at fiscal year 2014, we will begin to ramp some of those benefits, I would say, early on. Much of that will
be in COGS. And as you get later into the program, there will be more opportunities around OpEx. But clearly, around
three years, and ramping throughout that period.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Brian Alexander with Raymond James.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Thanks. Brian, just to follow up on the pricing, could you be maybe a little more specific
about which parts of the business you got more aggressive, and where you think you gained share by customer
segment, by region, or maybe by vertical? And more importantly, do you view this as a lasting change in Dell's pricing

philosophy in the client business? Or should we view it as more temporary given the vendor settlement benefit that you
had visibility into? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Brian, I – we said it last quarter, and I think we've talked about it for really a couple of
quarters. We looked at the markets, and clearly there were places that we needed to get more aggressive. I think this
gave us an opportunity to do that. I think we did capture some business and some of those are larger, kind of long-term
relationships that we think will pay off for us in terms of profitability and revenue growth going forward.
I'm not going to be specific around where we did that. But clearly, our focus has been on commercial and really across
the board in the commercial business. And specifically, around client, obviously, has been our focus. So, I think it's
going to continue to be a competitive market. No question. And I think part of what we had to do is get ourselves in the
right price position in some of these segments.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Could you talk a little bit about federal? The margin there was down quite a bit, and you
mentioned the volumes were weak. Is that to suggest that the federal business will remain at these margin levels given
all the noise coming out of the various sectors there? And was it – I think you mentioned PCs or clients – excuse me,
was that where the most change was, or across the board? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, I think it is, Keith. It's going to continue to be challenging. I don't think – this is on the
very, very low end of profitability we've seen in this business. I think what you'll see – we've seen good progress in that
business around enterprise and there continues to be a good pipeline and remember it's not just federal. This is a broad
public business that has exposure to healthcare and education and a broader global exposure to government.
But I think you'll see us continue to work to grow the enterprise mix in this business and that's our focus to really
improve profitability here. But I do expect as you see the government spending continue to be somewhat constrained,
that this'll still be a challenging business for us.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just curious whether you think the elasticity that you saw in the PC
business and the linearity in the quarter give you any confidence that enterprise IT budgets are stabilizing?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Katy. I would say we've talked about the Windows 7 refresh and the fact that all the
data that we've seen – all of the conversations we've had with customers would lead us to believe that there's still a
significant refresh activity that has to happen in the next 12 months to 14 months. Customer conversations would
reinforce that.
I would say, as we sort of looked at the back half of the quarter, I think we got a little bit more comfortable with overall
corporate IT spending, and would hope that as we head into the year that IT spending will be a bit stronger in this fiscal
year than what we saw last year. And I think that's a broad comment across the portfolio, the data center as well as the
client environment.
But clearly, we are still of the belief that there's a broad Windows 7 based refresh that will continue to play out as we
move toward April 2014 with the transition with Microsoft.

Our next question will come from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you. Your growth businesses aren't growing. They were down 11%. Could you
comment on what's causing that? Is that mostly PC-based? And specifically, China was down again. Do you expect a
reversal there?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Steve. I think when you look at them individually and I talk about China, India, Brazil;
China I would say has begun to stabilize and we've seen the market improve over the last three to four months.
There's still – I would say not what we've seen over the last couple of years in China but it's picking up and we would
expect to see growth as we head into fiscal year 2014 out of China. I think Brazil, India, on the other hand, have been
tougher. And I think the currency situation there has really compressed both of those markets, and I think they were
significantly down. China, on the other hand, was closer to flattish.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Maynard Um with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi. Thanks. I have a question around the elasticity benefit. If I take the $250 million out of the
product margins, the product gross margins dropped to about 16.5%. They were about a little over 17% last quarter. So
while it may have been revenue accretive, it looks like it was gross profit dilutive, or maybe neutral at best.
Can you just talk about the strategy of revenue versus profits? Or maybe how much of the aggressive pricing is a
function of having to maintain your unit volumes to keep the supply chain scale benefits? Because it definitely sounds
like we should maybe expect this level of gross margin going forward, because of the competitive environment.
Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Maynard, I think it's clearly like I said, last quarter we talked about where we were in
terms of price position and expected to get more aggressive as we sort of headed into the quarter. The settlement
allowed us to do that. I think it is a bit of recognizing we need to keep this business in price position. We need to scale
it appropriately to ensure we have the right cost position, and making some of that tradeoff.
I would say that on a gross margin basis, clearly it was dilutive, excluding the benefit of the settlement in the quarter.
And we look at these accounts that we were engaged with, where we actually were able to win business, and see them
as long-term opportunities for the company, and see revenue growth as well as margin coming really outside the
quarter.
And I think that's the way we thought about it. This is a bit of an investment in the business to ensure we're in the
appropriate price position to grow and maintain our cost position. No question.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I just want to build on that. Brian, I think at the analyst
day event back in June, you talked about some scenarios on the PC business or end compute division, and stress testing
that. But comfort level in maintaining a plus-5% op margin in that business, can you just update where you stand? Do
you still think that's an attainable target? And if so, is that a function of some of the cost savings that you're trying to
drive out of the model, or something more?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, I think that is not something that we would intend to provide updates on a quarterly
basis. As you know, Aaron, we don't really even track the business that way and we've given you visibility and
transparency to those results on some regular basis. I guess what I would suggest is as we head into the first quarter
results and begin to report the business on a product base segment basis, you'll get a lot more visibility to that.

I think that business for us continues to be an important element of the portfolio. We think we can drive solid
profitability and strong cash flow from the client business. And, as you know, it pulls to lots of other elements of the
portfolio and that's an important part of our business model.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.
<Q - Jayson Noland>: Great. Thank you. Brian, just to clarify, you referenced April 2014. I think that was an XP end
of life statement. What percentage of the installed base for Dell today is XP?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I think that's really tough to get at, Jayson, but the data that we've seen would suggest they're
still somewhere in the range of 40% of the corporate installed base for PCs that is XP or Vista that needs to be
upgraded. So that's, I think, pretty consistent with the data that we see for our installed base, and for what we hear from
our corporate customers.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Brian Marshall with ISI Group.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great. Thanks. Your server networking business obviously up almost 20% year over year,
doing well, and you highlighted hyper-scale data centers as one of the key drivers of that. But one of the world's largest
consumer internet companies has recently talked about building a third data center in Sweden based on 100%
non-OEM servers. So I guess the question is, how do you feel like you're going to be positioned going forward if we do
see more of this white-box market start to merge with some of the biggest service providers out there?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Brian, it's not a new dynamic. I mean, this is something that we've seen for the last
few years. It is relatively isolated to a few number of large scale customers who can make the economics work, and
given that, we're still seeing strong growth in that business, and significant opportunities to continue to grow the
hyper-scale business.
So I don't think it's a new dynamic. I think it's one that we've seen, and the differentiation that we've shown in the 12G
products actually is showing very well, and helped us to gain share -continue to gain share in servers.
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: Brian the – it's Tom Sweet. The other thing I would add is that, yes, there is a push on
certain old white – certain hyper-scale people to provide their own boxes, but the benefit that we drive is around the
engineering and logistics and some of the other service capabilities that come along with our suite of solutions.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Yeah, hi. Just a question on the services side. It looks like revenues were down about 3% year
over year. Could you maybe just talk about what was driving that, and also, to the extent you can talk about services
revenues that were client-centric, how did that perform versus the non-client-centric services revenues? That would be
helpful. Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Amit. The services business in general I would say, from our standpoint, the apps and
BPO space is a place that we've been continuing to really exit legacy contracts and focus and improve business
profitability. That's continued, and you see that in the results in the quarter. We've seen good growth in the security
element of infrastructure cloud and security, with security – and that's really the SecureWorks business driving 17%
growth in the quarter.

Support and deployment, I would say, again, that is obviously going to feel the impact of the unit declines that we're
seeing on the client business. To keep that business flat, obviously, it's taken some good work from the teams around
the tax rates, around pricing, and I think we continue to see very favorable performance, especially on the enterprise
type services side.
So clearly in a flat number there, we would have seen the client side of support and deployment down, and we saw the
significantly better enterprise growth as we implement a lot of the support capabilities around some of the acquired
enterprise hardware capabilities in the business.
So that's really how it's playing out. I would say we feel pretty good about the progress in the apps/BPO infrastructure
side of the business, in terms of improving profitability. And I think we'll continue to see progress with that as we move
into the early part of the year.
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: I'd also point out that the deferred services revenue balance on the balance sheet grew 3%,
and further evidence of some of that long-term annuity that's building on the balance sheet given the good work that the
teams have done around attach rate.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah.
Operator
Our final question will come from the line of Brian White with Topeka.
<Q - Brian J. White>: I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the trends you saw in Europe in the quarter,
and what you see looking forward.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yeah, Europe has, I would say, over the last couple of quarters, been relatively stable at a
relatively low level. So you look at the declines we saw in the fourth quarter, pretty similar to what we saw in the
second and third quarter in Europe.
So, stabilized at a relatively low level, still some good progress around the enterprise side of our business in Europe,
and saw some good growth there. Clearly better in Eastern Europe than Western Europe, but I think we're sort of
bracing for a similar environment in Europe as we start to move forward. Don't see anything that's going to make that a
whole lot different as we move into fiscal year 2014.
