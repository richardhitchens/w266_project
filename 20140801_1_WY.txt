I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.
Doyle R. Simons
Thank you, Denise, and good morning, everyone. Weyerhaeuser delivered a solid earnings performance in this second
quarter, driven by a very strong results in each of our businesses and reflecting our employees' relentless focus on
operational excellence. This morning, we reported second quarter net earnings of $280 million or $0.47 per diluted
share on net sales from continuing operations of $2 billion. Excluding discontinued operations and special items, we
earned $234 million or $0.40 per diluted share. This is an increase of nearly 65% compared with the first quarter and
almost 30% compared with one year ago.
Special items in the quarter included an ongoing gain from a change to a postretirement health plan and restructuring
charges associated with our SG&A cost reductions. Earnings associated with Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company,
WRECO, are being reported as discontinued operations as a result of the divestiture of that business on July 7. I would
like to thank the Weyerhaeuser and WRECO employees for their hard work in completing this transaction.
As part of the WRECO transaction, we retired nearly 59 million common shares worth over $1.9 billion. These
retirements, which will be reflected in our third quarter share count, more than offset the common shares issued in
conjunction with last year's Longview Timber acquisition.
I will begin the discussion of our business results with some brief comments about market conditions. Severe winter
weather earlier this year dampened the start of the spring building season and the U.S. housing market recovery
remained sluggish with total housing starts up only 6% in the first half of 2014 compared with 2013.
Rising employment and strong consumer confidence support our expectation of further housing market improvement.
However, we have lowered our 2014 housing outlook as a result of the weaker market during the first half of the year
and are now planning for between 1 million starts and 1.1 million starts.
The bottom line is we believe that residential housing markets will continue to improve but at a slower rate than have
been previously anticipated.
Let me now turn to our business segments, starting with Timberlands, chart 3 to chart 5. Timberlands posted another
outstanding quarter, contributing $170 million to earnings. In the West we experienced steady demand in our domestic
markets, but realizations for Western domestic logs declined.
Although overall Chinese demand softened somewhat during the quarter as a result of elevated inventories at the ports,
our sales volumes to our customers increased compared with the first quarter and our pricing remained comparable.
As anticipated Japanese demand weakened in the second quarter due to the effect of the increased consumption tax.
Western logging and road costs increased seasonally as we log our higher elevations in the summer months when snow
is not present.
We remain extremely pleased with the performance of our Longview Timber acquisition, which contributed $51
million of EBITDA in the quarter.
In the South fee harvest volumes declined due to wet weather. And log prices rose by approximately 1% compared with
the first quarter.
Second quarter also included $24 million from dispositions of non-strategic timberlands, an increase of $20 million
compared with the first quarter.
The Timberlands segment continues to benefit from operational excellence initiatives, including reduction in stump to
customer logging cost and increased extraction of export-quality logs.

Wood Products, chart 6 and chart 7. Wood Products earned $102 million in the second quarter, an improvement of
nearly 60% compared with the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $132 million, compared with $93 million
in the first quarter. And sales volumes increased seasonally across all our product lines.
In lumber EBITDA improved by $9 million as higher sales volumes due to improved weather and seasonality were
partially offset by lower average price realizations. Lumber manufacturing costs continue to decline as a result of our
operational excellence initiative, which are focused on lowering our cost net of logs.
In OSB EBITDA was flat as lower realizations were offset by growth in enhanced products and improved productivity.
Results for engineered wood products improved significantly compared with first quarter, as EBITDA increased nearly
fourfold to $30 million. Sales volumes increased more than 25% for solid section products and nearly 40% for TGI
(sic) [TJI] (6:39) joists. And average realizations for both products rose slightly.
The business also benefited from lower manufacturing costs compared with the prior quarter, as a result of operational
excellence initiatives and the successful ramp up of the Evergreen, Alabama, mill.
Our distribution business reported EBITDA of $3 million in the second quarter, an improvement of $8 million. The
business remains focused on lowering cost and improving sales and margins. We're extremely pleased with the
progress that our engineered wood products and distribution businesses made against their operational excellence
targets in the quarter.
Cellulose Fibers, chart 8 and chart 9. Cellulose Fibers earned $91 million, a substantial increase compared with $54
million in the first quarter. Fluff realizations were strong and maintenance costs declined due to fewer scheduled
maintenance outage days. The business had another excellent quarter operationally and set a year-to-date record for
productivity.
Discontinued operations, chart 11. As I indicated in my opening remarks results from our real estate business are now
reported as discontinued operations. Second quarter results include after-tax earnings of $22 million from discontinued
operations, compared with $10 million in the first quarter. The improvement was primarily due to a seasonal increase in
home closings.
At the end of the second quarter we had clearly identified all planned cost reductions associated with our SG&A
initiative. Implementation is ongoing, and we incurred an additional $6 million of restructuring charges in the quarter
relating to this initiative. I am highly confident we will reach our $75 million run rate reduction target by the end of the
year.
I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our third quarter outlook.
Patricia M. Bedient
Thanks, Doyle, and good morning everybody. The housing recovery thus far in 2014 has been slower than anticipated.
However this week's better-than-expected forecast on GDP growth for the remainder of the year was welcome news.
The outlook for the third quarter earnings is summarized on chart 12. And I'll begin my comments with Timberlands.
In the West export log realizations and volumes are expected to decline as a result of normal seasonal softening. The
Japan market is normally weaker during the summer months as a result of rainy weather. In addition to the normal
seasonality the Japanese lumber market has been adversely affected by the implementation of the consumption tax
increase. High log inventories at Chinese ports will also likely result in lower demand and prices.
Domestic log markets are anticipated to be weaker as well during the third quarter. Softer export markets combined
with the increased supply of logs that typically come to market during the third quarter from the smaller non-industrial
private landowners, who do not have adequate road systems to harvest on year-round basis, are expected to exert
downward pressure on prices.

As a result, in anticipation of the softer markets in the third quarter, we intentionally accelerated harvest into the first
half of this year. For these reasons, we anticipate a lower fee harvest in the West in the third quarter compared to the
second quarter.
Supply constraints as a result of fire-related logging restrictions could result in some upward price pressure in certain
markets especially in Oregon. In the third quarter, we also expect seasonal increases in Western road costs.
In the South, we expect that fee harvest will increase as some harvest in the second quarter was delayed due to wet
weather. In addition, we typically perform more of our thinning activity in the third quarter which increases volumes
and lowers the average realizations due to mix.
We are also anticipating higher costs due to seasonal increase in silvicultural activity. Earnings from non-strategic land
sales should also decrease compared to the higher level of the second quarter. We expect that overall earnings in our
Timberlands segment will be significantly lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter but comparable to
the third quarter of last year.
In Wood Products, we expect that sales realizations will be down slightly for both lumber and OSB with relatively
consistent volumes. Sales realizations for engineered lumber will be up as a result of price increases that were effective
as of the beginning of this quarter.
Engineered lumber volumes could be somewhat lower due to orders that may have been pulled forward into the second
quarter as a result of the announced price increase.
Log costs in the West should decrease in the quarter and also in Canada to a lesser extent. Housing demand has been
more muted than expected. However, our inventories continue to be in great shape across our system.
And our continued focus on cost reduction and operating efficiencies continues to benefit all businesses. We expect that
earnings in the third quarter in the Wood Products segment will be comparable to the second quarter.
In Cellulose Fibers, global softwood inventories as beginning of this quarter were in good shape at a couple of days
below normal. We do see some softening in paper grade, especially into China, and we expect that inventory levels will
return to normal during the quarter.
Fluff demand globally remains healthy, and our order books are full. The most significant change in our Cellulose
Fibers business in the third quarter will be an extended planned outage at our Longview liquid packaging operation.
We will be completing a number of capital improvements that have been planned for some time. These include
upgrades to the press section, evaporators, digester and headbox. The improvements will lower energy and fiber costs
and increase the quality of the board and product mix.
Although, the outage will result in increased maintenance costs, our sales volumes will be only somewhat lower as we
have been building inventory in anticipation of this outage and we have had excellent year-to-date operating reliability.
In addition to the liquid packaging outage, we will also have increased planned maintenance in our pulp mill system
compared to the second quarter. Overall, we expect that earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will be significantly
lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, and more comparable to the first quarter of this year.
Our real estate results have been restated for all periods to show WRECO operations as discontinued. At the end of the
second quarter, our balance sheet was grossed up for funds WRECO borrowed in anticipation of the transaction. Both
the cash and the debt are included in discounted operations as of June 30, and were eliminated after the end of the
quarter when the divestiture was completed.
As previously announced, we closed the divestiture on July 7. As a result, our share count was reduced by
approximately 59 million shares, bringing our current share count to just under 530 million shares. In addition, we
received over $700 million in cash. Our third quarter results will show a gain on the divestiture of approximately $1
billion.

Chart 10 summarizes the unallocated items for the second quarter. In the third quarter, we expect that we will once
again have a special item for the pre-tax gain of approximately $45 million related to an earlier postretirement health
plan amendment which we are amortizing ratably over the year. Other ongoing unallocated items are difficult to
forecast as they are driven by changes in foreign exchange, share price and inventory levels.
Chart 13 summarizes certain financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $845 million, an increase of
almost $70 million. There was no change to our long-term debt of just under $4.9 billion. And we have no maturities
until 2017. As of the end of the second quarter, we had year-to-date capital expenditures, including reforestation of
$159 million and we still expect the total for the year to approximate $400 million.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle and I look forward to your questions.
Doyle R. Simons
Thank you, Patty. Through the WRECO divestiture and Longview Timber acquisition, we have positioned
Weyerhaeuser as a focused forest products company with a productive asset base and significant runway for earnings
growth and cash generation. Our strong second quarter results reflect our employees' commitment to operational
excellence and we remain focused on driving superior returns from our assets to generate value for our shareholders.
Thank you. And now, I would like to open the call to questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead with
your question.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Anthony.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: I had a couple of questions in Wood Products. In engineered wood products, it looks like
you've got $20 million of EBITDA improvement year-to-date, and I believe that you had the $30 million to $40 million
target for the year. And given the progress thus far, do you feel like maybe you'll be at the top end of that range? Is
there may be a potential upside to that target? And then also for the three main businesses within Wood Products, I was
wondering if you could share what you're operating rates were in the quarter.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Sure. So, let's start with your first question, in our ELP business, Anthony, we were very
encouraged by the progress we made in the quarter. As you referenced, we went from $8 million of EBITDA in the
first quarter to $30 million of EBITDA in the second quarter.
Also, as you referenced, our commitment was to improve EBITDA net business by $30 million to $40 million in 2014
versus 2013 and we think we're well on the way to doing that. That's the commitment we're going to work to get as
much earnings out of that business as we can get in 2014 and like I said, we're very encouraged about the progress
we've made to date.
In terms of operating rates, we'll start with lumber. Lumber operating rates were in the low 90%. OSB was
approximately 90%, and then ELP overall, and as you know that's the mixture of products was in mid-70%s in terms of
operating rates for that business.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up maybe on Cellulose Fibers. The
project in liquid packaging board; is that going to result in any material increase in capacity or is it just a cost measure?

<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Anthony, the most important part of that project is cost reduction and quality
improvement. We will get some increased capacity maybe around the 10% range. But that project really was done to
lower our energy costs and our fiber costs and as I said improve the product quality.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Thank you. Just following up a little bit on the liquid packaging and Cellulose Fibers. Can
you give us a sense as to roughly how much the outages are going to impact the third quarter relative to the second
quarter?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Sure, Mark. As we indicated in the comments, we anticipate our earnings will be lower in the
third quarter versus the second quarter in Cellulose Fiber and that is primarily, if not, wholly-driven by the outages. Just
to quantify it a little bit, we think the Longview liquid packaging outage will result in roughly $30 million of impact.
And as we also said, we'll have additional outages compared to the prior quarter in our pulp mills and that'll be another
$5 million to $10 million impact on the third quarter versus the second quarter.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Right. And then is it fair to say that when you come out of it though, the other end, you
not only get that back but presumably from the project, particularly in the liquid packaging, you'd hopefully have even
higher earnings power, assuming pricing and markets are similar. Any way to give us a feel for the type of returns or
earning enhancement that you might get from the project?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Well, as Patty alluded to, Mark, the project will do three things, improve quality, lower cost,
and then have roughly a 10% – it'll take a little bit time to get there, but 10% improvement in production. So, all of
those things will factor in. We won't provide a specific number but clearly the reason for doing that project is to drive
additional earnings in cash out of our liquid packaging board operation.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Okay. Thank you, and congratulations for the evidence of continued operational
improvement.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you, Mark.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Yes. Good morning, Doyle, and congratulations on a great quarter.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thanks, Chip.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: I wanted to ask you about distribution. I know that it seemed like in the first quarter, hadn't
really, turned much of a quarter but on the numbers I see here, it looks like you went from something like a $16 million
EBITDA loss in the first half of 2013 to a $2 million loss in the first half of 2014. So, it may not be – it may not have
arrived yet, but it looks like if the needle's moving in the right direction. Do you still think you'll get to your goals for
the year? And have your feelings about the business changed any in the last three months to six months?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: So we're very encouraged about the progress we've made in distribution, Chip. And as you
will recall the objective there is to improve earnings about $30 million to $40 million in that business versus 2013. We
think we're absolutely on track to do that.

I can tell you there's a real focus on continuing to grow profitable share, making sure our costs are at the targeted
levels. And I'll just tell you we're encouraged as now more than half of our sites are in fact profitable. And we see more
and more of those becoming profitable as we move forward.
So again lots of work to do as you mentioned, but very encouraged by the progress that has been made over the past
couple of quarters.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Okay. And then on the $1 billion gain on WRECO, is there any tax impact on that that we
should anticipate in the third quarter?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: No, Chip. That transaction as we talked about was done in a Reverse Morris Trust
structure. And that is one of the benefits of that structure is there is not a tax on that gain.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: I see. And then lastly just on the dividend at this point, I would imagine with the $700 million
plus coming in from WRECO and with the strong results – and I know the third quarter is not going to be quite a repeat
– but with the lower share count is that something that you guys are thinking about in the near term in terms of
[indiscernible] (23:34)?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: So, Chip, as we previously disclosed we're going to be visiting with our board in mid-August
regarding the dividend, potential use of cash proceeds, and those type of things. Just to remind you and everybody else,
as we think about capital allocation and what our financial priorities are, as you know first and foremost is returning
cash to shareholders primarily through a growing dividend but also by share repurchase where appropriate.
Second is investing in our business through high return projects just as you heard on Cellulose Fiber this morning that
improve cost structure and our margin. And of course we'll also look for opportunities to grow our business through
value-creating acquisitions. Again an example there would be Longview.
And then finally, making sure we maintain the appropriate capital structure. And as you know we're in good shape on
that front. So that's the way we think about it. And again we'll be back to you in mid-August.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Thank you.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Morning, Gail.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Morning, Gail.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Maybe going back to engineered wood for a little bit. The volume growth that you had
relative to the comments about housing maybe not picking up as quickly as you'd thought. And given how much
engineered wood is driven by housing, I mean what do you think drove your volumes? Were you picking up share?
Was there an inventory build? Or do you think that volume has actually been used?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: I think there are a couple of things that were happening. Or I'm guessing there were a couple
of things that were happening there.
I think first, as we mentioned, Gail, there's a price increase going into effect first quarter through the third quarter. So I
think there might have been some pull forward in terms of buying in the second quarter versus the third quarter. So I
think that's part of the equation.

I will also tell you as I mentioned earlier we had a very focused sales effort in that business. And I'm encouraged by the
progress we're making there. So I think our sales folks did a really good job of growing profitable share in that business
in the second quarter as well.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: And, Gail, as Doyle referenced in his remarks, we did bring up the Evergreen, Alabama,
facility. So all of our engineered wood products facilities now are operating. And so that came up, started shipping
product in May. So we'll have it for the full quarter in the third quarter.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And I'm looking at Cellulose Fiber. Was there anything in the second quarter result
that you wouldn't view as sustainable? I mean it was your best quarter since 2011, yet pricing for pulp at least didn't
move dramatically. I'm just wondering kind of what you think drove that upside?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well probably the thing that drove the upside the most was just outstanding operational
performance across the Cellulose Fiber system. And I think that all of the hard work that they've been doing is paying
off. And I would look to that being sustainable and repeatable as we go forward.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And looking at the Japanese market. I guess what trends did you see moving through
the quarter? Obviously the tax went up at the start of the quarter. Were things still getting worse? Are they stable? Just
how do you see that market?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Are you talking primarily on logs for that?
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Logs. The logs market. Yes.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yes. Yes. So we had thought that it would be impacted. We started to see some impact in
the second quarter. And that continued into the third quarter.
It's a little difficult to tell for sure, because as I mentioned the third quarter is normally seasonally weaker. But I think
the latest news that we heard just earlier this week was that the Japanese government is thinking that the impact of the
consumption tax, now this is broadly, was not as significant as many once thought. And that it is starting to come up.
And they see more activity toward the second half of the year, but we'll have to see. But certainly it is soft during the
third quarter.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And just one last question. Your Timberlands guidance for the quarter, can you give
a sense of what type of land sale activity might be incorporated in that?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure. It will be lower than the second quarter, as we mentioned. It'll probably be
somewhere around $8 million to $10 million lower than the second quarter.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Alex.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Couple of questions starting off in engineered wood products. Can you put a little bit of more
meat around how much you think pre-buy may have contributed to the volume number in the second quarter? I guess,
we're now through July, kind of looking at how the volume trends were in EWP in July. Does that sort of give you any
incremental insight in to how much pre-buy there was in the second quarter?

<A - Doyle R. Simons>: No, Alex. It's always difficult to assess pre-buy. I would tell you the – our activity in the
month of July continued to be good. So, I would tell you, there's some – there clearly was some pre-buy in the month –
or in the second quarter, but we didn't see just the dramatic fall off in July, so we continue to be encouraged by those
markets and our sales efforts in those markets.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Okay. That's very helpful, Doyle. And then, when you talk about share, so taking share in the
EWP, is that against just traditional lumber or would that be against other players in the EWP market?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yes. And again, it's hard to know exactly what happens on shares because we don't see all the
different information. But really what we're talking about when we talk about profitable growth is just growing the ELP
business overall. Is there some coming out of sawlogs? Maybe, but that's not specifically what we're talking – when I
say – I didn't mean sawlogs – is some of it coming out of lumber? Possibly, but that's not really what we're referring to.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Okay. Understood. And then just one last one, Patty, on the corporate lines just from a modeling
perspective. So, is this really [ph] $0 to minus $5 million (30:07) and then everything else is kind of noise around like
you said currency and inventories and some of the other things that flow through that line?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yes. Alex, as I mentioned, it is difficult to forecast and that's one of the reasons why when
we put this information together, we've started putting that chart 10 together for you to see. You can see what it looks
like in the number of things that move around. So, for us, the foreign exchange really is a function of the Canadian
exchange rate. So, as that moves, our share base comp certainly you can track that with the stock price.
And then there's just whole lot of other stuff that goes in there. This quarter and as we go forward, the other thing that
we are focused on is lowering our G&A but we will have some costs on a go-forward basis that were historically
allocated to the WRECO business and we are focused on making those costs lower as well but you may see some
choppiness as a result of that as we work through the G&A costs.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Okay. Got you. All right. Thank you very much, Patty. I appreciate it.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: You bet.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: Morning, Doyle. Morning, Patty.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Morning, Mark.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Morning, Mark. Good to hear you.
<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: Good to be here. I wondered if you guys could talk a little bit about just the shift that we've
seen over the last year and sort of where your log exports are going because it's been a pretty marked drop off in the
proportion of the volume that goes to Japan and about a 20% to 40% in terms of the growth in what's going to China.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure, Mark. It really is a function of not Japan getting smaller but the China market
growing. And so, as you think about the percentage of the pie to those markets, it moves around. What we're really
focused on is growing the pie, and Japan continues to be an extremely good market and important market to us. But
what's moving that really is more growth in the China market in terms of incremental growth.
<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: And, Patty, does that – should that change sort of your average just realization in your export
log prices? Because my understanding is always that China doesn't buy as high priced of log as what goes into the
Japanese market.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yes. That's fair, Mark. From a mix perspective, you will see the average realization come
down. But you will still see a spread between the specific China log compared to the Japanese log.

<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: Yes. And how would you think about that spread right now?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: It's closing a little bit, but they're both – both of them have come down in the quarter as we
talked about. So, I don't know that the spread is changing all that much.
<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: Okay. Just a couple of other quick ones. Doyle, can you talk a little bit about how you would
think about both investments and/or acquisitions outside of Timberlands, say, in the Wood Products area? And then
could you give us a little color on that joint venture you announced with Pioneer?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Okay. In terms of the way we look at acquisition opportunities in Wood Products, Mark, we
will – as we've said, we would be interested in potentially growing our Wood Products business, but we're going to be
very disciplined. We're not going to grow those businesses just for the sake of growing.
And if we find one-off opportunities, that's something we would consider. But our primary focus in our Wood Products
business, as we said, is just running on what we have better and that's what we're focused on doing every day.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yes. Mark, I think you're referencing the licensing that we did on some of our technology,
IT...
<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: Yes.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: ...international, intellectual property. And I think it's an important recognition of the
importance and the strength of our intellectual property, but I will tell you that it's not a meaningful increase in terms of
our quarterly results.
<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: Okay. Very good. That's helpful. Good luck in the second half of the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thank you. To follow on Mark's question, so the market in Asia for logs is moving in the
direction that you said last quarter you thought it would. Does that change the way you think about your Timberland
mix?
Over the years, obviously, Weyerhaeuser bulked up on higher-value species and got rid of a lot of the lower-value
Hemlock and other lower-value stuff. So, are we likely to see Weyerhaeuser maybe attempt to move that shift back to
owning or be more willing to own lower-value species in the Pacific Northwest?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, Mark, we are focused primarily on Douglas-fir. That is what most of our lands are
best suited to grow. We do have some white woods as well. And so as you know, not every acre grows best the same
species. So, I would say we will continue to have a focus on Douglas-fir but our white woods inventory will be
important as well although it does come at a lower price point based on the quality.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Okay. And then a second question. You've said that you have catch up investing to do
particularly in Wood Products. When do you think you will have caught up? Will that happen this year or next year?
And what do you think of as normal spending in manufacturing and maintenance, once that catch up is done?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: So, Mark, we're spending a lot of time working on capital issues currently. We will, as
always, once we make some decisions for next year either late this year or early next year, we will be passing those on
to you. It will take more than one year period to make the investments in some of our Wood Products operations that
we need to get our cost structure to where we want it to be.

And as you know, that's the real focus of the investment, we're going to make going forward is to continue to drive
down our cost structure in order to fully accomplish the OpEx initiatives that we laid out. So, that's how we're thinking
about it. And as we develop more detail, we will be sharing that with you.

Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. I guess, my first question,
I wanted to go back to distribution. And, Doyle, recognizing there were a number of factors that you had mentioned in
the past that you're focused on in terms of improving the profitability, were there one key thing or two key things that
you did this quarter, better as a business than you did first quarter or second quarter last year that drove the swing in
profitability, and could you comment to those things?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Sure, George. And it really is when you step back and look at it, it's getting the focus where it
needs to be and just doing the blocking and tackling better. But just a couple of things that I would highlight is we set
very specific targeted cost levels that we needed to accomplish in our distribution business to start to get earnings
where they needed to be, and we made significant progress toward those target levels in the second quarter.
And then the other thing I would say is, while we've been successful in driving the top line in that business as I've
referred to, we haven't always had a focus on driving what I call a profitable share and I think our folks did a really nice
job of growing business that added profit to the bottom line in the quarter.
So those are the two specific things that I would highlight occurred in the quarter. Again, more work to do but really
encouraged about the progress that we're making in distribution and our folks have done a lot of really good work in
that business.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: In terms of the runway, is it going to be more on the cost side? Or is it going to be more on
what you've got on the racks and can sell? I mean, where do you get the further uplift from here if you had to pick
between those two?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Normally, I'm not ambiguous as you know, George. But I would tell you it's absolutely both.
We have to pull both those levers to get to where we need to get to. So, I think there's opportunities both on the cost
side and making sure we get the turns right, making sure we have the right products that our customers need.
So lots of leverage to pull in that business, and we're going to need to pull every one of them and we are.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Okay. Thanks for that. Doyle, in terms of the Longview board machine, I seem to
remember that machine, may be had some operating difficulties in the last couple of years. Now, clearly you're going to
improve productivity, you're going to improve cost and you're going to need a little bit of throughput out of this as well.
But how much of this was driven by the fact that maybe the machine had been a little bit less reliable in terms of
quality over the last few years? And can you explain a little bit more in terms of what was behind that?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: So, let me give my view point and probably a little more short-term and then I'll let Patty
expand on it. But, again, I can just tell you this facility has run really well, and Patty mentioned in her comments, has
run really well over the past few quarters both from a quality perspective. You're right historically we've had some
quality issues. But quality, we made significant improvements in quality over the past few quarters.
And just to be real straightforward about it the operating rates and reliability of liquid packaging have been kind of off
the charts the last few quarters.

Now again we're excited about the outage and the capital that we're going to spend, because we think that's going to
allow us to take it to the next level. But this is not one where we go, oh we're having big, big problems. We got to go
spend this money. This is one that's really going to just further enhance what we've been able to do at this facility at
least over the past year.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah that's...
<Q - George L. Staphos>: That's fine. That's where I was going with that question. Go ahead, Patty. I'm sorry.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: No. I was going to say, George, that as we look at the spending that's being done at
Longview, there is some spending for cleaners that will improve the quality. But as a percentage of the total dollars it's
a small amount of that.
The big piece as well in this project is that it will allow us to upgrade the product mix coming out of that operation.
Today the excess slush pulp goes in to wet lap, and so there's not a great market for that. So we'll be able to change the
product mix a little bit.
And then again the big piece will be just lowering the fiber cost and lowering the energy cost.
So it's not a place where as we look across our system that we would spend capital in any operation that we didn't think
had the ability to run well and run reliably. And Longview has proven that. And I think they have a really good package
going forward as it relates to the return that we'll get from these projects.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Okay. Last question and I'll turn it over. Would it be fair to say that – recognizing it's the
board's decision – that at this juncture from your vantage point of the key metrics, either from a balance sheet
standpoint or the operating fundamentals of the company and the sectors that you're in, that you've checked the boxes
so to speak in terms of being able to raise a dividend in the next several quarters? Thanks guys and good luck in the
quarter.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yes. I think, George, going back to the comments that I made in December at the Investor
Meeting. We said that we would be looking forward to increasing the dividend in the future. But that would likely be
after we closed the WRECO transaction. And that is now closed. And as Doyle said we'll be visiting on that with the
board at their next board meeting in mid-August.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Thank you, Patty.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Steve P. Chercover>: Thanks. Good morning everyone.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Morning, Steve.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<Q - Steve P. Chercover>: A couple that pertain to I guess the Wood Products segment. Starting with engineered
wood products I think you indicated that all of your facilities are now running, and you're at around a 75% operating
rate. If we call housing at 1 million and potential 1.5 million, that's a 66% operating rate. Will you guys have sufficient
engineered wood product when the housing actually hits mid-cycle? Particularly if EWP gained share versus solids on
lumber?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: So as I've said we're running at 75% kind of on a blended average across the system. Some of
our mills are running more than that. Some of our facilities are running less than that.
So clearly in some products as housing continues to improve, we may not have enough production to always meet our
customers' demands. In others we clearly do have. As Patty mentioned we're just in the process of ramping up

Evergreen. So we've clearly gotten more capacity there.
So we feel pretty good about where we're positioned overall in engineered lumber in order to continue to service our
customers as we move forward.
<Q - Steve P. Chercover>: But the capacity you have is the limit? Right? Everything that has been decommissioned
has been demolished? Or is there any kind of temporarily or indefinitely idled capacity that still exists?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: No. You're exactly right. The capacity that we have is what we have. And so there's nothing
sitting out there to go start back up. We're running what we have.
<Q - Steve P. Chercover>: Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And then just on distribution great to see it turn the
corner a little bit. Again looking towards mid-cycle can you give us a sense of what the revenues and I guess EBITDA
or margin are please?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yes. And it's hard to project exactly what revenues or earnings are going to be. But I'll just
tell you as mentioned our commitment this year is to improve by $30 million to $40 million in our distribution. But let's
be clear about it. That doesn't get us to where we absolutely need to be. We think as we do benchmarking versus our
competition, we understand we're clearly not the leader.
Our goal will be to be the leader in that business. And I'll just put it this way, Steve, I think there's still a lot of runway.
Once we accomplish the $30 million to $40 million this year, there's still a lot of runway in front of us to continue to
improve earnings and cash flow out of that business going forward.
<Q - Steve P. Chercover>: Yes. I should think so. And so therefore would it be safe to say that your aspiration is to
see 3%, perhaps 4% EBITDA margin once you're back at mid-cycle potential?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yes. I mean our goal is to be like I said the leader in that business. And those type of numbers
are absolutely what we ought to be able to accomplish.
<Q - Steve P. Chercover>: Great. Thanks, Doyle.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Yes. Thanks very much. Morning, Doyle and Patty. Just couple of easy questions here. Just to
kind of put in context on Cellulose Fibers, you mentioned that year-to-date record productivity and I know you've
moved to 18-month maintenance schedules on some of your mills. Just if you could give us an update on where you are
in that program? And then how the year-to-date productivity record sort of balances with that?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure, Paul. As it relates to the 18-month cycle, now all mills will be on an 18-month cycle.
The last one really is Longview which was on 18-month and we took it down – it went down in 2013. It's coming down
this year in order for us to be able to put those capital improvements in.
But now, they are all on an 18-month cycle going forward. So, I don't have the specific how many mills in which year
will be in, 2015 versus 2014 in front of me, but they are all on that cycle.
In terms of the productivity, that really is, as we look at it, how are we doing in terms of our uptime and how are we
doing in terms of our production per day, and all of our mills are really operating very strongly and they are competing
with each other as well. As one gets better, they benchmark each other and share best practices, and we're really
pleased with the work that's being done by the folks in Cellulose Fibers.
As I mentioned the third quarter, our earnings will be significantly lower, but that's because of the maintenance that
we're doing, not because the mills aren't running well.

<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Okay. Great to hear. And, Doyle, you mentioned that you'd be interested in growing the Wood
Products business. Just curious as to which area within Wood Products is more highly sought after than other areas?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yes. And what I said on the Wood Products business is our primary focus is continuing to run
what we have better, and again, making progress there. In terms of specific business, there's not a specific business we
feel compelled to grow at all. We like our position in all of those – in those businesses. Again, we think our biggest
opportunity is to run what we have better.
With that said, if we find growth opportunities that we think can add additional value for our shareholders in that
business, that's something we would consider.

Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Good morning, Patty and Doyle.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Congrats on the quarter. Couple of questions here. Can you guys discuss a little bit more about
the trends you're seeing in the different wood baskets you operate in, in the U.S. South? I know we've heard kind of just
generally out there that Arkansas and Mississippi have really lagged maybe, as it relates to you guys, the Carolinas but
put a little bit more color on what you're seeing kind of your expectations there for the back half of the year.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Sure. So in terms of Southern sawlogs we – as you step back and look at it overall in the
South and then we can talk more regionally, that overall in the South we saw our sawlog prices go up about 4% in 2013
versus 2012. As we mentioned earlier we have seen saw log prices up modestly in the first half of 2014 versus 2013
and we think that trend will continue into the second half of 2014.
Yes, there are always some regional differences based on capacity, based on weather, based on a lot of different things.
So, yes, you do see some different things in mid-South versus Gulf versus Atlantic whatever the case maybe. But
overall we continue to anticipate slow but continued improvement in sawlog prices going forward.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Okay. And then, Patty, I don't know if maybe you guys could break out roughly how much of
the EBIT during the quarter came from the South versus say the West?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: I don't have that exact number in front of me. I would tell you that in terms of looking
forward in the third quarter most of the decrease in the EBIT will come in the West versus the South because of the
export markets both in terms of what the export markets are doing in export and then obviously, that has an impact
back to the domestic market as well.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Okay. And then just really following up on an earlier question and I know it's early but as you
think about the – really the step up in the run rate as far as the CapEx this year is, $400 million kind of – is that even
appropriate as we think about 2015? Or could there be another, I guess, I'm asking could there be another leg up in
terms of CapEx dollars? Or do you feel like this was kind of the high watermark?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Collin, as we look at our capital expenditure, what will drive that is our ability to continue
to have high quality projects which we would focus on as driving our costs down. So, as Doyle said, we're still looking
at those numbers. I hope actually that, that number will go up a little bit because that means we do have good projects.
But we're still working through that as we speak.

And I think the other thing that we have really had a focus on is making sure that before we spend capital, all of our
operations are really operating well. So, we're not looking at growing capacity necessarily from additional capital
spend. It really is focused on improving the cost position of our operations. But we'll be giving you more clarity on that
as we get closer to the end of the year.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Okay. And then, again, going back to just the capital allocation and still recognizing you're in
the middle of that process right now. Can you maybe just put a little bit more detail on how much time are you really
actively spending right now looking at Timberland acquisitions and growing that part of the footprint? Or has it really
just been trying to, again, determine where you want to put capital to work and still kind of integrating Longview?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: We are always looking for opportunities to grow our Timberland base. So, there is, as you
probably are, – I'm sure you know there is some activity out there. There's been a pretty consistent flow. We look at
every opportunity that comes along. We take a disciplined approach to it, and we will continue to do that. So, no, we
didn't – Longview has been a fantastic acquisition for us. We're well ahead of our synergy targets. We're on track to
deliver the EBITDA that we indicated out of that acquisition. But we didn't put other things on hold as we went through
that process.
We've continued to look. Again, we'll be very disciplined. But we think there will be opportunities to grow our
Timberland base going forward and we're focused on doing just that.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over.

Thank you. And thanks, everybody, for joining this morning. Before we sign off, one thing I would like to do is I
would like to acknowledge Kathy McAuley, who actually retires, effective today. It's hard to express just how much
Kathy has contributed to Weyerhaeuser during her 14 years with us, but Patty and I would like to offer our sincere
thanks, and more importantly wish her all the best in her retirement.
As we have previously announced, Denise Merle has taken on responsibility as Senior Vice President of HR and
Investor Relations, and Beth Baum is the Director of Investor Relations. They will both be available to answer any
follow-up questions that you may have.
And again, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Weyerhaeuser.
