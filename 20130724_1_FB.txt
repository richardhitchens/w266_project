Mark Elliot Zuckerberg
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We've made some really good progress this quarter with
the growth and engagement of our community, the release of new products like Instagram Video and advertising
growth, especially on mobile. When it comes to mobile, I'm very pleased with the results. We now have more daily
actives on mobile than on desktop, nearly half a billion people use Facebook on their phones every day, and soon we'll
have more revenue on mobile than on desktop as well. This progress is the result of investments we started making
more than a year ago and in some cases years ago. I appreciate the patience and the trust of our team, our community
and our investors have given us, and we're looking forward to seeing our other long-term investments achieve great
results as well.
One of the questions I frequently get asked are, what are the big changes we want to make in the world over the next
five or 10 years? Now that we've connected a billion people, what are the next big ambitions? There are three main
goals I'd like us to achieve. Connect everyone, understand the world, and help build the knowledge economy.
Connecting everyone is about growing our community to reach the next 5 billion people. Our mission is to give all
people the power to share and make the world more open and connected, and that means everyone, not just people in
developed countries. Most people in the world don't yet have smartphones or data access, but we know they want to be
connected. We're focused on making this possible while also strengthening engagement within our existing community.
Understanding the world is about helping people share not just day-to-day updates like text messages and photos but
also building up long-term knowledge about the world like what people are interested in, which restaurants are good,
which hotels your friends have stayed at and so on. We should be able to build intelligent services that help you use
your network to answer lots of questions for you that no other service can, and we want to lead our community to
create a graph of all that understanding to power this intelligence.
Building the knowledge economy is about helping people create companies and jobs using information. The way I see
our advertising product, we aren't just building a strong monetization engine for our company, we're creating tools to
enable new growth to jobs and businesses through our platform and to support a larger economic shift in the world
based on knowledge and information. I'm proud of the work we're doing here to help developers create apps, to help
local businesses find customers, to help great brands tell their stories and this is a core part of our mission.
Now let's talk about the progress we've made in each of these areas starting with connecting everyone. The Facebook
community has grown steadily this quarter, adding 45 million new monthly actives and the number of monthly actives
is steady or increasing across demographics and countries.

One thing that surprised me as we've grown is I've always expected our ratio of daily actives to monthly actives would
decrease as later technology adopters used our service. The opposite has actually been true, and now 61% of monthly
actives are daily actives and that ratio has just continued to increase. In our most penetrated markets like the U.S., more
than 70% of our monthly actives use our services daily. And now, more than 700 million people worldwide use
Facebook daily as of today.
As more social services get created, one question is how that affects the sharing and time that people spend on
Facebook. You could naïvely assume that more new services means people spend less time on Facebook, but that isn't
happening. In fact, people on average are spending more time on Facebook than ever before. It's possible that because
the market is expanding due to mobile, even as time spend per person increases on Facebook, maybe our market share
could decrease, but that doesn't seem to be happening either. According to third-party metrics like comScore and
Nielsen, Facebook's share of time spent in the U.S. is either steady or increasing, and we believe it's either steady or
increasing everywhere else as well. This makes sense to me because Facebook helps you maintain your real identity in
relationships, which are universal needs. We believe that if we execute well, we have a good shot at growing the
amount of time that people spend using Facebook while also maintaining or increasing our overall share of time spent.
One specific demographic I want to address is U.S. teens. There's been a lot of speculation and reporting that fewer
teens are using Facebook, but based on our data that just isn't true. It's difficult to measure this perfectly since some
young people lie about their age, but based on the best data we have we believe that we are close to fully penetrated in
the U.S. teen demographic for a while and the number of teens using Facebook on both a daily and monthly basis has
been steady over the past year and a half. Teens also remain really highly engaged using Facebook.
Now it's also worth mentioning that these stats are for Facebook only. Instagram is growing quickly as well. So if you
combine the two services together, we believe our engagement and share of time spent are likely growing quickly
throughout the world.
Next let's talk about building more useful services on the path to understanding the world. The newest product I'm most
excited about from our last quarter is Instagram Video. Adding video fits really naturally with the Instagram mission of
capturing and sharing the world's moments, and it's off to a great start. People are already uploading hours of video to
Instagram every minute. I'm really proud of the team, and I think they did a great job with this product.
When I first saw talked to Kevin about this he had a really smart insight. Instagram has always been about helping
people capture moments in a way they're proud of. Filters were necessary for photos because when Instagram started
most phone cameras weren't good enough to take high-quality photos, but lack of filters isn't what's holding back
videos from being great. It's that they're shaky and feel unprofessional.
Kevin realized that if we could deliver a product that helped people produce stable videos that would really change the
landscape and I think it already is. Now some products like video fit into the flow of what people are doing and they
take off quickly. Others like Graph Search and Home are completely new kinds of products and they're just going to
take longer to develop. I think it's the right strategy to have a balance of long-term foundational new products than ones
that fit an immediate demand. We're committed to building all of these into market-leading products.
Finally, let's talk about building the knowledge economy and what that means for our core business. This quarter has
been a strong period for us. A lot of new businesses have signed up to advertise with us, and we now have more than a
million active advertisers. Our News Feed ads products are working well for them. One of the things I watch most
closely is the quality of our ads and people's sentiment around them. Right now, ads on average make up about 5% or 1
in 20 stories in News Feed. We haven't measured a meaningful drop in satisfaction when we asked people about their
experience with Facebook. We're comparing that to the result we get when we asked the same question to people using
a version of Facebook with no feed ads at all.
Now, that said, in recent studies people have told us that they notice the ads more. So we're going to invest more in
improving the quality. Our top priorities to expand the number of marketers and overall demand in our system rather
than just increasing the number of ads that we show. We believe that this will help us improve the quality of the ads
that we show by creating a more competitive auction, and this will create the best experience for people who use our

products, the best returns for more marketers and the best results for us.
So that's my update for this quarter. We've made a lot of progress in the last three months on growing our community
engagement, releasing a successful major product and generating strong financial results. This quarter also marks the
end of our first year as a public company, and I think we've created a good foundation for the future. I want to take a
moment to thank everyone who works at Facebook and everyone who's a part of this great community. You're all
helping to connect the world and push it forward. I'm grateful to have the chance to work with all of you on this. So
thank you and thanks to everyone on this call for joining us today. I look forward to having more to share next quarter.
And now, Sheryl.
Sheryl K. Sandberg
Thanks, Mark. Our advertising business gained significant momentum this quarter, growing 61% year-over-year to
$1.6 billion. Our mobile ad revenue grew significantly as well and is now approximately 41% of total ad revenue, up
from about 30% in Q1. This growth was robust across all regions and each of our four marketing segments increased
spending with us this quarter. We believe this is because our ad products are delivering impressive ROI for each of
these types of marketers. Direct response marketers, including e-commerce companies, increased their spend
significantly. Year-over-year, ad revenue from e-commerce companies doubled in the second quarter. Direct response
marketers are taking advantage of our high click-through rates and competitive CPCs to grow their businesses. These
marketers are typically very measurement focused and they quickly increase their budgets as we deliver compelling
ROI.
Revenue from mobile app install ads also continues to accelerate. The app market is relatively new but is already large
and growing very rapidly. We believe that Facebook is one of the most effective ways for developers to acquire new
customers at competitive rates. We're increasing our share and helping to grow this market.
Local businesses also grew spend significantly. We surpassed 1 million active advertisers this quarter, more than
double the number we had only a year ago. We believe that this rapid growth is being driven by our unique ability to
target ads and the simpler ad products we rolled out in the past year. We're all really excited that we can help local
businesses grow around the world. One of my favorite local examples is right in our backyard, ArtisanState, a San
Francisco business that prints photo books. The owner told us that running News Feed ads gained them so many
customers so quickly that they had to pause their campaigns to let their manufacturing catch up. Nearly 18 million local
businesses now have Facebook pages. While we are excited to hit 1 million active advertisers, we know that this is just
a small fraction of the local businesses on Facebook. So this remains a large growth opportunity for us.
And finally, brand marketers also continue to grow spend. We have a massive and engaged audience around the world
that brands can use to build awareness and drive scale. Every night, 88 million to 100 million people are actively using
Facebook during primetime TV hours in United States alone. One recent example is from Reckitt Benckiser, a global
CPG company. Their campaign for Lysol targeted moms and drove a 2x return on ad spend for their brand. Their
campaign for Air Wick was even better, driving a 5x return on ad spend. As they have seen these results, they have
more than doubled their ad spend with us over the last year. News Feed ads are performing very well. In an analysis by
Datalogix of 55 ad campaigns on Facebook over the past six months, marketers saw a median return on ad sales of 3x
for campaigns that did not include ad in News Feed, which is very solid performance. For campaigns that included
News Feed ads, the median return on ad sales was nearly double at 5.9x. During the second quarter, we increased the
number and type of ads in News Feed. At the same time, our click-through rates and cost-per-click metrics for News
Feed ads remained strong during the quarter, providing a good indicator of healthy and growing advertiser demand and
continued user interest in these ads.
Custom Audiences is another key product that continues to gain momentum. This product enables our clients to
enhance their ad targeting by marrying their data with ours in a privacy protected way. In Q2, the number of marketers
using Custom Audiences more than doubled relative to Q1. We also continue to innovate around our mobile ad
product. In April, we launched ad targeting for feature phones. This helps marketers, everyone from multinationals to

local businesses, reach people in emerging markets, who they could not easily reach before. While these ad markets are
not especially large today, they'll become increasingly important in the years to come.
In summary, we believe we're making strong progress executing our strategy. As I have mentioned in previous
quarters, we are investing in mobile, measurement, and product innovation. The results we're reporting today
demonstrate the early returns on these investments. Looking ahead, we're enthusiastic about the long-term prospects for
our business. The time people are spending on mobile devices is increasing dramatically, yet mobile represents just 2%
of ad spend globally and 3% in the U.S. We have a massive and growing mobile user base. We have an impressive
share of mobile time spent, and we have one of, if not, the most effective mobile ad products. Together, this positions
us well to lead the mobile ad market.
We believe that over time marketers will increasingly rely on Facebook not just to reach people wherever they are, but
to fundamentally transform the way they build their businesses. As Facebook delivers personalized experiences to over
1.1 billion people, we also have a unique opportunity to deliver a more personalized advertising experience. As I meet
with the marketers all around the world, I find more and more that they are understanding the benefits of this
opportunity. As a result, Facebook is poised to play a central role in the evolution of marketing. We know we still have
a lot of hard work to do, but we're excited about this quarter and the opportunity in front of us.
Now, David.
David A. Ebersman
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'd like to update you on our progress in Q2 against our key
financial objectives: increasing revenue, investing to drive our future growth, and positioning the company to maximize
long-term returns for our shareholders. It was a great quarter across the board as we continue to benefit from and
effectively navigate the transition to mobile.
Let's start with our network. Usage and engagement on Facebook remain extremely strong as evidenced by the
following. On an average day in June 699 million people used Facebook, up 27% from last year. This represents 61%
of the 1.15 billion people who accessed Facebook at any point during the month of June. Additionally, time spent per
person on Facebook continues to increase. In aggregate, across everyone in our network, time spent on Facebook
exceeded 20 billion minutes each day in June. Separately, Instagram continues to grow rapidly with impressive
engagement, and we announced last month we had over 130 million actives using the service. Overall, we're really
pleased by the unprecedented growth and engagement of our community at this scale.
Now, let's turn to the financials. In Q2 total revenue was $1.81 billion, up 53% or 54% when adjusted for constant
exchange rates. Ad revenue was $1.6 billion, up 61% in the quarter or 63% when adjusted for constant exchange rates.
This was our strongest quarter in terms of advertising revenue growth since the third quarter of 2011. The performance
was strong throughout the world, with ad revenue in each of our geographic regions growing by greater than 50%.
Growth in advertising revenue was driven by an increase in the number of marketers, overall advertising demand, and
the strong performance of News Feed ads. News Feed ads work. They've been remarkably effective at delivering high
levels of engagement, a significant increase in click-through rates and overall number of clicks, and marketers have
increased budgets meaningfully in response.
Overall ad impressions were up 43%, and the average price per ad was up 13% compared to last year. Ad impressions
are up due to more people using our service worldwide, combined with the impact of reducing the price floor late in
June 2012, which resulted in more ads being shown, particularly in developing markets. In the U.S. and Canada, where
the price floor changes had a smaller impact, ad volume increased 6% and average price per ad increased over 40%
year-over-year, driven by the growth of the higher performing News Feed ads.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $214 million in Q2, an increase of 11% versus last year. Payments revenue
from games specifically was up 7%, but we believe 11% represents the best apples-to-apples comparison if we adjust
for items such as the change in revenue recognition timing we made late last year.

We were pleased to see King's continued rapid growth on our games platform in Q2. King's strategy of launching
games like Candy Crush Saga on Facebook and subsequently launching on mobile has proved to be an effective
approach that enables people to seamlessly play games across desktop and mobile, and we expect other game
developers to pursue a similar strategy. We believe Facebook continues to offer a compelling platform for developers
to build great games and businesses.
Overall ARPU increased 25%, compared to last year to $1.60 per user for the quarter, including a 35% increase in the
United States and Canada as well as 30% plus gains in all our other regions.
Turning now to expenses; in Q2 our GAAP total expenses were $1.25 billion. Excluding stock compensation
non-GAAP total expenses increased 52% to $1.02 billion, primarily driven by head count and infrastructure. We ended
the quarter just shy of 5,300 employees, up 33% from last year, and we continue to be pleased with our success in
attracting talent. Our Q2 GAAP operating income was $562 million, representing a 31% operating margin. Excluding
stock comp, our non-GAAP operating income was $794 million, a 44% non-GAAP operating margin. Our GAAP tax
rate for Q2 was 39%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 37%. GAAP net income was $333 million or $0.13 per share,
and non-GAAP net income was $488 million or $0.19 per share.
We spent $268 million on CapEx in Q2 as we continue to invest in our data centers and facilities. While the relatively
lower spend on CapEx in Q2 is partially the result of timing of purchases, it also reflects the returns from a significant
effort by employees throughout the company to make our software and hardware more efficient. CapEx will remain
one of our primary areas of spend since we need a powerful infrastructure to provide content-rich and personalized
information to all the people who use our service around the world. But projects like Open Compute and many others
are providing great returns for us and helping ensure we're able to invest our resources in a disciplined and efficient
manner.
Of note, free cash flow in Q2 was over $1 billion. This is much higher than we expect in coming quarters as Q2 free
cash flow benefited from a $419-million tax refund and light quarterly spend on CapEx. But still, $1 billion in free cash
flow is a nice milestone for us against an important financial metric. In Q2, similar to prior quarters, upon the vesting of
employee RSUs, we withheld shares and paid the associated income taxes for our employees, which provides an
outcome similar to Facebook having repurchased approximately $153 million worth of shares in the quarter. We ended
Q2 were $10.3 billion in cash and investments.
Now, I want to conclude by sharing some thoughts about the second half of 2013. We expect News Feed ads to remain
the main driver of revenue growth in the second half of the year and we believe we have a great opportunity to continue
to drive long-term growth by improving the quality and relevance of these ads. However, remember that News Feed
ads really began to contribute to our revenue in the third and fourth quarters last year, which will make for more
difficult year-over-year comparisons in Q3 and Q4 relative to Q2.
Looking at expenses, consistent with what we've said previously, we plan to invest in our business and continue to
expect that our total non-GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue but excluding stock comp, will likely grow in the
neighborhood of 50% for the full year 2013 compared to 2012. We also continue to expect that this
full-year-over-full-year expense growth rate will be faster than our year-over-year revenue growth rate for the full year
2013 compared to 2012. In terms of our tax rate, we expect that our Q3 and full year non-GAAP tax rate will be a few
percentage points higher than our Q2 rate. And, finally, we expect 2013 CapEx to be in the neighborhood of $1.6
billion. This is down from our prior estimate of $1.8 billion due to a combination of efficiency gains and changes in
timing of purchases.
Overall, Q2 was a very strong quarter for us. We believe we're executing well, in particular with regard to the mobile
transition. The investments we've been making over the past year are paying off, the business is growing rapidly, and
we're excited about the opportunities ahead of us.
Now, let's open the call for questions.

We will now open the line for a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the
line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the
ad revenue growth here in the quarter. And it was very helpful to get the four segments broken down, but can you just
help us understand a little more on the – Sheryl, your comment on the increased number and then the type of ads in the
News Feed in 2Q? And trying to understand if this is more specific product driven or if this is just the combination of
all the efforts that have been going into News Feed ads essentially over the last year. Thanks.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: So, over the past year on these calls, we've been talking about our three priorities in
growing our ads business: mobile, measurement, and product innovation. I think what you're seeing here is all three of
these are paying off. Obviously, the transition to mobile was a really big one. We had almost no mobile ads a year ago;
we're up to 41% this quarter. We've done a lot on measurements and product innovation. News Feed ads has been the
most important thing we've done there and we've done other things as well. In terms of the marketer segment, all four
marketer segments are growing and contributing to our growth. So we're seeing both the increased supply that we
talked about with News Feed ads, but also the increase in demand that all four of these marketer segments represent.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: And just as a follow-up, can you help us understand how impactful or how big mobile app
install ads are within the mix?
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: Yeah. We don't break out by segment – the four market segments but, again, all four are
growing. Mobile app install ads we think are – they are small, but they are important, and they are growing rapidly. It's
basically a totally new market. People who are selling either mobile apps as their revenue or things that are bought
through mobile apps are looking for a way to find new customers and we represent one of the only ways and a very
effective way to do that. So we're growing quickly and I think we're helping to grow this market.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you very much and congratulations. I was wondering – you've talked about
before improved targeting and relevance of News Feed ads that lies ahead. I was just wondering if you could share with
us the progress you think you've made on this initiative and what's to come.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: Targeting is really important because what takes an ad and makes it a good ad is whether
it's relevant to you. When I see something on Facebook or anywhere that I am interested in that's a great experience.
When I see something that I'm not interested in that's not. And so we've done a lot of work around targeting. The most
important work we've done over the past year, and I think you're seeing its results in this, is around Custom Audiences
which enables people to use their data in a privacy protected way with us. It enables them to show different ads to
people who are current customers versus new customers who are interested in different things. And I think we're really
pleased with the adoption. The number of marketers using Custom Audiences more than doubled in Q2, and we're now
up to 50 of the Ad Age 100 who have already started using the product. We also think there's room to improve. We can
do more, and we will continue to do more to improve the targeting and relevance of our ads.

<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Great, thanks. Two questions, please. Could you talk about thoughts on monetization of
Instagram and maybe just potentially how you think about the ability to monetize that versus your core Facebook asset?
And then secondly, Sheryl, could you talk about on a vertical basis where you think the biggest white space
opportunities are for advertising revenue for Facebook? Are there particular industries that you look at that, say, are
materially underrepresented on Facebook that where you could have the greatest growth going forward? Thanks a lot.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Sure. I'll answer the Instagram question. Kevin has always been clear that we're
building Instagram to be a business and that we expect that over time we're going to generate a lot of profit from it and
probably through advertising. Now that all said, right now it's just growing so quickly; the number that we just said was
130 million monthly actives. The video product is growing really quickly. There are so many directions to expand this
in that we think that the right focus for now is to continue just focusing on increasing the footprint of Instagram, and
when the right time comes, then we'll think about doing advertising as well. And I think that's going to be a really big
opportunity.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: In terms of growth opportunities, I think in terms of vertical categories, we have big
growth opportunities across the board. There are certainly verticals where we're stronger than others. We're very strong,
for example, in CPG. But even though we've grown spend significantly, we're still a tiny portion of the spend of CPG
advertisers. So even in the verticals where I think we've done very well, starting to penetrate, there's a lot of room for
growth. I think, as you think about different industries using the power of online marketing, we see different levels of
adoption but I'm a believer that over time this is where people are spending their time and any marketer who's trying to
reach people is going to spend their resources here as well.

The next question comes from the line of Jordan Rohan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.
<Q - Jordan E. Rohan>: Thanks so much. I think it's fairly easy when talking to advertisers to assess that there's been
this latent demand for advertising on Facebook. But, when you look across the globe, it's a little bit harder to address
the advertising community. Can you talk about the growth of the ad sales force and the ad ops and all the people
required to really bring that outside of the major U.S. and Western European markets? And specifically, is there a
chance that you believe that Asia Pacific and rest of world markets can see a meaningful, continued and sustainable
shift higher in ARPU than where we are today? Thank you.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: Yes, I'm a big believer that their revenue opportunities exist all over the world. And our
growth was very strong across regions including outside of the U.S. for this time. We're up to over 40 offices, so we
have sales teams on the ground in over 40 offices, and we're seeing really good adoption and really good growth across.
You mentioned Asia; I was actually in Japan and Korea, meeting with advertisers just a few weeks ago, and we are
seeing companies that really weren't doing much with us a year ago increasingly adopt us as part of a core part of their
spend. So I remain very optimistic about our growth across Asia and the rest of the world.

The next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
<Q - Youssef H. Squali>: Thank you very much. Two questions, please. Maybe – can you talk about the mix of
growth in direct selling versus programmatic selling for you guys and where do you see that going forward? And, in
terms of just on the cost side, looking at the investment – and by the way, David, thanks for the color about operating
expenses guidance for the second half. But, as you look at longer term, how far can you see that 50% increase in
operating expenses still being sustained as you – just looking at 2014? I know you're not guiding to 2014 right now, but
just as we look at the model going forward, how far do you think you can sustain growth in operating expenses faster
than growth in revenues? Thank you.

<A - David A. Ebersman>: Yeah, thanks for your questions. Your first question about direct selling versus
programmatic, the mechanism that most people buy ads from Facebook is through the option that we offer but that
doesn't mean that we're not – we don't have a sales force that's out calling on clients. So, Sheryl can expand on that if
she wants.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: Yeah. We sell both directly through our own sales teams both in person and online. And
what I think you mean by programmatic which is through third parties such as....
<Q - Youssef H. Squali>: Right.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: ...DSPs and others. One thing worth noting is that FBX, which is part of the programmatic
selling, is actually a very small part of our business and I think sometimes people don't understand that. So that piece is
quite small. We are expanding both our direct selling efforts, both the sales team and online, as well as the third parties
we work with and we think having a healthy and growing ecosystem on both sides is really good for the development
of our business.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: And you asked about investments looking forward to next year. I think philosophically the
easiest way to answer that which is we still think we're early in the journey of building the service that we want
Facebook to be and there's lots of work ahead of us to do and lots of things to build. And our plan will continue to be to
invest aggressively in the areas that we think are important to improve our strategic positioning and to drive our ability
to grow revenues and profits over the long run. We also know that to be the great company that we want to be we have
to be disciplined in everything that we do and focus our spend on the areas that are really most important. So the
challenge for us, just like any company, is finding that right balance. I really can't comment on 2014 yet honestly, just
because we haven't – I don't know what 2014 is going to look like. We tend to plan in six-month blocks and I think
have our act together pretty well for what we're going to try to do in the second half of this year but haven't begun the
conversation about next year yet.

The next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks a lot. I have one for Sheryl and one for David. Sheryl, I'd be interested in hearing
a little bit about the relative progress of impression-based selling versus performance-based. And you mentioned the
e-commerce – the doubling from e-commerce from direct response, and I just wanted to know if you've increased the
amount of inventory that you're selling on an impression basis versus performance. And then, David, I had a follow-up
on the CapEx. It just seems like an interesting time for CapEx to be coming in when video usage and video uploads
could be growing....
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: Okay. I think we may have lost the question, but I'll take the first half while we wait for
the second piece to come back. On the first piece, our system works that you can buy by CPM or CPC, and we let
advertisers choose. I think both parts of our business are healthy and growing. I think, when people talk about
impression-based purchasing or buying, what they're really trying to get at is brand. And brand is a very important one
of our four segments and one that's growing. When you think about what brand spenders are doing, they're trying to get
discovery and I think we've made a lot of progress there. We now work with every one of the Global Ad Age 100 over
the past year. Now that said, people are in different parts of that spectrum. We have brand advertisers who are looking
for discovery, who have advertised with us for a long time, proven the value and are really expanding. And we have
others that are newer that are experimenting that aren't as convinced yet. And it's our job to get there and convince
them.
I think what people are increasingly seeing is we have a big brand opportunity. We have a massive and engaged
audience, 88 million to 100 million people in the U.S. during primetime hours on Facebook. We offer discovery, and
we have a unique opportunity to take people all the way through the funnel. In one example, a recent one that I really
liked, T-Mobile did an ad campaign with us to get – attract people to sell new phones. They put out – they used our

offer adds to do it. 9% of the people who claimed the offer converted to T-Mobile within 10 days and they had over a
20x return on their ad spend, which is just incredibly strong in the industry. And I think that shows the power of what
we can do with impressions, taking people all the way through the funnel.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: And, Anthony, I'll try and answer your question about CapEx as best I could. You got cut
off as you probably know so I only got about – well, I don't know how much of it I got but I got enough to give it a
shot. And really the best way I can think to answer it is to describe for you the variables that influence what CapEx
requirements are for the company. So, clearly, the number of users is near the top of the list, and also the time at which
the users use the service. So adding users who are off-peak, the Facebook peak, provides less of a burden for our
infrastructure than people who are using it at the same time as our peak hours because we can leverage what we've built
to peak.
A second thing is definitely the level of engagement of those users and that seemed to be where you were going with
your question about video. That is and will continue to be, we hope, something that drives up requirements for our
infrastructure because it means people are really engaging and finding new ways to use the service. What has helped us
I think is the two variables that come next. One is just the cost of the equipment itself and the data centers, and over
time Moore's Law and other things and competition in the market have helped us to really be able to bring down the
cost for each unit of equipment we use. And then the next variable, which I mentioned in my remarks, which I think is
a really important one is just the efficiency of what we build. So over time I think Facebook has impressively
succeeded at making the hardware we use more efficient and the software that we run on it more efficient in terms of
how much compute power that it needs.
The last variable, of course probably the hardest to predict, is product development. It's just what we build and how that
influences what the compute requirements are. So, clearly, the variable you emphasized, which was engaging with
higher content things, is one of the things that will influence the CapEx over time but it's a pretty complicated equation.
But I think right now we're managing well. I think we're pleased with how 2013 is coming together in that regard.

The next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thank you. As we look back at this mobile ramp back in 3Q last year, it's been pretty lumpy and it
bounces around quarter-over-quarter, but it looks like a pretty big inflection this quarter. Can you help us understand
why it has been so lumpy so we can think about going forward and maybe what caused the inflection this quarter? And
then really appreciated the time spent metric. I think you said 20 billion hours – minutes per day, but could you tell us
how that compares to, say, a quarter ago or a year ago? Thank you.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: So, in terms of the progression of mobile, we're really pleased overall that News Feed ads
in general and on mobile in particular are working so well in terms of the performance they're providing to marketers
and how users are engaging with them. For a new product like this, I don't think we should be that surprised that the
quarter-to-quarter progression is going to be harder to predict than it would be for a more mature product. I think one of
the things that happened in the second quarter is that, as the investments we've made started to really come together, we
had a lot more demand in our system that met the quality bar that we set for feed. So we're able to place that demand
intelligently in a manner where it performed well and didn't have a meaningful impact on the user experience. So I
think that more feed-eligible demand was a big part of the story.
And I think one of the really good pieces of news for us is how well the price held up as we did that, as we increased
the number of ads we showed in feed. So for many of our ads, as you know, marketers are bidding for clicks in an
auction, and the auction determines the price where supply equals demand, the cost-per-click price. And in the second
quarter – and this statistic I'm going to give you is relative to the first quarter of this year because it's hard to do a
year-over-year for mobile and for News Feed because it just didn't really exist a year ago. So, Q2 relative to Q1, the
number of clicks in our system went up a lot, and we might have assumed that price would decline as click number
increased because we're basically pushing out the supply curve and changing the point where supply would meet

demand. And that's not what happened. Cost-per-clicks for feed ads increased and really demonstrating to us that
demand was growing rapidly as well, as we were increasing the supply of ads we were showing. So it's not a perfect
comparison because Q2 is seasonally stronger than Q1, but it's – I don't think the seasonality explains the trend I just
provided and I think that's a really encouraging metric for us.
And your second question was – I wrote it down, hold on. Time spent. Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of
longitudinal data for time spent. It's not something that we had instrumented well going back more deeply in time
because it's hard – well, it's hard on every interface and it's particularly hard on mobile. We feel pretty good about
where we are now in terms of the quality of the instrumentation. It is up on a per-user basis. As you would imagine, it's
not – it's gone – quarter-over-quarter sequentially, on a per-user basis it'll be growing slowly. On an aggregate basis, of
course, it's benefited from the fact that we have such a nice and consistent increase in the number of daily users of the
service.

The next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Great. Thanks, guys. David, just a continuation of what you were just talking about. So on the
mobile News Feed ads, is the 5% number – your 5% of stories being ads the right number and is that consistent across
geos? And then is the growth a function of – you just said price is going up sequentially. Obviously, your mobile DAUs
are going up – or MAUs are going up sequentially. And you're probably also seeing improving click-through rates. So,
of those three variables – users, click-through rate, and price – which is driving the sequential increase the most in
mobile? Thanks.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: So in terms of the 5% number, again, we – what we know is where we are now, and we're
pleased that things are going as well as they are at the current level. So the number was zero a year ago. It's increased
steadily over the past year, and the 5% number is an average number globally. It does differ by geography, and it also
differs by person. It will be higher for people for whom we have a lot more ads that are targeted towards them and are
relevant for them. And what we're trying to do is find the right balance ideally for each user where we're balancing their
experience with Facebook and the performance of the ads and continually tweaking the product, learning from our
experience to try and do that as well as we can.
Going forward, I think, as we've, I think, been consistent in saying the biggest opportunity for us is to improve the
quality of the ads so that we can show ads that are engaging and relevant for the users involved. Your question about
what drove the increase. I think everything contributed. I mean, I think that's one of the things that's encouraging about
where we are as we do have more users. We have more demand that enabled us to show more News Feed ads. We're
really pleased with how click-through rates have held up, and I mentioned what was happening in terms of cost per
click increasing sequentially. So it's a nice balanced contribution from the variables that determine what our revenue
performance is.

before deploying a major video ad product on the core site. As you're out talking to potential clients, can you help us
understand what demand looks like for that product? And then maybe separately just a sense for what you're seeing in
Europe from a macro perspective just given some of the mixed views we've heard on the economy over there. Thanks
so much.

The next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your line is open.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: Congratulations on a really outstanding quarter. Mark, I want to ask about the platform strategy
and just broadly, how is the strategic vision to allow third-parties to provide services to the network evolved over the
past year? And what needs to happen to have more of a contribution from non-advertising-based businesses? And then,
David, just quickly for modeling, the mobile ad revenue, can you talk about how that progressed through the quarter?
Did it exit June much stronger than it was earlier in the quarter? Thanks.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Yeah, I mean, I can take the platform question. The strategy for that has – we've
shifted a bit to focus on building more business tools for developers and a lot of what we're seeing is folks have shifted
towards using products like mobile app installs. And originally we were – we had a little bit of skepticism about how
happy developers would be with a system where they would pay to get more distribution. But what we've actually
found is that the NPS is really high for this because it's just a lot more stable than anything else that they've had in the
past and it's the most stable way that they have to grow their app.
So what we're basically focused on doing now is we think about advertisers in terms of these use cases that folks have.
I mean there's local businesses, there are great brands, there are developers who are building apps, there's e-commerce
and we're really focused on building up the platform to be one of those big verticals to be a big part of the business.
There's also the games part of the platform, which is kind of the first piece of platform that we launched, and that is just
continuing to grow at a slower but steady rate.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: Your second question was about progress through the quarter. Nothing notable to report
there. It was really a strong quarter from the beginning to the end.

Next we have a question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Thanks. I had a bigger picture question for Mark. I was hoping you could give sort of a
scorecard when you're in relative to your founder letter. I know it's been only 14 months and that's a short period of
time, but it would be interesting to hear your views on the company's performance against the longer-term aspirations
and core values that you put in the letter. Thanks.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Yeah. I think we're early, and one of the interesting things over the past six months or
so is reaching a billion people was this big rallying cry for the company for a long period of time. And I think as we've
passed that we've seen the ambition that the company has grown, and reaching a billion users was a great first thing to
focus on because no one had ever built a service that had a billion active people who were signed in and had a real
identity before. But in a way it's actually kind of just an abstract. There's nothing magical about a billion. The real goal
is to connect everyone in the world and help people map out everything that there is and I think what we're seeing is as
some of the product succeeds is just the ambition increased to be able to do more of these and taking on more longer
term things.
At the same time I think what you have is we weren't happy with the quality of our mobile experiences, rewinding 18
months. So we had just a lot of foundational work to do and I think coming into this year we kind of could tell
internally that we were turning a corner on that. We were in good shape and could start to play a bit more offense but as
I think the numbers from this quarter suggest I think we're really starting to see the upside of some of the investments

The next question comes from Mark May with Citigroup. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark A. May>: Thanks for taking my question. I had two. One of the things that stood out in your prepared
remarks is I think you mentioned 40% year-on-year increase in average price per ad in North America in Q2. I was
hoping you could remind us how that compared to, say, Q1 and given that I think you contributed that to
higher-performing ads, if maybe you could call out specifically what one or two either ad units or ad targeting
enhancements were the kind of key contributors to that growth? And then secondly, David, I think you called out the
more challenging comps as you enter into the second half of the year. Are you suggesting that it's kind of unreasonable
for us to look at the sequential growth that you saw in the second half of 2012 and assume that that sort of rate of
growth is repeatable this year?
<A - David A. Ebersman>: Okay. In terms of pricing, I think we are pleased with the pricing growth in the first
quarter too. The net across the world was a 3% average in the first quarter but that was much higher in the U.S. and
Canada because again for the same reason it wasn't impacted by the price floor change, so it was about 25% in the U.S.
and Canada and was even stronger in the second quarter. And similarly in other territories I think pricing's just going
really well and would be stronger than the results show if not for the impact of the price floor, we'd probably have
numbers that are similar to the U.S. and Canada, if not stronger in our other regions as well.
In terms of the comps, I don't think there's anything particularly complicated to what I was saying. It's just if you're
looking at the percentage growth rates for Q2, you're comparing to a quarter last year that really didn't have much
mobile revenue or News Feed revenue in it at all, and that really started to ramp up in the third quarter and the fourth
quarter. So it's there in one side of the comparison going forward.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: In terms of the – where the growth is coming from in terms of ad units, in terms of our
market segments, direct response marketers were a very big contributor to the growth. That's why I started with them in
the remarks and in the Q&A. E-commerce doubled year-over-year and they're doing that by using a bunch of our
different ad products, everything from posts to offers to other things, but it's really about looking for those
contributions. We've also seen a lot of growth as I said in mobile app install ads, small-market but growing rapidly and
it's a market where we offer a product that there's almost nowhere else to get the kind of returns and opportunity we
offer.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: I'm just going to add one more thing just in case I, in any way, created any confusion. I
have no evidence that I did yet. But the price per ad that I was talking about in this question is reflects not the same
thing as the cost per click that I answered in a question earlier, because price per ad will also incorporate the
click-through rate as well as the cost per click for a click-based ad and also includes ads that are purchased on an
impression basis. So most of the pricing metrics we provide are per ad inclusive of click-through rates and
impression-based ads. The CPC metric I gave earlier was just I think a specific and useful metric in understanding how
much strong demand contributed in the second quarter.

<Q - Ken Sena>: Hi. So, just maybe if we could drill into the comment around e-commerce spending doubling and it
seems as though FBX and third-party effort, it's growing fast but it's small and same with the app install effort. But can
you talk a little bit about what drove that doubling year-on-year? Thanks.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: I think direct response marketers have had more opportunities to use our system, use our
product and we've also made a very major investment in helping them measure returns and helping them connect what's

happening both online and as well as throughout the system. So direct response marketers tend to be buyers where –
when they have an ROI metric. They're looking for that ROI metric and their budgets are flexible around those ROIs.
So as they've invested with us and hit their ROI metrics, their budgets go up and they make those adjustments very
quickly. That's why when they start using the products and see the value they create, they're able to grow very quickly,
even within a quarter or within a week or within a month, because they adjust to their budgets.

The next question comes from Rory Maher with Hillside Partners. Your line is open.
<Q - Rory F. Maher>: Thanks. A couple quick questions. First on hiring, there's been a lot of discussion in the press
about tech companies' need for more highly skilled workers, and I'm curious if you're feeling pressure to find that kind
of highly skilled talent and what areas you find hardest to fill, and maybe some successful ways that you're finding
good engineering talent. And then secondly, on the advertiser mix, have you guys discussed your mix of brand
advertisers by category like auto, retail, telecom, that kind of category mix? And are there any that have grown
particularly well the past year?
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Yeah, I can take this. Hiring great people, especially engineers, is one of the biggest
challenges that any technology company has. We're doing really well against the hiring goals that we have, but – I
mean, there's a systemic issue where our country doesn't produce the volume of engineers that the companies would
want to hire, and I think that that's a lot of what you hear these companies talking about. We're doing really well
competitively right now. We have a really strong program on colleges where we can continue to attract a lot of the best
people who are graduating. We do really well at hiring senior engineers through – from across the Valley as well, but
it's just something that we invest a huge amount of time in. It's really important.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: In terms of where we're growing by category, I've mentioned CPG, gaming, retail. These
are vertical categories where we're very strong. But again, we're growing. We're growing. You're watching people
really experiment. One of the things that's been really fun to see, even though it's not a paid product, is GE's Instagram
work. GE is doing super-interesting photos on Instagram which show us that they're – other industries are also going to
adapt to the social environment and to some of the new ways to reach customers globally.

The next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Laura A. Martin>: Hi there. Great numbers, you guys. Congratulations. Two questions. One on, could you guys
quantify the custom advertising bucket? I know you said it was up 100% year-over-year and – or quarter-over-quarter,
and a lot of the brands are talking about this as a key growth area, so I'm real interested in how big it's starting for you
guys. And then my second question is, we're also talking to a lot of companies that target your metrics using your [ph]
UTI (55:47) integrations, and I'm – would that – creates an arbitrage? I'm wondering if, over time, you foresee that
being a stable ecosystem, or are you guys going to try to ease those guys out over time and grab some of that upside
that these arbitrageurs that are using your platform are garnering today. Thanks.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: On the first, Custom Audiences is small but growing in importance. We doubled – what I
said is, we doubled the number of marketers using the product Q2 over Q1, and that also has included getting us to 50
of the Ad Age 100. As I've talked about, the large brand advertisers, the Ad Age 100 have a long sales cycle, and it
takes a lot of work to get them to adopt products. And so, seeing adoption this quickly of something, we think shows
how powerful that targeting is.
In terms of some of the more programmatic ways people buy, we think it's really healthy for us to have multiple sales
channels. We like having a direct sales channel which we have in our 40 – over 40 offices. We like having online and
robust sales because that means that even in countries where we don't have offices, we have the ability to sell into those

markets. We also like having an ecosystem of what we call PMDs and third-party sellers who can work with our clients
to provide some of the kind of features that we don't have, or some of the kind of capabilities that they may not have
in-house. And so, for us, we'd like to see all of those sales channels continue to grow and thrive.
<A - Deborah Crawford>: Operator, I think we have time for one last question.

The next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks, guys. Congratulations on the numbers. Mark, a longer-term question focused on your
initial comments. How have some of the recent products that are consumer-facing that you guys have launched like
Graph Search and Facebook Home sort of taught you what the consumer acceptance is for certain things, learnings
about how the platform can be developed and evolved over time? I would love to get your takeaways on that.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Yeah. Well, I mean, I think that there are a bunch of different kinds of products that
you can ship. Every day we ship a lot of tweaks to the products, the small changes to existing products. Then there are
going to be products like Instagram Video, which is really doing well. And it fits very naturally into the current flow of
how people use Instagram to capture moments that they're proud of from. So that makes sense. I think the team did a
really good job there.
Things like Home and Graph Search are really new use cases. In the case of Home, it's a new category of products
that's different from anything that exists out there. And I think of it more as a seed that we're planting that's going to
create a completely new pillar of the ecosystem rather than drafting off of a behavior that people already have in the
system today. So I definitely think that we just have to look at this over the long-term. And if you're – when we're
building models for the company, I mean, we basically think that this is going to be something that we will invest in for
years, and we expect these to become market-leading products. And they're doing things that no one else really has the
strategic position or content to be able to build these products. So we're excited about them. They're just going to be
longer-term bets. But I think you want to look at the different things that we're doing in terms of how naturally they fit
into the flow of a person's day-to-day life today to get a sense of how quickly it's going to ramp-up over time.
