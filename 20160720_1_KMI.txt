Now, I'll turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may
begin.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. Thank you, Laura, and welcome to our call. As always, before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's
earnings release and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures.
We encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures

Let me begin by just making very few introductory comments, before turning the call over to our CEO, Steve Kean;
and our CFO, Kim Dang. First of all, the operating results for both the second quarter and year-to-date are very
consistent with Kim's guidance, which she shared with you on our Q1 call, and which were in our Q1 earnings release.
And I think this demonstrates once more that our assets are consistent generators of strong cash flow, even in these
times of volatility.
Several specific events have happened since our last call, mostly positive. First of all, the National Energy Board of
Canada recommended approval of our Trans Mountain expansion project. This is an important step, but we still need an
Order in Council, and that decision is expected in December of this year.
We also entered into joint ventures, as you know, with Southern Company on our SNG natural gas system, and with
Riverstone on our Utopia pipeline project. And have also divested an additional approximately $175 million of
non-core assets. These steps allow us to significantly improve our balance sheet with the expectation of now ending
this year, 2016, at about 5.3 times debt-to-EBITDA, which is an improvement from the 5.5 times budgeted.
In addition, we're also reducing our future need for expansion CapEx, and all of this is getting us measurably closer to
being able to return significant additional cash to our shareholders through either increasing the dividend or buying
back shares. I can assure you we will continue on this flight path, as we work to maintain and strengthen our balance
sheet, while, at the same time, preparing to deliver increased value to our shareholders.
Now, with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven J. Kean
All right. Thanks. I'm going to update on capital and counter-party credit and then hit on some additional segment
highlights and trends that we're seeing. On the capital update, we've been talking for several quarters now about high
grading the backlog and how we do that. That consists of making sure that we are attending to our balance sheet, but
also ensuring that we grow our DCF per share through the investments that we're making at attractive returns and that
we are now funding out of the excess cash flow that we generate without needing to access the capital market.
The high grading includes select joint ventures on assets and projects. The Utopia JV shows that we can originate
high-value midstream projects that are valued by investors. On SNG, we are entering a JV with our largest customer in
a transaction, which brings value to that asset through specifically identified opportunities and is accretive in the
medium-term.
We have trimmed some projects from the backlog, where they don't make sense from a return standpoint or in today's
commodity price environment. And we've also made scope and cost savings improvements and, in some cases, deferred
costs on projects that we are proceeding with.
One example of this improvement is in the Gas Group in this quarter. And part of the reduction in the backlog is due to
this. We renegotiated a contract with a customer, and the result of that renegotiation was a reduction in our capital
spend for that project, a boosted return, acceleration of the in-service data of a portion of the revenues, and we freed up
some capacity that we believe we can resell. Meanwhile, the customer got the benefit of a lower cost, longer term
solution for its needs. We're going to continue to work on additional opportunities within our backlog and in addition to
our current projects. The results of these efforts is a backlog, which now has an EBITDA multiple of 6.5 times CapEx.
That's excluding CO2 projects, which tend to have a higher return, but are more commodity price sensitive.
We now expect to spend discretionary capital of $2.8 billion in 2016, which is down from $2.9 billion last quarter that
we estimated for the year and down $500 million from our plan for the year. Our backlog is now $13.5 billion, down
from $14.1 billion. And that's a function of projects going into service, the Utopia JV, the project renegotiation that I
mentioned, and netted against some project position. So in short, we're making good progress, we're doing what we told
you we would do, and that progress is on the balance sheet as well as positioning us to grow our DCF per share.

On customer credit, we continue our extreme focus throughout our commercial and corporate organizations. In the past
quarter, credit defaults amounted to about 0.3% of budgeted revenue annualized, and most of that is associated with the
Peabody bankruptcy that took place in the first two weeks of the quarter. Without that, we would be well under 0.1%.
And again, putting our situation in perspective, we're a broadly diversified midstream company. We've got a strong and
diversified customer base, which includes integrated energy majors, utilities and end users. So the credit picture is
stabilizing.
Now, for some of the segment highlights and trends overall, and I compare to a year-over-year basis here. Segment
earnings, before DD&A and certain items, was down $31 million, or 2%, from Q2 of 2015 to Q2 of 2016, so $31
million down. CO2, by itself, is down $59 million, due to lower prices primarily and lower production, even though
CO2 is making plan due to some price improvements and good performance on the cost savings front. Compared to the
same quarter last year, Gas is down 1%, while Terminals and Products are up 4% and 8% respectively.
Some broad themes on our year-to-year performance. We continue – number one, we continue to see strong demand for
natural gas across our network. Transport volumes were up 5% year-over-year. We're getting good terms on storage,
transportation, and sales renewals in our business. Power burn on our pipes is up 8% year-over-year. And recall that
power burn was up 16% from Q2 of 2014 to 2015. So there's strong compounding growth coming from the power
sector.
For the first time ever, gas is making up a larger share of the fuel for power generation than coal. That's been true
year-to-date for 2016. It's very close in 2015. In the last most recent quarter, Q2 of 2016, 35% of generation came from
gas versus 27% from coal. Gas exports are up on our system too. Exports to Mexico have grown to 3.3 Bcf a day and
three-quarters of that volume moves on Kinder Morgan's pipes. We continue to believe and we're seeing that the need
for natural gas transportation and storage services growing as the demand in the power sector – power generation sector
and industrial sectors continues to grow, along with export demands from Mexico and LNG.
The Products Pipelines were getting the benefit year-over-year of higher volumes on KMCC and Cochin, and the
start-up of the second splitter unit in the Houston Ship Channel.
In Terminals, we are seeing the benefit of new liquids capacity coming online. Remember, liquids makes up a little
better than three-quarters of our segment earnings, before DD&A, in this business. And we're also seeing increased
utilization on that expanded capacity, so more capacity online and higher overall utilization of that capacity. The
second quarter was a record-setting quarter for throughput on our liquids terminals.
On the bulk side, while coal volumes are down year over year, other bulk volumes are partially offsetting that decline,
particularly in petcoke and metals. We also renewed our steel handling arrangement with Nucor for ten years with
some value enhancements in that new deal. Overall, in the bulk part of the business, the entire year-over-year change
can be explained by the coal bankruptcy.
The negatives affecting the business on a year-over-year basis are, of course, lower commodity prices, which affect us
directly in the enhanced oil recovery part of CO2 and, indirectly, in our gathered volumes of gas in Crude and
Condensate. But even with oil prices and gas prices that are lower year-over-year by 18% and 26% respectively, we're
showing durable performance from our portfolio.
Lastly, an update on our Trans Mountain expansion. This continues to be a two steps forward, one step back
development. I'll start with the fundamentals. What we consistently hear from our producer customers in Canada is that
they're counting on this project to get built. Putting the recent fires aside in Alberta, production continues to grow, and
takeaway capacity projects continue to be behind the demand. Oil prices have hurt Alberta for sure. But from the
perspective of our expansion, the supply and demand fundamentals for takeaway capacity are good.
We're in the midst of the federal review process, as Rich mentioned. We have our NEB recommendation, binding the
project to be in the public interest. And the federal government's undertaking its further consultation process with the
objective of final decision in December this year. We've made great progress with communities along the route, have
agreements of support from a majority of the most directly affected First Nations there. We are actively engaged with
the B.C. government on the satisfaction of their five conditions and we are making very good progress there. We're

going to be actively working with contractors over the summer on the always-challenging work on cost and final scope
for the project.
Finally, before turning over to Kim for the financials, I'm going to point out, as you probably noticed, the release is in a
slightly different format than usual. What we're doing is showing GAAP measures with equal or greater prominence
per the recent SEC guidance to public companies. As always, we'll continue show you all the numbers, including the
non-GAAP measures that we use in our management of the business, but this is the format we'll show going forward.
With that, I'll turn it over to Kim.
Kimberly Allen Dang
Okay. Thanks, Steve. Let me start by reiterating three overall financial points that Rich mentioned to you that we
believe you should take away from this call. Number one, as Rich said, our full year guidance has not changed from the
updated guidance we gave you last quarter. We continue to expect that EBITDA will be about 3% below budget and
DCF will be approximately 4% below budget.
To be consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter, this guidance does not include the impact of the SNG JV,
which we anticipate will close in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter. Secondly, we expect to end the year at
5.3 times debt-to-EBITDA, which was down from our budget guidance and the guidance we gave you last quarter,
largely as a result of our balance sheet improvement effort. When you annualize the EBITDA impact from the SNG
transaction, we expect that the full year impact would be slightly higher than the 5.3 times. And third, our
debt-to-EBITDA target is still around five times. And once we've reached that level, we will decide how to return value
to shareholders, and we're not committing to a specific method at this time.
On our dividend, today, we declared a dividend of $0.125 per share, consistent with our budget and the guidance we
gave you in December of last year. Looking at our GAAP income statement, you will see that revenues are down
significantly. As I say, many quarters, we do not believe that revenue or the changes in revenues are necessarily good
predictors of our performance. We have some businesses where revenues and expense fluctuate with commodity prices,
but margin generally does not, which is why you also see a large change in cost of sales during the quarter.
In addition, our GAAP numbers can be impacted by non-cash, non-recurring accounting entries or, what we call,
certain items. So if you turn to the second page of numbers, which shows our DCF for the quarter and year-to-date, I
believe you'll get a better picture of our performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.05 billion versus
$1.095 billion for the comparable period in 2015. Therefore, total DCF was down about $45 million or 4%. The
segments were down approximately $31 million or 2%, with a $59 million decrease in CO2 offsetting increases in
Terminals and Products. The $31 million decrease in the segments was partially offset by a $23 million decrease in
G&A and interest expense.
If you net out the $39 million increase in our preferred stock dividends, you get a DCF variance of $47 million versus
the $45 million that we show on the page. There're a bunch of other moving parts, but that gives you the main one.
DCF per share was $0.47 in the quarter versus $0.50 for the second quarter of last year or down $0.03, with about
$0.02 associated with the DCF variance that I just walked you through and about $0.01 due to the additional shares that
we issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects and maintain our balance sheet. Therefore, despite approximately
20% decline in commodity prices versus the second quarter of last year, our performance was down approximately 4%.
We believe these results demonstrate the resiliency of our cash flows generated by a large diversified platform of
primarily fee-based assets.
Certain items in the quarter were relatively small, they were income of approximately $8 million, but let me describe a
couple of them that you wouldn't have seen before, so you can make sure you know what they are. We had a contract
early termination revenue, which is $39 million of income, which was associated with a customer buying out of the
storage contract on one of our Texas Intrastate storage field. We also had $21 million in legal and environmental
reserves, and that was primarily related to settlement of our over ten-year litigation matter with the City of San Diego.

Now, let me give you a little bit more granularity on our expected performance for the full year versus our budget. We
expect Natural Gas Pipelines to come in approximately 2% below its budget, primarily as a result of the lower volumes
in our Midstream Group and a 4.5 month in-service delay on our EEC/SNG pipeline expansion, as a result of a delay in
receiving our FERC certificate.
CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget. And essentially here, what's happening is we have some price help and
cost savings that are offsetting a little bit lower oil and CO2 volumes than we budgeted.
We currently expect Terminals to end the year about 4% below its budget, primarily due to the impact of the coal
bankruptcy. We expect Products to end the year approximately 5% below its budget due to lower crude and condensate
volumes on KMCC, Double H and Double Eagle, lower rates on our SFPP pipeline, and the sale of our Parkway
Pipeline. Right now, we're projecting KMC to be essentially on budget.
On the expense side, interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining CapEx, on a combined basis, are expected to come in
positive versus budget or, said another way, generate a favorable variance primarily as a result of lower interest.
And with that, I will move to the balance sheet. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $41.3 billion in debt.
That is an increase in debt of about $97 million since the end of last year, and it's a decrease in debt versus where we
ended the first quarter of about $234 million. So, let me reconcile that for you. DCF in the quarter, as I mentioned a
moment ago, was $1.05 billion. We spent a little under $870 million on expansion CapEx and contributions to equity
investments. We distributed or paid dividends of about $279 million. We received proceeds from asset divestitures and
JVs of about $220 million, and then working capital and other items was a source of cash of about $110 million.
On year-to-date, we generated $2.28 billion in distributable cash flow. We spent about $1.88 billion on expansion
capital, on acquisitions and on contributions to equity investment, with the only significant acquisition being the
acquisition of the BP terminals in the first quarter. We paid dividends of $558 million. And we had proceeds from asset
divestitures and JVs of $220 million, and then we had working capital used of about $160 million to get you to the $97
million increase in debt year-to-date.
We ended the quarter at about 5.6 times debt-to-EBITDA, which is consistent where we ended last year, and consistent
where we ended the first quarter, and as we have mentioned a couple of times on the call, we expect to end the year at
5.3 times debt-to-EBITDA.
So with that, I'll turn it back to Rich.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. And, Laura, if you'll open the lines, we'll take any questions that may arise.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Kristina Kazarian from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now
open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Good afternoon, guys and Kim. So, I know you guys did this last week, so sorry for doing it
again, but I've been getting a lot of questions. Can you guys just help me recap the profile of assets you'd be up for
JVing? So, I know we've talked about Elba. Any thoughts on timeframe to that? And then, TMX is the largest
stand-alone project in the backlog, so would you be up for doing anything in anyway on this one?

<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. So we have not been talking about specific JVs, other than what we've put kind of in as a
placeholder, right, when we announced our plans for the year. And there are competitive reasons for doing that. We
don't want to be beholden to any one particular transaction. We've got some commercial considerations and competitive
considerations around counter-parties that we're working with there. So we're not identifying for you the whole list of
things that we would be considering.
But I think it's safe to say that we would look at and evaluate, if we could make it work just about anything on our
backlog that is separable that we think we can extract good value for and that we can get promoted on and boost our
return on. I mean, we'll have kind of the full list. Now, a lot of the things that are in our backlog are things that are
components of our existing network, our existing asset base, and so those are a lot harder.
The other thing I would point out is – and this was part of our strategy in maintaining some flexibility on what we
would work on and what we would get done. We've gotten so far – already this year, we've gotten to a point where we
brought our debt-to-EBITDA metric down to 5.3 times, which is better than where we expected to end the year. So, I
know that's not definitive answer on here's the list of things that we look at doing. That's the kind of characteristics of
things that we look at doing, and we've made great progress on it.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: No, that's helpful. On TMX, can you remind me what the next steps would be, if we get the
Order of Council (sic) [Order in Council] in December?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. So, there is another process going on, which is the B.C. Environmental Assessment – or
the Environmental Certificate (sic) [Environmental Assessment Certificate], I guess, you would call it, which we
believe will be close in time to when the federal decision comes out, maybe it lags by a month or so. That's another
requirement. And, again, we are working through the B.C. condition five process, which is a – the premier statement of
conditions that you would like to see us in order to sanction a project, right? And we are making good progress in those
negotiations.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: All right. And then, last one for me is an asset level one. Can you talk a little bit more about
the gathered volume number? Was this kind of in line with what you guys were thinking post 1Q, especially in the
Eagle Ford, and then the same thing on that increase in power demand number being up so much?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. I would say, first, on the gathered volumes, we made some good progress during this
quarter and maybe a little bit at the end of last quarter in terms of signing. And we've signed six or seven – I think six
with existing shippers and seven with new shipper of, kind of, incentive agreements to try to bring volumes to our
system above the contract minimums. So, we lost some volumes on our Eagle Ford system that we are now getting
back by entering into these arrangements. So it's probably a little bit worse than what we would have been shooting for
or hoping for, but I think we've taken the right steps during the quarter to get some volumes incented back on the
system. And so, I look for improvement from here.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Perfect. Well, thanks for taking...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Oh, and then...
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Oh, I'm sorry.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, and then, on power, we were watching to kind of see how power generation would play
out. I think I'd say, and Tom Martin's here too, a little surprise to the upside on the year-over-year improvement, when
you think about how big of a leap we had last year. Now, if you look at the year-to-date number, it's not quite as strong,
because we had that weak winter. And so, Q1 was actually down a bit. But if you look on a Q2-to-Q2 basis, after
having a very robust growth from 2014 to 2015, we saw growth, on top of that, of 8%. And I'm – here, I'm just talking
about our system, so 8% on top of that 16% that we saw before, which I think is very strong, and I think bodes well.
We had – another data point there is we had five of our six biggest days for power generation on the SNG system
happened in the last 45 days, five of our biggest – five of the six biggest.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Great. Well, thanks for all the answers two weeks in a row on calls, guys. Nice job today.

Thank you. Our next question is from Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: I just wanted to clarify, I guess, your response to Kristina's question about the JVing of
assets. So, if I'm understand the backlog correctly, if there's a project that's basically a brownfield expansion to an
existing asset, that makes it more difficult to pull off a JV but not impossible, but more likely to happen on something
that is more discrete. Is that a fair way to think about it?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: That's a good way to think about it.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. And then, if I remember your call from last week, you sort of indicated that the
SNG asset sale effect, that you took an operating asset and then entered that into a JV. That seemed more of a one-off
type of thing and not to really think about that on a go-forward basis. Does that apply to your CO2 business? Or is that
one segment that you would actually consider JVing or outright selling?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. As we said last week, I mean, in general, it's not going to make a lot of sense for us, in
general, to be selling interest in up-and-running assets. That tends to be an expensive way to raise capital. I would
characterize it as a somewhat unique opportunity in the SNG case, because what we had there is our largest customer, a
great power market in the Southeast U.S., and some specifically identified and agreed to opportunities that we can
jointly pursue in this JV that, again, somewhat unusual for such a transaction would actually make the sale of an
interesting existing asset accretive in the medium-term. So I think that's a fairly unique situation.
We had, as Kim mentioned, in some of her updates on the cash numbers, proceeds from other asset sales that we did
and, again, they are – I think we've had a few others. They're somewhat exceptional, and it's either a case where – it's
really a case where the customer on the asset or a third-party has a much higher value or placed as a higher strategic
value on the underlying asset. Parkway was an example. There were some other smaller examples during the quarter.
We sold a small transmix facility, which we were essentially just doing spot business through and really not making
much of anything on it. We had a third-party who's interested in doing more with that asset. And so, again, I think those
are exceptional cases, but where we see them, we go get them.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. If I can follow up with some financial-related questions. I guess, first of all, the
credit market has been a lot more generous on issuers lately versus a couple months ago. Has there been any thought to
pre-funding some of the upcoming maturities? And I was wondering if you can also walk us through the delta on
maintenance CapEx. It kind of seems light. Is it seasonal? Or is this part of your efforts to continue taking some costs
out of this structure?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Do you want to take the first one?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Sure. On the debt side, you're right, I mean, we could issue ten-year bonds right now at
sub-4%, so very attractive market. We do not have any need to access the capital market during 2016. We will continue
to evaluate whether it might make economic sense to pre-fund 2017. Obviously, we're going to be – or we expect, later
in the year, we'll be getting proceeds from the SNG transaction, and so you have to take that into account as well.
On the CapEx – sustaining CapEx, we're going to come in, we think, probably about within 1% of our budget on
sustaining CapEx. And so, it is just – it's really – we are running a positive variance year-to-date versus our budget, but
that's almost entirely timing.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. So, it is timing of the work. We're still planning to do the work. We are getting some cost
savings, but we also planned to get some cost savings. So it's relatively modest beyond what we budgeted for. And as

Thank you. Our next question is from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We can't hear you. Do you have us on mute? Operator, I think we may have lost the last caller.
You want to go to the next one?
Operator
Yes. Our next question is from Brandon Blossman from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon, Brandon.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Good afternoon, Rich, everybody else. I guess one real quick. I'll ask a very similar
question in a slightly different way. Steve, you've made impressive progress both on the capital high-grading side and
the JV side. It obviously takes pressure off to get anything else done in the very near term. How would you characterize
kind of discussions on either point there currently? And what's your expectations maybe over the next 12 months?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, Brandon, I think you're right. I mean, it does – it puts us in the position of being more
patient and selective as we look at any other opportunities really for the balance of the year. So, again, that's why we're
very pleased with the progress that we've made here in the first half of the year, and the fact that it does put us in a
position to be more selective about what we want to do going from here.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: That said, we're not sitting on our hands. We'll be looking at all opportunities and, again,
it's our intent to get back as quickly as we can, judiciously done, to the point where we can return more money to our
shareholders. That's our intent. We've been saying that since we made our decision on the dividend last December. And
I'm just enormously proud of the job that Steve and the whole team have done in getting us this far, and there is more to
come, and we're working on it.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: All right. Thank you for that. And then, just a couple of quick ones. Elba Express, is that
still 100% your project, or is that 50-50 now?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: No, it's 100% ours.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, it's 100% ours.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Okay. And then, on oil volumes. Is that – you said you'd – I think, Kim, you said you'd
come in slightly under budget on volumes, is that because of the CapEx reduction relative to plan, or is that
performance on the field?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: I mean, it's primarily performance on the field. I mean, Jesse is here from our CO2
Group, and he can comment a little bit more.

on the programs going forward, but we had less performance than we expected. If you look at the year-over-year, a big
part of the year-over-year impact is we had some – really what was a – I think a record-setting infill program at
SACROC that we saw the benefit of in really from Q4 of 2014 through the first half or so, Jesse, I think, of 2015.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Hi, guys. Just a follow-up on that last question. So, at this level of $220 million or so of
investment in the EOR business, what's your current view of what ongoing decline rate we should expect going forward
on oil volumes?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. Not necessarily expecting an ongoing decline rate. I mean, what we do in this business is
we are looking at deploying capital that gets us an attractive return on the incremental barrels that we are producing that
is associated with that capital spend. And so that's kind of how we look at each of our investments here. We don't aim
to necessarily, with regard to returns, keep production flat or grow it slightly. We really make those decisions on each
individual capital and investment in the development programs that we spend money on in CO2.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Okay. Thanks. And then, just as a follow-up, can you just remind me if you have all of the
approvals that you need from Shell in order to start construction on Elba in the third quarter?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We have our contract with Shell. We have a FERC 7C certificate that we received in June, June
1. And what we're waiting on to proceed there is we've got to get through the rehearing process, and rehearings were
filed, I guess, 30 days after we got our certificate. So there's a rehearing process that we're going through now that
should take 60 days from the date of that filing, and we still need that. We've got to get through that process.
<A - Jesse Arenivas>: There's some other smaller permits we're waiting on.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Some other permitting. Yeah.
<A - Jesse Arenivas>: Those are imminent.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Okay. But as far as from Shell's perspective, they're aligned with the timing with you
guys?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I don't know what you mean by aligned with the timing, but it is a requirement for this project
that we get a final FERC order and that includes not just the 7C but also the rehearing. And so...

<Q - Brian Gamble>: Good afternoon, everybody. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Steve, you talked about the
incentive agreements that you've been able to reach on the gathered volume side. Great to see those volumes coming
back to the system. Can you give any more color around, I guess, what types of agreements those are? Maybe not give
the exact rates, but maybe talk about additional opportunities on top of what you've already captured as far as the
magnitude of potential volumes that may come back in the back half of the year.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Go ahead. Yeah, you go first.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah. I mean, I think in a broad brush, we've got deficiency fees that are in play in many of
these agreements, and we're not meeting the volumes associated with that. And so, anything that we can do to entice
incremental volumes incrementally and get a fee that's downstream, we get additional value. It makes sense to work
around that deficiency fee, and I think that's sort of the general construct without getting into any more.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. I think the – we would rather get the volumes than get paid the deficiency fee, and so
we're working with our customers.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: The volume bring incremental value than just getting paid the deficiency fees. And we'll
work on that field and add incremental volume. That's what we think makes sense for both the producers and to us.
<Q - Brian Gamble>: Was that volume...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Go ahead.
<Q - Brian Gamble>: So, is that volume is moving back to your systems? Had it been going different directions? Or
have you actually been incentivizing producers to produce volumes that they may have chosen not to, based on just
picking the deficiency [indiscernible] (37:21)
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: I would say it's probably bringing volume back to our system that may have been going out
to other places.
<Q - Brian Gamble>: Okay. Great. And then on the power burn side, great to see the Southeast region contributing
such huge days to that piece of the business. Has there been any change in that recently? You mentioned five of the six
biggest days in the last 45 days. We've also seen a pretty healthy move in the gas price over that time period. Were
those five or six days particularly in July? Or was that more of a June event that maybe we're starting to see a little bit
of softness as the gas price goes up? Any color on the trend there would be great.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: It was June and July.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Early July.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. So I think split fairly evenly.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I don't think it was – it was certainly not a fully June phenomenon.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: All right. So I mean, I think – generally, I think we believe that we're going to see really
strong volumes even at the current gas prices through the third quarter. I think once we get latter part of September and
we're still pushing $3 or upper $2, there maybe some switching back. But certainly not seeing any indication of that
with the kind of weather we're seeing right now and expect to see through August.
<Q - Brian Gamble>: Great. Appreciate that, guys.

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Darren. How are you doing?
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: I'm fine. Thanks, Rich. Hope you and the rest of the team are doing well. Just two quick
ones for me. The first, with regards to your comments around enhancing shareholder value. I'm just curious – and I
recognize it's hypothetical – but I'm just curious how the impact of the conversion of the preferreds to common shares
might influence your preference on which measure of equity value enhancement you choose first. Meaning if it's a
share repurchase to manage some of that incremental dilution, or maybe it's a bit more of a balanced approach.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, I think, as we've said, and Kim's been very clear on, when we get down to around
five times, which is our target, then I think we'll look at what is the most opportune, expedient way of returning value
to our shareholders. And we're not trying to judge in advance. We won't do it just to avoid the potential dilution or the
conversion of the pref. We'll look at it as to whether it makes sense to buy back shares or increase the dividend.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Again, I would emphasize, we're running at a $2 DCF rate, and we're pleased that the stock
has rallied here post the announcement on SNG to the $22 range, but that's still about a 9% yield on DCF. So we look
at that and are still amazed that it's that high.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay. I appreciate the color. Steve, one quick one for you just with regard to the
Northeast, the expectation their possibly regarding TGP working with customers, possibly expanding that system
beyond what's stated and scaling it up. With the developments that have transpired since the close of Q1, has anything
changed there?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: No, we continue to talk to customers, but there's nothing definitive there, Darren. I mean, we
are – the need for gas in the Northeast is real. It's present, and we still think that there are capacity needs. And we'll talk
to our customers and continue to work with them on finding something that makes sense, not at the same scale as NED,
but perhaps something else.
In the meantime, we're expanding TGP like mad. I mean, we are bringing gas down from the Marcellus and Utica down
to the new market area, if you will, of the South, the Gulf Coast, where LNG exports ultimately going to Mexico as
well and serving demand down here in Texas, as well as power plant laterals, a couple of other projects. So we're
actively investing in TGP, but no update really on Northeast utility customer contracts.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Good afternoon. Thanks. Just wanted to talk about Canada first, and given that British
Columbia isn't necessarily known to be the easiest place to do business, I'm just wondering if you had any reaction to –
a bit more thoughts on the reaction as far as what they've said there recently with the TMX expansion? And does this
enhance your ability to potentially kind of find JV partners here, because it seems like this could be an ideal project to
bring in a partner for?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. So first, on B.C., as I said, I think Ian and the team have been making very good progress
there. And I assume you're referring to the Energy Minister, Bennett's comments here recently – that recently reported
in Bloomberg. We think that the environment overall, I would say, is improving, and we are making progress in getting
matters worked out with B.C. But we're not there yet, still working on it.
I think that – again, hypothetically, from a JV perspective, I mean, the more of these kinds of things that we're able to
resolve and get behind us, the more value there is to a potential investor, but again, we've got nothing active going on

on the project. It's 100% ours right now, but I think whether it's 100% ours or ultimately whether there is a partner,
getting these things taken care of from a regulatory and political standpoint is very helpful.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then just, as far as the 5.3 times leverage that you guys are
targeting for year-end right now, does that – how much incremental asset sales or JVs does that bake in at this point?

Thank you. Our next question is from Ted Durbin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Ted. How are you doing?
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Hey. Doing well. Thanks. So, coming back to the 6.5 times capital to EBITDA multiple that
you've put in the press release, which is now down from the 7.5 times you spoke about at the Analyst Day, can you just
walk us through the details of how you got from 7.5 times to 6.5 times? I'm assuming it's taking net out of backlog, but
what are the other ways that you're bringing that multiple down on invested capital?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. It's really kind of all of the items that I listed out there. We've had some contracts
restructured, we've had some projects, NED being the largest one – largest single one – that had below-average returns
compared to the overall backlogs that have come out. We've also looked for ways to make on all of our projects, if
there are scope improvements that we can make, cost reductions that we can take on, occasionally pushing capital out
to closer in time when the project's coming in service, all of those things helped improve the returns and the multiple on
the existing project base.
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Okay. And now with the new project base, can you just remind us how much of these
projects actually have take-or-pay type components or how much of them depend on volumes that maybe were outside
of your control, again, in Terminals or other places?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. The majority are going to be under contracts with customers and let's see, on a – I mean
on a percentage basis, I guess, essentially what you could do is exclude the CO2 portion of it and, generally, everything
else is going to be under contract.
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Okay. Great. And so, then, I guess, just stepping back here, you're earning 6.5 times multiple
returns, which certainly very good returns. At what point do you say, that's enough on asset sales, JVs, et cetera; this
backlog is too good, we actually don't want to give this up?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. Well, look, the backlog and the projects that we're going to be bringing on are part of our
effort to improve our DCF per share. And so we're going to keep – but that doesn't mean that we won't keep trying to
find ways to optimize the scope and do other things that are going to boost returns.
Going forward, we've set fairly high – look, we're in a self-funding world right now, and so we'll continue to look for
incremental project opportunities. But we raised our return criteria to something again that's all – it always varies on
any individual project depending on the risks and rewards. But we've kind of used as a rule of thumb a 15% unlevered
after-tax return. So we continue to look for those projects and have authorized several along the way through the year.
But we'll look to boost returns on what we have, but – and we'll raise our return thresholds as we look at incremental
capital investments.
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Okay. And then if I could just sneak one more in on Trans Mountain, I guess, any update on
your views on the costs there to meet the 157 conditions, now that you've had some time to go through there? And just
remind us if you'd have any ability to – if the costs were higher to pass those costs through to customers.

<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, we're working on the costs right now and working with our contractors right now and
kind of will be over the – really over the course of the summer. And look, contractors always want more than we want
to pay them. And we're going to be pushing back hard on that process over the course of the summer to try to keep
costs down and under control. Once we arrive at a cost that we turn over to our shippers in our final estimate, which
will be sometime early next year or maybe later this – maybe late this year, Ian?
<A - Ian D. Anderson>: [ph] Early next year (48:09).
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Okay. Then, we have flow-through protection on certain identified uncontrollable costs. And
that includes things – that's once we've set the price, right, once the cost has been set, and that includes things like the
First Nations costs, steel costs, one of the more complex spreads through the mountain, and then the last 40 kilometers
in the lower mainland.

Thank you. Our next question is from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Faisel. How are you?
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Good. Thank you. Thank you, Rich. Thanks for the time. A few questions. First is, I just want
to go back to some of the answers around the gathered volumes because it was a little bit confused. So you've gone
from roughly 3.5 Bcf a day in gathered volumes down to below 3 Bcf a day. And I think, Steve, what you were saying
is that that's basically it. A lot of that was sort of volumes above and beyond MPC, now you're saying that that's going
to stabilize going forward.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, what happens in the basin will drive a lot of that, right? I mean, we're starting to see some
people come back to the Eagle Ford, but you not only have to come back, you have to bring a lot of rigs back in order
to see that flatten out and then start to increase. And frankly, I don't think the basin is at that point yet.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: No, it's not.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: And so most of what we have been focusing on is where we lost some volumes to third-parties,
we're trying to incent those to come back to the system rather than just collecting the deficiency charges from those
customers. And as I said, I think we've made some good progress over the course of the quarter in doing that. But so
long as the overall basin is declining, what we're doing is fighting off decline and trying to stay above that decline rate,
if you will, but I don't know – it depends on whether the basin decline starts to slow, I think, and level out.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Right.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Now I'll point out too, because we haven't talked about Hiland. We actually had year-over-year
and over budget improvement on our Hiland gathering assets in North Dakota. A lot of that was due to, also,
restructuring of contracts and primarily migrating them from percent of proceeds to fee-based, which gives us both
greater stability, but also happened to have a beneficial impact on this year's earnings. So, we talked a lot about the
Eagle Ford. In the Haynesville, we've done an arrangement to try to incent a current customer to do some drilling. And
there what we've done is, we've divided, if you will, the contract between what's already under contract to us and new
or incremental wells and providing discounts there to try to incent some drilling. But, again, the overall gathering
picture is primarily driven by what the overall basin picture is.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. But I mean, to go from 3.5 Bcf a day to under 3 Bcf a day in two quarters is pretty
extreme. I mean, is that level of decline going to continue into the end of the year?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I think you may see some decline, but it won't be at that rate.

<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Got you. And then the Eagle Ford volumes you talk about, that's just on the liquid side,
going from [ph] 344 million barrels down to 304 million barrels (51:48), that's what you're talking about there, or is
there a mix of gas volumes you're talking about within the gathered volumes?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: There are significant gas gathered volumes in the Eagle Ford as well from our Eagle Ford
gathering system, and the assets that we acquired from Copano. And those are factored into our overall gas gathering
volumes that we report on the numbers page.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. That makes sense on the G&P side. And then, on the CO2 production volumes, I just
want to go back to a question that was asked before. So the 15% decline in volumes year-over-year, that's not the
natural decline rate of the field, if I remember correctly. I mean, I thought that the field – if you're not spending a lot of
capital in backlog engaged that volumes might decline by about, maybe, mid-single digits based on how much CO2
you're injecting in the field, but 15% seems like a lot.
<A - Jesse Arenivas>: Yeah, this is Jesse. No, it's not a natural decline. As Steve said earlier, we had a record quarter
and half year in 2015, based on a very successful infill program. The candidates are not as prolific in the area at the
moment, so that's really the driver period to period. It's the success of that particular infill project.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. So what is the natural decline in the field from here on out, if you could give me a best
guesstimate?
<A - Jesse Arenivas>: Yeah, it's probably more along the 6% to 9%, depending on the area of the field.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Understood. The last question for me. Just on the asset sale program, there was some
trade publication news that you were in the market to sell the Jones Act tanker business. Is that still an asset, that is on
the market or have you pulled that asset from the market?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: And again, Faisel, we're not really talking about specific processes or assets for the reasons that
I said earlier.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. One more, if I could. The drive to get the return capital to shareholders as quickly as
possible, I'm just wondering, did you have a lot of – you've announced a lot of asset sales already. I'm just wondering
do you risk sort of racing too quickly to return capital back to shareholders, and maybe not retaining assets that may
have sort of better value over the longer terms. So I'm just trying to understand sort of that balance between asset sales
and returning capital back to shareholders over a certain time period.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, I think it is a balancing process, and we're certainly not going to sell anything that
doesn't make sense strategically for us, and that's why, for the most part, and Steve has explained I think very clearly,
the thought behind the joint venture with Southern Company on SNG. But beyond that, our effort has been
concentrated on new projects where we could bring somebody in, who would reward us for the efforts we've made on
those projects thus far and participate heads up with us on a going-forward basis. So I think we're trying to balance this
very carefully, and we're not going to rush into anything that doesn't make sense strategically. We're obviously in this
for the very long-term.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Great. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Craig.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Hi. I've got three questions here. The first, pretty quick, on the fall to 6.5 times from what I
think was guided 6.7 times CapEx-to-EBITDA on the remaining non-CO2 growth CapEx, is that mostly on efficiencies
and that Gas Pipeline project restructuring? Or, were monetized projects in the completed Magnolia tanker at higher

multiples?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I think Magnolia would have been in there all along. So really it is the contract restructuring,
it's the Utopia JV. Those would probably be the two main contributors to it. But also we have – as I've said, we've
looked for ways to cut spend or reduce scope, where we have the opportunity to do so, without – and enhance return as
a result. Those are probably the two biggest single components.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. Great. And kind of the bigger picture here. I know the balance sheet repair and having
the flexibility to return money to shareholders is foremost in your minds. But, of course, if you had to make a choice
and you had unlimited ability to reinvest at 6.5 times EBITDA, certainly that would be preferable to returning money to
shareholders. Currently, excluding CO2 and CWIP, I think you have about $10 billion of proportional spend now for
2016 to 2020, and over half of that is Trans Mountain. How would you handicap the prospects for this fee-based
outstanding growth CapEx inventory to materially fill in and expand over the next couple of years?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, again, as Rich said, we're trying to balance things. There're two things we're trying to
accomplish here. One is we want to get our debt-to-EBITDA down to – into the vicinity of five times, okay? The other
thing we want to do is grow the DCF per share, and that involves investing in projects, as we've described, and getting
good returns for the capital that we do deploy. And we're doing this in a context of being self-funding. So we are trying
to make sure that we are dedicating our capital that we have to the best returns we can get and not be in a position
where we have to access the capital market. And so those are really the things that we are balancing. We remain
focused on getting the balance sheet in order, and in improving our DCF per share. And we believe following that
course will allow us to be in a position to return cash to shareholders.
I think if you look at what our opportunities and – it remains to be seen what the total investment opportunity is going
to be out there, but I think there is a very reasonable case, right, or reasonable scenario, where we're in a situation
where we're generating significantly more cash, particularly as these projects come online – more cash than we're
investing. And when we're in that position, we're going to be also in a position to either, as we said multiple times,
either further de-lever the balance sheet, or return value to shareholders in the form of buybacks, or increase the
dividend. And as we get closer in time to that, we'll be evaluating which one of those approaches is the best way to
maximize shareholder value.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Understood. I guess what I'm trying to get at is that there's a much higher value proposition
potential, and that is, if you get close to five times net debt-to-EBITDA towards the end of next year and you have this
flexibility and still can issue 10-year debt at sub-4%, if you could fund half the cost of all your growth CapEx at 6.5
times with cheap debt, you would have enormous amounts of free cash flow to both fund growth CapEx and return to
shareholders. And I guess I'm trying to get a sense of, if you think that having additional projects in line with the
attractive inventory you currently have – I mean, there was a point you had over $20 billion of inventory – do you think
that there's prospects over the next two years, three years to start recharging that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. Look, that's a possibility, and that is absolutely something we would look at. But again,
the place we're trying to maintain ourselves right now is not to have to access the capital market. It doesn't mean that,
on the right terms and conditions, we wouldn't.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. Last question. On CO2, I think for the entire segment, there was originally budget of
$1.8 billion of growth CapEx over the five-year plan. I think the forward strips in 2016 and 2017 are above your plan
assumptions, but longer term, the strips are still stubbornly low. Any reason to think about – particularly with some of
the volumes being less than originally anticipated, any reason to think about that spend over the five years coming in?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Five years coming in, meaning...
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: They were falling, less than the $1.8 billion.
<A - Jesse Arenivas>: As a matter of fact, we're up slightly from the $1.8 billion in the first Q. At the current strip, we
have – the $1.8 billion still fits. It works with the current strip.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon, Chris.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Hey, Rich. How are you?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Thanks for the time this evening. Just a couple of quick follow-ups for me. I
guess, Kim, starting with CO2 for a moment, you've been willing to give us some updates in prior calls on the hedge
book and activity. I'm just wondering if there's been any update on the hedge positions. If so, if you could just sort of
update us as to where you stand.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Sure. As we said on the last call, we continue to lay on hedges in a programmatic
fashion in order to stay in line with our hedge policy, but for 2017, we're 51% hedged at $68; 36% in 2018, $72; 24%
in 2019 at $60; about 6% in 2020 at $49.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Okay. Thanks. And then, with regard – I think you had said earlier in the call that
there were $175 million of sort of arranged sales in the Products business, and I was curious just – you had a press
release out with regard to Parkway. I was curious if you could quantify how much of it was that.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: No, we can't, due to confidentiality commitments, cannot talk about it specifically. We try to
give you some – I've got a little bit of guidance there. If you aggregate all of those things that we sold – so, not teasing
out Parkway, okay? But just aggregate the other – it was a terminal asset that was sold, and of the three total assets
sold, $172 million proceeds and the EBITDA multiple was about 13.5 times.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Okay. Thanks, Steve. Also had a question just with regard to Trans Mountain, if
that project is formally a go when all is said and done, could you – I don't know if you know at this point or could help
us think about how the cadence spend would go on that asset, particularly in 2017 and 2018? Or is it mostly
concentrated in the final year?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Kim?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: It's concentrated in 2018 and 2019.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: It's concentrated in 2019. We won't start actual pipe construction until late summer of 2017. So
I would say that if you think about 2018 and 2019 as being the peaks, when the project would complete with a half-year
in 2017 is a good way to think about it.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Okay. And then I think just a final question for me. I don't mean to beat a dead
horse, but I wanted to revisit sort of the balancing act that you spoke about with Faisel and then Craig's efforts or
comments around sort of the deleveraging efforts versus capital deployment opportunities. Steve, recognizing that you
don't need to access the capital markets, but I'm just wondering like, at what point – what are the conditions under
which you would – like, if the – I get that the effort around JVing on in-flight projects is seemingly the most attractive
thing, particularly if the party can bring something to that other than just capital. We've obviously seen asset sales, but
it's kind of tricky when you're selling underlying cash flow and utilizing some of the NOL balance. So I'm just curious
like if you go around de-levering, where and when and if equity issuance would play into that.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Well, I think at this price level, we don't want to issue equity, and so, look, I think right
now, we're going to live within our cash flow. And I think that as we look out in time, we want to do projects. So we
want to do projects that have good returns on them. And so, if they have good returns, we think that will be value
creating to our investors. And so if we can do projects at 6.5 times EBITDA, then that is going to be a priority.

But as we look out in time and we look at the backlog that we have and we look at the potential opportunities that there
may be, we see that there's probably going to be cash flow in excess of the capital projects, once the balance sheet is
repaired. And so that's why we're saying, once the balance sheet's repaired, then at that point in time, we will be in the
position to return value to shareholders through share repurchases or dividends, because we think there will be some
projects, don't get me wrong, but we just think that the cash flow that we will have will exceed that amount of projects.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Okay. I think I'm clear on that. Thanks, Kim. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our last question at this time is from John Edwards from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, John. How you doing?
<Q - John Edwards>: Good. Thanks, Rich. Just a couple of just real quick ones for me. Just, do you have the breakout
of the sub-sectors for the backlog? If you could give that to us now.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. Hang on. Yeah. So Natural Gas is still about 30% of the backlog in the current – so this
is the $13.5 billion that we talked about.
<Q - John Edwards>: Yeah. Exactly.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. Gas is 30%. Products, after the JV, is sitting at 2%. Terminal is at 15%. CO2 is 14%.
And then KM Canada, carrying the project at the $5.4 billion U.S., is 40%.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. And then just what change from the – you said it came down about $1 billion. Was it
mostly coming out of Natural Gas?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. It came down from $14.1 billion to $13.5 billion, so $600 million, and there were
projects that rolled into service. We also, in the previous backlog, did not have a Utopia JV assumption, but the JV of
Utopia had an impact [indiscernible] (01:07:59). It was part of the decline. And then, as I mentioned, we've restructured
a contract with a customer, actually boosted the return, and that also reduced the capital associated with that particular
project, and those are the three biggest things. And then, there were some fairly modest project additions that went the
other way.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. And then, just my only other one is just, can you quantify the amount of deficiency
payments you're receiving?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I don't have that number. That's not something that we track separately.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: So no.
<Q - John Edwards>: All right. That's it for me. Thanks.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Thanks.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Okay.
