Thomas A. Fanning
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In a few minutes, Art will provide an update on our financial results as
well as our sales and economic outlook. But first, I'd like to begin with an update on construction activities in Kemper
County and Plant Vogtle. First, an update on the Kemper County IGCC project.
Last night we filed our latest 8-K and monthly PSC report for the project, which reflect a quarterly increase in cash cost
of $418 million, consistent with an in-service date in the first half of 2016. As you recall, the 8-K we filed
approximately one month ago reflected $88 million in increased non-schedule related costs, and indicated that the
schedule was likely to be extended into late 2015 pending a review by the project team.
Since that time, the project team has worked through their latest cost analysis and identified additional non-schedule
related costs of $20 million for a total of $108 million. The remaining cost increases totaling $310 million can all be
attributed to the extension of the schedule by 10 months. We currently estimate that each additional month will cost
$20 million to $30 million, and our increased forecast assumes the high end of that estimate.
As a reminder, major construction is essentially complete, and the combined cycle portion of the plant has been in
service since early August. It is been performing extremely well, running at a capacity factor of 80%, and has an
equivalent forced outage rate or EFOR of less than 1%. That compares to an industry average for combined cycle of
closer to 4%.
With the combined cycle producing energy for customers, it's important to note that the schedule extension we have
disclosed is for the gasifier and the gas cleanup systems of the facility. These two complex systems are key long-term
value drivers for customers, as the ability to utilize Mississippi lignite along with the capture and sale of byproduct like
CO2 are both key to delivering reliable, low-cost energy to customers for years to come.
With this long-term value in mind, the project team has recommended, and we have agreed, to adopt a more methodical
approach to operator training, control system design, startup activity, and integration of the gasifier and gas cleanup
systems. I am proud of the work that has been done at Kemper. There is a very clear distinction between the
outstanding quality of work on-site and our frustrating difficulties thus far with accurately forecasting cost and
schedule. We will continue to work diligently towards the successful completion of this project. And once we get past
start up and integration, which no doubt will include many challenges, we expect this facility to benefit Mississippi
power customers in a safe and reliable manner for decades to come.
Meanwhile, progress continues towards in-service date for plant Vogtle Unit 3 and 4. Our most recent major milestone
was the setting of the CA05 module for Unit 3. This module provides structural support and also serves as a safety
barrier within the containment barrier. The 50-foot tall lower ring of the containment vessel has also been set in Unit 3.
While the critical path and with it, most of the external focus has been on the Unit 3 nuclear island, the progress around
the remainder of the site is noteworthy as well. For example, the Unit 3 cooling tower is now more than 500 feet tall
with less than 100 feet remaining to build. We have also made significant progress on the Unit 3 Annex building, which
is critical for the initial energization and testing of the plant's electrical components. Meanwhile, in Unit 4, the first
concrete has been poured inside the containment vessel, and we completed the foundation for the 500Kv transmission
switchyard that will serve the entire site.
Upcoming near-term milestones for Unit 3 include the reaching of Elevation 100 and the nuclear island bringing the
initial shield building module to ground level where they will serve as the foundation for the remainder of the shield

building.
We also expect to see Unit 3 cooling tower completed before yearend. The CA01 module which is scheduled to be
placed during the first quarter of 2015 is the largest structural module to be placed in the nuclear island, and will house
the unit's steam generators.
Unit 4 also has several upcoming milestones, including structural module CA04 and CB65. Fabrication of CA20
modules for Unit 4 is currently underway with on-site assembly expected to begin in the next few months.
As you know, the latest Vogtle construction monitoring report was filed in late August. More recently, Georgia Power
filed its direct testimony in support of the VCM 11 filing. Hearings are scheduled to begin November 5 with the
Commission voting next February. Obviously, a project of this magnitude comes with many challenges, including
among these is the ongoing pressure on this construction schedule which we believe is still achievable.
We will continue to work through issues on a daily basis and are very pleased with how the project has proceeded thus
far. Through the combination of diligent oversight and quality assurance efforts, our fixed and firm EPC contract and
robust regulatory process, we believe we are well-positioned for success with this project going forward.
I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview.
Arthur P. Beattie
Thanks, Tom. For the third quarter of 2014, we earned $0.80 per share compared to $0.97 per share in the third quarter
of 2013, a decrease of $0.17 per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we earned $1.88 per share
compared to $1.41 per share for the same period in 2013, an increase of $0.47 per share.
Earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, include after-tax charges of $258 million or $0.29
per share, and $493 million or $0.55 per share respectively, related to increased cost estimates for the construction of
Mississippi Power's Kemper County project.
Earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, include after-tax charges of $93 million or $0.11 per
share, and $704 million or $0.81 per share respectively, related to the Kemper County project. Earnings for the first
nine months of 2013 also include an after-tax charge of $16 million or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a
leveraged lease investment recorded in the first quarter of 2013.
Excluding these items, earnings for the third quarter of 2014 were $1.09 per share compared with $1.08 per share for
the third quarter of 2013, an increase of $0.01 per share. Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2014,
excluding these items, were $2.43 per share compared with $2.24 per share for the same period in 2013, an increase of
$0.19 per share.
A primary driver for our 2014 third quarter results was more normal weather compared to the same period in 2013,
resulting in an increase of $0.06 per share on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Third quarter 2014 earnings also benefited
from retail revenue effects at our traditional operating companies, as well as increased industrial sales and residential
customer growth. Revenue increases were largely offset by increases in non-fuel O&M expenses. A more detailed
summary of our quarter-over-quarter drivers is included in the slide deck.
Economic activity and sales growth in our region reflect a recovering economy, and for the remainder of this year, we
anticipate continued improvement with expected quarter-over-quarter GDP growth of 3% for both the third and fourth
quarters of 2014. Despite recent volatility, consumer confidence has improved more than 10 points since 2013.
Residential building permits are 11% higher for the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013, and
initial unemployment claims are now close to pre-recession levels. Additionally, the monthly U.S. economic policy
uncertainty index is trending toward pre-recession levels. In summary, the economy is recovering, but still considered
fragile and subject to event risk.

This economic data is reflected in our sales results. Industrial sales were up nearly 5% in the third quarter of 2014
compared with the third quarter of 2013, with expansion across all major segments. For the first nine months of 2014,
six of our top 10 industrial segments show sales above pre-recession levels, while our housing related segments are
recovering strongly but remain below their pre-recession marks. Segments with the strongest growth include primary
metals, up 12%, transportation, up 7%, and housing-related segments of stone, clay, and glass and lumber up 7% and
6%, respectively.
Expectations for continued strength in the industrial segment are upbeat. This is supported by an expanding ISM
Manufacturing Index, which indicates increasing levels of employment, production inventory, new orders, and supplier
deliveries. Also, our surveys of top industrial customers continue to indicate that a majority expect continuing strong
product demand from their customers for the next six months. Meanwhile, weather-normal residential and commercial
sales remained relatively flat in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the third quarter of 2013. Residential customer
growth continues to recover, with Southern Company reporting positive customer additions during the third quarter of
2014. For the first nine months of 2014, we have added more than 21,000 new residential customers, about 4,000 more
than expected. However, weak household income growth continues to challenge growth in customer usage.
We continue to see evidence of strong economic development activity within our region. One recent example is the
announcement of the new Army Cyber Command Headquarters at Fort Gordon near Augusta, Georgia, consolidating
U.S. Army cyber security functions for the first time and bringing nearly 4,000 jobs to East Georgia. And just this
morning, the Navy Federal Credit Union announced it will be adding 5,000 new jobs in Pensacola, Florida. These are
in addition to the 2,000 new jobs announced in May of this year.
The first 2,000 jobs will be in place by 2016, and the additional 5,000 are expected to be in place by the early 2020s.
Other economic development announcements include a tractor manufacturer adding 650 jobs to an existing facility in
Hall County, Georgia. A carpet manufacturing facility expansion that will bring 350 jobs to Cartersville, Georgia, and a
new medical research and development facility bringing 300 jobs to Metro Atlanta. So overall, our economic
development pipeline remains robust and on a positive long-term trajectory.
Now turning to our fourth quarter estimate and EPS guidance for 2014, our fourth quarter estimate is $0.37 per share.
This implies a year-end result of $2.80 per share excluding charges related to Kemper, which is at the very top of our
annual guidance range of $2.72 to $2.80 per share. Included in our fourth quarter estimate is the initial earnings impact
of the Solar Gen 2 project recently announced by Southern Power. This transaction with First Solar will increase the
size of Southern Power's growing solar portfolio by almost 30%. The 150-megawatt project, which will be 51% owned
by Southern Power and used to serve a 25-year purchased power agreement with San Diego Gas and Electric, is
expected to be completed in December of this year.
In addition to the Solar Gen 2 project, Southern Power also completed a transaction to purchase 90% of the
50-megawatt Macho Springs' solar facility in New Mexico earlier this year, and recently purchased options to acquire
development rights to approximately 100 megawatts of utility-scale projects associated with Georgia Power's
Advanced Solar Initiative.
As you know, we previously provided a forecast of placeholder CapEx for Southern Power of $1.4 billion over the
three-year period 2014 to 2016. With the projects we have either already completed or for which we have options to
purchase, we have already utilized about $1 billion of that estimate. Given our recent successes in the solar power
market and the availability of additional projects, we will reassess our placeholder forecast for Southern Power in
conjunction with our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call in February of next year.
One final note. We do not anticipate issuing additional new equity beyond what we had planned to issue, even with the
recognition of additional costs for the extension of schedule at Kemper County. We will continue to assess, on a
consolidated basis, the level of equity capital needed to maintain our financial integrity. This will be a function of many
factors, including potential changes to our CapEx forecast and potential extension of bonus depreciation.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.

Thomas A. Fanning
Thanks, Art. As Art indicated, we are having great success with solar power. In fact, Southern Power's
accomplishments are only one example of our growing reputation as a national leader in the development of solar
resources. Notably, in Georgia, in addition to the approval of Georgia Power's Advanced Solar Initiative, the Georgia
Public Service Commission recently approved three rate-based solar projects totaling approximately 90 megawatts at
Fort Benning, Stewart and Gordon. These projects are expected to be the largest solar generation facilities operating on
any U.S. military base. In addition, the commission recognized a memorandum of understanding between Georgia
Power and the U.S. Navy to build a 30-megawatt solar facility at Kings Bay Submarine Base near St. Marys, Georgia.
Final approval of this project is expected soon.
In recognition of these initiatives, which could increase Georgia Power's solar resources to nearly 900 megawatts by
2016, Georgia Power was recently named a 2014 investor-owned utility of the year by the Solar Electric Power
Association.
Renewable energy is just one component of our commitment to build the nation's only truly diversified generation
portfolio, one that makes use of new nuclear, 21st century coal, natural gas, renewables and energy efficiency. Our
ability to balance fuel diversity benefits customers directly by helping keep prices well below the national average. Add
to that our industry-leading reliability, as evidenced by our 2014 summer peak season EFOR of 1.6% compared to the
most recent five-year national average of around 9%.
Likewise, our transmission and distribution businesses have performed superbly, with our rate of service interruptions
and the duration of those interruptions at historically low levels. As a result, it's no wonder our four traditional
franchise utilities scored the four highest customer satisfaction ratings among national peer utilities this year as
measured by our annual customer value benchmark survey.
I am intensely focused, as is the entire management team here at Southern, on startup activities at Kemper County.
Despite those challenges, the Southern Company franchise is in as good a shape as it has ever been. Our
customer-focused business model, with its emphasis on outstanding reliability, exceptional customer service, and prices
well below the national average, remains the cornerstone of our business and a key driver of long-term value to
Southern Company shareholders.
We're now ready to take your questions. So, operator, we'll now take the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please
proceed.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. You looked great this morning on CNBC, by the way.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thanks.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Can we talk about the CapEx forecast a bit?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Sure.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: So, on two fronts, one on Southern Power, you've indicated you're doing really well finding
opportunities to put that placeholder capital to work, a lot of it in solar, and that you're going to reassess whether there's
an opportunity to spend more basically. Do you see a big enough opportunity to put capital to work at a good enough
return that it could move you outside of the 3% to 4% earnings guidance range that you've laid out for people for 2014

to 2016 or is it sort of it pushes you around inside that range?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Hey, Greg. Let's carry that conversation next February. I am a little hesitant to get into kind
of reviving the forward forecast. Let's just say that we've had a better-than-expected rate of success in solar so far,
using up all of our kind of allocation for CapEx there in solar. And I think the presumption is that there is opportunities
to do more. With respect to the long-term forecast, we'll handle that in February, if that's okay.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Let me ask the question a little differently, then. The assumption inside the current
guidance was that you'd spend the $1.4 billion.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's right.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: And earn some sort of reasonable return on that capital. Is that fair?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. And my second question goes to everything you're seeing on the economic development
front, seems like things are going really well. The industrial load has been great. At what point do you reassess your
2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 kind of CapEx forecast in light of any upside changes in the economic forecast? Or do you
think that [indiscernible] (24:45) sufficient to have the infrastructure you need to keep up with the way the economy is
ramping?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, I think I got it, Greg. As we look forward, I think you're talking about new capacity
additions, I assume.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Or increased distribution spending because of housing formation. You name it.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: There'll be some minor effects there. But new generation is still in the mid-2020s, at least
under the current economic forecast that we have. So it would be on the likes of more distribution growth to serve some
of these customers, maybe some transmission, but it wouldn't be a lot, at least under the current forecast.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, Greg, the other thing I would add there's an enormous swing variable, and that deals
with where EPA is going to come out with this carbon rule, 111 (d). By their own calculations – this is EPA's own
calculation, not ours, they would have us projected to build over 5,000 megawatts of combined cycles by 2020. Now I
don't think that's a practical assumption, not only given the lead times required to build combined cycles, plus
considering the state of natural gas infrastructure in the Southeast. So my sense is these things are going to have to be a
bit more fluid than what EPA is assuming. But depending on how that rule turns out, you could see a swing in CapEx
also.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Great. Thank you, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, sir. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question is from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Tom, I just want to make sure I'm not reading too much into your
comments about Vogtle but you made a comment about ongoing pressure on the construction cycle but you guys
thought, still manageable. Did I, A, hear that correctly and can you just maybe give a little more color on what's going
on that's putting some pressure on timelines?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I guess it's out there. SCANA has had some announcements about schedule and costs and
all that, and we have not. I think that's an obvious kind of conclusion people will make. I would just point to the fact
without commenting on SCANA's situation, that we have a different site, a different state of construction and certainly
a different contract. Our contract is essentially a fixed-price turnkey arrangement, and while there is always challenges

with respect to cost and schedule, I think given the commercial status of our contract with the consortium, we have
been assured by consortium personnel that, in fact, we can meet the schedule. It's always a challenge. It is subject to
change, but we believe, as we sit here right now, that we can go in-service Unit 3 at the end of 2017 and in-service Unit
4 at the end of 2018.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: And then I guess just kind of against the Kemper rule of thumb, the $20 million to $30 million a
month for the delays, would that not apply in the Vogtle situation because of the contract you guys have in place
[indiscernible] (28:00) I guess?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: If there were a schedule delay, that would be owner's costs, essentially overhead cost of
our own oversight. But certainly the cost involved with housing workers and whatever other time-related costs would
really be for the account of the consortium.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Thank you. And then I guess one last question, on the solar development, we've talked to
you about the yield cos before, but can you explain where you guys are taking advantage to win some of these projects
rather than relative to the yield cos? You seemingly have reasonably low cost of capital at this point?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Dan. This is Art. We feel like we've got a lot of the relationships with the developers
out there. We've done a lot of projects with the likes of First Solar. The one thing they know is when they do a deal
with us that we're going to be able to close, and we're going to be able to do it in an efficient manner. We have access
to low-cost capital with decent credit ratings, so we still feel like we can be competitive. This recent transaction that we
did with First Solar was a little different than some of the others. We basically bought not only 51% of the operating
asset, but basically the vast majority of the tax benefit. So we're finding different ways to get deals done, and this was a
– what we thought would be a win-win for both Southern Power and for First Solar, and we think that both parties are
pretty happy with it.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The other thing I'll just add here too is, we have been very careful about not overextending
on our tax appetite. We haven't found ourselves in any substantial carry forward positions. We've always kind of been
very careful about tax-advantaged investing. I think, given that we do have a tax appetite and that we have a strategic
kind of reason for being in this space, it gives us a very nice niche in this market that seems to be evolving. And I think
we tend to be a pretty attractive partner for that reason and all the reasons Art just mentioned. So my sense is there will
be some more opportunities ahead.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: So the $1.2 billion of CapEx you're able to spend with the tax credits coming back to you, with
bonus depreciation, would that affect your ability to monetize some of those benefits if you think about perpetuating
this level of investment? Or can you manage bonus and these tax credits?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, one can only say what's going to happen with bonus, it will move things slightly
through time. But even if you get some enormous sense of new tax benefits, it won't move us but a year or so. So, yes,
does that shift your IRR curve? Sure. But it's not in a substantial way. Nothing like multiple years of carry forward.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Very good. Thank you, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet. Thank you.

<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Hey. A question for you. Actually a couple of questions. The first one is on the fourth
quarter earnings estimate. Can you remind us what would drive the $0.11 decline year-over-year?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, if you go back and look at our fourth quarter earnings from, say, 2010 forward, there's
a pretty good variability in our level of earnings in the fourth quarter, and it's subject to where we are at the end of the
third. And that's true this year. We plan on making up for what has, year-to-date, been an under spending of our
non-fuel O&M, and as you know, we traditionally do that in the last half of the year, and in this case, a lot of it will be
done in the fourth quarter. So that is the main driver in the reduction in year-over-year earnings from 2013 in the fourth
quarter to 2014 in the fourth quarter.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I think we did a presentation at one of the investor conferences where we were able to
show that over the past 10 years or so, we've hit our range 100% of the time. We can't ever guarantee that going
forward, but that is our past history. You know that for a long time, we have had a practice of being able to structure
our O&M spending in such a way that we essentially account for, through optionality, variability in weather and for a
reasonable variability in economics, sales forecasts coming to fruition, et cetera. My sense is we'll continue that
practice of matching in the fourth quarter here.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Okay. And the second question is on the dividend. A lot of folks are raising their
dividend more than historical rates, and I just wanted to get a sense as to what you're thinking about the dividend,
especially as it relates to a GAAP payout ratio going forward.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So we've been very consistent with this. One of the Southern mantras here is regular,
predictable, sustainable increases in earnings per share which provide for regular predictable sustainable increases in
dividends per share. For a long time now, we've been on a $0.07 per year increase in the dividend per share rate. While
this ultimately is the decision of the Southern Company Board, the management is in a position where we believe very
strongly we'll be able to continue that trajectory for years to come.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Okay. Just double-checking. Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thank you.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Thank you, Jim.

And our next question is from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, John.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Good afternoon. Hi, guys.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Hey.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Can I just ask you to maybe clarify how the accounting will work on the solar deal in
the fourth quarter and perhaps quantify what the impact on the quarter is?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes. Jonathan, this is Art. Basically, the Solar Gen 2 project will, I believe, provide about
$30 million of net income on its own, and – or so, and then there are some other year-over-year effects that will
mitigate that number somewhat for Southern Power, along with the other expenses at Southern that I talked about on
the earlier call that will get us to our $2.37 estimate. But we can give you more detail on that if you'd like off-line,
Jonathan, but basically, it'll be 51% of the cash flows will go to us, and we'll get the vast majority of the investment tax
credit.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: And in terms of timing of how that gets booked, is that all being booked in Q4 or...?

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes. That's our expectation.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. So the ongoing number will be less, but $30 million is the right number to use
in the quarter?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's approximately correct.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: But there are lots of details in their around bases differences and how much IPC, so we can
give you more detail on that.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. And then the second topic, I was just curious only, can you give us – shed a bit
more light, Tom, maybe, on what – you said the project managers have sort of recommended and you have agreed that
you should sort of be more methodical about how you work through start up. This is obviously a significant delay and a
large number. Can you give us some more color as to what exactly you're going to do differently and how you've
arrived at that determination?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure. And I just want to tell you all investors of Southern, I'll bet you I am more frustrated
than you are. And I certainly empathize with any of you that are frustrated. I can tell you that we have had very direct,
candid, tough conversations with the team on executing on this. What the more methodical approach deals with is,
essentially, an extended schedule that relates to training. Recall not only is this an electric project, but it is a chemical
and gas process project. There is specialized training. And given that this is the first of a kind technology, we are doing
kind of a more methodical approach to moving people through all facets of any kind of operational requirements with
respect to running this plant.
The second we've talked about a lot over time, and that deals with recall – about how complex the integration of this
project is. And we've often used kind of the example of in order to get a combined cycle plant to work, you need to
integrate three systems. This plant has 13 systems. One of the efforts that we are spending a lot of time on in order to
do it well is essentially the digital control equipment and a simulator associated with that. And so as you would think
about the challenges involved in integrating these 13 processes, we are following that through on the simulator as well.
And that also extends to training. So that when we get the digital control equipment exactly the way we want it, and the
simulator the way we want, and the training the way we want it, we will have moved people through, again, an
extended process, whereby when we reach the intended in-service date, we're ready to go.
And I would point to when we turned on the combined cycle, it has worked beautifully. Did we have to fine tune it a
bit? Yes. But overall, when you look at the performance of that part of the plant, it's fantastic. And when we've looked
at whatever we've completed on construction and the pressure testing we've done so far and everything else, the plant
has performed well. Our intention is to do startups so that at the end of the day, this plant operates as well as it can
when we put it into service.
The final piece of all this is adding a little more time into the startup processes, the packages, the turnover packages, the
execution of the checkout of the systems. The analog to this in the nuclear world would be the [ph] I tags (39:34). In
other words, as we go through the various – turning on the various systems before we get them all to run together, just
being very methodical there also, allowing more time.
So, I guess what I'm saying is, when you consider training all personnel in all facets of this plant, when you consider
the integration of the digitized systems and the simulator, when you consider the time involved in going through the
startup processes of all the segments, we have added more time in there. We've had a lot of tough discussions about
this. Like I say, I'm frustrated with it. I think this is the best of our judgment. I think this approach is painful in the short
term, but I think it gives us the best long-term result that will demonstrate the value of this technology.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: So I'm just following up on one thing you just said. It seems you might be suggesting
that you don't really kind of have the training protocols established to your satisfaction yet. So you've got to do that,
and then implement the training. Or is it just – am I understanding that right?

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No, it's – here's the deal. In this world it's called PSM, okay? It's called process safety
management. And that involves when you basically – it's the regime under which procedures have to be followed when
you turn the plant on and introduce syngas live into the turbines. That is a whole new regime.
There are no bright white lines about how you must operate, and I think we have brought in a lot of external consultants
here, people that worked at Chevron, people that worked at BP and other places. And I would say here again, our
approach, rather than trying to push something that might qualify, we are taking more time to do more in terms of
training, so that everybody is essentially up to speed on all facets of the plant. For example, one thing you could do is
just train certain people on certain aspects of the plant. We're taking this methodical approach to make sure that we
have the best kind of foundation for a safe, reliable operation once we go in service.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. Thank you, Tom.

And our next question is from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Good morning. Good afternoon. You indicated that despite the latest Kemper write-off, you
don't think you need to backfill equity to protect the balance sheet. Kind of, where are you finding that upside?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, we – and as I said in the call or in the script, we continue to look at it on a
consolidated basis. As you know, we had contemplated issuing $600 million of equity this year. We're on track to do
that. We may in fact issue just a hair more than that this year, but we'll see. So at the end of this year we should be in
fine shape, and as we move forward it's going to be a function of our need for capital, which is also a function of our
CapEx. It's also a function of accelerated depreciation opportunities and those things. So it's difficult for me to sit here
and a bit premature to say I'll need X amount of equity in order to do this. But based on our plans, we had assumed no
new issuances of equity in 2015 and 2016.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Correct.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: When we look the plans that we have in place, we already had, shall we say, placeholders,
room, for additional problems elsewhere, for example at Kemper or somewhere else. What we're seeing at Kemper fits
within those thresholds, and within those thresholds we don't believe we'll need to issue new equity. I think what Art's
referring to is, one of the big swings that I would see is, what if Southern Power had lots more opportunity? That could
give rise, depending on the way tax law changes, that could give rise. But we already had contemplated, we had
placeholders, room, so that the kind of equity issuances we've talked about, and really turning off equity, was already
provided for. We're well within where we think we need to be from an equity capitalization standpoint.
The last thing I'll just mention here, when you look at our profile in terms of reducing CapEx compared to our rather
immense invested capital base, we start throwing off cash flow, and one of the things we've suggested in the past still is
in front of us as an option, and that is reducing our equity capitalization as a percent. So my sense is we have room.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: So you're just kind of beating me to the head room that you built in conservatively?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It's the way we plan.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: And things continue to evolve so we'll evaluate that, and we'll assess it as we move through
time.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Kind of going out on a limb here, given your conservative DNA. Would you guys ever think of
an alternative financial structure, like a yield co?

And our next question is from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Hi, Tom. How are you doing.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Hey. Just a lot of my questions are already answered, so I just wanted to follow-up on the
throwing off of cash flow, you're saying that might also be Vogtle and Kemper together, will eventually be cash flow
producers so that you might be able to withstand a little more of a lower equity ratio until they do? Is that basically
what you're saying?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct. It would be after those are operational and then it would start depreciating
those assets, it's going to be throwing off a lot of cash.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. And also is there any consideration of other than Solar and Southern Power such as
biomass opportunities or any other opportunities in other forms of renewable energy that you might be...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, sure, one that we've looked at in the past, this was all the way back to my time as the
CFO, those of you that have been around that long may remember we used to have a placeholder in the plan for like
$250 million of wind, and we used to push around all the different wind deals. The reason we've always been bullish on
solar is it had direct application into our service territory, and so therefore, we loved especially PV solar. We weren't
really bullish on thermal solar. When we thought about wind, especially looking at the portfolios in that timeframe, we
were of the opinion that the risk return profile really didn't fit us given some of the technology challenges and some of
the other challenges that industry was facing.
What we're seeing now is a more mature technology certainly in terms of technology, it seems like there's two or three
kind of really mature ways to harvest wind energy. And recall also that wind doesn't make sense really in the Southeast
except for maybe offshore. We don't have the climatology, so my comment on wind as a potential would be that I think
we're finding that area to be a bit more suitable and we would most likely do it other than the Southeast. So that's
something we could do. We're very happy with our biomass deal in Nacogdoches, Texas. That was the largest bubbling
bed technology in North America, and I guess it was the biggest in the world, it was the biggest biomass plant in North
America when it was built. And unlike Kemper we built that on-time, on-schedule, and it's worked beautifully.
To the extent there are other biomass facilities available, we'll certainly look at that. They come and go on our project
development list. Given all the environmental issues it's kind of hard to get those done, but we certainly would consider
that.
And let me just leave you with all this discussion about renewables. For us, gas is still a priority. We think we are the
preeminent competitive generator in gas, and we have just a terrific track record of executing there. So you know what,
if EPA comes forward and they start requiring more shutdowns of coal and more gas to be built, we're going to be very
well positioned to help execute in that [indiscernible] (48:53).
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Thanks. Do you have any kind of estimate as to what the timeline is with EPA at this point,
like where they stand on this issue?

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You know that – I guess it was yesterday there was kind of a new alert out that they were
willing to rethink some of the points of their proposed rule, but what I understand right now, and this is very premature.
We're just kind of understanding what's in that latest update, is that they're going to try and maintain the same schedule

And we have a question from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Michael.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys. Hey Tom, two questions for you. One, can you give a little insight – it's been a
couple of quarters now in terms of the big spread between what you're seeing in weather normalized industrial demand
versus what you're seeing in weather normalized commercial and residential demand? That's one question.
The second question totally unrelated. Can you give an update at all on the litigation between you and the consortium
members regarding some of the – I think it was like $900 million or so of potential cost related to Vogtle?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes. You know what I'm going to do? I am going to give you a top answer on the first
one, and I'm going to let Art dive into more detail there. The second one on litigation I think I can hit pretty easily, and
I don't mean to sound glib here, but there's just nothing much to report. We continue to have very productive
discussions. We meet with Phil Asherman and Danny Roderick and members of Toshiba regularly. They are cordial
meetings. We get along, we solve problems. But you know there's kind of two ways to think about how those
discussions occur. One is between us and the consortium. The other is within the consortium they have obligations.
And so it's not just as simple as us and them, it's them and them. That's about all I can say on that.
There's always been a big difference in weather between industrial and residential and commercial. Industrial sales just
aren't very weather sensitive. Certainly the residential and commercial are. Art, do you want to give more color there?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, Michael, as I said in the script, a lot of it's driven by household income and the lack of
growth in household income. If you look at the split of residential between growth in customers and growth in usage,
growth in customers was actually positive 0.7%, I think, on a year-to-date basis, and growth in usage has been a
negative 0.6%. So, I mean, we're flat. So that's an indication that our people are sitting in their kitchens trying to make
decisions on how to make the budgets work, and so we're feeling the effects of some of that. I think you're also seeing
that true, say, at Walmart. Walmart lowered their sales forecast growth for the same reason.
Another factor to think about on the residential side – when we look at new customer additions, about 35% of our new
customer additions are in multi-family homes rather than single-family homes. Our existing customer base is about
20% multi-family. So multi-family additions use about 70% of the energy of a single-family home. So that could be
another factor. So because we add a new customer doesn't mean that they're all the same. And these are factors that we
have to think about as we move forward and try to predict where sales are going to be.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I gave some comments on this. I have in the past on Squawk Box. I did this morning just a
bit in that very kind of interesting exchange with Joe Kernen. But we – I think the Fed and economists all over have
overshot where we thought we would be on GDP recovery. I think it's because you have a bit of a false signal, a false
positive, on improving unemployment when you consider the jobs that are getting there, that are getting filled are lower
paying service-related jobs compared to the past, when you consider more part-time labor accounted for, when you
consider disaffected workers, household income are generally flat. And that's what we've got to look to.

The people that are having flat incomes, that are making tough kitchen table economic decisions, as Art said, aren't
spending money. And I think they have this kind of psychological issue of dealing with the recent recession. And
something that I don't think is all bad is savings rates are up. So people are consuming less. I don't think that's all bad.
We don't need an economy and people's incomes living on the edge. I actually kind of am okay with where we are on
that. But that seems to be, I think, in my opinion, a more important statistic than household incomes than, say,
unemployment.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: And, Michael...
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Should we – go ahead, I'm sorry.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes. I was going to comment on the commercial end, unless you want to ask a different
question.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: No, that's exactly where I was going.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Okay. Yeah, the commercial side, it's still flat to slightly negative. If you do the splits there,
customer growth is up, but usage is down. And so what we see in Georgia, particularly around Atlanta, is it was an
overbuilt market, especially in the retail side, and especially in the office side. And it's a little different. The perimeter
is doing great, but the center city, there's lots of vacancies. So it's a different story depending on where you go. But the
other thing on the retail side is what I call the Amazon.com effect, is the fact that more shipments are being made by
mail and by the Internet, I think they've doubled since 2009. And so you're seeing that effect on the vacancy issues
around the retail space.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: When Art said perimeter, he's referring to the highway that runs in a ring essentially
around Atlanta. It's about a 60 mile-long highway around Atlanta. So that's where you're seeing some commercial
growth, rather than the internal kind of core part of the city.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it, guys. Thank you, Tom. Thanks, Art. Much appreciated.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Mark.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: A couple of follow-up questions actually on that last point. I might have missed it, but when you
talk about some of these factors that are underpinning the changes in retail and residential and commercial demand, can
you talk about maybe what your look forward is for 2015? And then I know you do a lot of work on your numbers and
that final kind of demand, not expecting that kind of a number, but what you see in your forecast and in your budgets
up to this point, and how that's going to impact 2015 versus 2014 so far?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, and again, it's going to be a function of the economy, as it always is. And we don't
want to get out in front of where we're going to be in February. We'll talk more robustly in February when we have our
realized numbers. But if you go back to the 2014 forecast for 2014 to 2016, it was roughly a 1% growth, maybe a little
stronger than that as you move through the year 2016. But again, we redo that every year and we'll comment more on
that in February about our new look.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And without regard to the future, this year our plan was based on 0.7% retail sales, and it's
1%.

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Okay. And just a quick one on Southern Power. Obviously Solar has been in the headlines and
you've had some nice progress there so far this year. I'm just wondering, given where in-generation economics have
moved for a lot of people this year, have you seen any interesting gas projects that you'd be considering, or is that sort
of lower priority at this point?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, we actually think there are some on the shelf. I want to kind of lay low on that. But
you want to know, a really good kind of target audience for us with respect to those projects are co-ops and municipal
utilities. We have a great track record of serving them here in the Southeast. I would bet you 40 years ago they were
kind of the enemy, and now they are great partners and they're wonderful people, and we've gotten along great and
produced I think really good business results for them and us. And I think our reputation is preceding us, and I think we
have around the United States more prospects to do more such deals with other co-ops and munis in the United States
away from the Southeast. So I think there will be some opportunity there.
And I'll tell you something else. You know that outside the Southeast in the United States, may presume that we're in
the so-called organized markets. Our business models will remain the same. Long-term bilateral contracts, creditworthy
counterparties, no fuel risk, no transmission risk. That's the way we like to do them.

Our next question is from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been covered. I just wondered if we could
discuss the Sanmen Nuclear Project in China and just, generally interested in your thoughts on progress there, lessons
learned for the U.S. Or sort of, as you look at execution risk in China, how has that project been going?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, we've had people that live in China that kind of work around that site, and we have
teams of people that regularly visit Sanmen to bring back those learnings. I will bet you, I don't know, I'd love to see
what [ph] Buzz's (59:50) opinion is here. Something like, I'll bet you 60% of what they do is applicable to what we do.
We are different than them as in the degree of automation, particularly in welding practices. They tend to use a lot more
manpower, we tend to use a lot more automation, and it's worked pretty well. We kind of believe that they're going to
be in service sometime late 2015, and as they commission that plant, that'll be very helpful. The other thing that has
been helpful to us is some – they are dealing with some issues with the vendor, for example, the design of reactor
coolant pumps. And I think as they resolve those problems that will enure to our benefit.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. One, Art, can you remind us through the nine
months how much equity you've issued so far this year?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes. We're right at $500 million through September 30.
<Q - Ali Agha>: If I heard you right, you may cross the close to $600 million by the time the year is over?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, but it's not going to be significant.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And then can you also remind us on a normalized basis what's the O&M base we should be
thinking about for you guys and the growth rate of that going forward?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Ali, I think what we outlined for this year is that we'd be in the – if you look at total
Southern, we'd be just over $4 billion and I think we're going to be very close to that number if we spend what we're
going to spend and as we move forward I'd say a 3% growth rate, maybe 2% – maybe 3% to 3.5%. 2% of that would be
– or 2.5% might be just core and the other 1% would be related to environmental. Environmental O&M as we start up
all these environmental projects that adds a different layer of O&M to the core amount.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And then my third question, can you remind us why was Southern Power down so significantly
quarter-over-quarter in the third quarter? And then related to that when we put in the Solar Gen 2 project, in the past, I
don't know, Tom, you talked about the run rate of net income for Southern Power around the $170 million a year level.
How should we now think of that with the portfolio changes going forward?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, Ali, I think what I said, and we actually checked this in preparation of this call. I
think I gave a range, didn't I, of about $145 million to $175 million, somewhere around there. And I think we're going
to end the year at the upper end of that range.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And why was it down?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, why was it down? It benefited from solar revenues this year, additional plants and
things versus last but there was some particularly high depreciation expense related to new plant and service. There was
a slight change in the methodology; went to a units of production method of depreciation that also caused some delta
and then we did some major outage work at one of our units where we had to really catch up on some accelerated
retirements just due to the accounting issues related to that one particular plant and that really drove a lot of expense
into Q3 of this year versus last and that's why it's down quarter-to-quarter.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And, Tom, to be clear, are you suggesting that one, call it $170 million, $175 million run rate,
is that a good run rate going forward as well? Or does that change with the Solar Gen 2 and other activity that you've
done there?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So, if I recall kind of the forward curve, Southern Power in the near-term has a decent run
rate, kind of $160 million to $170 million, something like that. It certainly picks up, what you have as kind of a filler.
We have contracted capacity that picks up again at a certain timeframe. So at the end of the decade, it goes up into the
200s. But for now, I think it's a decent assumption. And certainly we'll update you in February on that.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Got it. Got it. Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes sir. Thank you.

<Q - David A. Paz>: Can you hear me?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes. We can now.
<Q - David A. Paz>: Okay. This is David Paz for Steve Fleishman. Just a quick question, Tom. Going back to Vogtle,
do you expect a, is there a timeline for when you get a new schedule for post 2015?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, it's under consideration right now. They are rebaselining and what they're working
hard on is – see what you always kind of work on here is – you have heard that they have had some challenges out of
their Lake Charles facility. And so the consortium is working hard on mitigating whatever challenges that they see,
certainly with respect to the schedule. And they're obligated to meet that schedule to us via the contract. So one of the
things that we meet with them on, when I say that Asherman and Roderick and the pertinent members of Toshiba get
together, it is to give us the new schedule. Right now they know they have a commercial responsibility to fulfill and so
we look forward to seeing how they're going to do that. So that's kind of it. I don't have a timeframe in which we will
see a new schedule, but I can tell you that is a topic of current conversation.

Our next question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP Capital. Please proceed.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Vedula.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: Hey. Good afternoon, Tom.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: Let's see, earlier during the call you referenced your tax appetite. I'm wondering if you can both,
in the cumulative sense, give a of sense what you're cumulative tax appetite is and kind of like the options in which you
are looking at in order to optimize that and whether the optimization of that balance has been considered as part of your
forward views that you have provided us in the past.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, when you say tax appetite, a lot of it varies on bonus depreciation or not, right? So
the number is going to swing around a good bit. Absent kind of an extension of bonus depreciation, our number would
imply an investment appetite of over $2.5 billion, okay? So to the extent you get bonus depreciation passed, it could
subtract – in its current form, if we got current bonus depreciation extended again, it would probably take away about
$1 billion of that over at $2.5 billion number. And I'm being very general here because there's a lot of uncertainty with
respect to how these things will manifest themselves. But that would be a decent working number for you to think
about.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: And in terms of the way to utilize a lot of these tax deferrals and everything like that, usually I
think you're implying earlier about taxable income creation or acquisition in order to optimize utilization of various
renewable credits and those types of things. Can you spend a little bit on that if I understood you properly? Or how we
should think about that?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I'm not sure, Vedula. What that basically says is in normal circumstances, Southern
Company is a taxpayer, and our kind of cash tax rate, not our book taxes but our cash tax rate is reasonably high, to the
extent we get bonus depreciation or something else that serves to reduce our effective cash tax rate. I think right now,
this year, I'm going to say our effective cash tax rate is around 7% or 8%. So there's still a little bit of headroom.

It's those kinds of factors, so my sense is when you look at our normal business, we don't have significant tax deferral
items in play. So letting the system run on its own, we become a full taxpayer. That gives rise to the $2.5 billion, $2.60
billion investment opportunity, given the extension of investment tax credit for solar and wind and everything else. To
the extent that moves from a 30% number to a 10%, an ITC number, then your investment opportunity, your appetite
actually goes up.
So there's a lot of swing here. What I've tried to do is outline – what I like is Caveman Math. Under current
circumstances, without an extension, you are somewhere in the $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion investment opportunity range.
Obviously that could swing.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: And these are all cash items? This doesn't affect what we end up seeing on the GAAP financial
statements? This is all cash flow items in terms of how these think swing, correct?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, in terms of calculating tax appetite, that's right. Ultimately, there is a booking
impact, such as Art described on Solar Gen 2.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: Okay. And if next week or whatever, with the elections, if the Republicans get the Senate, you're
particularly talking about bonus depreciation extension or whatever. If – like I said, if that comes to pass, given the
folks that you talk to, what do you think is reasonable or feasible that could occur that's relevant to your business that
you'd like?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, that's just pure speculation. My sense is, you're going to see some sort of extender
build whether the Democrats hold the Senate or whether the Republicans get it. Whether it's a permanent, whether it's a
two-year, whether you'll extend out kind of the provisions related to wind and solar, my sense is whichever party gets
the Senate, you're going to see something. That would be my guess. It just – it may also depend on how comprehensive
they want to go, and therefore what the timing will be of the implementation of that.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: All right. Thank you, Tom, and hopefully I'll see you in Dallas.

Our next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to hit on Kemper, two questions. One is, you
kind of gave a risk of I guess the schedule each month, the cost that shareholders could bear. I just want to know, is
there any regulatory risk associated with I guess that seven-year settlement that paid the gasifiers not in service. Was
that part of the settlement that that had to be in service by a certain date? And the second question I guess is, when do
we get through the forest here? Is there a point in the schedule where – if there's a gasifier goes online and that's when
we could exhale? Or another point in time where we know the bad – the write-offs are behind us?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, it does not include anything for the settlement, the grand proposal we're working
on. And certainly, there is risk in that. I can't say that there's not. What I can say about the settlement agreement, we
continue to have productive discussions, but I can't predict the outcome of those discussions. What was the other thing
you wanted?
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: I wanted to know like...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: When are we going to get first gas through the gasifier? When is that?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: It's not scheduled until July of...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Summer of...

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Summer of 2015. That will be a big deal. What we'll provide you in EEI is essentially a
chart that will lay out, kind of, three clumps, three segments of risk. One is all the milestones that we need to
accomplish before we get gas to the turbines. And then kind of, once we get gas to the turbines, what are the milestones
following that? And like again, I think we're looking at summer of 2015 for that event to occur. That's kind of what I
would say in a broad sense. We'll have more detail for you, actually it's handouts I think, in Dallas.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Just lastly I guess with the gasifier, and you think of that seven-year global settlement,
how much of that – I guess, what's in a rate base or what is being recovered in rates, is related to the gasifier?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, we have rates in place, an 18% increase, associated with a $2.4 billion total capital
investment that we earn on. There are securitization bonds that to take us to $2.88 billion. Those are all represented by
rates. It's hard to say, if you wanted to segment out what is currently part of a combined cycle, I would say something
like, $1 billion, $900 million to $1 billion, somewhere around there, of the $2.88 billion. Round numbers again.

Our next question is from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC. Please proceed.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Kit. How are you?
<Q - Kit Konolige>: I'm doing well. How about you, Tom?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Great.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Just thought – a lot of my questions have been answered. I thought I'd inquire about your interest
in the pipeline business. As you say, you burn a lot of gas in your power plants, Utility and Southern Power, and a
couple of the big companies around you next year into Florida and Duke and Dominion have talked about the Atlantic
Coast pipeline. How do you look at the pipeline business as far as your forward book of business goes?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet. So it's interesting. We actually go through a process that's pretty disciplined,
pretty rigorous here. Whenever we think about different companies or different lines of business, and frankly, we just
covered this with our board a week ago in our off-site kind of strategy board meeting, and the way I tend to think about
it is kind of the red/yellow/green chart. So green for us would be an integrated regulated electric utility with make,
move, and sell elements within that. Yellow, to me, would be things like a gas pipeline. It has kind of a similar
risk-return characteristic. It is not necessarily something we know and have – in depth – and that we have decades of
experience with like we do with others, but it is certainly something we would consider.
You're right. When people think about Southern Company, you'll run into it from time to time, people think we're a big
coal company. We're still big, but rest assured that Southern Company, I think, is the third-largest consumer of natural
gas in the United States. Gas is a part of our future. It will become increasingly important. And so therefore it makes
sense for us to consider gas-oriented investments along the way. So, Kit, it's something we absolutely would consider.

<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Tom, quick question for you. On page twelve of your handout, you show that your Q3
gas combined cycle capacity factor is up to 76% versus 68%. Non-PRB is up 44% versus 40%. Where do you see your
capacity factor for gas going into the fourth quarter, and where do you think you'll end up for the year? Because it's
been quite a turnaround as natural gas prices have come down, right?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, it sure has. I mean, Greg, you're all over it. I think it just depends on kind of what the
weather holds and everything else. But we're seeing sub-$4 gas right now. You're going to see pretty strong
performance by our combined cycle fleet over time. Some time...
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Do you think you'll be at or above the 66% capacity factor you ended the year at last year at the
rate you're currently running?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Pure guess, yes.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Awesome. Hope you're well.
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: Well, getting a little long in the tooth on this call, though. But we appreciate you taking the time,
Tom. Definitely do.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Listen, it's always our pleasure.
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: Just to make sure, because I think when you said this, I didn't hear it correctly. You said that stuff
came out right I think when it was being discussed, but what did you say about rebaselining in the consortium? Did you
say you were expecting them to come back with rebaselining? I just...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Oh, sure. The question, I think, I forget who even asked it, but somebody asked the right
question and that is that in fact the consortium SCANA talks about it, they're coming back from us, they're coming
back to us with schedules that will meet our in-service dates. And in talking with senior management, we believe that
can be done. Now in order for that to be done, they have had a lack of performance, particularly in the Lake Charles
facility, and so you're always in this position of mitigation, right?
So to the extent Lake Charles doesn't perform the way you wanted it to, what they'll do is essentially farm business out
as they have to Newport News, to make sure that we get the material and the documentation, I think was pointed out
appropriately, in a suitable manner. So the consortium is working hard to mitigate whatever operational challenges they
have. That has always been the case. We believe they can mitigate to the extent they preserve our in-service dates.
That's all that is. That's an ongoing process.
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: So I guess, again from what I think you're saying is, either you stay on schedule, and costs to stay
on schedule could potentially go higher to stay on schedule, or costs could not go up as much, and the timeline would
slip? Is that the way to think about it?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, here's the way I would think about it. You get into – they're going to provide us a
schedule that mitigates any problems they have, so that they can abide by the contract we have, which is essentially a
fixed-price turnkey contract. Okay? I wouldn't be surprised that they try to issue change orders to that effect. But
whether or not we accept the change orders depends on what caused the delay or whatever. If it is their own

performance, it's for their account. If it is because the NRC did something which made them do something different,
then that would be a change order that we would likely accept. Right now, we believe that they are bound to deliver a
plant in service, and we believe they can deliver it, and we look forward to their meeting their obligations under the
contract. And like I say, we have good constructive conversations with these folks.
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: And when do you think we should – you should hear from them, and then us hear from you?
Would that be in the fourth quarter, or would that be sometime in 2015?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, man, we're having conversations with them right now. And I think the other thing I
tried to suggest, I hope I wasn't too obscure when I did it, I was talking about the consortium in respect of the
commercial dispute. And I said it isn't just between us and the consortium. There in effect is a – in my words, I mean,
you know. But there is a relationship, an inter-creditor agreement, whatever, there is a sharing agreement within the
consortium among and between Westinghouse and CVI, overwritten by Toshiba. So to the extent there are commercial
obligations that the consortium has to fulfill, they have to decide as partners how they're going to fulfill that. That really
doesn't have anything to do with us.
It's those issues which have to be worked out, which complicates the delivery to us of a fully mitigated schedule. We
continue to work constructively on it, and we look forward to that happening in the next few months or so. I can't
guarantee you a date in which we will get a fully mitigated schedule, but we're working on it.
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: Got it. And then just back on an earlier question as well with the same subject matter, just – but
kind of going back in time, so on the original dispute between Westinghouse, CVI and your group, what exactly is
going on now? Are there actually talks going on or is there an arbitrator, or are we kind of just in the court stage that's
going to take a while? Or can you give us any update on that? Because I guess CVI seemed to suggest on their call,
again, it was just kind of a one-liner that things hadn't moved along anywhere on that or were not going anywhere.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, look, what I can say is this. We're in litigation mode. So in other words, we're going
through periods of discovery. We're taking depositions. I can get you detail on when we think the hearings will begin
and all that. And of course, that's all subject to a judge ruling on certain matters. Where the venue is, Augusta, Georgia.
That's where we are. At the same time, parallel activity, we are having settlement discussions with the consortium, and
they're very cordial. So this is not bomb throwing and missile launching. This is good constructive talk. And I'm trying
to convey that it's not just us and them, it's them and them with us.
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: I understand. So basically there are talks going on, but at the same time parallel – the court
process continues, and it could take some time...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. Look, we...
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: ...quite some time to play out. Is that fair?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right. Sure.
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And we'd love to settle today. But we're also prepared to go to litigation unless we get a
settlement that is desirable for the benefit of our customers.
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: And then just as far – I'm sorry. I apologize.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No, go ahead.
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: And then just as far as the cost for that or any rebaseline, just understand that's something that
would be negotiated, it sounds like, based on your contract between CVI and Westinghouse, and your position right
now at this stage is that you're not willing – wow, I don't want to negotiate on the telephone, but basically we should
expect those two to be paying that difference, at least that's your position at this point. Is that fair? I mean there is some
big dollars involved...

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: My only point is, it's pretty clear, it's in public knowledge, that there have been some
challenges with material coming out of Lake Charles, and as a way to help mitigate their challenges in fulfilling their
obligations under the contract, they've enlisted sub-contractors, for example, Newport News. To the extent they're able
to perform, my sense is they're going to be able to hit on in-service dates and everybody's going to be happy with the
ultimate outcome. That's where we believe we are right now.
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: Yes. It's just kind of the dollars involved and who's going to eat those dollars, and I guess CVI
doesn't have as much flexibility, obviously as Westinghouse or Southern Company or your – or people within your
group. So...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, Andy, I think we need to – you know, I'm not going to go there on...

<Q - Dan Jenkins>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Dan.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: So first, I just have a clarification on what you said a little bit ago about Kemper. I think you
mentioned July 15 is when you're looking for syngas to go to the gasifier. Is that what I heard?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's a good general date. I wouldn't get that precise, but yes. That's our target.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: So is that the same as first syngas production that you were talking about on your slide from last
quarter's?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: Okay. Then I also had a couple of clarification questions on your Vogtle construction update on
page five of the presentation. I'm just trying to get a sense of timing for the near-term items and those items you expect
to occur in 4Q, or what's the timing kind of related to the cooling tower and for Unit 4 for the CA04 and CB65? Is that
before yearend? Or how should we think about that?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Dan, I think the CA01 module is first quarter next year. We should complete the cooling
tower in the fourth quarter of this year and then as far as Unit 4, we certainly should do in the fourth quarter, setting
CA04 and CB65, I think that's where we are.

At this time there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?
Thomas A. Fanning
Yes, sir. Thank you all for being on the call. Thank you for being loyal shareholders. I'm disappointed with our

The project team there understands the intensity of my focus. Other than Kemper, I would say that the franchise is
