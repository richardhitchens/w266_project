MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. My name is John, and I'll be your operator for today's
call. [Operator Instructions] Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is
being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Ms. Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Gasper, you may begin.
Barbara L. Gasper
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for a discussion about our first quarter 2013
financial results. With me on the call today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Martina
Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce
your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask a
question.
This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor
Relations section of our website at mastercard.com. These documents have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed
with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for one week through May 8.
Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include
some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially

summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filing.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajay Banga. Ajay?
Ajaypal Singh Banga
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we reported net revenue growth of 8% or 9% after adjusting
for currency. And this, combined with operating expense growth of 6%, helped drive our EPS growth of 16% or 17%
on an FX-adjusted basis. This quarter's performance was in line with our expectations, which took into account last
year's strong first quarter as well as the mixed global economic environment, both things that Martina and I have been
talking about for a while.
So let's start at the U.S. Consumer spending started out the year, rebounding from what was a weak holiday season at
the end of last year, but started to cool in February as consumers adjusted to higher payroll taxes, to some inflation in
food and gas prices, as well as the effects of late season winter storms in March. I think these factors contributed to
consumer confidence levels fluctuating over the quarter.
Our first quarter spending pulse data mirrored these trends, showing that U.S. retail sales ex-auto grew by only 2.6% in
the first quarter this year compared to 3.9% in the fourth quarter of last year and 7.4% in the first quarter of last year.
So you could see the declining trend in these U.S. retail sales ex-auto. Much of this deceleration is attributable to
slower consumer spending, but of course some of it is also the result of the leap year comparison as well as
comparisons against a strong first quarter in 2012, when an early spring helped boost retail sales growth to that 7.4%
number I just talked about.
Overall, our U.S. business reflected these mixed conditions. First quarter processed transactions and GDP growth were
lower than what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2012. And looking ahead, recent positive news about the strengthening
U.S. housing market, which as we've been talking about has been going on for a few quarters, could be a good signal
that the economy is turning, but we're going to watch, and the second half of 2013 will be the test of that.
Now Europe, the environment in Europe remains similar to what we saw last quarter. Both the economic situation and
our business there can best be described as a tale of two regions, developed versus emerging. The Eurozone in the U.K.
developed, so retail sales growth slowed despite improvements in consumer confidence and in business sentiment. And
MasterCard's business in these markets reflected that slowing growth trend, still growing but slower than the past. We
also experienced some slowdown in growth in the eastern European countries Poland and Russia, but this slowing was
more of a function of the denominator based on the expanding size of that market rather than the real decline in
economic drivers.
MasterCard's total Europe in volume growth was in the low-teens, a little bit lower than the last couple of quarters, but
still pretty good as the secular shift away from cash accompanied by a continuing growth in share helped overcome the
headwinds from economic uncertainty.
In Asia, indicators show that consumer confidence and business sentiment were on the rise in the majority of markets.
And as a result, consumer spending and retail sales in some of the major markets are picking up. Australia's projecting
economic acceleration, but on the other hand, views on the outlook for China's economic growth are currently mixed.
As you know, China will be impacted by any deterioration in the European economy. Europe is one of the largest
trading partners, and that, of course, has potential implications for the broader Asian economy. Having said all of that,
our business in Asia-Pacific remained at healthy levels, similar to the past several quarters.
In Latin America, growth projections from Brazil and Mexico indicated a slight improvement over 2012 lower levels of
economic growth. Consumer sentiment was mixed across the region, with Brazil at its lowest levels in three years,
while Mexico is bouncing up against five-year highs. Overall, our business in Latin America saw transaction and
volume growth in the mid-teens, similar to the past two quarters.

So looking ahead to the rest of the year of 2013, we're still maintaining the same cautious outlook we've talked about
for a while. Europe's economic picture remains mixed. Uncertainty will likely continue there for the near future. In the
U.S., the second quarter right now looks a little bit dodgy, but there could be some upside going into the second half of
2013 as far as U.S. economic growth is concerned. Economic growth rates in Asia-Pacific and Latin America have
softened a little versus the past couple of years. From the ground, there is still a great deal of energy.
So with all of that as a backdrop, our focus remains clear. We are still focusing on our strategy to displace cash to
increase our share of electronic payments. So before we move on to recent business highlights, I know there have been
some recent news reports about European regulatory matters, so let me quickly get a few words about those.
First, as for the investigation launched by the European Commission in early April, based upon what the Commission
has told us and stated publicly, we do not believe that the investigation is about our network fees. Rather, we
understand that it is about our interregional interchange fees that are paid by EU merchants, as well as our cross-border
acquiring and point-of-sale acceptance rules, including the Honor All Cards rule. The Commission had already
launched a similar investigation on Visa's interregional interchange fees.
Second, in terms of the Commission's plan to announce proposed legislation related to card payments within the EU by
summer, we have no new insight to offer you either about the timing or the potential components of that proposal. As
you probably know, the EC has publicly said that it plans to propose legislation during June.
So now let me move on to some of our recent business activity. We are continuing to work on improving our U.S.
Consumer Credit business where we are winning new deals with more in the pipeline. This effort will be a slow, steady
build from what I shared with you last quarter. And this quarter, to add to some of the wins we had from last quarter,
I'm pleased to report that Bank of America recently launched a new consumer credit card, called Better Balance
Rewards, which provides consumers cash back for responsible payment practices. This is the first Bank of America
product other than a co-brand that is exclusive to us at MasterCard.
In Canada, TD Bank, a long-time customer of one of our competitors, has now launched their very first TD-branded
MasterCard product, a credit card that also has cash-back rewards. And we're continuing momentum in the commercial
space. In the U.S., we continue to work in corporate T&E, with issuing partners such as Bank of America, Citibank,
Capital One and HSBC, where we've signed both large and small deals across a number of industries.
The government of Canada is converting their travel and expense program to MasterCard early next year. The win
builds in our current partnership with Bank of Montreal for the Canadian government's purchasing power card program
that started years ago in 2004. In Latin America, there are a couple of examples from Colombia in the micro business
commercial space. Bancolombia chose us to help them develop a micro business credit card program which includes
things like credit risk modeling. We also won Bancamía's micro business debit card program, which includes a flexible
insurance package customized for that market segment.
We've launched a number of new travel, eCommerce and affluent programs around the world, which will continue to
aim to enhance the cross-border component of our business. So I'll give you a few examples. In Australia, Qantas will
upgrade its Frequent Flyer program cards to enable prepaid functionality. This feature will be available to all its nine
million Australian-based members. In addition to the existing functions, this Qantas cash card will now allow members
to load money, withdraw cash and foreign currency from ATMs as well as earn Frequent Flyer points from purchases
made at MasterCard-accepting locations.
And in March we signed a MoU with Alibaba Group, Asia's largest eCommerce company, to establish an enhanced
eCommerce environment that we think will benefit consumers and small businesses both within and outside of China.
This MoU has many potential opportunities, including making the MasterPass wallet available to Alipay's 800 million
users, providing the ability to offer virtual card numbers for online payments, giving Alibaba's 6 million merchants the
ability to acquire MasterPass payments and providing Alibaba with fraud and risk management tools.
Rakuten, Japan's largest eCommerce shopping site and the second largest online retailer in Asia, launched a service
which will provide their Japanese Rakuten credit card holders access to virtual MasterCard prepaid cards that can be
used to shop online safely and securely. A new prepaid program for Chinese tourists traveling to the U.S. is being

launched this spring through a company called Oriental Tours, a China-based travel company. MasterCard prepaid
cards can be loaded in advance with U.S. dollars through Western Union outlets in China and then picked up from the
tour company when you get here to the U.S. This program will be available to an estimated 600,000 Chinese tourists
annually.
And we've got a number of affluent launches around the world. I'll give you a few. In Canada, CIBC launched two
World Elite programs, one travel, one cash back. In France, Crédit Mutuel is converting their platinum portfolio to
World Elite. In Mexico, Banca Mifel launched World Elite as their new top-tier consumer credit product. In addition,
Citibank launched their Citi Prestige program in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore and the U.S.
And most interestingly in South Africa, Nedbank, one of the four largest banks in the country and a long-time key top
customer of one of our competitors is now converting the bulk of their entire business to MasterCard. Nedbank will
also be issuing our Platinum and Gold cards for the first time. When this win is fully implemented, we will become the
market leaders in South Africa.
On the mobile front, we continue with our efforts to develop partnerships with mobile network operators around the
world. We've now got relationships with over 30, with a combined reach of 1.3 billion people in 28 countries. So, a few
examples of some of these recent mobile deployments. We've now launched MasterPass in Australia and Canada and in
the U.S. In the U.S. alone, currently a 100 merchants are now able to accept MasterPass.
We're partnering with banks around the world, Westpac and Commonwealth Bank in Australia, Bank of Montreal in
Canada, Citi, Fifth Third and several credit unions in the U.S., and the launch of MasterPass in the U.K. is on track.
We're aiming for the end of summer and we hope to be available in at least nine other countries by the end of this year,
meaning a total of 13 by the end of 2013.
MasterCard and VimpelCom, with telecommunications provider with over 200 million subscribers in 18 countries
around the world, recently announced a strategic partnership. We expect the first deployment end of 2013. Wind Italy,
a VimpelCom division and Italy's third largest mobile operator, will now enable subscribers to pick up a prepaid card at
one of Wind's retail stores, link it to the mobile phone and then use apps on the phone to top up the prepaid card, pay
bills, purchase additional air time.
And building on our partnership with Telefónica in Latin America, we've now launched two more initiatives with
Telefónica this past quarter, this time both in Europe. The first is in the Mobile PayPass program in the Czech
Republic; the second is in O2 branded wallet in Germany.
And finally, one of the largest banks in Indonesia, Bank Negara Indonesia, launched a mobile payments program that
also leverages our in control platform. For the first time, this bank's nine million debit MasterCard cardholders can
shop online, thanks to virtual card numbers which we'll give them on demand through their mobile banking
applications.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial results and our operational
metrics.
Martina Hund-Mejean
Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on page three of our slide deck, where you see the as
reported as well as the FX-adjusted growth rates. All of my comments pertain to the FX-adjusted figures, which as you
can see this quarter are almost the same as the as reported numbers.
As Ajay said, we are pleased with our performance this quarter, given the tough comps we were up against from the
first quarter of last year and the relatively choppy economic environment. Net revenue growth of 9%, combined with
operating expense growth of 6%, supported our net income growth of 13%. EPS growth of 17% also benefited from
our share repurchase program. Cash flow from operations was $872 million and we ended the quarter with cash, cash
equivalents and other liquid investments of about $5 billion.

During the first quarter, we repurchased about 1.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $766 million. Through
April 25, we repurchased a little more than 340,000 shares at a cost of $182 million, and now we have about $1.7
billion remaining under the current authorization. We will continue to look to repurchase shares on an opportunistic
basis.
So let's turn to page four, where you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar
volume or GDV was up 12% on a local currency basis. U.S. GDV grew 4%, with credit volumes growing 2%. U.S.
commercial credit growth was in the low-teens and slowed somewhat from last quarter as we have left a couple of
deals. U.S. consumer credit growth remains slightly negative, similar to last quarter. Our U.S. debit growth slowed to
6% as we have now fully lapped our signature debit wins in a large seasonal program expected to decline versus last
year.
Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 16% on a local currency basis, and this continues to be driven by APMEA
with more than 20% growth and a solid double-digit growth in Europe and in Latin America. Per quarter volume grew
16% on a local currency basis, including more than 20% in Latin America and APMEA and growth in the high-teens in
Europe.
So let me turn to page five. On here, you see processed transactions grew just over 12%. As expected, this deceleration
from the fourth quarter was mainly driven by the lapping of our processing wins from new PIN debit transactions in the
U.S. and the effect of leap year. After considering the start of the lapping of the U.S. PIN debit wins as well as
normalizing for the effect of the leap year, our underlying growth rate was about 11%. And globally, the number of
cards grew 8% to 1.9 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards.
Let's turn to page six for some insights on a couple of our revenue line items. Again, I will be talking only about the
FX-adjusted figures. Domestic assessments grew 8% while worldwide GDV grew 12%. The gap between these two
growth rates is 4 ppt, which is driven primarily by the contribution of higher growth outside the U.S. with lower than
average revenue yields. Cross-border fees grew 14% while cross-border volumes grew 16%. Similar to last quarter, the
primary reason for this difference was a higher mix of intra-Europe activity, which comes with a lower revenue yield.
Transaction processing fees grew 9%, driven mainly by the 12% growth in processed transactions I just spoke about.
The gap between these two growth rates can be attributed mainly to U.S. PIN debit transactions that come at a
lower-than-average revenue yield.
So I'm moving to look at the components of total operating expenses on page seven. The increase in G&A expense was
primarily driven by the impact of higher compensation cost as a result of the increase in a number of employees
compared to the same time last year to support our growth initiative. And the slight increase in advertising and
marketing expense was mainly due to the impact of new and renewed sponsorship.
Turning to slide eight, let me discuss what we had seen for the second quarter through April 28. Globally, our
cross-border volumes grew about 15%, slightly lower than what we saw in the first quarter. This is primarily driven by
slower growth in Europe and Latin America. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 6% up from our first quarter
growth due to improvements in both debit and prepaid. Our U.S. credit growth remained about the same as what we
saw in the first quarter.
Processed volume growth outside the U.S. grew about 14%, equal to what we saw in the first quarter. In particular, our
European processed volume growth was in the low-teens, similar to what we saw in the first quarter. And globally, our
processed transaction growth was 8%. That's down from 12% that we saw in the first quarter, driven by the full lapping
of our U.S. PIN debit wins and merchant routing decisions that began last April. We expect our transaction growth for
the entire second of quarter to be closer to our normalized growth rate of 10% to 11% as the impact of these merchant
routing decisions from April 2012 settle out.
Looking forward, let me start with our long-term performance objective. We continue to remain confident that our
business can deliver an 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR and at least 20% EPS CAGR over the 2013 to 2015 period.
These growth rates are on a constant currency basis and exclude any new acquisitions. We also remain committed to
our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. And as we said several times in the past, based on our current view

of the economic environment, we expect that net revenue and EPS growth in the early part of this three-year period
might be slightly below the 11% minimum for net revenue growth and 20% EPS growth. In later years, assuming the
world returns to a more stable environment, we believe net revenue growth could be at the higher end of the range. And
that could also benefit EPS growth in that particular period.
I just want to reiterate one other comment about our EPS CAGR objective, which we said was based on a normalized
tax rate that excludes the impact of several one-time benefits that we were able to achieve in 2012. So our 2012
normalized tax rate of 31.8% would have resulted in a pro forma EPS of $21.44, which becomes the base on which you
should be modeling EPS growth beyond 2012. I think most people are clear on this point, but I wanted to mention it
again for those who might be newer to the MasterCard story.
Now, I would like to share with you a few specific thoughts about 2013, which really haven't changed from what we
had said on our year-end call back – our year-end call back in late January. We expect that income growth- I'm sorry,
let me start again on this one. We expect net revenue growth in the first half of 2013 to be below the 10.7% currency
adjusted rate that we saw in the second half of 2012. We expect the second half of 2013 to be slightly better than the
first half given our current view of the economic environment.
Given the complicated economic environment, we continue to spend on the right things to support our growth initiative
such as mobile, eCommerce and information services but are keeping a close eye on other more discretionary expenses.
As a result, we expect total 2013 operating expenses to grow a bit below the 8% currency adjusted growth rate we saw
in 2012. We expect to be able to deliver some operating margin expansion in 2013. The amount of any improvement
will depend on both top line growth and investment opportunities that may surface during the year. And for modeling
purposes, you should continue to assume a tax rate of roughly 31.8% for the remaining quarters of 2013.
With respect to FX, while it proved to be a slight headwind for us in Q1, we expect a tailwind of at most one
percentage point to as reported net revenue, net income and EPS growth for full year 2013. And this obviously assumes
that the euro continues to trade at the 131 level and the Brazilian real at the 198 level for the rest of the year.
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session.
Barbara L. Gasper
Thank you, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question-and-answer period. And in order to get to as many people
as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Yeah, good morning, everyone. Wanted to ask on rebates and incentives. They were
materially higher in the quarter than what I was expecting, both absolute and as a percentage of gross. As we look
through the year, was there a timing issue that inflated first quarter? And what should we expect that pattern to look
like through the rest of the year?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Craig, let me take this. I mean, first of all, I have to tell you that actually rebates and
incentives came in spot on, on our expectation. When I look at the consensus out there, the consensus seems to be
actually really spot on with what we expected. As you know, there are gyration some time to time and from quarter to
quarter really depending on when we signed new deals and renewed deals. In fact for this quarter, we had actually the
lapping of a new deal. And so, we actually got a little bit of a benefit from that, and that was the reverse in the last – in
the year ago quarter. So I'm not sure how to guide you other than to say what people have out there is pretty much spot
on with what we expect.

<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Okay. If I could just follow-up. The Alibaba announcement, you were talking about
MasterPass wallet possibly getting into, well, it was a very big number. I think you said 800 million users, which I
know is just the market size. But what's the economic value of getting those wallets out there?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Look Craig, it's actually – I'm not making money out of a fee from the wallet. That's the
big difference in our program. I don't want to charge consumers for the privilege of having this wallet, there's going to
be 150,000 wallets out there before we know what's going on. I don't want to be the one charging fees on it. I want to
make money from it when they use their wallet. So if they use their card or they use services that the wallet will
provide, that's when we'll make our money. So I'm not doing it based on how many users pick up the wallet.
It's really – to me, what Alibaba is, is a partnership that expands the distribution footprint of MasterPass wallets across
the 6 million merchants that Alibaba has. And as the ability to make it available to as many as 800 million users. They
are adding 300,000 users every month sort of, there is a whole new number there. But I don't know how many of them
will adopt it. We'll see.
But the merchant for 6 million, that will be a big distribution footprint expansion. In addition, they're going to use
virtual card numbers for the merchants to buy goods cross-border as well as within China, which has been a big
problem for them to be able to do thus far on eCommerce. And so, I believe that's going to help enormously with the
facilitation of that purchasing. And then, of course, we're going to work with Alibaba and so on in helping them with
fraud, security and the like. So it's got three components to it.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Chris Brendler from Stifel. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question on the U.S. debit business. Do you
think at this point we should start to see the more normal debit rates continue? And also is pressure on the yield relation
to PIN debit perhaps playing its way through here? And I have a follow-up as well, thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yeah, Chris, I mean, on the U.S. debit business, I think what you're seeing from the
numbers and then what I said about April, you're starting to see everything going more to normalized rates and to the
market growth. Right? I mean, we think from a volume, from a U.S. debit volume point of view, the market growth
will be around the 6% to 8% for the foreseeable future. That is kind of what we are trending to. And something very
similar you're actually seeing from a transaction processing point of view. And you have one more quarter to round out
and then you should really see us coming back to market.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Okay. Great. Thanks. And my follow-up is more of a strategic question. We are hearing a
lot of noise and mostly complaints about the U.S. EMV initiative. Is there anything you can sort of say to give issuers
and merchants a little more of an incentive. Why this is going to benefit them? I think a lot of merchants in particular
don't see much benefit from moving to EMV. It sounds like some merchants are actually thinking that the liability shift
is not much of an incentive. Can you just give me color there? Thanks.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: I think you're mixing up a couple of things. Let me just help a little bit put into context.
The liability shift is right now being discussed mostly with the ATM operators. That's where the conversation is
different from merchants. The objective of that was, people who had EMV cards from other parts of the world, when
they came to the U.S., which was still a mag-stripe environment, the level of fraud was much higher. Fraudsters will
move to where the security and protection is the weakest in the chain.
EMV is clearly the higher security protocol than mag-stripe. All we're trying to do is ensure that card consumers who
were traveling from the other parts of the world when they come to the U.S. do not have experiences that make them
feel that their cards are not safe. A number of the ATM operators and banks are actually quite comprehending of that.
A number of them are spending the effort and energy to get some of their ATMs upgraded.

In others what we're trying to do is to roll out a tool called fraud risk manager, which allows the ATM operator and the
issuer and the acquirer at the other end of the game to look at the risks involved in a EMV card coming to a mag-stripe
ATM and that helps them manage that risk.
My expectation is not, just to make clear, that people would like a tap, switch-on, on April 19th with tens of thousands
of ATMs switched. I never expected that. What I expect is that a roadmap that shows that in most places that tourists
travel where the frequency of utilization of ATM will be maximum but they will get the right experience with an EMV
enabled card. My expectation over a period of time most ATMs in the U.S. will switch. I just think it will take some
time. Because it will be the right thing to do for all the right reasons.
And I think it's connected a lot to the launch of EMV issued cards as well in the U.S. eventually. There will be a
timeframe that will all come together. We are starting with ATMs. It will move to the issuance of cards, this may take 2
years to 3 years to play out in its full form, and I understand that. But all we are trying to do here is protect consumers
who travel as well as ensure that banks overseas do not get unnecessary fraud experiences because this market has the
lowest ability to provide security protection based on mag-stripe versus EMV. That's what we're trying to do.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Thank you.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: I think we've had a very productive dialogue with a number of merchants and banks and
ATM providers. In all big changes like this, this is a very big change. In all big changes like this you will have people
pulling in different directions. Our job is to try and make them get the incentive to go and feel the importance of going
to the right level of security protocol. That's all we're trying to do.

Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Hey. Thanks, guys. So I just wanted to try and get a read on the overall tone and
message that you guys want us to be picking up on here. I mean, obviously, your guidance is unchanged which I think
is what people had expected but should we be reading any kind of nuance difference in your overall tone just in terms
of thoughts on the macro and the general outlook for the business?
I mean, it sounds pretty consistent with the past couple of quarters but just wanted to verify that you're still feeling
essentially exactly the same about the macro picture and its impact on your business now as you were a quarter or two
ago. Is that accurate or should we be feeling a little better or a little bit worse?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Accurate. Just, absolutely accurate. Everything we have said was, when we said second
half, we'll probably be a little better than the first half. That's kind of coming to where we part where we are right on
where we expected in the first quarter. I continue to believe that the second quarter, the U.S. economic growth will be
somewhat less than what people might be hoping for. I think that there's a lot of mixed sort of currents in the U.S.
between payroll taxes and all the moving parts there.
Although housing looks like it's better but if you look at spending pulse and if you look within spending pulse, it's
really interesting while earlier categories of everything that had to do with housing was going positive for the previous
four quarters. In the first quarter, out of the two categories to do with housing, one went slightly negative, one remained
positive. That's the first time in five quarters, that I saw that. But I expected some of that given that I think the first half
will move in and out a little. So no change in how I feel about where the economy is in the U.S., in Asia, in Latin
America and in Europe. No change at all.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Okay. Thanks for clarifying. And just can you give us a couple comments on your
reaction to the Chase-Visa deal? Is that something you guys might be interested in pursuing similarly with other
issuers? And just how you feel philosophically about giving one of your issuers the ability to negotiate interchange

directly with a merchant?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Well, we haven't done it. So philosophically you can figure out where my philosophical
stance is. The fact is that we're going to see how this thing goes in the marketplace, very early days. A lot depends on
how issuers and acquirers respond as well as how merchants respond. A bit like Durbin, I don't believe I have the need
or the pressure to do anything differently other than look at it strategically. We have the ability to offer a similar thing.
It's a white label capability existed for a long time. We could do it. I just haven't put on the tap. And so it is where it is
today. And that's what I am. Philosophically, I am unchanged from where I was before the Chase-Visa deal got
announced.

Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you. Good morning. So I had a question Martina on the domestic assessment revenue
line. When I look at that revenue line over GDV, it came down that the yields came down quite dramatically
year-over-year. And I was just wondering if it was all the mix shift that you talked about and kind of how we should
think about it going forward. Should we expect that decline year-over-year to kind of sustain itself as we move through
the quarters? Thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yeah, so, Sanjay, that is a very good question. really there are couple of things going
on. One is what I said is when you look at the mix of the growth of the business in the United States, it comes at higher
revenue yields versus the growth outside of the United States which does come at times with lower revenue yields
especially in some of the emerging markets. That's really contributing to that kind of differential. Now you have to
understand, domestic assessments are only one set of fees that we are actually charging in the market. You really have
to think about at very comprehensively and then those countries that we actually processing we obviously also get the
benefit of the processing fee. So that's one explanation.
The other explanation is in terms of what's happening from a cash utilization. So especially when you go in new
emerging markets and people are getting their cards, they predominantly start to go to the ATM first until we are
getting them used to actually going directly to POS. And the ATM fees that we typically get are lower than what you're
getting at the POS. So those are kind of the broad changes. So in terms of going forward, I do believe – it depends on
the mix. Right? It depends on how the U.S. grows versus our other markets are growing. But our current view has that
this kind of difference in terms of growth of the domestic assessment fees versus the volume, will persist for the rest of
the year.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Okay. Maybe just one quick follow-up for Ajay. I was just wondering strategically kind of
how you felt if Visa Europe were to exercise its put as kind of talked about in the market place and kind of what
implications does it have on your business? Thanks.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So I don't know what the latest news is. They were supposed to be deciding. It's been a
couple of days. So, I guess they're still thinking about it. I don't know. Maybe you guys know, you'll find out when you
talked to Visa today but my perspective is whether they go one way or the other. I think we've got to be as a company,
capable of handling both. So let me put it for you this way, if they exercise the put option, they're going have to go
through two or three things. One is integrating technology, people, systems, cultures.
From our own experience of doing that with MasterCard Europe and before that with Europay, the European – we are
working that technology, that association culture, merging that with a different culture, it's a reasonably preoccupying
time. The second part is that when you need to innovate, you need focus, you need time, you need attention, you need
management energy. If you kind of divert it to integrations, it makes it a little more difficult.

So I think that in the short to medium term, Visa would have to do all those things, they have the right things to do by
the way, if you're integrating something but it would provide us with our own space and opportunity along with the fact
that a number of the Visa-issuing banks, who may be waiting for the put option to be able to get some benefit one time,
they may well be in play after that once they've booked that relatively large benefit.
On the other hand, if they don't do it, then life carries on the way it is today and we think we're doing pretty well in
Europe and growing market share and growing our business at the both the cost of cash and at the cost of our
competitors. So life will continue in that form. So, I kind of think about our company as responding with focus on our
strategy. Either which way. Just keep plugging away at what we are doing in Europe. We're doing well, we want to
keep doing well.

Our next question comes from Bill Carcache from Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Carcache>: Thanks. Good morning. Ajay, I was hoping to follow-up on a comment that you made about
payroll taxes. I was wondering if there were any noteworthy observations relating to the impact of payroll tax increases
on the spending behavior among your customers in the U.S., particularly if you stratify the customers by income
segment? And then also could you talk about the potential for a near-term upside to numbers, to your earnings from the
staged digital wallet operator fees that are scheduled to kick into effect later in the year?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So two things. The staged digital wallet operator fee, as we said, it comes in later, but it's
a relative de minimis number for a company of our size and scope. So, in fact, a lot of the noise that is made around
how that fee was put in and why it was put in, focus on the economic impact to us and the wallet operators. I think that
is completely the wrong noise. It was more about the principals of creating the right rules and the right operating
methodology to allow us to operate with staged digital wallet operators. At any case, that number is in the plan, it's de
minimis, so who cares, that's small number.
The real issue here is the first question, which is about payroll taxes. I don't have a way, just as nobody else has, for
connecting payroll taxes directly to spending impact by segment or type. But I can watch different kinds of retail stores,
where people who are more likely to be impacted by small movements in their take home pay are shopping and I could
see that they were impacted by the payroll taxes. They didn't get impacted in the first time around, it's almost like they

didn't register how much the impact would be. By the time February came around, oh, boy, they have felt it. So, to give
you an example, spending pulse, ex-auto, January retail sales ex-auto, were actually pretty good. They were back –
pretty good meaning in this environment, 3-something percent.
You come to February, 0.8%. So it showed that that came right in their face. Whether there is only payroll taxes,
whether there is other issues as well, I have no individual way of segregating those impacts, but I'm kind of putting
them all together and then putting together anecdotal evidence from different types of stores and different types of
merchants and retailers whom I'm in contact with and giving that back to you.

Anyway, I was wondering if you could give us an update on your thoughts about Chinese market and what your
reaction is to China UnionPay coming here to issue prepaid cards? In the past you said you think it could be many,
many years before they open the market, but has that changed?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: No. I don't know if many, many years is what I said. What I said was that China
UnionPay has expansion plans around the world. They have been trying to expand for a number of years. They mostly
try and first start doing acceptance deals so that the Chinese users can get to use a China UnionPay card when they
travel as compared to the co-branded card with them is where our strongest partnership is and we're kind of the ones
who have been wining all the deals with them for the last two, three years. If that picks up momentum, it impacts the
growth rate of our cross-border business out of China.
But I haven't seen great differences there yet. I've seen acceptance grow and improve, but China is growing at such a
great rate on its expansion that I think that increment gets hidden in the wash. As far as their issuing prepaid cards in
the United States is concerned, what they're doing is issuing a prepaid card at Bancorp, which has to be then distributed
to other U.S. banks because Bancorp doesn't really have the branch network. And so other U.S. banks have to agree to
distribute this Bancorp-issued prepaid travel card for those people who want to buy it from here before they go to
China.
I don't know. We'll see. We'll see how that goes. But at the end of the day, there's a large business opportunity in
prepaid. I don't think this changes anything very much. I think China UnionPay will keep attempting to grow its
self-standing business, as I would in their shoes, while trying to keep working the partnership with us, which is what
we're doing. In the meantime the WTO judgment has happened. China has accepted that judgment. I'm expecting in a
few months that we will get clarity on the meaning of that acceptance. When we get clarity on that, we'll figure out how

to work our partnership with CUP. I met them in China last month. I met them in New York a couple of days ago. We
have got a great partnership and I'm still very happy with what I'm doing with them.
<Q - David S. Hochstim>: Thanks. Can I ask one follow-up?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Since you waited that long, go for it.
<Q - David S. Hochstim>: Thanks. Can you give us any thoughts about the prospects for some benefits in the U.S.
credit business from the emergence of the American Airlines from bankruptcy and from GM starting to do better? You
have a GM co-brand relationship?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Yeah, yeah, American Airlines, as you know, is already our co-brand.
<Q - David S. Hochstim>: Yep.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: And a large part of it is with us. GM is also there. I don't think people, in the case of GM
anyway, I don't think they spend more on that card based on how GM is doing. In the case with American Airlines, it's
without a doubt that a certain amount of American Advantage cards then goes towards the travel on American Airlines
flights, without a doubt. But it's only a certain amount. And I think that this utilization of these cards has a little less to
do with the parent company's performance as compared to how the consumer who holds that card is feeling about their
spending pattern and the like. That's a much bigger impact.
And so the bigger issue remains about the U.S. consumer and their spending pattern across segments. As I said in that
one, I'm still not convinced that the second quarter will be much better than the first quarter. I think I used the word
dodgy, but that's just a technical term to indicate that I'm not sure that U.S. economic growth in the second quarter will
be much better than the first. I do believe, however, that the second half of the year will be better.
We've got a number of wins that they're doing. But the U.S. credit business, our predominant business is with a certain
set of issuers who themselves are working their way through what has been a very complicated year for them, and a
few years for them. I am reliant on them in many ways, but I'm trying to build through co-brand wins and other wins.
You know, last quarter we told you about KeyBank. We told you about the InterContinental Hotel Group. We talked
about Bass Pro, we talked about a bunch of those, and the Shell Rewards card and the Fuel Rewards Network, and this
quarter we talked about Bank of America. We've got a bunch of things brewing on the commercial credit side. But this
is not something that will change in a dime unless a big flip happens, which I have no way to assure. So that's the
nature of our business.

Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Great, thanks. Just following-up on the question about the domestic assessments revenue. If
you look at what you said about the first quarter and then the month of April, it seems like that mix shift is kind of
continuing if kind of U.S. volumes accelerated but credit was kind of flat with the first quarter. Is that a fair way to
think about it that is -that's what's actually going on, that that further shift into debit if credit is kind of flat? And, again,
that would seem to be somewhat of a weakening because obviously the leap year effect doesn't hurt you until the
second quarter.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Moshe, on domestic assessment, what the big issue was is between what the growth
that we're seeing in U.S. versus the growth that we're seeing actually outside of the United States. And that mix effect,
both from a POS point of view as well as how people are using their cards at ATM, especially emerging markets, I did
say that we will continue to see that growing for the rest of the year. You will see that differential from a growth
perspective between the fees and the volume for the rest of the year.

<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Just one thing I want to make sure I didn't here you wrong, you said something about the
leap year effect impacting us in the second quarter of the year.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: No.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Actually...
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Right. No. What I said, Ajay, was that you said that the U.S. credit was kind of flat with the
performance in the first quarter.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Right.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yes.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: That the first quarter was impacted by that so the second quarter would be somewhat
weaker, correct?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: No. What we – no. What we actually said is that our process volume fees, the U.S.
process volume fees in the second quarter is actually higher at 6%, and we said it's mostly driven by debit and prepaid.
And we did say that credit, the credit growth is very similar to what we saw in the first quarter.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: We said processed volume, not processed volume fee.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Yes. Processed volume.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yes. Processed volume.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: That's correct. And I also continue to believe that the second quarter in the U.S. will be
less than clearly predictable on CCE and consumer spending. That's kind of what I'm trying to tell you. I'm actually not
believing that you should read any more into it than that.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Okay. I guess I would have thought that some of the stuff in terms of tax refunds and the like
would have provided a little bit of a tailwind into Q2.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: You could see that a little bit of volume increase is happening in Q2. Prepaid and debit
have picked up already by April 28 and then Martina is trying to indicate that she thinks it'll settle to a certain number
over the course of the quarter. It's in credit that we at least have not yet seen a pickup in the second quarter versus the
first quarter. That's what our numbers currently are telling us.

Our next question comes from Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Okay, hey. So you mentioned that you're philosophically against licensing the MasterCard
network to a bank.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: I didn't say that, Rod. I just said I haven't changed my opinion from where I was earlier,
which is that we are there we are. We do not have that license today. I'm watching what's going on with Visa and
Chase. If merchants, issuers and acquirers respond in a way that would put me in a situation where I may need to do
something which is thoughtful, I will. But I'm reluctant to just jump to a conclusion that I'm against or for anything
until I watch what they do. I don't feel the pressure to have an against or for right now.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Right. I mean, my guess is that Visa would have said six months ago that it's
philosophically against licensing its network, but it sort of needed to do that in order to maintain a relationship with
Chase. And I guess I'm wondering if a bank, maybe call it HSBC just as an example, if it were to ask MasterCard to do
a Chase/Visa net type of deal even though you're philosophically not excited about that add, is it something that you
would look at doing because that may be a trend at certain banks that have a big presence in issuing and acquiring? It

could be a new trend that comes down the road. Is that something that you're looking at?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So many, many things there. One is I look at anything. If clients talk to me, I'll think
about it. I don't know what I'd conclude because it would depend on what it does for our brand and our company, as
well as for that client and for the other clients whom I have relationships with. It's going to be a very complex Rubik's
Cube to think our way through, so I don't know the answer to that yet.
The second thing is I don't know exactly what's inside the Visa Chase deal. I may not do it exactly like them. If I do
something, it may be done differently. So this is all speculation. I have no clue. I know this, that just like in Durbin, I
will watch this very carefully. And if I feel the need to make some moves to be able to ensure that the banks who are
partnered with me on my brand don't suffer in the marketplace, I will. But I'm not going to jump to a conclusion right
now that I need to do something either similar or a little different or nuanced differently. I don't know yet, I just don't.

Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, guys. I just wanted to follow-up on that Chase Visa deal. Obviously, there's been a lot of
questions on it. I guess there's been some speculation that you'll lose some Chase card volume in that deal. I just wanted
to see if that's correct. And then I know Chris McWilton questioned the economics of the deal, so I just want to get
your thoughts on allowing Chase to do on those transactions. Do you think that model makes sense?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Well, we have a certain amount of business with Chase. As you know, Chase was a
predominantly Visa bank even earlier. But we have a good relationship with them. We still got business with them. In
fact, the recent InterContinental Hotels co-brand that I talked about with you last quarter is actually with Chase, which
was signed and done post the announcement of this deal. So I don't know. My approach is to keep building that
relationship with them. We're doing businesses with them on prepaid cards. We're doing businesses with them on
commercial cards. We're doing business with them on co-brands, and we have some non-co-brand but simple credit
card kind of products with them.
My sense is that what they've done with Visa is to allow them to certainly protect the business they have with them. I
think they're still open to doing some business with us and we're pursuing that relationship. So I don't know where that
will go. I have no idea.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: And then just does the model make sense to you on how they probably would be paid? And
then just the one follow-up is the acquiring. You're waiting for what the acquirers might do. I just want to make sure I
understand what you mean by that.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Well, everything depends on how acquirers, issuers and merchants respond to all these
deals. It's like in Durbin. All three players had different responses to the way Durbin played out. I'm just making sure
I'm keeping an eye on all the three players and how they respond. Does the model make economic sense? I have no
idea. You got to ask Visa because I don't know what's inside.

<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Losing credit portfolios?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: No, that's not what I said, but I think I might recall what you are referring to. So this
was when Greg was asking about rebates and incentives and the level of that. And one of my comments is that we

actually had the lapping of a new deal. So you might know that whenever we sign a deal, we might have an impact on
our rebates and incentive line, and that can happen in any particular quarter and we had some impact in the first quarter
of 2012 and that is basically lapping. And it actually was in the fourth quarter of 2011 and that is now lapping in the
first quarter of 2013. But the deal is live. It's just the way that the accounting works.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Okay. Great. Just as a follow-up, can you talk a bit about what you're doing in credit in terms of
trying to gain share in the market? Maybe talk about what you're seeing in the U.S. market versus overseas.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So as I said – overseas is the same business. We're out there winning deals. A number of
the things I talked to you about Nedbank as an example in South Africa. It's both credit and debit and commercial
credit and so on. It's in the U.S. that we've got a situation which we've talked about, which is our consumer credit share
is not where we like it to be. So it's not something that will change in a hurry unless some very big portfolio switches
over, for which I have no ability to decide yes or no. That depends on how you negotiate it. Typically, large portfolio
flips are relatively long selling cycles.
What I am focused on, however, is all the business comes around that. So co-brands, which is what I was telling you
about. In the last quarter, I gave you a number of examples. Other opportunities with new launches. I've given you the
example of Bank of America this quarter and a ton of things on the commercial credit space where we're doing things
with Citibank, Bank of America and with others in a number of industries. That's what we are up to.
I think our consumer credit share business will not change in a hurry. It will change over a period of time. But we've
got all the right building blocks and we are out there using both our ability to bring in control, priceless cities and a
number of other assets, advisors, to play while also looking at our ability to bring value to the co-brand partner. So
those are the kind of things we're up to.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Next question, please?

Next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Hey, Ajay. I wanted to ask you a philosophical question as we've been doing a lot of
philosophizing today on this white label stuff. I mean, do you believe philosophically that banks are actually trying to
give away interchange or not? And then I guess when you think about the value of the network itself, is the value of the
network under duress and possibly going into some other areas mean that, you need to be in more advertising areas,
loyalty, other things that I guess would be additional sources of potential revenue for your model?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Second question and first are actually interrelated. Let me – I think you're on to a good
topic which is that going forward, would people like us, be also building revenue streams from other places rather than
just the traditional clearing authorization and settlement function that in some ways has been a certain proportion of our
revenue. Julio, you've heard me talk openly about diversifying our business from the day I joined and the reason is that
I believe what we have in the network is the asset of connecting billions of consumers with millions of merchants with
tens of thousands of banks in 200 countries with all the local legal regs built in. That's a great asset.
What we need to do is to be able to leverage that asset in many ways. One of the reasons why I'm investing in loyalty
and rewards, why I'm investing in things like inControl, why we've got into prepaid program management, why we are
doing all those things and the investment we're putting into data and information services and the advisors business is
all about making sure that we build our company not just based on converting cash but also imbedding ourselves better
with merchants, with issuers, with acquirers, with governments and consumers thorough these value added services that
you can bring by using what you do well which is the network.
And the data warehouse, and the processing. And that's what I've been doing from the beginning. And so nothing's
changed in that way. I'm sort of focused on that still and that's where the investments are going as well. Yes, we're
investing in credit and in debit and in prepaid and commercial. But we are also investing in new channels like mobile

and eCommerce and we're also investing in the diversification. That's the grow, build, diversify strategy that I've been
laying out for MasterCard for a while.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Right. Okay. Maybe just one quick follow-up for Martina on the margins. Thinking about
the trade-offs between revenue growth and the ability to continue to defend EPS. Anything in particular that you would
sort of highlight as continued drivers to sort of defend the EPS on margin side you would have left for the rest of the
year here?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: I think as we have said that it really depends on where the revenue growth comes in for
the rest of the year and what we might be doing from an investment point of view where the margin is going to come
out for the year. But at this point in time the visibility that we have we do believe that there will be a small margin
expansion. But just to remind everybody we have really a number of levers in terms of EPS growth. Right? One, is
what's happening on the revenue and on the expense side. Two, is what's happening on our tax rate. Everybody knows
that we're working at that. And three, was we're doing from a share repurchase point of view. So we are looking at all
levels to be making sure that we are reducing our financials.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Operator, I think we've got time for one last question.
Operator
Our last question comes Bob Napoli from William Blair. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: Thank you, I was hoping, Ajay, you could maybe give a feel for the emerging market story over.
Do you still think that you're going to be able to grow internationally in a mid upper-teens especially in the emerging
markets over the next several years? And just a minor point, if you could. We've had some crazy weather here in the
U.S. I think they're getting seven inches of snow in Minneapolis today or something and Denver's getting, but have you
seen an effect from some of the unusual weather in the U.S. on your business?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So, there was some – March clearly was a month that got impacted by the unusual
weather in terms of spending. So that I think does happen periodically. I tend not to give it more credence than that
because eventually it kind of evens out over the course of time. So I tend to worry about it in a context of a month but
not in the context of a longer period of time. I look at the basic franchise and what it's doing as the real context I think
in.
I think the emerging markets question, I still believe that there's enormous opportunity to grow our kind of business in
the emerging markets. You take the South Africa story. We were a smaller market share player there three years ago,
but through consistent wins and now the latest one with Nedbank when we finish implementing Nedbank, we're in a
market where there's still a great deal of cash. And yet the economy is clearly the most powerful economy in Africa,
then I feel that we would end up being a market leader there. That's a pretty big opportunity.
Because not only would we have the market leader in terms of cards issued. We can keep focusing on the secular
change of cash through electronic as well. Hence the focus on the social security payments in South Africa where now
10 million card holders have come out where there were none earlier, their social security payments are now going into
their card. Now as Martina said, a number of them take that card and go to an ATM or a cash point and take out cash.
That creates a lower revenue yield than going to the point-of-sale. The next step in all these cases is to find a way to
encourage them to go to the point-of-sale rather than taking out cash.
So all these things on – the emerging markets on a step-by-step building process. You've got to build issuance. You've
got to build the habit of using a card. You've got to build acceptance and you've got to build government support and all
of that together. So we are systemically going about it in a number of countries. And I just gave you the South Africa
example because it's a live example from this quarter and I was there in January when I signed this Nedbank deal,
which we now publicly announced.

And so I feel still that the emerging markets are still a great opportunity to where this company is going in, South
Africa is just being one example, China being another, India being a third. Parts of South Asia, parts of Southeast Asia,
Latin America. There's a lot going on. There's all the emerging markets Central and Eastern Europe where we're
making really good headway. I think it's not just in the payments business but to Julio's earlier question, it's also in
diversifying our revenues through alternative ways whether it'd be data and analytics or advisors or in control, or
different value added services that embed us better in that marketplace and I'm trying to do all those things as we are
growing our future over the next few years.
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: Thank you.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Ajay, you want to offer some closing comments?
Ajaypal Singh Banga
Thank you for all your questions and I want to leave you with a few closing thoughts. We're going to continue to work
through some of these challenging economic conditions that we've been talking about for a while. I think we're off to a
good start in 2013. With this last quarter's performance in the past quarter was absolutely in line with where we thought
we would end up. The slower growth in consumer spending and confidence from the second half 2012 has continued
into 2013.
But we also saw the expansion of electronic forms of payment around the world. So we're going to keep a careful eye
on expenses. We're going to keep investing in those initiatives that will set up our company for future growth for that
diversification as well as that I just talked about. We remain confident in our three-year performance objectives through
2015. As we said last quarter, we expect performance in the early part of that period will probably be slightly below the
range with growth picking up as the global economy returns to a more stable environment. There are signs that that
stability will come.
All in all, our focus is clear, grow our share and drive the conversion of cash through technology, through partnerships,
around the world, while continually developing products and services that embed us with banks, with merchants, with
governments and consumers. So thank you for your participation. Thank you for your support. I appreciate it.
