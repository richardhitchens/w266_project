Thank you, Denise, and good morning, everyone. As we entered 2014, we embarked on a journey here at
Weyerhaeuser to grow a truly great company. As we said at that time, the three primary levers we're pulling to drive
shareholder value are portfolio, performance, and capital allocation.
Over the past year we have made significant progress. Specifically, in 2014, we divested our homebuilding business to
become a focused forest products company, achieved our 2014 operational excellence targets and improved earnings
from our continuing operations before special items by 22% to $700 million or $1.25 per diluted share compared with
$572 million or $0.99 per diluted share in 2013. In addition, we increased our divided by 32%, authorized a new $700
million share repurchase program and within five months completed nearly 30% of that authorization. Through these
actions, we demonstrated our commitment to delivering shareholder value and our total shareholder return for the full
year 2014 exceeded 17%.
Included in these full-year results are the strong fourth quarter operating earnings we reported this morning.
Weyerhaeuser earned $166 million or $0.31 per diluted share for the fourth quarter on net sales from continuing
operations of $1.8 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $145 million or $0.27 per diluted share, an increase of
31% compared with the year-ago quarter.
Special items for the fourth quarter included an ongoing gain from a change to a postretirement health plan, and
restructuring charges associated with our SG&A cost reduction.
I will begin the discussion of our businesses' performance with some brief comments on housing. Housing starts
showed continued improvement in the fourth quarter albeit at a modest rate. U.S. housing starts totaled just over 1
million for 2014, an improvement of approximately 9% compared with 2013. We are confident that housing markets
will continue to strengthen in 2015 as accelerating employment growth, strong consumer confidence, low mortgage
rates and initiatives to improve mortgage availability should support increased household formation. We anticipate over
1.1 million housing starts for 2015.
Let me now turn to our business segments starting with Timberlands, charts 4 to 6. Timberlands contributed $143
million to fourth quarter earnings compared with $136 million in the third quarter. In the West, fee harvest volumes
increased as we were able to access tracks that had limited operations during the third quarter's fire season. Average
realizations for Western logs rose due to tighter domestic markets and a favorable export log mix. Japanese demand
remained solid during the quarter. Chinese demand slowed and prices for Chinese export logs declined. Although
Chinese inventories decreased during the fourth quarter, they remained above normalized levels and the weak ruble
improved the competitive position of Russian logs.
Operational excellence initiatives to direct each log to its most profitable customer contributed to the strong
performance in the quarter. Our Longview Timber acquisition contributed $44 million of EBITDA in the fourth
quarter. This acquisition has been fully integrated into our Timberlands' operations.
In the South, fee harvest volumes rose and average realizations increased compared with the third quarter. Fourth
quarter earnings included $3 million from disposition of non-strategic Timberlands, a decrease of $16 million
compared with the third quarter.
Our Timberlands business met or exceeded all of its operational excellence targets for 2014, including $184 million of
EBITDA from the Longview acquisition against a target of $175 million to $185 million, $29 million of synergies
against a target of $20 million and over $20 million of operational excellence improvements. We anticipate an
additional $20 million to $30 million of operational excellence improvements in 2015 in this business.
I will now turn to Wood Products, charts 7 and 8. Wood Products contributed $56 million in the seasonally weak fourth
quarter, down from $105 million in the third quarter. Earnings for the segment were comparable to the fourth quarter of
2013 as benefits from our operational excellence initiatives offset a 13% year-over-year decline in average OSB
realizations.
Wood Products EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2014 totaled $86 million compared with $135 million in the third
quarter.

In lumber, EBITDA totaled $65 million. Average price realizations declined approximately 4% compared with the
third quarter. Log costs for Western and Southern mills increased and per unit manufacturing cost rose due to
seasonally lower production volumes.
In OSB, EBITDA decreased by $4 million compared with the third quarter due to a 4% decrease in average
realizations.
Engineered wood products reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $14 million. A slight increase in average sales
realizations was more than offset by seasonally lower sales volumes and higher per unit manufacturing costs due to
reduced production volume.
EBITDA for the Distribution business declined $6 million compared with third quarter but improved by $5 million
compared with the fourth quarter of 2013.
In 2014, the Wood Products segment achieved over $100 million of benefits from operational excellence initiatives
including delivering on our commitment to improved EBITDA in engineered wood products and distribution of about
$30 million to $40 million in each business.
We have made good progress but much more work remains to be done. As we continue our focus on operational
excellence in 2015, we have committed to deliver an additional $25 million to $30 million of operational excellence
from our lumber business, $10 million to $15 million from OSB, $15 million to $20 million in engineered wood
products EBITDA and $20 million to $30 million of EBITDA from Distribution.
Let me now turn to Cellulose Fibers, charts 9 and 10. Cellulose Fibers contributed $87 million to earnings, an increase
of $28 million compared with the third quarter. Fluff pulp markets remained strong in the fourth quarter and average
pulp price realizations increased. Maintenance cost at our liquid packaging board facility declined substantially and
production increased following completion of an extended outage that occurred primarily in the third quarter. As
anticipated, liquid packaging board realizations declined in the fourth quarter due to a temporary shift in mix as we
restarted the facility. Shipment volumes for that product also declined as a result of a slowdown associated with the
West Coast port labor dispute.
The Cellulose Fiber business finished the year with strong operational performance with several mills setting annual
records for uptime, productivity, and quality. The business generated nearly $30 million of operational excellence
improvements in 2014 and is targeting another $25 million to $30 million in 2015.
As I wrap up this morning, let me touch briefly on SG&A. At the end of 2014, we had achieved our $75 million run
rate reduction target. Moving forward, we will continue to seek opportunities to simplify and reduce costs to ensure that
we have the appropriate cost structure required to win.
I'll now turn it over to Patty to discuss our first quarter outlook.
Patricia M. Bedient
Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everybody. The outlook for the first quarter of 2015 is summarized on chart 12. I'll
begin the discussion with Timberlands.
Fee harvest in the West is anticipated to increase seasonally. Western domestic prices are expected to move higher and
we're shifting supply into those markets. Japanese volume will likely decrease due to softer overall Japanese housing
demand and seasonal weather conditions. Sales realizations for China logs are expected to decrease somewhat but the
impact of softer prices is being partially offset by lower freight costs. Inventories at Chinese ports have been declining,
the takeaway has not yet been strong enough to bring balances to normal levels. Demand is not expected to pick up
until after the Lunar Holiday. Logging and road costs should decrease in the quarter as the results of harvesting lower
elevation sites and less road construction activities.

In the South, we expect to fee harvest to decline seasonally. We anticipate slightly stronger pricing, although
realizations will likely be flat due to a somewhat smaller log size.
Earnings from non-strategic land sales are anticipated at around $10 million compared to $3 million in Q4. We expect
earnings in our Timberlands segment to be significantly higher than the fourth quarter and up slightly from the first
quarter of 2014.
In Wood Products, we anticipate higher sales volumes in Q1 compared to Q4 due to seasonal improvement in demand
and slowly improving housing markets. The increase in single-family starts, which improved by almost 8% in
December on a seasonally adjusted basis compared to a year ago is a positive sign. Channel inventories are very lean.
So, assuming a more normal spring building season we should see a pickup in pricing. Prices in lumber and OSB,
however, had decreased since year-end but we expect realizations to improve as we progress further into the first
quarter. Average realizations for engineered wood products are anticipated to decrease slightly due to products mix.
However, this decrease should be more than offset by higher sales volume.
Log costs are expected to increase, while manufacturing unit costs should be lower on higher production volumes.
Resin costs should also decrease as a result of low oil prices. Overall, we expect earnings in our Wood Products
segment to increase significantly in the first quarter compared to the fourth.
In Cellulose Fibers, days' supply of global softwood inventory has increased to 31 days as of year-end, which is above
normal levels. The combination of a stronger dollar and the usual seasonal slowdown in demand is likely to negatively
affect pulp pricing. We also expect to incur higher maintenance expense this quarter as our largest fluff mill takes its
planned maintenance shutdown.
Sales realizations for liquid packaging are expected to increase this quarter compared to Q4 due to a more normal sales
mix. The problems encountered as a result of the West Coast port slowdown have continued into this quarter. So far
this quarter we have scheduled 13 days of downtime at our Longview liquid packaging board facility due to the port
situation. Although negotiations are underway with the federal mediator, the issues have yet to be resolved.
In addition to downtime, we are also incurring additional dollars for increased freight and warehousing. We expect
overall earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment to be significantly lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth
quarter and likely more comparable to the first quarter of 2014.
Chart 11 shows the detail of Unallocated Items. Earnings in Q4 were negatively affected as Unallocated Items
increased by approximately $23 million in Q4 compared to Q3. The largest increase was the change for profit in
inventory and LIFO, which accounted for $14 million of the difference. Higher share-based compensation at the result
of the increase in the stock price during the quarter accounted for an additional $8 million of the difference.
Referring to chart 13, I'll now touch on some overall financial comments. Cash flow from operations for the fourth
quarter was $304 million. Major uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $124 million, dividend
payments for preferred and common stock of $174 million and share repurchases of approximately $80 million. This
brings our total share repurchases for the year to just over $200 million or approximately 30% of our current
authorization.
We ended the year with total shares outstanding of approximately 524 million shares down from approximately 584
million shares at the beginning of the year. The divestiture of our homebuilding business in the third quarter of last year
resulted in retiring approximately 59 million shares.
Total capital expenditures for the full year of 2014 including reforestation was $395 million. For 2015, we are
expecting expenditures in the range of $480 million to $500 million consistent with the guidance we gave at our
Investor Meeting this past December.
I'll now wrap up with an update on the status of our retirement benefit plan. The unfunded status of our defined benefit
pension plans and post employment retirement plan increased by approximately $820 million as of the end of 2014
compared to 2013. This increase in unfunded status was primarily driven by the implementation of new mortality table
and decreasing discount rates. The updated mortality table accounted for approximately $400 million of the deficit

increase and majority of the remaining change was due to decreasing the discount rate by approximately 80 basis points
for both the U.S. and Canadian plans. We did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plans in
2014 and we don't anticipate any cash contribution towards that plan in 2015.
Cash paid for all other pension and postretirement benefits in 2014 was $101 million. We expect total spending in 2015
to be approximately $90 million. Our primary contributions in 2015 will again be to our Canadian plans for
approximately $40 million with the remainder going to pay for benefits under our supplemental pension plan and other
post-employment benefit plans, none of which are separately funded.
Chart 15 details pension and postretirement benefit plan expense from continuing operations by segment. For 2014, the
full year is net to zero. Pension and postretirement plan expense for 2015 is estimated to be approximately $40 million.
The increased expense is driven by the adoption of the new mortality table and decreased discount rates.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle and I look forward to your questions.
Doyle R. Simons
Thank you, Patty. In 2014, we demonstrated our commitment to driving shareholder value by improving performance
through operational excellence and returning cash to shareholders. As we enter 2015, our priorities remain unchanged.
We remain relentlessly focused on driving operational excellence to fully capitalize on our improving markets and
deliver value to our shareholders.
And with that, I'd like to open up the lines for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go
ahead with your question.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Patty.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Mark.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: I wondered if the two of you could talk a little bit about the impact of FX moves across your
overall portfolio? You've made a couple of references to this in the commentary already this morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: So, Mark, let me talk generally about the effect of the stronger dollar across our businesses
and then I'll ask Patty to fill in any of the details. But just generally, a stronger dollar generally is not a positive for
Weyerhaeuser. In terms of Japanese logs, what we've seen is the demand has not been affected by the strong dollar, as I
referenced and Patty referenced in our comment. But if it continues, it could potentially affect our price. In terms of
Chinese logs, what's happening there is the weak ruble is making Russian logs less expensive than U.S. logs. That, of
course, reduces the price that the Chinese are willing to pay. Now with that said, as you very well know, there is a
practical limit on just how much Russia can provide and the other thing is we are – prices are not at desirable levels, we
are able to redirect some of our logs to domestic markets and the domestic markets are holding up very well.
In terms of Wood Products, the Canadian lumber mills are benefiting from the higher margins on shipment to the U.S.
overall. And then on Cellulose Fibers, as Patty alluded to, the strong dollar at this point has not affected demand, but
we do anticipate lower prices due to the considerable pressure from fluff pulp's customers, primarily in Europe and
currently India's K prices are under some pressure. So that's kind of the big picture impact of what's happening because
of the stronger dollar.

<Q - Mark Wilde>: All right.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure. The only other thing that I would add, I think Doyle really went through all of the
businesses. I would just call your attention to chart 11 that I talked to in my comments and you'll notice there that there
is an FX loss both in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. That's really a function of U.S. dollar denominated debt
that is held by our Canadian subsidiary. So as the Canadian dollar depreciates, as it did in the fourth quarter, that takes
more Canadian dollars to pay off that loan, so that's what generates the bulk of that loss there. Now, as we look forward
into Q1, the Canadian dollar to-date I think has depreciated even more than it did in the fourth quarter, but that will be
driven ultimately by whatever the exchange rate is as of the end of the quarter.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Okay. And then, Patty, if I could ask just one follow-on, I wondered if you could talk a little bit
about that big cash position you're sitting on, yet the rationale for holding so much. And tied with that, how you think
about the – completing the remaining share repurchase authorization? You have about $500 million out there yet.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yes. So we are very committed to completing that authorization and we have a little under
$500 million left to go. The other thing I would say is that we think we should have a cash balance somewhere between
$300 million and $500 million. So we do have significant cash yet to create additional value for shareholders and we'll
be talking about that as we go into 2015 and have been discussing that. But I really don't have anything more to add in
terms of what we would use that for, other than just to reiterate that our priorities for capital allocation are, first and
foremost, returning cash to shareholders, investing in our businesses, and maintaining our appropriate capital structure.
And to that end, I should probably add that in January we did receive an upgrade in our investment rating to BBB from
BBB minus from S&P. So I think our capital structure is in good shape.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with
your question.
<Q - John P. Babcock>: Hey, good morning. This is actually John Babcock sitting in for George. How are you doing
today?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good. How are you, this morning?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Morning.
<Q - John P. Babcock>: I'm doing very well. I know you talked a little bit earlier about the performance
improvements and, first of all, I was wondering if you could discuss how everything is going on that front, especially in
4Q. And, additionally, are there any segment performance goals that are looking more difficult to achieve than when
you presented back in December? And then, lastly, and with the G&A expense reduction in the fourth quarter, where
was that ultimately focused?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yes. So in terms of our OpEx targets, we continue to make progress in the fourth quarter of
2014 and ended up essentially in line with what we laid out at our December 9 presentation. So we're encouraged by
the progress we continue to make. In terms of 2015, as we specifically laid out on December 9, we think there's a lot of
additional opportunity. We identified $20 million to $30 million of additional OpEx opportunity in Timberlands,
another $20 million to $25 million in lumber, $10 million to $15 million in OSB. In ELP, here again the target is in
improving EBITDA and that's a $15 million to $20 million of EBITDA improvement in 2015, $20 million to $30
million of EBITDA improvement in Distribution business, and then $30 million to $35 million in Cellulose Fibers. So,
overall, very encouraged by the progress we're making, but still – as I mentioned in my comments, still a lot of work to
do in front of us, but we are very focused on getting that to the bottom line in 2015.
Regarding your SG&A comment, our question if you will re-ask that, so make sure I'm more responsive to your
question.

<Q - John P. Babcock>: Yes, I was just wondering, it looked like G&A expense had come down in the fourth quarter
and I was just wondering ultimately what drove that.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: When we laid out our SG&A target back at the end of 2013, we said it would take the balance
of 2014 to get it fully implemented. So we continue to make progress in the fourth quarter, and by the end of the fourth
quarter we were at the run rate of above $75 million in terms of our SG&A target. So encouraged by the progress we've
made there and, as I mentioned, we've achieved that target, but we'll constantly be looking for opportunities to make
sure we have the appropriate cost structure going forward.
<Q - John P. Babcock>: Okay.
<A - Denise M. Merle>: Actually as you look at Q3 to Q4, Q4 is up over Q3, and that's really just a function of some
of the timing that happened with year-end as well as the additional items in unallocated, as I spoke about share-based
comp, etcetera. But as Doyle said, we feel very confident about that $75 million reduction run rate.
<Q - John P. Babcock>: Okay. Great. Well, thank you for the color there. And then, next, I guess, before I pass it on, I
just was wondering, on the Cellulose Fibers front, first of all, it looks like liquid-packaging realizations were down a
little bit in 3Q. And I was wondering if most of that was seasonal in nature or if there's any impact ultimately from the
port disruptions. And then, on top of that, how are the mills performing on the 18-month maintenance schedule?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, as it relates to the liquid packaging realization, the decrease in the fourth quarter
wasn't driven by the port disruption; it was driven by the fact that we had – we were bringing up Longview liquid
packaging as a result of the extended outage that we had in Q3. So it's just a little mix of lower grade board in the
startup of that facility coming up from the outage. You'll see in Q1, as I referenced in my comments, that the sales
realization will increase in the first quarter more consistent to where we were on a more normal sales mix. So the fourth
quarter decrease is really just a mix issue from the startup of the machine.
<Q - John P. Babcock>: Okay, great. And then, on the maintenance schedule, briefly?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yes, on the 18 months schedule, we are on track, fully implemented for that. It will vary
from year-to-year as that 18 months hit, but we're pretty much on schedule to do that. As I mentioned, our largest fluff
mill goes down this quarter, so that's our maintenance outage that we have in the Q1.
<Q - John P. Babcock>: Okay, great. Thanks for the color. I'll get back in the queue.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Thank you. Was hoping to get a bit more color on your encouraging comments on Wood
Products prices expected to go higher as the quarter progresses. And maybe if you could just kind of contextualize, why
they've been weak quarter-to-date and what you think – and what degree of confidence you have that indeed they are
going to turn?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Mark, as you know, predicting prices is always difficult. Currently, as we alluded to, lumber
prices are down slightly versus the fourth quarter average and OSB prices are down about $5 versus the fourth quarter
average. We, in talking to customers, understand that inventory levels are very lean. We also believe, as we said, that
housing is going to continue to improve. So our thought is as we move into closer to the stronger seasonal period that
we will see a rally in lumber and OSB prices as we move throughout this quarter. So our comments to your point
regarding significant improvement in earnings in Wood Products and first quarter versus fourth quarter are dependent
on pricing. But we do believe, our crystal ball tells us that we will see higher prices as we move through the quarter in
Wood Products, but time will tell.

<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Thank you. And do you have any view as to what's been pressuring prices of late? Are
there some weather-related issues, or is there – obviously, seasonally it's not a great time, but any added color you
might have but – anything unusual going on or just part of the seasonal process?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: I think it's mostly the seasonal process, Mark, there have been some weather-related events, I
don't need to tell you all, you all lived through or at least the folks to the North you all lived through one earlier this
week. So I think there have been some isolated weather incidences. So far we haven't had the type of weather overall
that we had last year first quarter. So I think it's mostly seasonal. I think it is some people being very conservative on
their buying. As I said, inventory levels throughout the system are very lean. And that's part of why we believe that
prices are going to rally, because as demand does pickup, as we get closer to the spring building period, we believe it's
not going to take a lot of pickup and demand to have a impact on pricing moving forward.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Okay. That certainly all makes sense. Just lastly, as you think about the dividend this
year, can you kind of remind us what the key metrics you'd be looking at that would determine any action you might
want to take on the dividend later in the year?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. Let me just make a general comment about the dividend, it goes back to our overall
levers we're pulling. We clearly understand that capital allocation is a key lever to driving shareholder value. As we've
consistently said over and over our number priority in terms of capital allocation is returning cash to shareholders
through growing and sustainable dividend. As you know, we increased our dividend about over 30% in 2014. And I'll
just tell you, we'll be working with our board later this year to determine the appropriate dividend level going forward.
We have given general – and I'd reference it as a general guideline of 75% of FAS over a cycle, in terms of dividend
level. But again that's just a guideline, but we do in fact understand the importance of growing our dividend and that's
something we intend to do, continue to do going forward.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: And would it be fair to say that you'd consider 2015 at least the way it looks now, to be
not an above the average year, given that housing is still at fairly depressed levels, or...
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. That's a fair comment. I mean, as we said, we anticipate housing this year will be north
of 1.1 million units, but that's still a long way from, kind of average 1.4 million units, 1.5 million units, 1.6 million
units. So, I would agree with your commentary.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Thank you.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thank you. Two things. Doyle, first, how are you thinking about the relative value of U.S.
versus non-U.S. timberland acquisitions? And then, secondly, as you think about the targets you're setting for Wood
Products for 2015, is the emphasis different than it was in 2014? I'm just curious, because you achieved a lot so fast in
those businesses, and I'm wondering if you've got to do something different to get the next layer up.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: So, Mark, in terms of the relative value of U.S. versus non-U.S. Timberland. As we've said
before, we look at all opportunities to grow our Timberland both domestic and non-domestic. I will tell you, I think our
bigger opportunity is going forward will probably be in the U.S., we will look internationally. I think one of the things
we need to be sure and do, when we look internationally is risk adjust based on the international exposure and we'll
continue to do that going forward. As you know, we have a very good plantation position in Uruguay. Those trees are –
we have a very good team there. Those trees are very well positioned and growing really fast and those markets
continue to develop over there. But, so I'd tell you we look both, but I think our bigger opportunities to grow our
Timberlands will be domestic going forward.

In terms of our Wood Products, operational excellence, targets, Mark, thanks for the comment, we did make good
progress in 2014. But as I said, we've still got a lot of work to do in that business. Now, I'm not going to tell you, it's
going to be easy as you continue to make progress on these. You kind of gotten some of the low hanging fruits, so
you've got to remain very focused on delivering that to the bottom-line, that's why we said very specific targets and
have very specific plans on how we're going to get there both from the sales perspective as well as the cost perspective.
So, we're very focused on pulling every lever that we can pull to continue to drive OpEx improvements in the Wood
Products business and are confident we're going to reach the targets that we've set out in 2015. But to your point, I
mean, it will get harder as we move forward, but I'm confident we have the team and the focus to accomplish the goals
that we've set forth.

Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Gail.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Gail.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: I guess, just can we go back to some of the comments about currency and how that might
flow into some of the markets? Have you seen – can you give any sense of magnitude to the shift that you might have
seen in Russia and maybe more detail? Have you seen any signs of Canadian lumber being redirected from China into
the U.S.? And, if so, any concerns that that might affect some of the Western markets?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Gail, as you would expect, it's hard to know exactly what's happening in the Russia situation.
Clearly we're hearing and seeing that there is more wood coming – more logs coming from Russia into China. I think
most of that's in Northern China, as I understand it. So, I think depending on what happens to the ruble, that's
something that could continue. But as I outlined, there are some practical limits based on just how much can come just
on the infrastructure challenges that Russia had, has had historically and we believe will continue to have going
forward. Patty, do you have any thoughts on the Canadian question and any redirect from lumber coming from, that
anything going to China that's being redirected otherwise?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: I think that that is something that is happening. We haven't seen a big pickup in lumber
volumes overall, yet. So I think to the extent that we'll see it, we'll see it more as spring building season continues. So it
will be something that will impact us going forward. We do have some Canadian operations ourselves as well. And
Gail, you referenced the Western prices, I think that's also Canadian lumber coming in puts pressure on the U.S. South
as well. But so far, it's not been a huge piece.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And can you give any insights into how your oil and gas income might be impacted
by the recent collapse in oil prices?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah, so let me give a couple of sensitivities to that. I think we've done some work on that
exact issue. So as you think about oil and gas prices and specifically oil prices going down, there is some give and takes
that you would expect. But as we think about sensitivity specifically to diesel prices and how that flows through, I
would tell you that, we think there was probably a $4 million to $5 million benefit in our earnings in fourth quarter
2014 as a result of lower diesel prices and that's probably $2 million to $3 million in Timberland and couple million in
– couple million in Timberland, couple million in Wood Products and maybe a million in Cellulose Fibers.
Going forward, we would tell you that every roughly $0.10 decline in diesel prices flowing it through the system would
result in, somewhere in the $5 million benefit again, with the relative ratios kind of like I outlined earlier in terms of the

various business. So on an annual basis every $0.10 reduction in diesel prices will have a bottom line $5 million
impact.
Now, there are some offsets as you just alluded to, Gail, one of them is there, we continue to face increasing base rates
for truck and rail carriers as those continue to be tight. So that will somewhat offset some of the benefits I just outlined.
And then, to your point if oil prices remain at the levels that they are currently, it'll take a little time, but that would
have a negative impact on our mineral income going forward. Just how much it's hard to know. We haven't seen a big
impact so far, but again if oil prices stay $50 or south of $50, that would have some impact going forward as we
continue to look at ways to maximize the value from our mineral resources.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. Thank you. And just one last quick one. Patty, can you spot us or give us any
perspective on how much pulp maintenance will be in the first quarter?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah. I think that will have an additional in the fourth quarter – somewhere I would expect
around $10 million to $15 million in additional maintenance expense; we'll have some decrease as a result of the effect
of less productivity because of maintenance. As I said, as you think about the overall earnings for the pulp segment or
Cellulose Fiber segment, it's a little difficult to project. So we tried to give you a little more color on that in that we said
it would be significantly lower than the fourth quarter but probably comparable to the first quarter of 2014, which I
think was somewhere a little bit north of $50 million, maybe $54 million.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - James H. Armstrong>: Good morning. This is James Armstrong sitting in for Chip.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, James.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Morning, James.
<Q - James H. Armstrong>: First question is in Wood Products with oil prices down significantly, how much impact
have you seen on resin and chemical costs so far? And could you remind us of the cost buckets for that business?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. So, James, the sensitivities that I just outlined for Gail, or we just outlined for Gail in
terms of diesel prices includes the improvement in resin. But you're exactly right. That's where the biggest opportunity
is in terms of the lower oil prices is in the resin that we buy for our OSB and ELP businesses. So, the biggest
component of what I just outlined is prices – as oil prices move down, resin prices are moving down and the sensitivity
I gave earlier is making the correlation between diesel and resin and then flowing that through to the bottom line.
<Q - James H. Armstrong>: Okay, that helps a lot. And then switching gears, any chance to retire debt in the next
year? I just was wondering if there are any lockups or what's going on there?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure. As you think about the debt, we don't have any maturity due until 2017 and for us to
retire that debt in terms of the premiums we would have to pay really doesn't make it very economic to do that
depending upon the issue it's probably premium of somewhere between 25% to 30% plus. So we do continue to look at
it but it doesn't really seem to make a lot of sense at us at this point.
<Q - James H. Armstrong>: Perfect. And then, lastly, could you just give us an update on what you expect the 2015
tax rate to be?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure. The tax rate always is dependent upon the mix of REIT income which the tax rate is
zero and TRS income which would be somewhere around 33%. So there are two things that drive that. One is the rate
overall, which is dependent upon the mix, but we would expect that we would be somewhere around 18% to 20%.

Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Tyler J. Langton>: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Tyler.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<Q - Tyler J. Langton>: I was just wondering in the West for Timberlands and I know it's still early, but do you think,
I guess, domestic demand at this point is still strong enough to offset the weaker demand that you're seeing sort of from
the export markets at this time?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. So, as we talked about, at least in the first quarter, we anticipate that we will have
higher earnings in Timberland and clearly a component of those higher earnings versus the fourth quarter, Tyler, are
higher price and that's primarily due to domestic prices being higher, as you just alluded to, and some mixed issues. So
we will see how it plays out, going forward, but as we said, domestic prices are in good shape and we think that could
continue. We'll just have to see what happens in terms of, I think, the biggest challenges we talked about is in the
Chinese market. We will get through the Lunar Holiday, as we talked about, inventories have come down, and not back
to where normal is but they have come down. So our guess is those markets will stabilize in the second half of the year
as well.
<Q - Tyler J. Langton>: And then, I was just being nosy in terms of your export log volumes, I guess, China has
slipped, they had been accounting for around 30% of your volumes and they were around 25% this quarter. I mean, is
that anything – is that a deliberate effort on your part, just given the weakness over there? Or, really, is that just a
function of demand from China has just slowed a lot more than demand has slowed out of Japan?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: I would most say its most, Tyler. I mean, part of it is we have seen a little bit of fall off in
demand in China, as we alluded to, but we also made the conscious decision to redirect some of those log domestically
because of the strong prices that we're seeing on the West Coast. So it's a combination of both things.
<Q - Tyler J. Langton>: Got you. And I think just finally on the engineered wood products side, and I guess you've
had two quarters of pretty significant production declines. Have these been more sort of temporary cuts and getting
volumes to go down more towards the levels that we saw in the first half of 2014 or do you think volumes should grow
more in line, off of this lower base, just kind of any thoughts on that going forward?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. I think the declines – one of them was kind of – it happened because of the second and
the third was as we put in a price increase and moving some volume forward to the second versus the third. And then
the fall off in the fourth quarter from our perspective was purely seasonal. So as we move into the stronger seasonal
period, first quarter and then second quarter, we would anticipate a nice rebound in volumes in our engineered wood
products business.
<Q - Tyler J. Langton>: All right. Great. Thanks so much.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Yeah. Thanks very much and good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Yeah. Just two easy questions today. Just one is, you referenced opportunities in Timberland in
North America. I just wonder if you could comment on the competitive landscape out there and whether you are
looking at bigger things or smaller things.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. So, as you know, it's been pretty active in terms of activity in both the South and West.
In terms of the competitive landscape I still think there's a lot of money out there that is looking to invest in this asset
class. In terms of the way we look at it, our key criteria, we clearly are looking for opportunities that generate
appropriate returns and cash flow, both short-term and long-term. We look for opportunities where we can strengthen
our access to strategically important markets for us or move into new markets that we may not be in although we're in
most markets, as you know, also looking for opportunities where we can get synergies and I think Longview is a very
good example of where we were able to do some things to get some unique synergies. And then, finally, to your point,
we're looking for scale opportunity. Now, that doesn't mean we won't do some small deals and we're always in the
markets doing some small deals but we're really looking for some scale opportunities to continue to grow our
Timberlands if we can find those right opportunities going forward. So, that's kind of the way we think about it.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Okay. Great. And then, turning over to Softwood Lumber Agreement, one of your competitors
on the Timber REIT side this week said that he thought that the Softwood Lumber Agreement served its purpose and
really no longer needed. I am just wondering what Weyerhaeuser's position is? Are you happy with the current
agreement? Do you want to see higher import duties or is it the latter, they're no longer needed?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. I wouldn't say some type of agreement is no longer needed. As you know, as we've
talked about the agreement is set to expire later this year, I can tell you there is a lot of discussion from folks on both
sides of the border discussing options for renewing that agreement. And I can also tell you that we are very actively
involved in those discussions.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Okay. That's all I had. Best of luck. Thanks.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question. Your final question comes from the line of Anthony
Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Hi, Anthony.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Hi, Anthony
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Hi. I had a question on Cellulose Fibers. Given we've seen a slowing of Emerging Market
economies, a very strong dollar, I was wondering as we start the year, putting aside the West Coast port issues, are you
seeing any change in customer buying behavior or any slowing of demand for fluff?. And then, a related question, you
have a competitor who's talked about converting a fair amount of new fluff capacity next year. And I think you've
devolved maximum capacity as well. I was just wondering how are you thinking about the fluff supply demand balance
over the next year or so.

<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure, Anthony. As it relates to demand for the product, demand has continued to be very
strong. Having said that, I think that we will likely have some downward pressure potentially on price, just given what's
happening with the economy in Asia as well as just currency flows. So far we've been very pleased with the demand
outlook for fluff, it does continue to grow. But depending upon what happens with some of those developing
economies, we could see some softening a little bit there, but really haven't seen it at this point.
As it relates to conversions, I wouldn't want to speculate too much because it will take some time for any conversion to
come into play and then it will just be a function of what the overall market is at that point in time. One thing I would
say is that as we've talked about before the higher quality fluff product which is where we play primarily does have
consumer product companies like Procter & Gamble who are pretty picky about the quality. So not only does it take
time to actually do the conversion to the product, it also takes time to sell or buy that product. So it's something we are
watching very carefully and being very thoughtful as we go forward, but the current state is that the demand is pretty
solid.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Okay. That's very helpful. And then, maybe just switching to Wood Products, you know,
you've made some very impressive performance improvements in Distribution this year or last year. And I think you
referenced the $20 million to $30 million improvement target for 2015. Can you drill down a little bit on the kind of the
leverage you're going to pull to drive that EBITDA improvement in Distribution this year? And can you talk a little bit
about the strategic importance of Distribution as part of, you know the broader Wood Products portfolio?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah, so in terms of the levers that we're going to pull, they're essentially the same levers that
we pulled in 2014, it's just continuing to be focused on those. As Cathy Slater talked about in our December 9
presentation, it's really a focus on what we call the 5Ss which is sourcing, selling, stocking, storing and shipping. So,
it's basically the blocking and tackling of making sure we're continuing to do things to drive down our cost structure
where it needs to be and then making sure we're doing things on the sales side to maximize the profit margins of what
we run through our distribution system.
In terms of how we think about Distribution, as I've said before, we – that's a business where frankly we've
underperformed for a number of years. We needed to show that we could make dramatic improvements in that and
versus in terms of overall EBITDA improvement and where we stack up competitively. We started to do that in 2014,
but still a lot of work remains to be done in terms of how we think about it going forward. That's a business where we
need to show that we can win by out executing the competition and generate returns well in excess of our cost of capital
over a cycle and that's what we're focused on doing currently.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Right. Thank you.
Doyle R. Simons
Okay. So, as I understand it, that was our last question. So, I would just like to end by saying, thank you everybody for
joining in this morning. More importantly, thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser.
