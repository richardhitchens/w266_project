MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, my name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone
to the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded today, April 17, 2014.
Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.
Dane E. Holmes
Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter

Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?
Harvey M. Schwartz
Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through our first quarter results. Then I'm obviously
happy to answer any questions.
Net revenues were $9.3 billion, net earnings $2 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $4.02, and our annualized
return on common equity was 10.9%.
The first quarter reinforced two consistent themes that we have seen over the past few years: first, the continued
uncertainty around the strength of the global economic recovery; and second, the dominant role that central banks play
in driving broad economic activity and capital markets sentiment. With respect to the first, market participants
struggled to reconcile mixed economic data across different regional economies, the weakened prospect of a
strengthening U.S. economy against an improved but still relatively weak European economy, and a slowing economy
in Asia.
As it relates to the second theme, discussions among market participants also centered on the potential for additional
central bank activity. In the United States, the focus remained on the pace and potential magnitude of further tapering
to the Federal Reserve's bond buying program. In Europe, the market attempted to weigh the potential for either
negative interest rates or the introduction of an asset purchasing program.
In Asia, market participants questioned whether the upcoming hike in Japan's consumption tax would weaken positive
momentum and require the Bank of Japan to boost its quantitative easing. Given the uncertainty surrounding the
outlook for central bank activity, it is understandable that overall client sentiment and risk appetite was subdued. With
this backdrop, we are all reminded of the importance of a strong and diversified business.
With respect to the client franchise at Goldman Sachs, we continue to see strong relative positioning of performance
across all of our businesses. Within Investment Banking, we maintained our market leading position in completed
M&A. We advised on 31 transactions valued at $1 billion or more, the highest number in the industry. We helped
underwrite $55 billion in global equity offerings during the quarter, making us the market leader. We also helped to
bring $194 billion of high-yield and investment-grade debt offerings to market, which is a quarterly record for debt
underwriting volume.
Within Investment Management, total assets under supervision reached a record $1.08 trillion, up 12% over the past
year. Despite market headwinds, our performance within FICC demonstrates the benefits of offering our clients a
diversified product suite, meeting their needs across rates, credit, currencies, mortgages, and commodities. Whether it's
from a business, product, or regional perspective, the value of diversity was reinforced in the first quarter of 2014.
Now I'll discuss each of our businesses. In Investment Banking, we produced first quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion,
up 4% from the fourth quarter. This was our highest quarterly performance since 2007. While our Investment Banking
backlog declined from year-end levels, it is up significantly compared to this time last year.
First quarter advisory revenues were $682 million, up 17% sequentially. We advised on a number of significant
transactions that closed during the first quarter, including: Vodafone's $130 billion disposal of its U.S. group, whose
principal asset is its 45% interest in Verizon Wireless; Cole Real Estate Investment's $10.9 billion sale to American
Realty Capital Properties; and Bristol-Myers Squibb's sale of its Global Diabetes business to AstraZeneca for up to
$4.3 billion plus future royalties.
We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter. These include:
Safeway's $9.2 billion sale to an investor group led by Cerberus Capital Management; Hutchison Whampoa's $5.7
billion sale of a 25% stake in A.S. Watson to Temasek; and Foster Wheeler's $2.9 billion sale to AMEC.
Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $1.1 billion in the first quarter, down 3% compared to record fourth quarter
results. Equity underwriting revenues of $437 million were 30% lower, as industry-wide activity declined in the first

quarter, particularly for IPOs. Year to date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity-related common
stock offerings and IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues increased 29% sequentially to $660 million due to higher
issuance activity in both investment-grade and leveraged finance markets.
During the first quarter, we were committed to meeting our clients' diverse financing needs, whether it was McKesson's
$5.5 billion bridge loan and $4.1 billion investment-grade notes offering or Hong Kong Electric Investments' $3.1
billion IPO or X2 Resources' $2.5 billion private placement.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equity businesses, net revenues were $4.4
billion in the first quarter, up 31% compared to the weaker fourth quarter. FICC plan execution net revenues were $2.9
billion in the first quarter. Excluding DVA, net revenues were up 50% sequentially. Rates on mortgages were both up
significantly relative to the weak fourth quarter, although client activity and volatility remained relatively muted. Credit
improved slightly and was supported by stable credit markets.
Commodities revenues improved significantly relative to a weak fourth quarter, as market volatility and client activity
increased. Currencies was modestly lower sequentially. Equities included Equities Client Execution, commissions and
fees, and Securities Services. Net revenues for the first quarter were $1.6 billion. Excluding DVA, results were down
7% sequentially. Equities Client Execution net revenues of $460 million were down significantly due to less favorable
market condition in certain areas, including emerging markets in Asia, particularly Japan. Commissions and fees were
$828 million, up 11% relative to the fourth quarter on solid cash volumes. Securities Services generated net revenues of
$352 million, up 4% sequentially.
Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the first quarter was $82 million, roughly consistent with fourth quarter levels.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in
the first quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $702 million, primarily reflecting company-specific events
including divestitures and pending IPOs. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $597 million and benefited
from net gains on certain investments and net interest income. Other revenues of $230 million include revenues from
the firm's consolidated investments.
In Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. Management and other fees were
roughly flat sequentially at $1.2 billion. Incentive fees were largely driven by a performance fee related to the sale of an
investment.
During the first quarter, assets under supervision increased $41 billion to a record $1.08 trillion. This growth was
driven by record long-term net inflows of $40 billion, largely in fixed income assets. During the quarter, long-term net
flows were strong across each of our client distribution channels, institutional, high net worth, and third party. During
the quarter, we also had market appreciation of $14 billion, largely in fixed income and equity assets.
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of
prior-year equity awards, and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 43%,
which is consistent with the accrual in the first quarter of 2013. First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.3
billion, 24% lower than the fourth quarter and down modestly from the first quarter of 2013. The fourth quarter
included higher litigation and regulatory expenses, higher charitable contributions, and higher impairment charges on
consolidated investment entities. Total staff at the end of the first quarter was approximately 32,600, down 1% from
year-end 2013. Our effective tax rate was 32.7% for the first quarter.
In terms of capital, there are a number of items to cover. First, during the quarter we repurchased 10.3 million shares of
common stock for a total cost of $1.7 billion. These repurchases reflected the completion of our 2013 capital plan. As
previously announced, the Federal Reserve did not object to our revised 2014 proposed capital actions.
With respect to our regulatory capital ratio, the Federal Reserve has approved the firm to come off the parallel run. And
therefore, starting in the second quarter, our capital ratios are determined under the transitional provisions of Basel III.
As a result, the transitional ratios are not only the most relevant but also a better assessment of our risk-based
capitalization. Our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio on a transitional basis was 11.3% using the advanced

approach. Under the standardized approach, our transitional ratio was 10.9%. Risk-weighted assets under the advanced
approach are approximately $600 billion: $355 billion in credit risk, $155 billion in market risk, and $90 billion in
operational risk.
Let me make a few brief points on the supplementary leverage ratio. Given that the proposed rule hasn't been finalized
and won't take effect until 2018, to date we have not taken any significant actions. When we have a final rule, there are
multiple options that we can pursue. On the capital side of the equation, our regulatory capital levels benefit from a
natural tailwind over time as we comply with the Volcker Rule. As you know, we have investments in funds where we
invest alongside our clients. Under the Volcker Rule, we are required to significantly reduce our level of fund
investments, which currently creates an approximately $9 billion capital reduction.
With respect to the asset side of the equation, there are also steps we can take if needed. For example, as of year end,
we had over $260 billion of assets associated with secured client financing activities. These are generally lower-risk
collateralized assets. We can ultimately decide, if needed, to reduce the lower-returning portion within these balances.
Regarding the new proposal, our best estimate today is 4.2%. Including the capital impact of reducing our fund
investments to comply with the Volcker Rule, we estimate it would be 4.7%.
To sum it up, we feel confident about our ability to comply in advance of 2018 given the variety of actions that we can
take, and we look forward to working with regulators to pursue the goal of enhanced safety and soundness while
continuing to serve our clients and support economic growth.
Before I take questions, let me leave you with some closing thoughts. Our performance in the first quarter is reflective
of the ongoing challenges facing the broader marketplace as the global economy continues its slow recovery. This has
been counterbalanced by the continued strength and diversity of our global client franchise. A sluggish yet steady
improvement in the global economy should drive greater confidence in the durability of the recovery. In response, we
would anticipate that market sentiment would improve, which should ultimately drive more client activity and greater
risk appetite.
As a management team, we're focused on two primary goals; first, to focus the bulk of our resources on serving our
clients and, in the process, grow our single most valuable asset, our global franchise. Our second goal is to take a
disciplined approach to adjusting and reengineering our businesses so that we are well positioned to protect returns in
the current environment and, more importantly, maximize returns when a more favorable environment emerges. Simply
stated, the goal is to consistently provide superior results for you, our shareholders, across the cycle.
Thank you again for dialing in, and now I'm happy to answer your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi, thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Good morning. So taking a look at I&L, and maybe we should only focus on the equity side
because I think most of the debt in lending will stick. At last look, there was about $20 billion in there, $16 billion of it
private equity. And given that you reiterated the $9 billion of disallowed – this is a question, sorry. I'm assuming that
you had some realizations in the quarter, but market list still has you at the same level of equity. And I'm going
somewhere with this because I'm curious to see how you go about winding that down and getting in Volcker
compliance over the next couple years and what the backup plan is if you don't sell it off. In other words, can you spin
some off? Sorry for the long question.

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay, I understand. That's obviously an important question, Glenn, thanks. So I think the
right way to think about the Volcker compliance is if you look at the 10-K, we roughly added the end of 2013 $14
billion of investments in funds. Now we obviously co-invested with our clients in all those funds. Those funds are not
just private equity. They're private equity, real estate, debt funds, et cetera. The important thing is really to focus on
2014.
Now obviously, there's a process where we can apply for extensions for two years, which basically takes us out three
years in terms of compliance. But just to size it for you, I think it's worth breaking down the $14 billion. And so if you
start with $14 billion, you can immediately take off $2 billion for what I'll refer to as permitted investments. That
brings you down to $12 billion. And then you can take off another $1 billion that relates to investments in funds that
we're already in the process of redeeming, hedge funds and credit funds where we have the flexibility to manage our
own times out there. And so that takes you down another $1 billion, bringing you to $11 billion.
Now within the $11 billion, obviously for several quarters we've been in a harvesting mode. And within the $11 billion,
$2.5 billion is already public, but there may be restrictions on sell-down et cetera. So when you add up all that math,
the $14 billion at the end of last year brings you down to sub-$9 billion. And so the sub-$9 billion is the number we
really have to manage. Again, we're invested alongside our clients in these funds.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, that's super-helpful. I guess the environment is pretty conducive right now, so that's
good. Moving on, just a cleanup question related to CCAR. Your plan wasn't objected to; you've got tons of capital and
you keep producing more, so all those are good things. I'm curious to see why you think you were so far off from the
Fed in both PPNR and RWA. And I'm not agreeing with the Fed's projections; it's just you had the biggest distance to
the Fed. I'm curious on how you decompose that, knowing that you don't have all the answers just yet.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: That's an important question. So we obviously submitted a plan that we thought was
significantly stressful. You can see that in our year-over-year numbers. As you know, the Federal Reserve by design
has created a process that is not transparent. They've communicated that very clearly. And so it's difficult for us at this
stage to reconcile our results with the Federal Reserve's results. We'll obviously work with the Federal Reserve on the
material they publish and we'll participate in their forums actively, and we'll try and get better insights.
I think an important takeaway here is we certainly – as a market participant, we're not encouraged necessarily to
replicate their test. And so in the end, they're our regulator; we're the regulatee. And so if they see that their results are
more severe than ours, it guides the process. And I think this window for modifying your capital actions is a good part
of the process, which we obviously participate in.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, I appreciate that. And the last one is you've been able to put up ROEs in the 10% –
11% range in an environment that I think you all would describe maybe a five out of ten overall. So with your cost
takeout and your share count shrinkage, I'm assuming you feel like you could do better than that over the cycle. I'm not
necessarily forcing you for a goal over the cycle, but just curious to get your thoughts on what it can do in a little bit
better times.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Over the last several years, as we talked about, we've been focused on a number of
strategic initiatives, things like obviously growing our Asset Management business and very focused, as you know, on
cost reduction. And that really is strategically about building operating leverage into the business. As we've done that
through this part of the cycle, we've done it with an eye on finding the right balance. And by balance, I mean is we're
obviously running these businesses for years and decades.
And so as we're getting more efficient and creating operating leverage, we need to make sure that we protect that
franchise. And I think this quarter's results really showed the diversity and the strength of the franchise, whether you
look at Investment Banking, Asset Management, et cetera. So I think we found that balance, the right balance so far.
Now, if we were to get significant tailwinds and a pickup in activity, we're very confident that we would participate in
that significantly. So there's a lot of operating leverage in the enterprise.
And with respect to our ROE, again, on an absolute basis, it's not what we want to be able to produce for our
shareholders. But on a relative basis, it looks pretty good.

Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Matt.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Just coming back to the Volcker on the equity exposure, so you went through how we
should think about the $14 billion running off over time and addressing that. But I guess how quickly and how big can
you rebuild the direct investment book that I think is still Volcker compliant?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So it's not as much about speed of rebuilding. And as you know, we've never approached
capital deployment about speed. It will all be driven by opportunity set. So that's the way we think about all of our
businesses. As capital comes out of those funds, it can be redeployed. It obviously can be redeployed anywhere, or it
can be returned to the shareholders if we don't think the opportunity set offers the best. So over time, this will be
completely driven by the opportunity set.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: I guess if you had to take a guess looking out – I don't know, three, five years, does the
overall equity book get back to about where it is here? I would think a little bit smaller but maybe not a lot smaller.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It would be impossible for me to say. Again, there will be maybe opportunities that are
more driven by the real estate cycle versus others. And I don't know; my crystal ball barely works for a week. It
definitely doesn't work that well for three or five years, but I wish I had one that did.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay, fair enough. And then just on the comp ratio, looking out the rest of this year, I
think last year you changed up a little bit. You kept it steady in the first half and then brought it down a little bit in 3Q
and brought it down again in 4Q; just any comments on how you're thinking about the timing of pacing of the comp
ratio.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So as always, in this quarter it's our best estimate for the year, and we'll evaluate it as we
go through the year. Again, really the philosophy on competition hasn't changed at Goldman Sachs since the day I got
here. It's all going be, again, a process driven by performance of the firm and business units and the individuals and
obviously our management of expenses and the returns we want to provide to shareholders. But right now it's our best
estimate.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay, all right. Thank you.

<Q - Christian Bolu>: Good morning and thank you for taking my question.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hi, Christian.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Hi. Harvey, given all the beta rounds of cash equities market structure and the rules of
high-frequency trading, I'm just curious to get your updated thoughts on plans for the equity trading business,
particularly the future of the Sigma X platform?

Page 7 of 16
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So we've been obviously an active market participant in the dialogue. Gary Cohn, as I'm
sure you saw, published an op-ed several weeks ago. Our focus on the equity market structure isn't specifically around
high-frequency trading necessarily. It's really about the fact that over the last 10 years-plus, the market evolution, speed
of execution has just gotten ahead of the market infrastructure and the market plumbing. And so we're very focused on
working with all market participants and regulators to ensure that the market infrastructure catches up with the speed.
There are other things I think in Gary's op-ed that I would refer you to, but that's the primary message. With respect to
our own Sigma X platform, I know there have some things in the news. We have no strategic plans for Sigma X at this
stage.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay, that's great. Switching over to FICC, I'm just curious as to what happened to the credit
business, coming through a year-over-year decline. Contrast repairs with speaking to strength there.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So obviously from a debt underwriting perspective, I know your question was
specifically about credit, but from a debt underwriting perspective, very strong quarter for us I think by any measure;
breadth of transactions, as I highlighted, and certainly relative opportunity in the marketplace. In terms of any one
quarter in credit, I have no insight into the competitors. It seemed like a reasonably solid quarter for us in credit, so
there really are no major takeaways there.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay, thank you and thanks for take my questions.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks, Christian.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Thanks, Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: First question, I think you gave some updated numbers around SLR, and I just want to
make sure I understand. I know before there was that estimate of greater than 5%, but the rules weren't finalized. I
guess now you're saying you got the mostly finalized rules, 4.2%. But if you got out of some of those funds, you get to
4.7%. I guess just getting from 4.7% to above the 5%, if you could, mention some of the things. Obviously, there's
earnings power. You mentioned some of the repo part of the business, but I just wanted to understand, what's the math
in terms of getting there?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So if I wasn't clear, let me just clarify. So the 5% wasn't a move to 4.2%. The 4.2% was a
reference to the proposal that just came out which incorporates the larger denominator. And we've done – as I
mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've done nothing to mitigate that. And as you know, our strategic philosophy on
proposed rules is to engage actively in the dialogue with the regulators. But more importantly, we really won't look to
mitigate until we feel like we have visibility around the final rule because we just don't want to mitigate things and
quite frankly do them in error. So we have done nothing to mitigate it.
The reason I highlight the natural tailwind, as I refer to it, is under the Volcker Rule the $9 billion has to come out of
funds, and that is a dollar-for-dollar capital deduction. So just standing still we would move to 4.7%. But we haven't
specifically begun to articulate a strategy internally to get us to 5%, but this gap is not material enough for us at this
stage to be extremely focused on it.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay, that makes sense. And then I guess when you combine the CCAR process and then
with some of the other regulations like Volcker, there's obviously some constraint on payouts for everyone. When you
think about the other opportunities, so investing in the business, making investments, but on the other hand, managing
your risk-weighted asset side of the equation, are there starting to be more opportunities to invest versus payout? And
as the economy improves, does that pick up? I just want to get your sense on the balance there.

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: That's a great question. I think the one word you used that I think should resonate for the
whole marketplace, not just Goldman Sachs, is this notion of constraints. And so every firm will be managing to
whatever constraint they perceive. Within that, really how do you fundamentally manage your capital? And at this
particular stage, we're not feeling constrained. Obviously, the 11.3% Basel III ratio I referenced gives you some sense
of potential excess capital.
I think that it's an important industry discussion because obviously for Goldman Sachs but again the broader industry,
the first priority is always about safety and soundness and adequate capital. But I do think that the flip side is there's a
risk of excess capital in the system, and what we're doing is no different than what we would have done in the past. If
there are periods where we're running with excess capital, we're going be patient and disciplined and wait for
opportunities. And certainly we're in a position today where from a liquidity and capital perspective, if there's demand
from our clients, we can meet them.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay, that's helpful, and then last one. Just on the FICC side of the business, you
commented a lot on the quarter-over-quarter. When we look at year-over-year, and you've given that at least on the
OTC side, you've gotten clearing in place and we're starting on the electronic side or the SEF side. I just wanted to get
your sense. I know it's difficult to piece those changes versus the broad environment given a lot of the volatility and the
uncertainty out there, but maybe, just from client conversations, how that's progressing and where you see that panning
out.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I think if you look back over the past year, I think clearing certainly managed by the
marketplace and the regulators extremely well. I know there were a lot of concerns going into it, but I think the
multi-stage launch, really you have to give everybody high marks for that. Swap execution facilities now up and
running, still relatively new, so a bit early to tell; but at this stage, really no significant impact in the marketplace. And
again, we'll watch it evolve and its impact with market structure, but really nothing to discern at this stage of any
materiality.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay, thanks for the color.

Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: Hi. Can you talk more about the non-comp expense? I know that's been a focus of yours, and
it certainly came down a lot. How sticky is that decline?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So at this stage, Mike, as you know, several years ago we launched the cost reduction
initiatives. And so that was a series of steps which brought us up to just under $2 billion. At this stage, we're still being
at the margin very focused on costs throughout the entire system. And so the sequential decline, as you know, was
obviously litigation, so that's not the mover. But the focus really is about, again, keeping costs significantly subdued
during this part of the cycle and again at the same time positioning us for an upturn.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: So are you still looking to have these non-comp expenses decline? It's down year over year.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yes. As I said, at the margin we're very focused on expenses in this part of the cycle.
And in areas where we can get positive results, you should see them.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: Okay, a separate question. The 2% buybacks were nice, but perhaps you could do even more.
And the threshold for the SLR is $700 billion in assets, and I guess you're above $900 billion. But is there any scenario
where you would say let's reduce our assets to below $700 billion so there's less regulatory burden on the firm?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, there are no plans strategically to shift the size of the balance sheet in any way to get
underneath some regulatory threshold. However, there are tactical things we can certainly do with the balance sheet,
which I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which give us some flexibility. I think for example, for any market
participant, if balance sheet becomes a constraint, I think there are elements of the balance sheet that either can be
repriced as we move through the cycle or can certainly get smaller.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: I know I've asked this question on several calls. But do you have any published financial
targets as of right now?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Mike, I always appreciate your focus on this. There's no targeted ROE. As I said earlier
at this stage, what we're really doing is strategically finding the balance point with this part of the cycle to make sure
that we position the firm for growth, we provide you, the shareholders, with adequate and hopefully superior relative
returns. And in the future, we're going to look to take advantage of all the market opportunities as the cycle improves.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: As a key, should I be looking at the proxy? I'm looking at page 38 of the proxy. You have the
long-term incentive plan, and that's based on ROE and growth in book value per share. So should I take that as an
indication of what you're most focused on? But then on page 33, I guess the Compensation Committee reviews results
at Goldman versus peers, and so a laundry list of ROE, EPS, earnings, revenues, comp ratio, non-comp expenses, a
couple other items.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yes.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: So what are you most focused on if I'm looking at financial metrics?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Any day of the week, as a firm, we're most focused on serving our clients and growing
our activity levels. In terms of aggregate financial metrics, all the things you see in the proxy, whether it's book value
per share, ROE, those are all components into the compensation methodology, as are those other things that are
mentioned in the proxy, whether it's a focus on expenses and aggregate performance. Those are part of our long-term
incentive plan. I wouldn't view those as specific metrics as it relates to how we think about our capital.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: All right. Lastly, at what point do you think you'll have enough clarity to be able to give us
financial targets?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I think, Mike, we'll continue to communicate our message in a way that we think is
appropriate for the context. Right now, obviously, there's still a significant amount of runway in the finalization of
rules. And as we get more clarity, we will continue to communicate with you how we think about capital. But I'm not
sure necessarily having a published target is necessarily the best way to think about how we're managing the franchise.
But we'll continue the dialogue, I'm sure.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: All right, thank you.

<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Hi, thanks and good morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: A couple of ticky-tacky questions. One is on the I&L revenue line. I was just wondering
if you can give a little more color around how much was driven from the monetization of the investments. I'm basically
looking to understand how that contributed to the higher incentive fees in Investment Management.

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So the equity line was driven by a portion of the portfolio which, as I referred to, is
divestitures and IPOs. And the debt line is really investment-related gains and interest income. And obviously, to a
certain extent you see in the broader market this is solid harvesting environment, and so you're seeing us do that.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Right, okay. And did it have any implication for the incentive fees in Investment
Management, or no?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: As I said, the incentive fees this quarter obviously are largely influenced by a single asset
that was sold. Again, I would put them more in the bucket of it's a harvesting environment. And so when/if we have
performance, you're going to continue to see incentive fees.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Right, I get that. And then the $8.5 billion that you're going to be managing again over
time, clients went into these funds with an expectation of typically 10-ish years or so, but you're not beholden to that
timeframe if obviously there are opportunities to extract value early.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So a number of these are older vintage funds. Obviously, we had some visibility on the
Volcker Rule when it was first launched. And so we have obligations to our clients. But again, we'll work with the
regulators and continue to harvest the funds in the profile that I gave you.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Our clients obviously value these returns.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Yes, absolutely. And then just on to Basel III, the transitional numbers we got, I'm just
wondering if you can give us a sense of what your fully phased-in number is. That's what we've been looking at for a
while.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure, 9.7% on the fully phased-in. But I would remind you again that we have to have the
capital coming out of the Volcker funds, and so the transitional measures may be the best indicator.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Right. I get that. And that 9.7% is standardized, advanced?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, I'm sorry, I apologize 9.7% was advanced. I thought that's what you were asking
about out. Standardized is 9.3%.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: 9.3%, okay, all right, super. And then just lastly on the SLR, you walked through how
the Volcker is going to benefit it. Can you give us a sense of how the SA-CCR would benefit it as well?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Around Goldman Sachs, we refer to that as 'sacker' [SA-CCR], by the way.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Sure.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I'm not sure if that's in the marketplace yet. So we've looked at it. We've studied it. At the
margin, it could be in the neighborhood of 10 or 15 basis points, but we're still digging through the details of that. But
it's a tailwind too.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Sure. Okay, thanks.

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, that would be a fully phased-in, if you will.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: It is, okay.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yes.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: All right, I just wanted to check. And the increase to 4.7% would just be completely static if
you were out of the $9 billion or so of funds today without any other change.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yes, we stand still, we do nothing.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. And then you'd add back 10 or 15 bps for the SA-CCR potentially just on top of that.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yes, the SA-CCR, look, again, early days on the SA-CCR. By the way, I'm glad you
adopted the SA-CCR acronym already. Early days on I think studying the SA-CCR, so that's why I didn't mention it
earlier, but obviously, I'm happy to give you a range on it. But the $9 billion that comes out, that comes out.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: SA-CCR is obviously a tailwind too.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yes, okay, I just wanted to make sure that we put them all in one place and that it was clear
that they were all on the same basis.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: That's correct, and that would give you 4.8% or 4.85%, if you will.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, that's real helpful. Moving back to FICC, I know you don't usually disaggregate, but it
would be helpful maybe this time around because we've seen such diversity of results among some of the different
players. If you could, give us some color on a year-over-year basis on the divergence that you saw between macro
businesses like rates and FX versus credit and commodities; and the more numbers you can help us with, the better.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I think the takeaway from the FICC business this quarter is really given the market
backdrop we had where sentiment was really fluctuating, we had concerns about Asia growth and then political events.
I think it really reinforces that if you're going be in these businesses, you really need the diversification. And so as we
mentioned, the quarter was helped by commodities because we have a strong commodities business, and you saw in
certain segments really unusually strong volatility, so we had opportunities to work with our clients. But we just don't
look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We look at it on a multi-quarter basis. And in this particular quarter, you saw us
outperform.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And just a follow-up question on the commodities. Was that mostly within the energy
complex where you saw the greatest strength?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yes, so that's where the primary volatility was.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Okay, that's all very helpful, and I appreciate you taking my questions.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher M. Kotowski>: Yes, good morning. You flagged in the release the Investment Banking pipeline
backlog was down, which was the first time I remember anyone doing that in a long time, and I'm curious. Is that just
because of the underwriting calendar, or do you sense that M&A is also at a peak and backing off?

Page 12 of 16
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So it was down; that shouldn't be a surprise. You may remember, Chris, that backlog had
hit a post-crisis high in the third quarter. Then it hit another post-crisis high in the fourth quarter, and obviously the
fourth quarter tends to be more the build quarter. And then coming off a relatively strong quarter, and it wasn't down
significantly towards year end. I think more importantly, I'd make two observations, one that's explicit about the
backlog, which as I mentioned, is up significantly versus the first quarter of last year.
But I think the takeaway on M&A is an important one. We've now seen a couple of quarters with higher M&A notional
volumes. And so these things can all change quite quickly, but right now it does feel like it's an environment where
we're far enough away from the epicenter of the crisis where CEO confidence is at a point where strategic transactions
are occurring. And there's an important takeaway about the nature of the transactions, which is some of them are very
large. And when you have a large transaction environment, I referred to the 31 transactions we did in excess of $1
billion in the quarter. Large transactions can have – they won't always, but they can have a catalytic effect either on the
industry or they create subsequent transactions themselves. So again, it could all change on a dime. But right now the
trajectory for merger activity feels pretty good. And obviously over time, that feeds a lot of other activity.
<Q - Christopher M. Kotowski>: Yes, I guess that's what I was getting at. Everybody is looking for an M&A cycle.
And in your view, it's alive and well, and that's not the reason for the decline in the backlog
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, the level of engagement and conversation is quite good. And then look, again I
referred to my crystal ball earlier not being great, but right now it feels pretty good.
<Q - Christopher M. Kotowski>: All right. And then switching gears, the easiest line of your income statement to
predict the last couple years has been the Investment Management business because the AUM was always $850 billion
and it was always $1 billion base management fees I think going all the way back to 2008. And all of a sudden, we are
seeing a significant amount of inflows, and AUM are up nicely two quarters in a row. What's happening there and what
should we expect and what's different?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So we've articulated this in the past. Obviously, this has been a strategic growth area for
us. And it really has been about – it's a bit old-fashioned, but it's been focused on performance, delivering for our
clients, and having differentiated performance. And when you look at our historical multiyear numbers, they look quite
strong, and so you're really starting to see the inflows.
<Q - Christopher M. Kotowski>: Okay, nothing beyond that?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: There have been some very small bolt-on acquisitions, which are disclosed. But this is
really the core drivers' performance, particularly in fixed income this quarter.
<Q - Christopher M. Kotowski>: Okay, that's it for me.

<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Harvey, you made a very interesting point regarding the SLR tailwind from the sale of
Volcker assets. Looking at the metrics where they stand today, assuming that SLR will remain binding, the elimination
of the disallowed assets will provide a meaningful boost to the numerator, which will help both your risk and SLR
ratios. However, the capital relief from any additional shrinkage in I&L I presume will impact the denominator
exclusively, which if SLR is binding actually incentivizes you to engage in more risk-intensive activities. So should we
expect you to boost your permissible I&L investments as you optimize the ROE opportunity that you currently see
based on the capital constraints as they stand today?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I think we should be really clear on this. In no way, shape, or form are we going to let
the regulatory guidelines or ratios or constraints encourage us to change our risk-taking philosophy or how we deploy
our capital. I can't underscore that more strongly. We often make mistakes and we're far from perfect. But as a firm, our
risk culture focused on mark-to-market and our philosophy has served us well. And we're certainly, as I said, not going
to be influenced by metrics that would maybe encourage risk-taking. Quite frankly, we would always rather deploy this
capital into our franchise businesses, and we'll do that as opportunities present themselves.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, fair enough.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: And just one more for me. The Fed in ANPR published earlier this year suggested it would
consider imposing some tougher restrictions on merchant banking activities, whether by more punitive capital
requirements, restrictions on holding periods, what have you. I recognize this is really in the very early stages. But can
you help us think about how your business or the Merchant Banking operation could adapt if tougher restrictions are
imposed? And what level of I&L assets would be classified as Merchant Banking ex those which are disallowed under
Volcker? I'm really just trying to identify what could potentially be exposed.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It's very early in that process, and so I have no discrete insights for you. We'll obviously
participate and have participated in the Federal Reserve's ANPR, and it will be an evolving process. Again, I think the
fundamental takeaway for you to consider and the way we would approach these things is, if needed, if you had an
outcome that restricted our abilities, we would weigh that outcome and our ability to drive value for that capital. And if
we felt we couldn't drive value for that capital, then we would look to return it to the shareholders. I think it's that
simple. You've seen us do it before in things like our insurance business in Europe and our reinsurance business in the
United States. And that's the lens that we'll evaluate all of our capital opportunities. But obviously, we'll discuss this as
we get more clarity.

Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Brennan.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So coming back to commodities, solid results this quarter, certainly encouraging. Maybe can
you talk about your commitment to the physical side of the business and whether or not you think that a regulatory
surcharge on that business could make it still economically viable for you all?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So it all depends, obviously, on the outcome. We don't have any visibility into the
outcome, but again it will depend on whether or not the regulatory constraint is too high a bar. I think more importantly
today, as you know, we have a long history in the commodity business providing our clients, corporate treasurers and
asset managers around the globe, with hedging solutions and access to the marketplace and liquidity, not unlike we do
in the corporate bond market. And separately, we feel we provide value in providing debt and equity capital to the
investing side of the business. But it will evolve over time and we'll adjust accordingly. But it's bit of a wait-and-see.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Have you seen any impact in that market as some high-profile editors have announced plans
to exit or sell or what have you?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So look, this is an important business to us because it's important to our clients. I don't
want to read through too much of this because it's only one quarter, and I think it's hard to extrapolate anything from a

quarter. But certainly in commodities this quarter, in certain sectors the feedback we're getting from clients is that there
may be – and again, I have very limited visibility into our competitors' businesses. But there just may be some benefit
to those market participants that stay strong in commodities like us by those that are deemphasizing or exiting,
particularly when the market is volatile.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, that's helpful color. And can you speak to trends of MD and partner head count over
the last few years, maybe across the firm and by division?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Obviously, as I had mentioned earlier, we've been very focused on cost. We continue to
drive efficiencies throughout the organization in terms of non-comp expenses and obviously also in people. But I don't
really have any specific color for you in terms of by division, et cetera. Obviously, we're managing those resources in
the context of the business activity that the businesses are seeing.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Sure, sure. I was just trying to get a sense of the shift to a more pyramid structure that you
guys have referenced.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sorry, sorry. This is a partner year for us, so it's been two years since we made partners.
And so obviously, we'll be grinding the entire organization through that process this year.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, and then last one. Just in reference to this $9 billion that you've chatted, we've
discussed it a bunch here and the dollar-for-dollar capital hit in I&L. Does your experience this year in needing to use a
mulligan, which I certainly recognize as a positive in trying to shrink the equity base, does that make you a bit nervous
about potential friction in returning that capital and the possibility of trapped capital for a while here as I&L shrinks?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It doesn't. This year, again, there was a difference in outcome between our results and the
Federal Reserve's results. We obviously thought we submitted a severe test, and their outcome was more severe. Again,
I think this process of giving firms the opportunity to adjust, I think it's a good one, and it provides us and the
marketplace all the flexibility. So again, I have to believe – again, it's my opinion only, so discount it as you will. I
have to believe we'll be able to return excess capital over time for the exact reason that excess capital on a sustained
basis for any industry I don't think is a healthy thing. But again, that's just my opinion.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Sounds good. Thanks for the color, Harvey.

quick ones. You've obviously spent some time today talking about the ratio at the holding company. I was just curious
if you could update us on the SLR ratio at the bank level, if that's materially changed from – or materially different
from what you were talking about maybe a quarter ago.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So again, I think what we should do just for the purposes of this conversation is ignore
the last quarter and I'll just focus on the supplementary proposal that's out there because I think the proposal is probably
more relevant for your work.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Great.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: And that number in the bank would be 5.6%.

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: But obviously, there are lots of things that go into the supplementary leverage ratio, so
it's not a primary concern.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay, fair enough. And then you mentioned, and I'm sorry if I missed it, but you
mentioned on the equities trading side of things your particular strength in cash in the first quarter. I guess I'm just
curious if you could give us some color in terms of the trends in the equities derivatives and PB businesses.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So you can't really read anything I don't think into one individual quarter, but I think that
this quarter in particular was probably in some respects tougher for our client base than the headline indices would read
just in terms of their ability to drive performance. But again, the equity business, to be a leading player, you really have
to be strong in all facets of it, which means the prime brokerage business. You have to have a strong research business.
You have to be able to drive IPOs and secondaries. Obviously, you've got to be able to commit capital. That's clearly
important. And obviously, you have to have a huge commitment in technology. And so right now, we feel quite good
about things.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: But in terms of the client activity levels or risk appetite, it sounded like that was a little bit
lower than maybe the headlines would have suggested across your non-cash equities businesses.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So if you look at our commissions and fees line, you can see it's up year over year and
sequentially. But I would say again for certain segments of the client-based asset management in particular for example
and certainly hedge funds, I think it was a tough quarter for them. But I haven't studied all the full results but that's
what I would expect to see.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay, thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks.

And at this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.
Harvey M. Schwartz
So since there are no more questions, on behalf of the team I'd like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the
call. Hopefully, I and other members of senior management will see you in the coming months. If there are any
additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane or the team. Otherwise, please enjoy the rest of your
day. I look forward to talking to you soon. Take care.
