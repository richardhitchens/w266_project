Jan Bennink
Thank you, Melissa. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Let me first say that it is a great pleasure to be with you
today. After almost three months in the business I can say that I am very glad that I joined and be part of this exciting
project.
Now, many investors and friends and anybody have asked me why did I give up my freedom and took this job. To be
very honest with you, I mean, I had been looking at Sara Lee for a while because I found it is an undervalued company
with great assets in coffee and tea and in meats. So when the opportunity came up last year, I grabbed it, and so far I
can assure you that I have not been disappointed – on the contrary.
As you can imagine we are and have been very busy looking at all parts of the business. And I can assure you that we
will leave no stone unturned in our quest to maximize shareholder value. We are very pleased to announce some parts
of the progress today.
Clearly not all news is good today, but we're facing extraordinary headwinds in commodity costs. However, we feel
confident that we can weather this storm with additional price increases, supply chain savings and even harder look at
our fixed costs, which we have been doing for the last couple of years. All the lessons I have personally learned from
being in the dairy business and especially in the milk powder business in my last seven years as a tenure CEO will be
applied and even more.
Let me now move on to the slide number one, the first slide of creating two successful pure play companies. And I
think we basically here to make sure that we will create two very good successful stand-alone companies. And what
we're doing for that is basically four points. The first of all is that we're looking at our portfolio of the company, so
we're looking at the portfolio in the sense, can these businesses deliver a high-growth high margin in the future. And I
think that's what we put against the loop, all those businesses. It's not only in the portfolio of the company, but we're
also looking at that within the two divisions. So every part of the division has to deliver towards our goal of delivering
high growth top line and margin.
As part of that, when we're coming out of a business which was a $20 billion conglomerate of many businesses, and as
a result of that there are many fixed costs related to that. What we're doing now is we want to create two lean and mean
companies which are entrepreneurial in terms of spirit and we're going toward looking at the fixed costs which fit that
profile of the two companies.
Now, for those who know me a little bit from the past, reducing working capital has always been one of my key things
to look at. Now, when I look at the working capital, clearly, Marcel and his team have done a great job in the past. But
if I still look at the numbers, and I like to look at it from a percentage of net sales, rather than as a kind of number of

days, I see that we're about 11%, 12% of total sales. Is it good, is it bad? I think I won't give any guidance, I won't give
any numbers here, but definitely if you look at my past, those numbers do not fit in the things would I like to achieve.
The organizational structure is similar to creating two entrepreneurial companies. Being a division is one; being a
stand-alone company is very, very different. Very different in terms of management needs, in terms of structure of the
company, where you go for, so we are looking at that and we'll continue to look at that very closely, how do we
maximize the management, how do we maximize our structures as such that we will have two very clear companies
going out of the gates at the moment of the spin, which will be in the early next year, fiscal '12.
Now talking about the future is all nice and easy but I think meanwhile we have to run a business and that is critical and
I think we have to be rest assured that we will not forget to run our current business. There is a couple of things which
make it sure and we'll make sure that we'll deliver our results, as far as we can promise, accelerate fixed cost
reductions. We will put extra gas on looking at our fixed costs. Doing it now rather than doing it tomorrow. So that's
one thing and one promise you have from the whole management team.
Variable cost reductions, the supply chain I think also there, I said right in the beginning it is absolutely critical that we
look at those things faster, more efficient, and leave no stone unturned. Things which were sacred cows before will be
looked at and we'll look at how we can reduce our variable costs.
Energizing and accelerating our innovation pipeline. I think coming to the company I think I was surprised by the
amount of innovations in the pipeline. Very nice. Our R&D center in coffee as well as in meats in the U.S. are doing a
lot in innovation. So what we're doing and what we're looking at, how can we accelerate the innovations, how can we
make sure that we don't wait for them but do actually more and create a new pipeline?
Actually next week we're starting a company-wide project with very young and energetic teams all over the companies
both in Europe and the U.S. We call it Energy in Motion to accelerate and to kind of make people think about the future
and how to make sure that innovations becomes part of our DNA. Part of that is boost our marketing spending. You've
seen in the results and Marcel will come back to that later that we have decided not to give up our marketing spend in
order to cover our bottom line.
We will say we have things to defend, we have great brands and it will be a great pity to stop our marketing spend. On
top of that, which is not on the chart, and I think we've put in place some very simple reporting mechanisms, which will
allow us to monitor the business very, very closely. It's getting also that people in divisions used to having monitored
very simply with one page where we go and how are we doing things.
So that is in terms of the work stream of current today. We have a work stream of tomorrow. And we have a work
stream which is a work stream of making sure that all the things, which are with the spin which are not necessarily
business building but which are absolutely necessary, there is a complete, dedicated work stream to making sure that
from a financial point of view, from a current work point of view these things work perfectly.
As you see the preparation for accountings are on track completely. The readiness for IRS ruling, we are completely on
track, making the portfolio decisions, we'll come back to that later in my speech. Organizational structure, I think I've
talked enough about it. We'll make it very, very clear that our new organization will be ready to have the challenges of
being an independent company.
And the balance sheet optimization. We're looking at how to make sure that we'll two have healthy companies coming
out of the gates next year.
Okay, having talked about that I would like to take a step back and look at our North American meats business and I'd
like to look at our international business.
First of all, I think I am very pleased to announce an acquisition of Aidells. This is I think the first acquisition, and we
went back to history a long, long, long, long time and make an acquisition in meats. I think I'm very happy with it and
I'm happy with it for a couple of reasons.

First of all, Aidells premium sausage is getting us into a segment of the market where we are not playing. Normally, I
would say, we will be more industrial middle of the road, a good but middle of the road company in terms of the meats.
This will get us into a premium segment. We see a lot of movements too with the premium in all food segments,
definitely also in the sausages and in the meats business.
And this will give us a great entry, great entry in terms of consumers and the consumers, the premium consumers, the
people who are more organic and more natural related, which are growing. And on top, we will have now presence in
Whole Foods and a much better presence in Costco, where these businesses are more related. And we were traditionally
were weaker in these kind of areas. So very good from a consumer point of view and very good from a trade point of
view.
We tend to do this business in a separation. I mean we'll separate it as a separate business unit. So also we'll teach our
organization to make sure that how does an entrepreneurial company work. So there will be a learning element. We'll
put our Gallo salami in the business, and we'll have it run as a separate one, giving us an example of how an
entrepreneurial company can run.
The price, we paid $87 million for it; the revenue is approximately $100 million and the EPS accretive after year two –
in year two, actually that is because we're putting extra marketing spending behind it. Otherwise I could tell you the
best news that it will be accretive as of moment one.
Moving from meats to kind of another part. What does evaluating our strategic options for a part of the meat business?
And that is the, we call it inside our private label retail business, refrigerated dough. We are looking at that business,
whether that really fits with our strategy. Does it deliver the high growth, high margin we're looking for, and that will –
we'll have a very, very key look at it. It's currently $326 million. We refer it as, we call it store brands, the separate unit
within the meats business. So I think you'll hear more from us in the later stage.
We've talked about meats, and from meats we'll move on to the international part, the International Bakery as I like to
call it, the Coffee and Tea business, rather than International Beverage. But I can't change names I have been told, so I
think I might keep it the Coffee and Tea business. So here in the International Bakery, for those of you who know our
business very well, they probably know it, but many people refer to it as International Bakery, actually International
Bakery consists of three varied segments, different segments. First of all it's our Bimbo business, and people know that
business probably for sure it's the fresh bread business. And in Spain we have a refrigerated dough business called
EuroDough based in France, and that is very similar actually to the business we have for North America. It is the
croissants, the cinnamon buns like the Pillsbury Doughboy in the U.S.
And then we have an Australia [ph] Fireway (12:05) and actually Australia is probably one of our best performing
coffee and tea companies, and we just wonder whether it makes sense to have in that very successful Coffee and Tea
business a frozen dessert business and we wonder what it would do if the focus would be completely on coffee.
So here we are talking about – again you see the numbers in terms of sales, looking at what we want to do with the
business in the future. So very clear focus on the meats and the acquisition there, and the other side, looking at
businesses, whether they fit our long-term, I would say, mid-term goal of achieving good profits and high turnover.
We've announced previously two dispositions. It's good to keep you on track and to keep you informed about that. The
North American Fresh Bakery, it's completely on track as we've stated before. We expect to close by the end of fiscal
'11, and I think that is as much as I can and want to say about it.
In terms of Household and Body Care, I mean, that has been a long process, but on the other hand, very positive now
that I can say that 97% of the proceeds have been received. Cash in the bank. Australia/New Zealand Bleach closed,
Global Shoe Care and insecticides is expected to close in the second half of the calendar. So I think this gives you a
kind of an overview of where we are in terms of our total strategic review. And I feel very pleased about it, and I think
you haven't heard the last from us. And I'd like now to pass the word on to Marcel, who will go and make a deep dive
into our businesses. Marcel, up to you.

Marcel H. M. Smits
Good. Thank you, Jan. Good morning to everybody on the call. Ladies and gentlemen, Jan has given you a good
overview on the progress that we're making in terms of setting up both pure-play companies for success. And part of
that effort is to ensure that we weather the commodity storm that is currently raging around us. We're working our way
through some 900 basis points of commodity cost increases in Coffee and Tea, some 700 basis points in North
American Retail and Foodservice. And both of those, of course, are expressed as a percentage of sales.
Now if you allow me, let's take a step back. We're dealing here with the proverbial rock and a hard place. We either
take price and then risk some short-term volume, or we don't take enough price and then we risk our long-term margin
structure. And as you know, and what we've been communicating before, we have made our pick. Having to make a
tough choice, you might as well pick the option you think is going to least harm you in the long haul. The priority,
therefore, is to protect our margin structure and hence our ability to invest behind our brands.
To some extent, we can and have offset increased commodity costs with productivity improvements, but it is inevitable
that we have to take price. We've been very resolute about doing just that and we've been willing to accept the
short-term volume risk. Protecting our margins is part one of setting both companies up for success, and investing in
MAP is part two. In every quarter of this year, we increased our marketing spend. And in the fourth quarter we'll spend
less than last year's unusually high level, but we will be spending at what I would call business as usual levels. And
we've made a determination not to cut to the bone. Fortunately, we've been able to take a significant amount of costs
out of our business, in particular in the corporate expenses, and that has provided a fair amount of tailwind.
So here are the key messages. Adjusted net sales were up 6% thanks to pricing and a positive contribution from mix.
And that's real progress. Zooming in on pricing then I'd say we are on strategy. North American Retail, we saw 6%
coming through. For the first time in four quarters we've been able to offset our commodity cost increases with savings
in pricing. And that's a major piece of good news. As a result, we did take a volume decline. Our mix gain was
insufficient to make up for that volume decline and that's disappointing but it is on strategy.
In North American Foodservice meanwhile we really turned the corner. Commodities versus pricing and productivity
were not a drag in the quarter but more importantly, sales and profit in the quarter were both up and that's a break with
the trend of the recent quarters. As you know, we've been working through the loss of two large contracts in fiscal
2010.
In International Beverage then, during the quarter we've broken through many barriers of retailers resisting price
increases. These increases will flow through the sales line in the third and the fourth quarter. In the third quarter we
reported a 6% increase coming from pricing, and that is as yet not enough to offset our commodity cost increase and
we're working hard to get ahead of the curve.
Meanwhile, the good news is that despite the price hikes, our volume was actually a small positive, as was our mix. On
a cumulative basis then our adjusted operating income from continuing operations is down $82 million. Of that, $61
million is mark to market impact of currency. And let me just briefly explain that.
Last year the dollar strengthened against the euro and we recorded a gain on our long dollar positions in Europe relating
to our business buying coffee forward in dollars. So we buy coffee forward in dollars, and we hedge those positions
against euros. This year, the dollar has weakened against the euro, and we've had to take a mark-to-market loss.
Between the gain from last year and the hit from this year, there is a $61 million variance. And we've also spent an
additional $24 million in MAP spending. Excluding these two items, we're flat. Now, it's obviously not where we want
to be. But if it's the net outcome of dealing with a $650 million commodity storm, it's not bad either.
The last key message then is an adjustment of guidance. We miss by $0.06, and hence, we miss our numbers. Over half
of it relates to volume risks in both North American Retail and Foodservice and our Coffee and Tea business.
Since our last guidance in January, we've been confronted with an additional $100 million of commodity cost increases.
We're going to get most of this back in pricing and additional productivity gains, but we are now reaching price levels
where we're incurring additional volume risk.

The remainder of the call then relates to International Bakery business. And we'll talk about that in a minute when we
get to the discussion of the International Bakery segment. While we're not pleased to miss the numbers, we're confident
that we're doing the right thing for the long-term health of the business.
Going forward, the imperatives are the following. First of all, we've got to get ahead of the curve in pricing in Coffee
and Tea business. We're confident that we'll get there. Secondly, it's imperative that we keep up our MAP investments
and that we keep innovating. Thirdly, it's imperative that we further reduce costs. And we're very confident that we can
do that, aided, among others, by the conclusion that the split of the company presents additional opportunities for cost
reductions.
So what you can expect from us, essentially, is more of the same: protect the margin structure, invest behind the brands,
and cut expenses as aggressively as you can.
And with that said, let's go into some further detail. This slide shows our sequential estimates of commodity cost
increases in the comparison of fiscal '11 to fiscal '10. Back in August when we started the year, we expected some $200
million of headwind.
Every quarter the estimate has moved up and our current estimate is $650 million. Roughly half of that is in North
American Retail and Foodservice and the other half is in Coffee and Tea. And the text below summarizes the strategy:
protect the margin, accept short-term volume risk, cut costs.
Here you see the progression in terms of pricing. The fourth quarter the price component will again increase based on
pricing actions taken during the third quarter, but not yet fully reflected in Q3 and based on actions taken in the last
quarter.
International Bakery stands out and has gone in the wrong direction. In France we're confronted with price competition
we didn't have before, but really the key issue is Spain. We were confronted in the third quarter with a competitor
dropping its branded pricing to levels below private label and effectively entering into a price war. We decided to
vigorously defend and took our pricing down and that's why we missed the guidance in this part of the business.
Now, in every crisis there's an opportunity. Firstly, we've accelerated the discussion with the Spanish unions on
wanting to move our sales force to an independent operator model. We expect to reach a conclusion on that soon. And
that will help to recover most of what we're now losing in price.
The second opportunity that we do see is a large volume uptick, and in particular private label in the Spanish market
has taken a heavy toll. As said, we've brought our guidance down by $0.06.
On this slide, we're showing you the breakdown of the results by quarter, split by segment income, and the upper part
of the slide and corporate in the middle. There are two important conclusions to be drawn from this slide.
Firstly, our last quarter projection for segment income is not unhealthy. It's going to be a satisfactory quarter in line
with the last two. And in the comparison with last year, it'll actually be a strong quarter. Below the line of segment
income, as you can see here, our corporate expenses are going to be higher in the fourth quarter than they have been in
the second and the third. We've made great progress in reducing our corporate expenses. And we see a lot of room to
bring it down again next year. That said, in the fourth quarter we have to deal with some stranded expenses and some
commodity mark-to-market losses.
The second important conclusion from this slide is that we are targeting what I would call a normal MAP level. We're
not going to be cutting off our nose in order to hit our guidance.
Now here we compare our updated guidance with the figures we gave you on the 28th of January. Of the approximately
$70 million miss more than half related to our core North American Retail and Foodservice and Coffee and Tea
business and less than half relates to International Bakery. It translates into $0.06, and that's a bit less than one would
expect from the adjustment in operating income. We've had a little bit of tailwind from share counts, interest expenses,
and of course, currency.

Now let's go into the business segments, starting with North American Retail. As we've previously called out, pricing
actions coupled with productivity gains enabled the business to offset commodity increases in the quarter, a major
breakthrough. We benefited from a mix gain, but as we discussed, volume took a hit.
Let me just highlight that Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm, two of our core retail brands, posted sales growth in the
quarter and volume and market share gains in the key categories of lunch meat and breakfast sandwiches. We had
volume setbacks, fresh breakfast sausage, smoked sausage and hot dogs, mainly as a result of pricing ahead of the
market. Here we have the key figures showing the development of this business quarter-by-quarter.
Now let me start with the bottom line of the slide. Our third quarter margin came in at 12.8% and that's definitively the
good news. At the top end you see net sales. We've grown sales in all three quarters but growth in the second and the
third quarter was lower than in the first quarter. And the reason for that is shown a couple of lines below. We're making
progress in pricing quarter-by-quarter. Our mix is positive in each quarter, but our volume was down in the second and
the third quarter. We're increasingly seeing signs that price increases are being replicated and that makes us cautiously
optimistic that the worst may be behind us.
Now I've made a strong point on wanting to maintain MAP spending and in North American Retail in the third quarter,
we dialed back a little bit. In the fourth quarter, we will spend at normal levels appropriate for the innovations that we
have coming through.
Last year, we spent considerably more behind innovations in a number of consumer acceptance tests. This drove our
MAP spending to unusually high levels. From last year's test, we know that these investments actually do pay off. Later
in the year, the management team of new Sara Lee will present themselves to you, and I'm not here to steal their
thunder, but you can assume that cost reductions in order to finance MAP increases are going to be part of their
strategy.
Turning to the North American Foodservice business, we've got good news across the segment. The segment is really
our poster child of cost reductions, driving growth in the areas where you can make real money and leaving less
profitable sales behind. We did well in meats, frozen bakery, and liquid coffee. And those are exactly the areas where
we have sustainable advantage.
And here are the financials quarter-by-quarter. In the third quarter, sales were up, operating income was up, and that's
actually very encouraging, considering that we're still working through the loss of two large contracts in the prior year
as you know that, remember.
Our Coffee and Tea business then. The bad news is that we're still lagging commodity cost increases as I've explained.
In addition in the Benelux, we're fighting a tough battle with private label and Senseo. And to put it real simple, our
price premiums are insufficiently supported by brand equity and differentiation. That has led to market share loss in
that region. The solution is to redouble our efforts to strengthen the equity of Senseo and we're working on that, but just
to manage expectation, we're not going to be fixing that in the next quarter.
Now the good news. And we've got lots of it. Firstly, in the third quarter we broke through nearly all the glass ceilings
of strong pushbacks from our customers on the need to take price. The inevitability of price increases is now accepted.
Private label is taking price as well.
Secondly, the price increases would appear to have a muted impact on volumes. We do, of course, see some consumers
trending a bit more towards private label, simply because absolute prices are starting to give reasons to pause when
they stand in front of the shelf, but it's not dramatic. In fact, overall for the segment as a whole we're actually showing a
small volume increase in the third quarter.
Thirdly, then, our innovation is giving us real lift, and that is showing up in the mix. Senseo keeps growing, driven by
Germany, France, Spain, and, of course, of late, Brazil. Our L'Or capsules keep going strong. We've launched new
variants and we've launched into new countries. We're now present in France, the Netherlands and since a couple of
days we're in Spain. Recently we launched our Napolitano capsules in Spain, and, of course, we're putting money
behind all of these innovations.

Fourthly, then, it turns out that we did a nice acquisition in Brazil with Damasco. We've got this right. We came out of
the gate with good volumes. We believe the brand has legs better than anticipated and we're ahead of the business case.
Here are the financials. A couple of notes. I've already explained the impact of currency mark to market on our
operating income, and the footnote of this slide is actually really important. This year we took a $31 million hit from
currency mark to market and that's in the footnote. Last year we had a $30 million benefit.
Now, we tend to filter the $61 million delta out in order to make our own comparisons. And if you correct for it you'll
see that our profit decline in the third quarter roughly equals our MAP increase. And that means that the negative
commodity to pricing impact is absorbed by gains from organic growth and innovation as well as cost improvements.
Now lastly, just a quick clarification, you'll see that in particular in the third quarter our 13.2% sales increase is more
than the addition of price, volume, and mix. The difference is Brazilian export business. We export beans from Brazil
to Europe and that volume is sharply up, below margin revenue that allows us to capture nice tax benefits.
Now moving to our final business segment, International Bakery. I've already explained the issue. Let me just
summarize. The business underperforms. We face serious price competition, in particular in Spain. We've had to react
and see volumes rebound. We're working on taking out the next layer of costs, but it will come too late to avoid taking
a hit in profitability this year and that contributed to the margin, to the guidance adjustments. The financials then come
as no surprise. You see the pricing impact on the resulting operating income decline.
And with that let me just turn it over to Mark Garvey for a review of our financials.
Mark A. Garvey
Thank you, Marcel. And welcome, everyone. I would now like to walk you through the third quarter results in some
more detail. On this slide, you can see adjusted operating segment income for the third quarter and year to date for
fiscal '11 with comparisons to same periods in fiscal '10. Total adjusted operating income was $230 million for the third
quarter compared to $257 million last year, and year-to-date adjusted operating income was $658 million compared to
$740 million in fiscal '10. Now as an adjusted operating segment income level, the results were primarily impacted by
commodity costs net of pricing, particularly in the International Beverage segment; volume softness in North America
Retail; and weakness in International Bakery due to price competition in Spain. In addition, as Marcel has said, MAP
was 12% higher in the third quarter and is 11% higher year-to-date.
On the other hand we are pleased to see corporate costs lower than last year for the third quarter in a row. In this
quarter corporate and other costs were $25 million favorable to last year, $13 million of which was accounted for by
positive commodity mark-to-market variances. Year-to-date corporate and other costs were $83 million lower than
fiscal '10, of which $23 million related to positive mark to market. Core corporate costs are lower primarily due to
accelerated savings and pension cost reductions coming through.
Now as I mentioned, rising commodity costs were a significant factor impacting the performance of the International
Beverage segment during the quarter and year to date. As Marcel has discussed our coffee commodity costs do include
adjustments for currency mark to market each quarter. And on this slide you can see more detail at the impact by
quarter to date for fiscal '11 and the comparison to last year. In the third quarter, we had a currency mark-to-market loss
of $15 million compared to a gain of $13 million in the third quarter of last year, therefore, a negative delta of $28
million, and year to date this delta is a negative $61 million for International Beverage.
This slide quantifies in more detail the primary drivers of the year-over-year changes in adjusted operating income
from fiscal '10. Pricing net of commodities were a negative $61 million in the third quarter, $28 million of which can
be attributed to currency mark to market as just discussed. Project Accelerate contributed $10 million in savings and
MAP investment was $8 million higher. The lean savings commodity mark-to-market gains as well as lower pension
costs drove additional operating income and were somewhat offset by a lower volume mix result and costs for Kansas
City and our SAP implementation in North America, which we've discussed with you before. A similar theme is
evident for the year-to-date results, with pricing net of commodities as a negative $154 million, Accelerate savings of

$59 million and additional MAP investment of $29 million.
Now let me turn to earnings per share. For the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.25. There were a
number of events during the quarter as we continued to work on closing the Household and Body Care sales and started
ramping up the activity in preparation for creating two pure-play companies. Firstly, the completion of the sale of the
Asian Pacific Detergents business in the quarter resulted in the gain of $0.05, which is included in our reported
earnings under discontinued operations.
We also incurred termination charges related to certain household and body care licensing agreements amounting to
$0.04, which were also recorded in discontinued operations. In addition, there were significant items incurred related to
Project Accelerate, spin-off related costs and exit and severance actions in our International businesses as we continued
to work down stranded overhead. This then brings us to adjusted earnings per share of $0.30 for the third quarter, $0.24
of which relates to continuing operations and compares to adjusted EPS of $0.22 for continuing operations in the third
quarter of fiscal '10.
During the third quarter, we completed our share repurchase commitment for fiscal '11. In total 80 million shares were
repurchased this fiscal year at an average price of $16.21 per share. Since the program was initiated in fiscal '10 we
have bought back 117 million shares for $1.8 billion at an average price of $15.55. And as we have communicated
previously, we plan to pay a special dividend of $3 in fiscal '12, which when paid will bring the total amount returned
to shareholders to approximately $3.5 billion.
We are updating our guidance for cash from operations to a range of $400 million to $450 million primarily due to the
update in operating income guidance. As I have previously explained, the overall reduction in cash flow from
operations from $952 million at fiscal '10 is primarily due to reduced cash flow from discontinued operations this year
as well as negative working capital impacts arising from the commodity costs environment. In addition, we are
reducing our capital expenditure guidance by $25 million to range of $375 million to $400 million.
Now let me quickly update you on Project Accelerate, which remains on track and has contributed significant cost
savings. We expect cumulative savings of between $300 million and $350 million through fiscal '12. We have reached
cumulative savings of approximately $204 million through the third quarter of fiscal '11 and this will grow to between
$225 million and $235 million by the end of the year. Overall costs for the project are expected to be around $280
million, the majority of which have already been incurred.
Before I conclude I would like to update you on some of the impacts to fiscal '12 earnings per share, which I discussed
last quarter. There are some tailwinds that will benefit our earnings per share in fiscal '12, which we currently estimate
to be approximately $0.17 per share, of which $0.02 relates to the International Bakery business and the North
American Refrigerated Dough business, both of which are up for strategic review.
Now these tailwinds include the annualization of the reduced share count following the completion of the $1.3 billion
of repurchases this fiscal year. Pension expense is now expected to decline by approximately $25 million next year
based on current assumptions, and amortization costs will decline by around $30 million, of which $20 million relates
to the businesses under strategic review.
And we continue to expect to make good progress in eliminated the stranded costs for Household and Body Care and
Fresh Bakery. In addition, based on current exchange rates we should have currency favorability next year. We will
provide more complete guidance for fiscal '12 in August.
Now let me turn back to Marcel for some concluding remarks.
Marcel H. M. Smits
Thank you, Mark. I'd like to conclude this section of today's call with a few points. In late January, we told you of our
plans to spin the company into two pure-play, vibrant, standalone businesses, and we've told you that the definition of
success was not to just do the accounting work or the tax work and give you two pieces of paper, but the definition of

success is that we deliver to you two companies which have excellent margin and growth profiles. And I'm pleased to
say that we're making great progress towards that goal.
We've made some important strategic decisions, which includes today the announcement of the intent to acquire
Aidells sausage company in North America. In addition we discussed the plans to evaluate our strategic options
regarding the North American Refrigerated Dough business and our International Bakery segment, and that will all
help to enhance the margin and growth profile of both businesses.
On the operational side then, the strategy is very clear. We have to cover our commodity cost inflation through price
increases and cost savings in order to enable us to continue to build our brands, superior marketing and innovation.
We're committed to that strategy and we have great confidence that it will lead to an enhanced margin and growth
profile for both businesses.
Going forward we'll continue to invest in our brands, optimize operations and processes and manage commodity cost
inflation. And I think that I speak for the entire senior management of Sara Lee when I say that we're excited about the
successful future and prospects of these two new companies.
With that said, let's turn it over to Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from Terry Bivens. Your line is open, and state your company, please.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Hi, I'm from JPMorgan. Good morning.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Good morning, Terry.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Good morning. Terry.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Jan, one thing I wanted to ask you about I found intriguing in your remarks, the comment on
Senseo's brand equity. I think there are a lot of us out here that think perhaps that particular product could have been
better managed and I'd like to get just briefly your ideas on what exactly can be done, particularly with all the
competition in single serve? Where do you think that goes in terms of rebuilding or building again the brand equity?
<A - Jan Bennink>: Okay. Very good question, Terry, because I think that's one I've been focusing on a lot coming
into the [indiscernible] (38:21) business. I think if you put – just as a – we are the number one single serve sale in terms
of machines, far above a very well-known competitor, and if you compare what our well-known competitor is doing
and if you compare what Senseo is doing, I think if you put them in a kitchen, in a room, you can see the difference.
And I think that basically would be – we would like to be much, much better, much more innovative in terms of
machines, in terms of what you can deliver in terms of product, so much more innovation, much more innovative,
much more pleasant to have in your kitchen.
Now, having said that, within your single serves, I think you have to identify that one type of machine, an espresso
machine, is very much focused on espresso drinkers. Luckily there are a couple of people, about 30% of the population
likes espresso, and there's 70% of people who like more the filter and drip coffee. So we are going towards the filter
drip coffee people while the espresso machines are going for the espresso drinkers. So we have a very clear segment of
our consumers and we want to make our brand as exciting if not more exciting than our key competitors, so that is a
clear mandate we've given to our Senseo team and they have started to work very hard on that.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Okay. Thanks very much for that color. I'll pass it along.

Thank you. Next question. Vincent Andrews, your line is open and state your company name please.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: It's Morgan Stanley. Thank you and good morning everyone.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Good morning.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Hi Vincent.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: I just wanted to bridge the commentary about the volume risk in the core business, because
from the results in the quarter it looked like the problems you were having relative to price were more in the
International Beverage business versus the North American Retail business. So I guess my two questions are, one,
when you say volume risk in the core business on a go forward basis, I assume you're talking about both businesses,
and it looks like maybe from that retail slide that you're starting to see great elasticity as the price is going higher and
you're worried about what's happening going forward.
And then just the second part of that would just be, you speak broadly about short-term volume losses versus long-term
margin protection. And I guess I just want to understand why you feel like the volume loss would be short-term in
nature because we see most other consumer businesses that the volume loss from pricing doesn't necessarily come
back.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Correct. Thank you, Vincent, that's very helpful. I'm sure that Jan will have observations to
add. Let me just give you a couple of observations from my side. First of all, where's the volume risk? As you said, it's
indeed in both businesses. We're in uncharted waters now. In some countries we're taking the fourth price increase on
the coffee and tea side. In the North American meat side, we're taking pretty big hikes. And it's just difficult to predict
two things, what is it that consumers will do? Will people trend down to private label? Won't they? And secondly, it's
also very difficult to predict where the competitors are going to come out.
I've said, look, we are cautiously optimistic that everybody seems to be recognizing the realities on the ground. I think
we've made some noise about the fact that in the European retailing scene private labels are actually coming up quite
nicely. So in that particular part of our universe, people do seem to recognize the realities and actually reflect that in
pricing. But at these price levels, we've never been here. Consumers in the Netherlands stand in front of a shelf and
they look at a 500-gram filter coffee pack and they have to pay close to €5. That's something they haven't seen before.
So we have some uncertainty on the volume component. And then in respect of the long-term volume loss, we feel
pretty good about the strength of our brands. I think we have a convincing track record of actually growing share. If
you look at the last four years, what's happened with the core brands in which we've been investing, we've actually
outperformed the market very, very significantly. You'll remember that we had a slide on that in the CAGNY
[Consumer Analyst Group of New York] presentation, the four core brands were growing with top line growth of
something like double digits over the last four years on a CAGR basis. So that's pretty healthy growth, good brands.
We've got good innovation coming through, very confident about the innovation coming through next year.
So yes, we're taking a short-term hit, but we feel pretty good about our track record. And we also feel, driven by all the
innovation that we've got coming down the pipeline, we feel pretty good about our long-term prospects. The last thing
that I would say is I think we are all becoming increasingly convinced that the MAP levels in this business need to go
up, both on the coffee side and on the meat side. That's something that you can't do overnight, but that's just another
impetus to having a really good look at your costs.
We've had Jan coming in here, and he's basically turning every page and everything that doesn't make any money is
immediately questioned, and everything that is on a cost page is immediately questioned. And we're going to be
chucking as much as we can overboard. And a big chunk of that we'll put back into the market in terms of MAP
investments.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Just a slight addition to the short-term versus the mid-term volume loss and pickup. I think if you
look at the volume losses, if you look at coffee and tea specifically, you would look at roast and ground and you would

look at Senseo more than – in the Benelux countries. I think on the Senseo, I think I've given an answer before to Terry
in terms of that we're focusing on that business a lot and we've been convinced that we will get volume back in that
area. The other part, which is a big one, is roast and ground.
Roast and ground, to give you an example, I think the main brand of the Benelux, I think when I was a kid it looked
exactly the same as it looks now. And that's a long time ago, I can assure you. And I think that doesn't work. Such
things don't work. And I think the roast and ground people, old people think it's dead. I think it is one of the most
exciting areas where we can develop things. Nobody – it is a – people like roast and ground, and the beans comes back,
everything comes back. And I think we just – we have a lot of work to do in making sure that we reinvent that category
and make it exciting, like Starbucks has shown us that roast and ground can be very, very interesting.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thanks very much for all the detail. I'll pass it along.

Thank you. Next question, Ken Zaslow [BMO Capital Markets], your line is open and state your company please.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow CFA>: Bank of Montreal. Good morning, everyone. Hello?
<A - Jan Bennink>: Go ahead whenever you want.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: We just said good morning to you, so go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow CFA>: I have just two quick points of clarification, making sure I understand the
clarification, and then I wanted to ask a bigger picture question. First, on the $0.17 for 2012, did it always include the
$40 million from FX?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: No, it did not, Ken. So we're adding that in now because as we get closer to the end of the
year we're getting more visibility on currency. So we had not done that before, so that's new.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Yes, and the currency effect, of course, has moved very, very considerably over the last three
months.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: That's right.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow CFA>: I thought previously it was $0.15 to $0.20. So did something change negatively to
offset the...?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yes. So let's just give you a bit of color on that. We had $0.15 before. What's changed is our
pension assumption. We had $40 million of savings. Now, we're saying $25 million. We will measure pensions finally
at the end of June. But there's been changes in mortality table assumptions and inflation assumptions in the Netherlands
and the U.K. So that's what changed since we spoke to you last time.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow CFA>: Okay. And then the second point of clarification, in terms of the full year guidance, I
know you took it down by $0.06. The benefit from the currency as well, is that another $0.04? So, operationally it was
down a little more than like about close to $0.10? Is that a fair way to start just from a modeling standpoint?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: No. For the fiscal year, the currency effect actually is very small, because I think we went
from $1.34 to $1.36, I think, in terms of our average for the year. So it's not significant at all for the fiscal year, Ken.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: We've had a major upswing in the – or downswing in the dollar, because it's depreciating
very sharply over the last few weeks. But that has a very limited impact on the quarter.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow CFA>: Okay. So the bigger picture question to me, which is probably a hundred times more
important, is if you take out the $0.17 benefit, to what extent can Sara Lee grow operationally and where will the

positioning – where will you be able to grow more aggressively on the meat side or the coffee side? Because $0.17
doesn't seem that it's operational, but it seems like there is some way that you believe that you're going to be able to
grow in 2012 beyond that $0.17. Is that a fair assessment?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yes, that's a fair assumption. And that's why we're calling out the components of $0.17.
The $0.17 doesn't include any benefit from accelerated savings. It doesn't include any benefits from dissolving the
current corporate overhead structure. It doesn't include any of the swing from currency. And this year, we're taking a
$30 million negative mark-to-market, which hopefully all things being equal should normally be a zero.
It doesn't include any of the benefits of innovation, further rollouts of L'Or, further rollouts of Senseo, and it doesn't
include some of the stuff that Jan has been talking about in terms of putting more emphasis on innovation, in particular,
in roast and ground and Senseo.
So what we're doing here is we're giving you a figure for this year. We're giving you some stuff that is pretty mechanic,
and then the race of course is on to try and get as much operational improvements over and above that. And those are
the three buckets. And the operational improvements – we're really not in a position to do that yet. So that's going to
come in August.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow CFA>: And is it also fair, if the primal values keep on falling, the price stickiness of your
price increases should stick? So would that create potential margin expansion in the retail meat division in 2012?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yes. We're aiming for price increases, obviously, to stick. And basically what we're trying
to do is we're trying to make sure that both in North America and in Coffee, based on current price levels of
commodities, whatever price increases we need, we're just going to try and get them in in the fourth quarter. And that's
not going to be entirely done in Coffee and Tea. That's the objective in North America. We may have some overflow.
But we're going to try and get as much done as we can in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow CFA>: Great. I appreciate it. Thank you very much.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Next question, Jason English [Goldman Sachs], your line is open and state your company name, please.
<Q - Jason English>: Hey. Good morning, folks. Jason English here.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Good morning.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Hey, Jason.
<Q - Jason English>: I'm doing well. Thank you, and thanks for the color to that last question. I think that was good
information. And let me build off the last point there on pricing in the price inflation delta. I think absent the currency
mark-to-market, you've got roughly a $90 million negative deficit between price and inflation year-to-date. At what
point do you think that you're able to close that gap?
I know you had been originally targeting, hopefully, end of year for International Beverage. Does that still hold or has
that changed? And then building on that further and kind of to Ken's question, I guess, do you see any opportunity to
actually recover that deficit, so generate a surplus any time over the next 12, 18 months?
<A - Jan Bennink>: Yes. I'd be real cautious on generating any expectations on the surplus. So let me just give you –
because we had anticipated somebody ask this question. So thank you for that.
In North America, we are now at the point where commodity cost increases have been recovered through productivity
gains and pricing. So we've got that behind us. All of that is just contingent on not getting another huge hike of
commodity prices over and above what we now have because then, obviously, the dynamics shift again.

Coffee and Tea, we're lagging just on our calculation. I have little doubt that that's accurate. In Coffee and Tea, we
reckon that we're not going to be able to make everything up in the fourth quarter. We reckon that we'll have a little bit
of overflow in terms of negative commodity pricing variability in the first quarter. We're aiming to hit the milestone
that we've hit in North America in the third quarter. We're aiming for that to be hit in the second quarter of next year. Is
that clear?
<Q - Jason English>: Yes. No. That's helpful. Thank you. And then another question – this is a bit of a flyer. Marcel,
I've always been impressed with your knowledge of taxes. There has been a lot of chatter lately – I think that with your
initial coming out of Cagney, you dropped a lot of knowledge on us on the topic. So let me come back at you and tap
into that knowledge base. There has been a lot of chatter recently about potentially a repatriation tax holiday.
Hypothetically speaking, if that were to happen, what would the implications be for Sara Lee?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: It's a subject that we're following very, very closely. There was some chatter this morning.
The last time there was a Homeland repatriation position was in 2005. And there were some very strict conditions
imposed and restrained; there's a couple fences put around that in order for it not to be too big. We reckon that you
should not put that into our equation, so we're not sitting here saying, okay, fine, that's going to be a real plus for us.
We think it's likely to be too late for us. If the 2005 rules of the game are anything to go by, it's really questionable
whether or not it'd be applicable to us, so we're not counting on that. We're working on, as we've said earlier, we're
working on ways to optimize our balance sheet, and we have nothing to say about that today other than saying that
we've made a lot of progress in terms of our thinking over the last two or three months. But don't pin your hopes on
another Homeland repatriation.
<Q - Jason English>: Very well. I'll pass it on. Thank you for your time.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Thank you. Sorry, if I may, one more – I should have said one thing, and that is if it
actually comes combined with a lowering of the corporate tax rate, that in any scenario is, of course, very good news
for Sara Lee, because for the reasons that we've explained to you in the past, you know our meats profits are fully taxed
here in the US, and our coffee profits in any scenario, and I'm not going to go into the teaching that we've done the last
time, our coffee profits will also be impacted in any scenario by the tax rate here in the US. So if there's really thinking
that the tax rate could go to 25% that would be really welcome.
<Q - Jason English>: I'm sure, it would. All right. Thank you, guys.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Thanks.

please.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Yes, it's Sanford Bernstein. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Good morning.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Can I pick up on Terry's question from the beginning, taking about the private label situation
with Senseo in Europe. To what extent – you've talked a lot about the benefit of having Senseo as an open system. As
you move into new generations of product, how carefully are you thinking about maybe changing that?

<A - Jan Bennink>: I mean, it always will be – will it be as open as it is now, we're looking at can we close it a little
bit more. Definitely that's part of our thinking. But don't expect it to be completely closed but there's definitely ways of
how can we make it more ours rather than becoming part of a total system.

Thank you. Next, Eric Katzman [Deutsche Bank], your line is open and state your company, please.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: It's Deutsche Bank. Good morning.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Hey, Eric.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: There's no way I'm limiting it to one question, sorry. Okay, the first one, why do you, given
that most companies are excluding the mark to market commodity changes and I think you've done that in the past, why
wouldn't you do the same thing for currency, and how does the – does the mark to market currency have any impact on
the $40 million that you're pointing to as a fiscal 2012 positive swing factor?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: No, Eric, it's Mark. It has no impact on the 2012 guidance that I gave you. We did start to call
out currency mark to mark last year. It's traditionally included in our International Beverage results as opposed to called
out separately by commodity mark to mark. And we may look at doing it different in the future when we set up the
companies, but because of the scale of it it's important that you understand the deltas.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay.
<A - Jan Bennink>: It would seem disingenuous if we'd take it out. So that's why we've just called it out. We're not
going to be presenting a slide with adjusted adjusted operating income.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Somewhere within those 26 pages of press release I think there are enough adjustments. But
okay. On the...
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Is that a hint, Eric?
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Well, you know where I think everybody stands on that one. The $3 special cash dividend,
the net debt I think was expected to move up as that's paid some time in fiscal '12. But would the cash proceeds,
assuming that the strategic review leads to the sale of the Refrigerated Dough or the International Bakery business. I
mean, do you think that that would be material enough that the net debt would not go up much in terms of that funding?
Or if it was more significant, could that be additive to the cash dividend?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Okay. It's hypothetical. We're obviously doing a strategic review right now in terms of these
businesses. To the extent that we make any decision in terms of selling them clearly it will impact what that debt would
be in a positive way.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: All right. And then last question, Jan, I guess if you exclude the Foodservice business, your
MAP spending is probably running 4% to 5% of sales, which is pretty competitive with most consumer food packaged
goods companies. Do you think that that's – I mean it sounds like you want that to be higher, even though it seems
relatively competitive. Am I thinking about that reasonably?
<A - Jan Bennink>: I don't think it's very competitive actually. I think first of all, a closer look at the absolute
amounts, because it's nice to talk in percentages. The only thing is you want to have your cloud in terms of your
marketing spend. So as a result of that your percentage of marketing will go up, and it will be a significantly higher part
of the new goals once come in – slowly, slowly. I mean it depends completely how much money can they squeeze out
of the fixed cost supply chain and everything to make sure that they can reinvest part of it.

There's a clear mandate, you can go and invest more in marketing if you give me half and you can get the other half. So
there will be more marketing spend coming up, and the P&Ls looking in three years from now will look significantly
different than what they look now.

Thank you. Next question, Bryan Spillane [Bank of America Merrill Lynch]. Your line is open and state your company,
please.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: It's Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Good morning.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Good morning, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hi. Just a question with regards to how you're approaching planning for 2012, and more
specifically just I guess goal setting. You've done a very good job of maintaining the focus of your organization
through a lot of turmoil, right. Both the operating conditions being tough and there being a lot of changes coming up
structurally for Sara Lee. Are you doing anything differently in terms of the way you're going to set, I guess, goals,
objectives, payouts for 2012 in order to ensure that you keep people properly focused sort of in front of the split-off?
<A - Jan Bennink>: Those are really two questions. One was what's your planning for, how are you going to go about
the process of actually putting the two plans together. And the second question is how are you going to incentivize
people to do the right things leading up to the spin.
First of all on how are we going about the planning, both businesses are now making plans under the old structure.
That's mechanically the best way to do it, because otherwise we're going to create confusion from a systems point of
view. We're close to making determinations of what goes where, and we will then in the course of May and June
overlay the structure designs for both companies, and from that we will derive a view of both companies, and we're
right tin middle of that, of that exercise. So that's the way we're going to go about it, currently stick to the way you've
done it in the past because we're creating too much confusion. And then second we'll overlay the structure decisions
that we are in the process of taking. And then we'll incorporate that into the planning process, one.
Two, what are you going to do in terms of making sure that everybody is properly incentivized? That's something that
we're thinking about. Obviously come August, we're not going to be able to do a normal LPI. Because the normal LPI
normally centers around Sara Lee stock with restricted share units and performance share units.
So we're thinking about how we can make sure that everybody focuses on let's make sure that we're going to come out
of the gates flying. Marcel says, it's all focused on, as if we were already two separate companies, and we have a third
bucket, which is corporate. I think that's how we're trying to push it and maximize it to the – as far as we can go.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. So are you setting goals? I guess, I'm just – so is, like if profitability is a target, if I'm
working in your North American Retail business and I've got a profit objective for fiscal '12...
<A - Jan Bennink>: It's a standalone company.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you.

Thank you. Next question, Chris Growe [Stifel Nicolaus]. Your line is open and state your company, please.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe MBA>: Hi. It's Stifel Nicolaus. Good morning. I just had a couple quick ones for you.
The first one is Mark, you've been giving us – I didn't hear it, and perhaps I missed it, but sort of the market rate of
inflation and sort of the inflation you have coming through. I know the dollar amount. Is there a percentage? And I

guess I'm trying to understand, as it seems like some of the prices hold, it's really going to spill over into fiscal '12. So
is that going to require another round of pricing?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yes, we've been giving that each quarter. It's obviously gone up since the last quarter so we're
above 30% in terms of the basket. That is not our cost push as I've said before, because we have obviously hedging
policies that mitigate that, but we're quite a bit above 30% now because of what's happened in coffee primarily. And
there will be some – when you look at the comparison to fiscal '12 versus fiscal '11 we continue to have costs push into
'12. But I think the key message here is in terms of how our pricing is coming through. We have turned the corner in
terms of North America and we would expect by the end of the calendar year to be pretty much there in International
Beverage as well.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe MBA>: Okay.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Given current commodity prices.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Given current commodity prices, and that's a very important addition. We now look on a
weekly basis as to what our total cost increase is going to be as the prices that we're now seeing annualize so we know
that. And from there, the way we tend to look at it is do we make up commodity increases with price. That's the way we
plan for it. So when is the drag on profitability going to end, and that's why I think with some justification we've made
a point in North American Retail and Foodservice we've turned that corner. And we're pretty confident that we'll do the
same in Coffee somewhere in the first half of next year, all of that being predicated on assuming that current prices are
it. Obviously if prices go up again, then we're going to have to work hard to get ahead of the curve. In Coffee and Tea
we've been behind the curve so we're now trying to make sure that we get ahead of the curve.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe MBA>: Okay, that's helpful, thanks, Marcel. And then the final question I had was in
North American Retail, particularly in meats, you've had a bit of a drag from IT expenses and from the Kansas City
facility. And my modeling or my recollection was that those get better in the fourth quarter of this year and then really
throughout 2012. So are you expecting a nice little bump in margins in the fourth quarter for North American Retail
along the lines of that benefit?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: It's really going to – you see that into fiscal '12 more than fourth quarter. It's a little bit less
in the fourth quarter. I think third quarter we had an incremental $7 million spend because of the ERP and the Kansas
City implementation. I think for the full year, it's around for year-to-date it's $28 million. You see that begin to go
down in fiscal fourth quarter, but for next year you'll really start seeing the costs go away and the savings come through
from an accelerated perspective.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Yes, I should have mentioned that in my list of stuff that will help the operational next year.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe MBA>: It will help.
<A - Jan Bennink>: It's by the way, it's part of our accelerated savings.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe MBA>: Okay, got you, thank you.

<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good morning, thank you. Barclays Capital.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Hi, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: How are you all? So just a quick one, a clarification in the way I know that we've been
discussing input costs and pricing we're looking at obviously the dollar amounts, which makes sense, and the gap that
we've got. And then the way you sort of discussed trying to protect the long-term margin structure of these businesses, I
assume that means through more percentage margin structure, but I could be wrong. So I'm just trying to get a sense of

how you – and also – you're thinking in percentages, okay. And then so the thinking there is when you're talking about
turning the corner in North America and ultimately in Beverages, is that on a percentage basis, and if so is that what
you sense that your competitors are sort of after as well?
<A - Jan Bennink>: I don't know how our competitors think, but I would assume they're decent companies. But I think
if you're thinking of percentages that definitely is something we're looking at. How fast do you turn that corner? That is
the question. How fast can you come back to those margins where you were about a year, two years ago? That is the
question. But definitely the percentages is the only thing we're looking at.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yes, just to clarify, Andrew, when I talked about turning the corner it was an absolute
amount in terms of covering the actuals, but clearly what Jan says, we're focused on a percentages in terms of the long
term.
<A - Jan Bennink>: It's gross margins, it is everything, product P&Ls, everything has to – will go to percentages. And
that is a shift for the company because we've been looking at penny profit rather than percentages. So that is a little bit
of a shock, but I think it is a healthy shock and people at some point will understand what it means.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: This is a Jan Bennink challenge layered on to the profit objectives. I think it's actually a
very healthy principle. So it's going with some shockwaves through the companies but it's a very healthy addition.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Excellent. We like challenges. Thanks for the clarity.

Thank you. Next question, Tim Ramey [D. A. Davidson], your line is open and state your company please.
<Q - Timothy S. Ramey CFA>: D. A. Davidson. Good morning.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Hi, Tim.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Hi, Tim.
<Q - Timothy S. Ramey CFA>: The fourth quarter – I was just wondering if could you give us a little clarity on two
things. What will the impact on employee compensation accruals be? Without pointing fingers, I'm going to assume
that bonus accruals might be down some as a result of the earnings reduction. And also wondering if you can give us
any thoughts on what the volume impact actually might look like that's contained in your guidance reduction.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: On the bonus accrual, yes, there is certainly some benefit coming through because the
bonus accrual has dropped. We haven't given out the magnitude, Tim, specifically, but you're right, there is a small
impact there coming through from that. On the volume, I don't have in that front of me. So on the volume, we'd have to
get back to you on the volume impact because I don't have it right now.
<Q - Timothy S. Ramey CFA>: Okay. And just if I could sneak one more in, is there any comment on what happened
in Bakery in the quarter? I know you're carrying it as a discontinued op, but...
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: As I said in France, our EuroDough business...
<Q - Timothy S. Ramey CFA>: Thinking about North American, I'm sorry, Marcel.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Fresh Bakery, I'm sorry. I misunderstood you. Yes, that market continues to be a very
tough market. Everybody is battling it out. I think competition, it's just a very, very fierce market. I don't know whether
you've seen the results announcement from Grupo Bimbo. They were making some noise about the North American
market, and we recognize that as well. So that's – we're not having an easy time there.

Thank you. Next question, Akshay Jagdale [KeyBanc Capital Markets], your line is open. And state your company
please.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: KeyBanc Capital Markets. Good morning.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Good morning.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Jan, this question's for you. As a newcomer to Sara Lee I'm really indeed in your
perspective of the coffee business and specifically single serve and Senseo. So I'd be interested in knowing, when you
looked at this business since it was launched in 2000, what do you think of it? What did they do right? What did they
do wrong? And what is the competitive advantage even today that you plan to leverage?
You alluded to the 26 million machines sold, or your installed base, but at this point do you think you can leverage
that? Because to me that would be a competitive advantage if you could leverage it. But I'm interested in knowing how
you think of those things.
<A - Jan Bennink>: All right, I'll try to keep this answer very short, and I think it is probably more appropriate to give
you my view on Senseo, as far as I want to give it, what I think want to do with it and how we can leverage the number
of machines.
First of all, I think the Senseo name has much more value than you currently have. Yes, we sold a lot of machines, but I
think it is solely focused on the past. So is that the right thing to do, yes or no? You look at the whole, the machine,
either – how the machines are made, how the filters are made. So do I think it is a success? Not really. I think it is good,
it is a great number of machines, and I think if you look at what Nespresso has done, to name the competitor by name,
they've got great sales, they've got great profitability, and they're growing.
We're growing by 5%, 6% over the years, so that's good. We're doing well in France, we're doing well in Spain, we're
doing well in Brazil; in those countries where we've been longer, like the Benelux we're not doing so well. I think there
is a – they're crying out for newness, a new way of reinventing it, it's like reinventing the Senseo machine. And that's
what we're working on. So there's a couple things you will see faster, but there's a couple of things you'll have to wait
for a little bit in order to see how we'll look at. But to give you a short answer do I think it is a great success, no. I think
it's good, but that's it.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Perfect. And one last one for Marcel, if I may. You talked a lot about normal levels of MAP
spending and they're up year-over-year, which is great to see. What is in your opinion, the company as a whole, what is
a normal MAP spending level?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: What I have described as normal I think is relative to what we've been doing in the first
three or four quarters. That is for that purpose the definition of normal. I think I've also made it clear that long-term
we'd like to drive the company to meaningfully higher MAP levels because we think that we'd actually have a much
better growth profile if that's what we can achieve and that's why we are very critically looking at our cost structures in
order to try and do that. Does that help?
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: That does. Yes, I mean, if you look at it on a trailing nine-month basis I think it's about
3.7% so that would, I guess, be normal. But you're saying you want to be higher. Can you be specific about how much
higher?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: We have it on the slide. We have it for the fourth quarter, we're approximately $75
million. And I'm not in a position to tell you whether or not I think it should be $100 million, $125 million, or $150

million. We're just – we're not to that point. I think we're very clear that strategically we all believe that the company
over time should migrate to higher levels of MAP spending.

Thank you. Our last question comes from Andy Feinman [Iridium Asset Management]. Your line is open and state your
company please.
<Q - Andy Feinman>: Thanks. Iridium Asset Management. I know in the press release you give the average number
of shares for the fourth quarter, 605 and 609, primary and – or basic and diluted. But I was wondering if you could give
the number of shares at the end of the quarter since you bought a lot of stock during the quarter.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Andy, so it's approximately 585. Being 584, 585.
<Q - Andy Feinman>: And is that basic?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yes, I believe so.
<A - Jan Bennink>: I've been going around the world saying they're 584 or 585.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yes. That's consistent. Yes.
<Q - Andy Feinman>: All right. Okay. And the dilution was about $4 million. So if I want to estimate diluted myself
I'd probably use 588. Does that sound reasonable?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: That sounds reasonable, but let's get back and make sure we're absolutely right, but I think
that's right.
