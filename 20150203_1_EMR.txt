Hi. Thank you, David. Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2015 results. A conference call slide
presentation will accompany my comments and is available on the Emerson's website at emerson.com. A replay of this
conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next 90 days. I will start
with the highlights of the quarter as shown on slide two of the presentation.
Net sales were unchanged at $5.6 billion, with underlying sales up 6% in the quarter. Underlying sales increased in all
business segments with Climate Technologies being the strongest, up 17%. The Americas exhibited strong growth in
the quarter with mixed results in other regions. Emerging markets grew by 5%. Gross profit margin increased 90 basis
points to 40.8%, while segment margins were up 60 basis points to 15%.
First quarter earnings per share were $0.75, representing a 15% increase over prior year and a 4% increase above the
consensus. Share repurchase accelerated to $518 million in the quarter, and the previously announced divestiture of
Power Transmission Solutions closed on January 30. The first quarter was a solid start to the year despite an
increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment due to a strong U.S. dollar, the significant decline in oil prices, and
the continued weakness in Europe.
Turn to slide three for the first quarter P&L summary. Net sales were flat to prior year, while GP improved 90 basis
points, including the effect of portfolio repositioning and efficiency gains. EBIT increased 210 basis points, which
included favorable currency transactions of $19 million.
Turning to slide four, underlying sales growth in the quarter was up 6%, offset by 3% declines from both currency
translations and divestitures. The United States and Canada reflected strong market conditions, up 8% and 21%
respectively, while trends in other regions were mixed.
Turning to slide five, business segment margin expansion was led by Climate Technologies and Process Management,
while also including the effect of portfolio repositioning. Favorable comparisons in corporate expenses resulted in $74
million decrease versus the prior year. Lower operating cash flow reflected primarily timing of working capital
investment to aid underlying sales growth in the quarter. Trade working capital improved 50 basis points versus the
prior year.
Turning to slide six for the Process Management segment results, Process Management underlying sales grew by 6%
with a 3% reduction from currency translation, resulting in net sales growth of 3% in the quarter. Sales growth was
strongest in North America, up 9%, led by downstream and MRO investment.
Demand in Asia was mixed, up 1%, with growth in India and China offset by weakness in Australia and Southeast
Asia. Europe grew 4%, as double-digit growth in emerging countries offset modest declines in mature markets. Latin
America reflected robust growth, with sales up 26% in the quarter. Conditions in the Middle East/Africa were mixed,
with sales down 1%. Segment margins improved 40 basis points, reflecting favorable currency transactions. Order
trends have remained solid and backlog is strong despite an uncertain outlook in the process industry.
Turn to slide seven for Industrial Automation segment results. Industrial Automation underlying sales grew by 4% in
the quarter, offset by a 4% reduction from currency translation, resulting in net sales that were flat to prior year.
Strength in North America was reflected with sales up 13%. The increase was led by growth of over 20% in the
HVAC-related hermetic motors business.
The electrical distribution and power transmission solutions businesses reported strong growth, with the fluid
automation business down modestly. The declines in power generating alternators and motors and drives businesses
reflected continued economic weakness in Europe, which was down 8%. Overall, Asia grew by 5%, benefiting from
robust growth in Japan, coupled with solid results in China.

Order rates in power generating alternators are expected to slow further, as increased pressure from lower oil prices
reduces spending in the upstream oil and gas market. We expect market conditions to remain mixed in the near term,
with favorable trends in North America and continued weakness in Europe.
Turning to slide eight for Network Power segment results. Network Power underlying sales grew by 1% in the quarter,
offset by a 3% reduction from currency translations and a 12% reduction from divestitures, resulting in net sales
decrease of 14% versus the prior year. The data center business was up slightly, reflecting mixed market conditions
with strong growth in Europe, benefiting from a hyperscale project in Sweden, while growth in North America was
offset by Asia, Latin America and Middle East/Africa.
The telecommunications infrastructure business declined at a double-digit rate, with growth in Asia offset by weakness
in other regions. U.S. telecommunications customers have curtailed spending, referencing uncertainty surrounding
potential changes in federal regulations. The margin increase of 70 basis points reflects the impact of divestitures.
Demand is expected to remain mixed in the near term with favorable data center market conditions and reduced levels
of telecommunications investment.
Turn to slide nine for Climate Technologies segment results. Climate Technologies underlying sales grew by 17% with
a 2% reduction from currency translation. Net sales increased 15%, as U.S. regulatory changes that went into effect on
January 1 drove residential HVAC customers to build inventory ahead of the deadline.
Commercial HVAC grew at an upper single-digit rate, which was led by North America. Global refrigeration had
modest growth as strength in the U.S. and Asia was partially offset by a decrease in Europe. The demand for sensors
and controls businesses was flat.
Segment margins increased 40 basis points primarily from leverage on the increased sales volume. Second quarter
order trends in the U.S. will be uncertain until customers consume inventory that was built in the current quarter.
Market conditions are expected to remain favorable, driven by end-user demand, with continued momentum in North
America and Asia.
Turn to slide 10 for the Commercial and Residential Solutions segment results. Commercial and Residential Solutions'
underlying sales grew by 4% with a 1% reduction from currency translation, resulting in net sales growth of 3%.
Market conditions were mixed, with increased demand in the Americas and Middle East/Africa, while Asia and Europe
were down.
Increased sales were led by solid growth in professional tools, with moderate increases in wet/dry vacuums and food
waste disposal businesses. The commercial and residential storage businesses decreased modestly.
Segment margin remained strong at 21.5%, up 10 basis points versus the prior year. As we continue to assess our
portfolio, we recently initiated the evaluation process of a potential divestiture of the InterMetro business. We expect
favorable trends in the U.S. residential and commercial construction markets to continue in the near term.
Slide 11 contains our 2015 outlook and guidance. The current state of the global macroeconomic environment is mixed,
with favorable trends in North America, contrasting weakness in Europe and other emerging markets.
As we consider the outlook for 2015, we note three main concerns. First, the strength of the U.S. dollar, which will
continue to be a significant headwind; second, the continued weakness in Europe, which has not recovered from the
global recession of 2008-2009 as well as weakness in other emerging markets; and third, the rapid and sustained
decline in oil prices, which will be primarily felt in the second half of our fiscal 2015.
Given our concerns, we have decided to accelerate restructuring to approximately $100 million, which will allow for a
selective repositioning of our cost structure.
Based on these current business conditions, the following is expected in 2015: underlying sales growth of 3% to 5%; a
net sales decline of negative 1% to negative 4%, reflecting a 4% to 5% deduction from currency translation and a 2%
deduction from divestitures.

Profitability is expected to continue to improve modestly from favorable mix and accelerated restructuring. The
expected range of reported EPS is $4.50 to $4.60. This guidance includes a significant reduction from currency
translation, an estimated divestiture gain of $.75 per share and accelerated restructuring costs of $0.05 per share.
Additional business segment guidance will be provided at our annual investor conference on February 19.
And now, I'll turn it over to Mr. David Farr.
David N. Farr
Thank you very much, Craig/ Great job. A much smoother voice and delivery than [ph] Craig – who? Fitzgerald
(11:28), who is, by the way, doing a great job in one of our Process businesses now in Louisville and having a fun job
back into operations. I'm sure he is enjoying that today.
Again, I want to thank everybody for joining us. I appreciate your time. We had a very solid start to the new fiscal year,
with 6% underlying sales growth. But as I said, the challenge is now beginning. With the dramatic drop off in oil prices
and the resulting capital spending, which we'll talk about when we meet later this month in February, continued
weakness in Europe and their only address at this point in time is to weaken the currency relative to doing real
structural reform, the global weakening currencies in the emerging markets, as these currencies are trying to adjust to
figure out how to get growth in a global slowdown, and clearly, a stronger dollar are going to hurt a lot of our exporting
customers here in North America as they have problems competing around the world with a stronger dollar.
Consequently, we decided to accelerate restructuring. The world's clearly changing from the last conversation we had
in November, with a lot of moving dynamics, but fundamentally, as we see it today, we see a much slower global
growth and we are concerned that there's not a lot of momentum relative to turning that growth around potentially for a
couple of years. So we feel it's very appropriate to rebalance our SG&A head count on a global basis, rebalance our
global manufacturing and get our cost structure in line with what we see is a slower marketplace and a changing
marketplace, as the whole world rebalances with the relative currency changes, the lower energy costs and the
uncertainty relative to some of the major economies in the world, be it Europe, be it China, be it Brazil.
We know how to do restructuring. We had built in $50 million originally in our plan, and we feel quite significantly
upping this to include I don't know at least $50 million, maybe a little bit more, and to get on this right away to help our
second half of calendar year 2015 margins, also to help 2016, which is very important to get on with this, and we are
taking action today, and we'll continue to accelerate this.
From my perspective, we will continue to drive the necessary investments to accelerate our growth, to improve our
growth. Growth will be still challenging, but we are going to grow. I still feel comfortable saying our underlying
growth rate is going to be in the 3% to 5% range. Clearly, it's not as strong as we thought it was just six months ago,
with the global dynamics, but we still feel it's pretty solid. We have a strong backlog. Our profitability is running at
record levels. The restructuring is going to allow us to help us protect some of that profitability in I don't know
dynamic economies around the world.
And there are some plusses out there in the world that I think with the lower energy prices, you're going to see some of
the emerging markets accelerate growth late 2015 and going into 2016. In addition, a lot of these emerging markets
have actually lowered their currency valuations to make themselves more competitive. So a repositioning right now
makes a lot of sense, because you're going to see some of these markets, be they India's, be they China, say, other parts
of the world, where lower energy costs are going to help them be more competitive, at the same time, they have
reduced their currency value, which will give them the ability to be more competitive. And as you know, we are
extremely strong in the emerging markets position today already from a manufacturing standpoint, a selling standpoint
and our ability to compete.
So I feel it's very appropriate to take action and deal with the issues facing us right now and figure out how to drive
growth, at the same time, to protect our profitability in the uncertain world. We'll have the benefit of lower
commodities, which helped us from a net material inflation standpoint in the near term, potentially in 2016 that will

start reversing, as we'll start seeing other pricing pressures.
We have the benefit of some of our emerging market positions to be able to accelerate and be competitive on a global
basis from an export standpoint and be in our strong position there, so a very strong position from which to protect our
growth and protect our profitability.
From a cash flow standpoint, for the year, we're still looking at the range of $3.7 billion operating cash flow. This does
not include the impact of the loss of cash from the divestiture of Power Transmission business, which is done, and also
the tax impact of that, which will have an impact on the cash flow on a reporting basis.
But cash flow is generally going to be solid again this year. Capital spending is going to be around $800 million, as we
continue to invest in new products and we continue to invest in our global footprint and make sure we stay competitive.
We'll get into the segments and what we see in each of the segments in our February meeting coming on February 19 in
New York City, but from my perspective right now, we had a good start for the year. We see some issues out there.
We're dealing with these issues. We're accelerating restructuring. We're making sure our cost position stays at the right
level in taking those actions, allowing us to address some issues that had built up in the last several years, and we're
going to deal with those. At the same time, I feel we still have some strong underlying growth opportunities.
We just have to be very nimble and very quick and figure out where those are and make sure we continue growing the
company. But the company still is very strong at this point in time, and we're going into the new – the second quarter in
a decent position, but the winds clearly have shifted and we'll talk a lot more about that on February 19.
But I want to thank all the businesses out there for delivering a solid first quarter, and I want to thank the businesses
who've taken very strong action so quickly on the restructuring, which a lot of it is going to occur in the next two
months or three months, which is very, very important, impacting 1,000 SG&A people and impacting at least 1,000
hourly people around the world.
And so with that, I'll open the line up to take questions, and look forward to seeing everybody on October 19 in New
York.

<A - David N. Farr>: Depends where you are.
<Q - John G. Inch>: I know. Hey, Dave, could you just dig in a little bit to China business trends? You guys are a
pretty good read on a lot of those puts and takes in that market and the macro suggests slowing. Certainly, construction
doesn't look great. You guys had a tough compare. Just what are you seeing and what's your outlook there?

<A - David N. Farr>: Hi. My expectation in China right now is that it will be slower in 2015 than it was in 2014. We
had a very good year in 2014. I see the underlying economics have weakened. China has started out very slow. We did
have some tough comparisons, but just the overall pace of business was more challenging.
I do think that it's going to grow low single-digits. I still believe that looking based on the order pace and based on the
project list that we're seeing right now, but I do expect China to be weaker this year than last year. And I believe the
government is taking actions necessary to, again, get their house in order and figure out how to keep that growth going
and trying to continue to let air out of what I'd call the bubble in certain sectors of the economy. But overall, I just got
back from meeting with my Asia people, and they're pretty still positive about China, but my assessment is even though
they would think that they're doing as well as last year, I think they'll do a little bit worse than last year, but still okay,
still positive growth, still [indiscernible] (20:05).
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yeah. Dave, a couple of years ago, I think you had called out a trend of Emerson pursuing more
automation as part of your facilities in China. Where do you stand with respect to kind of your operating footprint? Are
you happy with the cost structure, kind of where you're positioned there? Or do you think there's a little more action
you'd like to take just in light of the pending slightly softer outlook?
<A - David N. Farr>: We are still on path, John, to continue to what I'd say rationalize our manufacturing footprint in
China.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yeah.
<A - David N. Farr>: And I would say that part of the actions we're taking in this acceleration will be to continue to
do more of that. And so, the automation part is continuing to happen across the businesses. I think we're pretty well –
pretty much got that done, but right now, what I'm going through is the rationalization of the manufacturing footprint,
and do we need that capacity or not need that capacity. But you also have to take into consideration the renminbi right
now is continuing to devalue again, and so we have to watch that. But we're continuing to rationalize that, and I would
say that the footprint is still declining.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Just lastly, the PTS gain, I think you said $520 million. I think previously we thought it was
going to be about $1 billion. Was there something about the final closing that made that adjustment...
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: No, the -
<Q - John G. Inch>: But you kept -
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: John, this is Frank.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yeah, Frank.
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: The $1 billion may have been a pre-tax number, John. The $520 million is an after-tax
number.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. Okay. So it was just pre- versus post-tax.
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Yeah.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David N. Farr>: The $1 billion gain.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yes. Thank you.
<A - David N. Farr>: And pre-tax gain. You had the right number.

We'll go next to Scott Davis with Barclays.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: That's okay. Thanks, operator. Good morning, guys or afternoon, sorry.
<A>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Dave, you made some pretty cautious comments regarding the macro, I think that for
somewhat obvious reasons, but your guidance still implies an acceleration year-over-year, and you just came off a
pretty good quarter. I mean what is it that you're seeing out there that's changed, and maybe it's the month of January
that's caused some concern, but I mean if you back out currency, your orders have been pretty good, and just give us a
little bit of color on why you've been more cautious, I guess, and despite the fact that 3% to 5% core growth, if you take
the midpoint, would still be your best year in three years.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes. From my perspective, John, I think – or Scott – the big issue right now would be what I'm
seeing happening to our major oil and gas customers, and they are definitely – are starting to cut back, and we're
starting to see that. As you know, we're very strong in that sector. We have good strength in North America, and the
North America guys are going to be cutting back with the price of oil where it is and the pressure point relative to the
demand around the world.
So as I look at, I have a pretty good understanding of the process industry, my gut tells me right now that we're going to
see a deceleration of orders and sales in the Process business that could cause this problem in the second half of this
year going into – and then also 2016. Hence the need for acceleration, and I'm being very cautious, because I'm nervous
about that.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Yes. How does – I mean I think upstream oil we all would – I think most of us on the line
here would agree is going to have some challenges, but how does chemical play out as we get into the back half of the
year and such, because you're also very strong in that world also as well, and utility as well?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, I think that there's a lot of puts and takes for the lower price of oil and gas, as you well
know, as you were just saying there. Upstream, clearly, going to be hurt; national oil companies will keep spending
going on, in my opinion, around the world. Downstream, with the lower feedstock going in both the oil and the gas will
be helped.
The question is how fast do they go make those investments? And the question is, we, I think it's going to be later,
maybe late 2015 on a calendar year basis, maybe early 2016 that we would see that type of acceleration. They have to
go through the process. They have to think about the world and the rebalancing. They have to think about the world's
demand.
So I think there's going to be a lag, to be honest, Scott. And based on what I've seen in the past, when we've had this
dramatic drop-off in the oil prices, you'd see a lag. I think it eventually will be a benefit, and you're right, but I wouldn't
be surprised if there's not a hole there for six months or nine months or eight months for some of our businesses as the
shift goes between downstream and upstream. We're strong on both bases, and we're going to talk quite a bit about that,
but clearly, there's a hole opening up, no doubt about it, and hence we're getting ready for it.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay. That's very good color. Thanks, and good luck, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: All the best. We'll see you – I hope you will be in New York.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: I have my conference. You guys double booked us.
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, that's good. I forgot.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: No problem.

Operator
And we'll go next to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Thanks. Just a question on the portfolio. You mentioned the divestment sort of
potentially underway in Commercial and Residential Solutions. This is sort of the fourth year now of maybe low and
mid single-digit earnings growth. So does that make you want to accelerate portfolio change in divestments? Or does it
make you want to kind of slow them down, because you're not getting as much organic earnings growth as you may
have expected a couple of years ago?
<A - David N. Farr>: From my perspective, we laid out a plan of what we want to undertake in the restructuring a
couple of years ago, and we have a couple of pieces left, and they are businesses that don't fit us strategically, and we're
going to get that done, and one of them is we announced that we're evaluating Metro right now, and we will continue to
look at acquisitions, and when they come up, and I think they will come up in this marketplace that potentially could
get a little sloppy in late 2015 and early 2016 from acquisitions, so we are clearly looking for acquisitions, but we're
also not going to go crazy, and I understand that divesting has an impact on the company, but I'm also repositioning this
company for the future.
And sometimes transitions take time. The company is extremely healthy right now through this transition, and we're
investing and the quality of the earnings, the quality of the assets are very high. So I expect my shareholders to stay
with us as we make this reposition and then we will continue to figure out how to accelerate our top-line growth and
earnings growth coming out of this. We know what it takes to grow this company.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks. And then just on the currency hit to earnings, just wondering if you could
quantify that at all for this year, or say what the hit was in Q1 to earnings from currency?
<A - David N. Farr>: So from the perspective of the way we look at currency, as we look at the way we're balanced
around the world, both the inputs and outputs, if we lose $1 of sales, we lose about $0.15 of profits, 15%. And so, if we
lost – we lost three points of growth in the first quarter, you can calculate that. And you can then calculate what that
means from – on average, we lose about $0.15, $0.16 with the current structure and the current currency make-up. So
they can tell you how much earnings we lost in the first quarter.
Those things help us sometimes and hurt us sometimes, and I'm a big believer in a strong dollar. Right now, obviously,
it's hurting us, but I'm a big believer in a strong dollar and our objective is to figure out how to grow this company and
deal with the fact that we have a headwind, but who cares, we got a headwind. And so from my perspective, we're
going to deal with it. And the same thing happened for the year. We just lost, as you know, we're going to lose probably
four points to five points of currency growth for the year, and you can do the same calculation what that means in EPS.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks. And then just very quickly, just a clarification on – you made some points on
pricing. Your gross margins have obviously been very, very strong Q1 and last fiscal year. Do you see any potential for
that gross margin increase to kind of plateau out because pricing may get tougher?
<A - David N. Farr>: From our perspective right now, the comment I made is, we look at the price cost and we're
green. With the movement of commodities where they are right now, it's going to help us in the next couple quarters. I
know that we will have pricing actions necessary over time and typically what happens, pricing will catch up, and so
we'll lose some of that green.
But at this point in time, our ability to manage the price costs and stay slightly green or within that, around zero, has
been very good, and I don't see that changing here in the next couple of years. Stability will come in commodities and
we'll probably have to give some price back, but that pressure probably won't build until 2016. But I still believe that
we can maintain our green capabilities. We have the infrastructure and the management team to be able to do that. So

We'll go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey. Dave, you talked about increasing the restructuring, but you've also had the foot
on the gas with some of these growth investments that you've been increasing recently. What happens to those in this
sort of changed environment? Do you keep speeding on those or pull back on a few? Maybe a little color there.
<A - David N. Farr>: From our perspective, we are going through a quick evaluation of some of those growth
investments based on the segments, based on what we see happening here in the next couple of years. So I would say
there's going to be a fine tuning, but we're going to continue to invest and protect the key growth investments to drive
that growth and reevaluate our cost structure elsewhere, and so we're going to do a balancing act here.
But clearly, one of the things we're going to look at is, if we have a segment that's under a lot of pressure and
downward trend line for the next couple of years, we may pull back on that from a growth investment standpoint and
just not spend that money. But we're going to keep most of it going forward and rebalance cost structure elsewhere.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: All right. And then in Process, I mean we've got kind of the end market look upstream,
downstream. I mean as you look across the different product lines, the valves, devices, systems, I mean is there any
difference you expect or – either you're already seeing or that you expect to see, in terms of what parts of that are going
to hold up better than others?
<A - David N. Farr>: It's a little bit hard to tell right now. All I can tell you is somebody asked me the first question
about why we have [ph] inside business. Been in (31:15) the business quite a bit. We have some segments in the
process world that lead this change when the cycle changes, and they've been changing now for 60 days. And they've
been changing the wrong way, down. So I think that the early cycle parts are already starting to impact and we're seeing
that, and we're going to redirect our organization to figure out how to make sure we protect our MRO business, how to
protect the small brownfield investments.
And I think that it's hard to say which ones are going to do worse, but all I can tell you right now is the leading places
within the process world have already started turning and directly tell us that we're going to have a slowdown. It's
coming.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.

<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: I guess first question on the backlog, how much visibility do you think you have? And
then I guess in conversations with your customers, I think to follow up on a question from last quarter, how long before
they start thinking about cancellations in addition to incoming order weakness?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, right now the backlog's holding. As you know, we reprice our backlog every month with
the currency. And so, when you see our orders turn down, a lot of times when the currency impacts those orders down
and up, and so right now, we're repricing. But the backlog's sitting at higher levels than it was at this year last time (sic)
[last year at this time]. Right now, it's at $6.8 billion.
And so, we have not seen any pushback on the backlog. I think what's going to happen is you're going to see a push-out
in maybe some of the execution of them. If the project's been awarded and they're procuring materials, there's a lot of
cancellation impacts there. So I think you're going to see a rebalancing from our customer perspective. What's going on
right now is they're evaluating where they want to spend their money, which projects they want to go forward, which
projects they may want to slow down, which projects they only want to do half of.
This is going to take time, but it's pretty clear to me based on the grinding we're seeing at the customer level and the
feedback we're getting and also the early indications that there's going to be a slowdown and a push-out, and as I said
earlier, there's going to be some holes emerging in the Process order and sales book. And our objective is to figure out
how to gain penetration around the world to try to protect our growth, but I know it's going to slow down and be slower
and we're going to have some quarters that potentially go negative in the process world.
So it's pretty clear what's happening, and it'll take about six months to unfold and our customer base is clearly working
it right now. And the most important thing for us is we're getting ready, we're redirecting our organization around the
world where we think they need to go to make sure we can maximize our growth potential in the marketplace.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: And to think about the magnitude of that, and I understand it's early, there are a lot of
balls up in the air and still not all determined yet, but presumably, in your career, you've seen big CapEx downturns by
some of your larger customers. Do you find yourself moving at a fraction of that or a multiple of that or kind of on a
one-to-one basis? So if you had an E&P cut CapEx by 20%, do you guys feel it dollar for dollar or maybe less so?
<A - David N. Farr>: It's not dollar for dollar. And we're going to take you through – I've asked Steve Sonnenberg to
take you through the mix of our business in February, how it mixes out, how we see, if capital spending goes down in
oil by 15%, what does that mean to us relative to our – we'll go through the details and calculations for you on that, but
it's not dollar for dollar.
Our current indication right now based on the inputs is we're going to see the marketplace globally, the market globally,
it's going to be negative in the oil, I think in the process world for the next 12 months. And what we've been able to do
historically is we've been able to outperform the market, but we clearly see with a take back, cut down in certain
spending that the marketplace, what we call the process world is definitely going to go negative. And the game plan for
us right now is how to have growth in a marketplace that's going to be negative for 12 months or 18 months coming at
us here in the very near future. And that's the game plan.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: If I could – oh, sorry.
<A - David N. Farr>: That's the game plan.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: If I could sneak in a non-oil question, which I'm sure you're longing for...
<A - David N. Farr>: I like oil. I love oil.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: Well, I'll sell some to you at a discount. On the HVAC business or I guess the Climate
side and related in IA, are you guys able to quantify what the benefit was from pre-buy and how we should think about
that versus 2Q and 3Q?
<A - David N. Farr>: The market has talked about 1 million units being pulled up. 1 million units.

<A - David N. Farr>: That would be – overall – I can't remember to tell, it's off the top of my head, but it's pretty
significant. I couldn't tell you if you go out – I'm sure it's out there. I can tell you who it is and then you can go out and
find out how many units are out there. 1 million units were pulled out. And clearly that is not for one quarter. They
have 18 months to use that build up. So the way I look at it right now is as we put in the press release, we won't get a
feel for this until March, April, what units are being sold and what – whatever type of marketplace dynamics we have
out there.
So we're going to see pretty sloppy North America order pace for Climate for the next three months or four months.
But I'm of the opinion that it is going to bounce back and we're going to see a recovery there, and it will get back to
some normality. But clearly that inventory build was – it's not for one quarter. It was meant to be for 18 months and
we'll see what happens here.

And we'll go next to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome, Craig.

Did you score him? Do you have a little scorecard there?
<Q - Deane Dray>: The cadence of the script was pretty darn good. So we'll see how he's interactive.
<A - David N. Farr>: I thought it was a much smoother delivery than Pat. He started out strong – he made a couple of
screw-ups, but he started out strong, good voice.
<A>: [indiscernible] (37:45)
<A - David N. Farr>: He is a Process guy, too, Pat.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Good. Then I'm going to ask Craig a question, then.
<A - David N. Farr>: Go ahead. Go ahead and ask him questions. See if he can answer it.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Okay. Because he's the one who said it, on slide three, what was the – I may have missed this – the
favorable currency transaction at $19 million? Was that a year-over-year? Was that a comp? What was the factor there?
<A - Craig Rossman>: Yes, so that's the year-over-year.
<Q - Deane Dray>: So was it the impact of a year ago? What would've been – I'm not used to seeing anything
currency being favorable in this environment.
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, yes. Yes, there's a cost trans – this is a different type [ph] of a net comp (38:22).
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Yeah.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Right.
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: And in transactional currency, we have a number of contracts, long-term contracts mainly
in Process, they get mark-to-market for currency, and given that they're heavily in some currencies that are
depreciating, where we have strong currency contracts, those get mark-to-market, it's called embedded derivatives. So
we had a big pickup there in embedded derivatives in the quarter. And you're right, it is unusual to see it go in that
direction.

<A - David N. Farr>: What will happen is that will zero out over a time period. Typically, within 12 months, 18
months it will zero out. So you – one quarter you get it, next quarter you'll lose it. It'll zero out. That's why we say flag
it, so you see it, because we know we're not going to keep that forever.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Got it. And then on...
<A - David N. Farr>: Good job, Craig. Way to answer that question.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Yes, that was fine. So now, in the comment on slide five regarding higher working capital needs,
so with the expectation of some of the softening, maybe you can just point to which business specifically you'd see the
higher working capital?
<A - David N. Farr>: That was for the quarter. That was for the quarter, because we had underlying growth of 6%,
and so, one of the things we saw was a little bit of higher working capital. As our underlying growth comes down, we'll
start taking capital off the balance sheet. So that's not unusual for us to go up and down in a quarter, but that's what he
was referring to. He's referring to higher underlying growth rate in the first quarter. At that 6% level, we actually build
a little bit of working capital typically. Even though we had good conversion, it still went up dollar-wise and hurt us in
the quarter. That's all it was.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Got it. Just last question, I don't want to front run too much of your Analyst Day, but...
<A - David N. Farr>: I'm working on that pitch. I'm really starting to get this fine-tuned. I don't want to give all the
facts to you yet.
<Q - Deane Dray>: So not looking for facts, but just in terms of thematically, it sounds like you'll give us more color
on the oil exposure. Is there anything else thematically you might be touching on?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think we're going to break up in the Process side. What we're going to try to figure out is how,
as I said, the market's going to be negative for a period, here, for 12 months or 18 months, how we're going to grow.
And we're going to talk a little bit about that. It will be a big issue there.
We'll get into a little bit, I've asked Ed Monser to talk about international. I think there's going to be a period here now
with the currencies reshuffling out there, you'll see a lot of currencies, international currencies, devaluing. And there's
going to be a changing mix right now relative to what's competitive out there in the marketplace, and you're going to
start moving some production around the world. So we're going to talk a little bit about that and how we're positioned
and where you see the pockets of growth.
So I think we'll give you a little bit of insight there. And then I'm going to have Charlie talk a little bit about Internet of
Things and where we continue to invest to change our business models that will evolve over time. In this industry, it's a
very slow process, but we'll have Charlie talk about that. So we've got some fun things to talk about. It's not all – we're
making investments, we're going to figure out how to grow this company and we've got some good things to talk about.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Looking forward to it. Thank you.

<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: So just back to Process, I think someone, perhaps Shannon, was trying to get at this a little bit.
But I'm just trying to understand kind of the mix effects in the business, and in particular, I believe, although I'm not
100% correct, that kind of the strength in North America oil and gas has been very, very [ph] mix (41:52) positive for

you, and maybe in general, things have been mix positive, because the big projects have kind of been looming but not
really kicking into gear. Is that right? And should we be thinking about a kind of meaningful mix down as we roll
forward here the next, I don't know, three quarters, four quarters, five quarters?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, you're exactly right. We're very strong in North America. We're very strong in oil and gas.
And we've had a good run in North America. Our North America percent of sales for Process has gone up the last
couple of years because of the oil and gas investments.
We – clearly, one of the things that we're dealing with right now on restructuring and the Process guys will be
restructuring is how to protect our profitability with the changing mix. And Steve's going to go through that with you
relative to what we see happening, but clearly, things are going to go on in North America on the negative side, but also
things on the positive side.
So if we have less oil and gas investment in North America, we're also, we think, at the appropriate time, going to see
an improvement in downstream investments, which are also very good for us in North America. It will not – the
problem is not going to be synced up properly. So you're going to see a slowdown in oil and gas up front, and we're not
going to see a pickup in the downstream later on.
So we have to figure out how to get our cost structure in line, protect our profitability in Process with the changing mix,
and that is hence one of the aggressiveness we're trying to take right now from a restructuring standpoint, because
we've had a benefit in this the last couple of years. You're exactly right.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And then strength you saw in Latin America and Canada, is that all oil patch related too, or is
there a little bit of diversity in that strength?
<A - David N. Farr>: In Canada, it's primarily oil and gas. And the key issue for us is I think the oil – I think Canada
is not going to back off as much as people think on spending from protecting their oil and gas. They need that income.
So I think that you're going to – I mean we had a very good quarter. I still think it will weaken, but I don't think it's –
we'll see how much those oil companies protect Canada up there. So right now, we're still expecting Canada to have
some growth this year.
We had a very good Mexico, and the investments have continued in Mexico, primarily not in the oil and gas, but in
other areas of Mexico. And the wild card for us is Mexico hold up for us in 2015. But we had a very good start in Latin
America, and that's helped us quite a bit. I think people are probably surprised at how good our Process business was in
the first quarter. And our backlog, by the way, did not really drop in Process in the first quarter. So we shipped [ph]
what we knew (44:33) business, so we did – we had a very good first quarter.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right. And then just one quick one if I could. On Climate, the margins are not as high as I
would have guessed given the volume surge. Did that pre-buy or a pre-build cause you a lot of inefficiencies and
overtime and the like, and any color there?
<A - David N. Farr>: No. No, it didn't cause us the problem there. The issue is just the mixed business within the type
of pre-buy. The type of product that they – that our customers are buying is – or it'll be at the lower end of our mix.
And so, therefore, we didn't get as much flow-through and the profitability. We still made decent money, because we
did get some profit improvement, but you're right, it was not what I'd call in the sweet spot of our compressor type of
business.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right. Thank you, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome, Jeff. I'll see you soon.

And we'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Well, thanks. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hey, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Hey, Dave. So the $50 million step-up in restructuring, it sounds like Process is going to account for
the bulk of that. Is that the right way to think about it?
<A - David N. Farr>: No. It's going to – we're going across the whole company. I'm going to look at – I'm particularly
looking at Europe and which will mean I might be hitting Network Power, I'll be hitting Industrial Automation, I'll be
hitting Process. But I'm going to be looking at – I'm a little bit nervous about Europe. I think Europe has some
fundamental cost issues. And I don't think those governments are really dealing with it.
Devaluing the currency is not going to help them as much as – and a real cost structure standpoint, they have a lot of
inefficiencies there, and the fact they're not getting growth is a concern for me. So I think you're going to see us take
some across the board, but it's going to be across all businesses. Process and Climate, Process and Network Power will
be the two biggest and then Industrial Automation will be a third.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. [ph] That brings me on to (46:20) Network Power, because if we adjust the prior year for
[indiscernible] (46:25) then margins are still down year-over-year. And I'm wondering obviously, restructuring, the
transaction will help in the back half of the year, but what is your line of sight in terms of mix or other factors to drive
margins back into expansion?
<A - David N. Farr>: There's two issues. The restructuring from the cost standpoint, we have the new products out.
We're selling the new products. The key issue for me right now is continuing to right size and readjust that organization
for the new business model, the new marketplace, and that will continue to happen throughout this year and then
continue to work on the cost structure of the new products and the new organization relative to deliver that business.
So we're going through a process right now. We're going to have to sort of re-base that whole business. We've got the
ability. We've got the products. The question is, how do we change that cost structure to get the levels of profitability.
And I want – Scott Barbour is going to talk about that in New York, because the key issue for me going forward is, we
know where this marketplace is going. We have the capability of dealing with it. Now how do we make acceptable
profitability?
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And then just a quick one, Dave, on Russia. And it sounds like Russia was still up to you in
Process, which is remarkable given all the news flow in Russia. Is that correct? And then maybe just a bit of color on
some of what you've seen over there.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, Russia was still good for us. Now, we got hit pretty hard with the ruble, but we have a very
strong local manufacturing capability and service capability in Russia. And given the fact that we have this local
capability, it's giving us a pretty good competitive advantage. And so, we're seeing the company still spending money.
And so, our business in Russia has held up, and we had a decent quarter.
The question will that continue to be able to do that, from the standpoint of where can they come up with the money,
but right now, we had a very good start of the year, and we see our customers spending money.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Great. Thanks, Dave.

<Q - Mike Wood>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Given how many questions we're getting from investors on
Process, can you just give us a sense of what declines you're expecting, particularly in the upstream business and how
you're thinking about it from a sensitivity standpoint versus even periods like 2009 when you saw pretty significant
declines in that business?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, I mean I'll rather wait until the 19th to talk about that. I think you're going to, I give you
an idea, I think you're going to – right now, we're looking at the market declines, because what we see out there
probably in the 2% to 3% – overall total process market declines of about 2% to 3%, which is a little bit less than the
last one, with the shifting going on relative to some of the downstream investments and other investments going on
around the world.
That's where we see – we'll talk more about that, but overall, the oil and gas number, obviously, is going to be a lot
bigger decline, and we'll talk about that, but I think the market overall is going to be down 2%, 3%.
<Q - Mike Wood>: Got it. I'll wait to hear more on that, then. Then, just regard to your balance sheet, I mean how are
you thinking about where your leverage is now, why not take a more aggressive balance sheet stance through buybacks
or more aggressive larger M&A given just the share performance over the past few years?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, I'm clearly not happy about the share performance the last couple of years. From my
perspective, right now, we're going to buy back at a minimum $2 billion worth of stock this year. And we're also trying
to keep our balance sheet ready, if the right opportunity comes along from an acquisition standpoint, but we've not seen
that opportunity at this point in time that makes sense to create value, but we're keeping that balance sheet and if
necessary, we'll continue to increase share repurchase at the appropriate time. But I don't see us changing the leverage
on our company at this point, because I'd like to make sure that we have the ability to do it, but a significant acquisition
if the right one comes along.
<Q - Mike Wood>: Great. And just finally, can you give us any more color on the InterMetro size of the business?
<A - David N. Farr>: It's a little too early to talk about that, but it's more than $200 million.
<Q - Mike Wood>: Great. Thank you.

And we'll go next to Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: Dave, can you talk about some more of the challenges in China? For you, are they more
general economy, specific to certain market exposures? And frankly, which segment has the most China exposure?
<A - David N. Farr>: We're pretty strong in China on all segments, but clearly, Process, Network Power, Climate, and
then Industrial. Network Power is number one, then Process is number two, Climate is number three, and Industrial is
number four, off the top of my head.
I think it's more – it's market. There is a general slowdown as they look at where they want investment to happen. We
had a very good period last year across the board. And I think right now, what we're seeing at the highest level in China
is sort of a re-evaluation of where money is going to be spent and how they're going to fund it.
And so, what we're expecting is a step back up as you get into the spring time in China, and so, we'll get a better feel of
it, but right now, we're still pretty optimistic based on the type of transactions and bidding going on that we're going to
see growth this year, but albeit I think it will be a little bit lesser growth. But it's all about where money is being spent
and not being spent right now. It's not, that's what is.

<Q - Mark Douglass>: Okay. And then on Network Power, the big project in Sweden, how much did it help you in the
quarter? Is there still some left over that's still over, say, in the second quarter? And does this imply maybe that
Network Power is flat to even maybe down underlying by the time we get to the back half of the year?
<A - David N. Farr>: The project is going to spread out over the year. So it's going to be at – actually, some of the
projects might go into next year. So I think from our perspective that the project has spread out. And the key issue for
us is we've got the capability to win. The question is how do we change that cost structure to win the type in the
marketplace we see today? And that's what Scott Barbour and his teams are all focused on at this point in time.
We know how to sell. We know how to make money. The question is how to make acceptable levels of profitability. So
that's why we have them take a hard look at the restructuring, given the products, given what we need, and let's deal
with this issue now and get on with it.

And we'll go next to Steven Winoker with Bernstein.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, all.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey. So listen, on slide 11, when you talked about guidance, you talked about modest
profitability improvement, and we've talked around that a lot, but just the puts and takes, restructuring sounds like $100
million or call it 180 basis points, I've got FX, which sounded like – you just said 15%, so $25 million or $30 million.
I've got price versus commodity, which sounds still positive, and then productivity, and then you've got normal
incremental leverage on the volume, which is something like $67 million or so.
So I'm just trying to understand, what am I missing here? How are you guys thinking about the puts and takes, and
where do you – frankly, what I really want to know is just what is the modest profitability improvement you're looking
for all in, net?
<A - David N. Farr>: [ph] One-tenth, two-tenths (54:20).
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: And that will be the chart. And we'll say, I mean with the puts and takes we've got going on
right now, we're going to be fighting for profitability and that's the game plan.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. Okay. And then secondly, on restructuring, Dave, Emerson has done an
extraordinary amount of restructuring and cost takeout for – certainly both before the downturn and through the
downturn up till now, and I'm as big a believer in lean and benefits of cost takeout, it never stops. That being said, it's a
pretty decent-sized number we're looking at this year. How do you sort of think about muscle versus fat on this one and
protecting the growth?
<A - David N. Farr>: We're not going after muscle. Any company as large as Emerson, and you do acquisitions, you
make investments, you can create – you can get a little less lean. And so, we're going after this pretty hard. We're
looking at, of all the capital investments we make in the last couple of years, and sort of read, which ones can we get
more out of productivity wise? So we're not going to cut anything that's crucial to growing this company, but we have
abilities to lean this company out. And I firmly believe we could be facing extended time [indiscernible] (55:37) I want
to lean it, and we're going to lean it. And you're right, we know how to do that.

And so, the business leaders have done a great job of reacting to this. I came back from a trip in India in the middle of
January, and I met with the OC and said, look, we need to lean out and that's what we're doing. And so Ed Purvis takes
over, and all he's talking about right now is figuring out how to lean this thing out and working with Frank and the
other guys. So we're not going to hurt, we're not going to damage ourselves.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And one last...
<A - David N. Farr>: Always room – always room to getting better. Always room to get leaner and meaner. Just like
you are, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Every day. I'm just trying to keep up with you, Dave. One more thing. You talked about
downstream chemical opportunity, and I understand the feedstock point, but the spread between oil and gas matters a
lot with regard to ethylene, and ethylene linking to butadiene, propylene, benzene, et cetera. What are you guys seeing?
You're not concerned about the shrinking gap between oil and gas inputs potentially putting new investments on hold?
<A - David N. Farr>: We haven't seen any of that yet. But that's obviously clear. It's clearly a key issue. I think that's
why we're going to – I think there's going to be a pause here where people evaluate where everything's going to
stabilize. That's why I think a gap's going to open up. It's pretty easy to put things on hold on upstream. I think they're
going to take a little longer to evaluate downstream.
We do know some of the gas liquefaction and those type of materials are going to move forward and things like that at
this point in time, but clearly, there's a lot of evaluation going on, and I'm very concerned about it. That's why Steve
Sonnenberg and his team are going to be pretty aggressive here to rebalance our cost structure knowing they could be
facing an 18-month headwind. And so, you're right, Steve. We don't know exactly yet, but we do know that it's going to
be tougher, and we do know there's still going to be huge capital out there being spent. How do we get more of that
capital? How do we use our people to get more of that capital?
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. I look forward to seeing you on the 19th.
<A - David N. Farr>: All the best to you, Steve. Thank you.

<A - David N. Farr>: The total Process marketplace, I think it's – we're going to have a window here, the 12 months is
going to be down 2% to 3%, yeah.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So over the course of kind of the calendar – calendar 2015.
<A - David N. Farr>: Correct.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: So what do you – I mean you sound pretty negative, rightfully so. I mean there's a lot of
cross currents going on out here. But 2% to 3% doesn't really sound that bad. I mean is there a quarter or two here this
could get pretty ugly, and how should we be prepared for the coming string of orders reports here? I mean should we be
kind of prepped for a couple double-digiters in there for you guys, or what's the story on that front?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think based on history, Steve, there's definitely going to be two quarters that are going to be
tough. Is our next quarter going to be one of them? It's hard for me to tell right now. It's hard from the reaction around
the world. But clearly, we're going to have a couple tough quarters here from an order standpoint. Second quarter, third
quarter or third quarter or fourth quarter, and I think leading into early next year. So there's no doubt about it, there's
going to be a transition here and the question is how fast we see that transition, which markets hold up, which
industries hold up. But clearly, you're exactly right; you're going to see a couple tough quarters.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: And will you...
<A - David N. Farr>: And I don't know which ones they are.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Will you guys be negative, do you think, on your core? I would assume if it's going to
happen, it'll happen in the second half and into the first half of next year. I mean do you see a quarter where you're
negative, and I would think that if it is negative, it's not going to be kind of more than a negative mid single-digit type
of number. Is that the right way to think about it?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, you're talking Process or total, Steve?
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Process.
<A - David N. Farr>: Oh, yes. I think – I mean we do not see that yet, but you're exactly right. I would say you could
have a negative 5%, 8%, 6%, 7% quarter. Yes.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: This year?
<A - David N. Farr>: Maybe not this year.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Okay. That's very...
<A - David N. Farr>: My gut tells me it's – if I was going to put a gut call right now based on my knowledge of the
industry, it's first fiscal quarter of 2016, which is the fourth calendar quarter.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So we can kind of do the linearity on where the 6% you did this quarter, and then
kind of march it down from there and then maybe march it back up, depending on what our view is on – what our call
is on where oil's going to be?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think, yeah, I wish I was that good. If I was, I'd be a gazillionaire right now, as you would be
too. But you're exactly right, that's what's going to happen. It's going to march down and march back up, and the
question is how big that hole gets. And right now I know it's coming.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: The key is pretending to be that good, I think.
<A - David N. Farr>: [indiscernible] (01:00:51)

<A - David N. Farr>: Okay. Okay. Okay.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: On the rest of the business, the orders for Climate, some parts of Industrial Automation,
I mean I can't imagine that over the next quarter, those are going to look that great either, because of the pre-buy
impact, and then obviously, Industrial Automation, you have some oil and gas exposure, and then on Network Power,
you've got the comp to Facebook. I mean is – again, I just – I think getting out in front of these orders numbers, I mean
am I missing anything on that front? Or is the next couple months kind of for the company in total going to be pretty
tough too from an orders perspective?
<A - David N. Farr>: I wouldn't be a shocked CEO if we don't have a negative second quarter order quarter. I
wouldn't be shocked.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Right. Right.
<A - David N. Farr>: I mean – I can't – I have a little sign here, I can't swear, but blank happens. And that's why we're
being pretty aggressive right now, looking at the restructuring, because we know it's going to happen and the question
is if it's not the second quarter, it'll be the third quarter. But clearly, you're going to have a down draft here, and we've
had – we have a good backlog, we've had good order pace, but clearly, we're going to have a down draft.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Great. And what...
<A - David N. Farr>: [ph] The U.S. (01:02:13) is going to have a down draft.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: And one last question on, you talked about the company in transition. It doesn't sound
like there's any – these divestitures are chunks of the business, not necessarily a big kind of strategic split or anything
like that. I mean you talked about doing acquisitions, but you said you're kind of holding your firepower for a bigger
one. I mean on either front, should we expect something major like a $5 billion-plus type of thing, on either side of the
divestiture or deal front?
<A - David N. Farr>: I don't – right now, there's nothing of that substance. However, there – clearly, I evaluate the
businesses at all points in time. If I feel like a business cannot firmly get back to the performance that it needs to get to,
and we've talked about this, Network Power's one of them, that would be a strategic repositioning. However, I also said
that we're going to play this out over three years. We're 18 months into that, almost not quite 18 months, so right now,
that clearly is a business, if I'm not able to deliver value for my shareholders, I'll figure out how to get out of that
business and create value in another way. And so...
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Is that something you're going to do at the Investor Day? Or that's not at the
Investor Day?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes. No, we're not going to be talking about that – we're not going to be talking about something
big like that, no.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Got it. Got it. Okay. All right. Okay. Thanks a lot. Best of luck.
<A - David N. Farr>: Okay, Steve, all the best to you.

<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: So just staying on Process for a second and Dave, I appreciate all the color and how candid
you've been – what's that?
<A - David N. Farr>: I said go figure, something in Process.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Yeah, exactly, but still I do appreciate all the color you've given us. The question I have is
really around key resiliency of your margins in Process, and so last cycle, you saw your EBIT decline about – close to
20% in the business. And Process is a lot bigger today than it was back then, and so just trying to get a sense for how
you guys are thinking about your cost structure, when this downturn actually happens?
<A - David N. Farr>: The big issue will be is we clearly are going to try to figure out how to get ahead of our cost
structure, how we're going to cut back what we need to cut back, but we will not damage the business. So historically,
if I have a couple of quarters of down sales for Process, we will obviously take a cross action to minimize that down
profit, but we will not damage. This is a very strong value creator for the company.
So we could have a couple of quarters like we've had in the past where the margins deteriorate, but I also put pressure
on the organization to make sure that we maximize and not waste our investments. So if we do have a couple of tough
quarters, most likely late this year and going into early 2016, I would say you're going to see a margin deterioration,
and what we're trying to do right now is get ahead of that to minimize that margin deterioration without damaging the
core company.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Is there an opportunity for your – given you've got a larger installed base, is there an
opportunity for MRO investment to help soften some of the blow [ph] of slower growth (01:05:25)?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, we'll talk about – I mean if you look at how many billions of dollars of equipment we
shipped the last five years or six years, our installed base has grown dramatically. So the answer is yes. However, it's
always about timing and which comes on and comes off. But you're exactly right; our installed base is much larger. As
you well know, part of our investment for the last three years has been building out stronger and stronger global service
organization. So we actually have the assets in place to take advantage of this, but the question will be can you execute
on that to offset the other areas? That's our game plan.
I'm not going in and allowing or my Process guys right now so they can drop their margins. We're not – that's not the
game. We're figuring out how do you hold your margins, but I also will not damage that company if I see a sudden
drop-off. I will not do stupid things for that business, because it is really a strong value creator for Emerson. But we
have the right position to protect profitability. It's just a matter of can we execute.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - David N. Farr>: All the best. I will see you – I hope you'll be there in February. Will you be there?

<A - David N. Farr>: I can't – I don't want to give you a rough number off the top of my head, but it is a significant
number, and you've already seen the bookings get impacted by that in the last couple of months. If you looked at our
alternator business that boards a drop off. So I will give you an exact number, Craig, but if I had to take a wild guess, I
wouldn't say a wild guess, but a guess, I would estimate, I'd say it's around a quarter. A quarter.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: A quarter of the CAT?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, and we're starting to see it already. And we'll talk about that, but they react pretty quickly,
because those are long lead time type of products.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Just to clarify is the quarter of the CAT exposure or the quarter of the Industrial Automation
business? Sorry about that.
<A - David N. Farr>: I would say a quarter of the Industrial Automation.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Gotcha.
<A - David N. Farr>: The business would be tied to oil and gas total.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And just a question on capital allocation. It seems that other companies that are active in capital
allocation are bringing up the fact that private equity is capped in terms of the leverage that you can take on for deals
these days. How does it change your thinking on, A, sort of making acquisitions, because it seems there are – both
Roper and Danaher I think say that that there's just more opportunity now, but, B, also given that private equity is
capped, how does it change your view on divesting businesses, if you could talk about that?
<A - David N. Farr>: We got a very good price for our Power Transmission. I think it was a good deal for both us and
Regal-Beloit, and I think we got a good price – we laid out what we want to divest, and right now, we know what those
two businesses are. And I don't think it's changed us from the standpoint of what we're looking at right now. We try to
find strategic buyers, and we'll continue to work that, but I don't think it's changing anything. It's just the amount of
assets out there. Right now, there's not a lot of assets to buy and there's not a lot of assets being sold either, so that's
why we had a lot of interest in the Power Transmission business and we sold it.

currency this year, despite this weaker outlook globally, and I appreciate you've had a good start in Q1. You've got a
solid backlog, but I mean after all that's been said on the call today, particularly on the Process side of things, where do
we get the growth from? Which segments of the company are you seeing taking us to that 4% to 5% for the remainder
of the year?
<A - David N. Farr>: We still have – our largest market's still North America. And we still have a very strong
business in North America across a lot of Emerson, and that business is – right now, it's holding up. We have not seen
any deterioration in North America. I still see very good growth for us in Mexico. I see very good growth for us in
India. From the perspective of China, we're expecting growth.
So I have markets around the world that are still growing. There will be a lot less growth than originally thought, but I
still believe that we can still have that underlying type of growth we're talking about with the mix of business that we

have and the strong business presence we have in North America. So that's where I come from at this point in time.
Now, if I start seeing North America weakening from an economic standpoint, then obviously that will change, because
that will hurt us given our strong presence we have here in North America.
<Q - Jeremie Capron>: Okay. Okay. And maybe finally on the – going back to the balance sheet, in this environment
of slow growth and cheap debt, what do you think is the optimal capital structure for Emerson? I understand the
discussion around potentially going after bigger acquisitions, et cetera, but outside of this, what do you think about
capital structure?
<A - David N. Farr>: We have a very flexible capital structure. I mean we've taken – right now we're running around
the mid-30% debt-to-capital right now, Frank, is that where we are?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Yes. Yes.
<A - David N. Farr>: Mid-30%. We've taken it down as low as the mid-20%s. I think right now the mid-30%s is an
area that gives us the flexibility we need to deal with, and we can flex down quite easily, so I think from our capital
structure right now, I think it's a decent capital structure and gives us the room we need. At the same time, it's given us
– we're spending a lot of money back to our shareholders.
In the last four years, we've almost sent back $10 billion to our shareholders. So we're very shareholder-friendly. And
we'll continue to spend money back for our shareholders, if necessary and use our capital structure appropriately. So we
try to keep it as flexible, and I think we – at the same time, we're paying money back to our shareholders.
This year, we'll give to our shareholders over $3 billion. I'll say that, over $3 billion to our shareholders this year. Last
year, we gave them over $2 billion. Year before that, we gave them over $2 billion. So we paid back to our
shareholders.
<Q - Jeremie Capron>: Great. Thanks very much.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome.

And we'll go next to Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're making up the – you got the caboose. You're the caboose, Rich.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: I know I'm bringing it up.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're a man. This has got to be one powerful question. No pressure on you, Rich.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: I know. One and one only.
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, I'll give you two, because it'll take a while to warm up, here. You're probably cold,
wherever you're looking, it's probably cold.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: That's true. Process. So the 2% to 3% down for the industry, does that assume any offsets in
other areas of Process? Because if you talk to some of the industry consultants, they say oil and gas is 20% of the
market, and there's growth in other areas because of lower energy prices. Chemicals, obviously, is one. But does that
assume – does that take into account your overweight on oil and gas? Is that referencing that? Or are you just looking at
how you define process and coming up for that?
<A - David N. Farr>: No, we define the process and we'll show you when Steve's talking about how we go at this. I
mean clearly, it means a much stronger down oil and gas spend number. And there's often – you're exactly right, there's

offsets that minimize that. But overall, we still believe probably in the next 12 months that oil and gas – not oil and gas,
total process marketplace as we see it today will be negative, driven primarily because of the oil and gas clearly drop
off coming off very high levels.
Still a lot of money being spent, so the key issue for us is how do we get more than our fair share of that money being
spent. And that's where my focus is for all of my team. How do you get more of that spending dollars, even though it's
shrinking out there, how do you go get some, more of it? We want yield.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Right.
<A - David N. Farr>: Right. That's the whole market, and I think that is weighting it out.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Okay. And then...
<A - David N. Farr>: As of today.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Right. And then on the downstream piece, so would you see orders – you think you'll see
orders late in the calendar year – late in calendar year 2015, early 2016? How soon does that translate? It would seem
like there's some lag there.
<A - David N. Farr>: I think there's a hole opening up, and my gut tells me we will be late, late calendar year 2015,
maybe the last quarter, and more like the first half of 2016 calendar year, because there's a lot going on.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Right, but it takes some time for that to turn into revenue, right? So I mean...
<A - David N. Farr>: Right.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Right. So okay, so it's more like...
<A - David N. Farr>: For us – the key thing for us right now is, as someone mentioned earlier, is we have a very
strong MRO business. How do we take advantage of our installed base that we dramatically have grown the last – if
you look at the last 10 years of our capital, our money we've sold in this industry, how do we take advantage of that?
That's going to be the key focus point for us. Because you're going to have a window here where you lose – the projects
aren't going to happen for you. You're going to have to go out and get that business day in and day out.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Right. Okay. See you in a couple of weeks.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good. See you in a couple of weeks, Rich. All the best. Where do you reside these days?
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: I'm in Baltimore.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're in Baltimore.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Yeah, you friend [ph] Mr. Bates (01:15:18)
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, did Orioles make any good trades this year?
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: No, they've been losing people.
<A - David N. Farr>: What?
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: They've been losing people. Cruz is in Seattle.
<A - David N. Farr>: Why?
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Yeah, they've lost a bunch of free agents.
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, that's a bummer. It was good to see the Orioles come back up.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Yeah, well...

<A - David N. Farr>: I got Frank Dellaquila as the Yankee fan, so he's sitting here pissing and moaning but I
personally like the Baltimore, giving the Yankees have run for their money, personally.
<A>: It's going to be a long, sad summer.
<A - David N. Farr>: Long for who? Yankees?
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Well, I'm actually a Yankee – yeah, but I'm actually a Yankee fan, but I am a transplant. So
down here so I follow them.
<A - David N. Farr>: There's a Rodriguez guy available with the Yankees. You want to pick him up. Good third
baseman. I look forward – I want to go to a Baltimore baseball game this year when the weather warms up, which is
probably what? August?
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Let us know. Let me know.
<A - David N. Farr>: See you later, Rich.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: All right. Take care.
David N. Farr
I want to thank everybody for the call. I appreciate it. Look forward to seeing you guys in a couple of weeks in New
York City, hopefully, with the snow, and we won't have Snowageddon again, or whatever that thing was called. And
well the Mayor called it was going to be the worst snowstorm ever in New York, and he must have missed that one.
But look forward to seeing everybody, and hopefully, everyone stays healthy. Take care now. Bye.
