financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial
information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call. To follow along during the call, you
can access these slides on our Investor Relations website at www.southerncompany.com.
We have a full agenda for today's call. We will begin with a brief recap of 2014 operational highlights, followed by an
update on the Kemper and Vogtle projects, we will then discuss fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial results and
sales results, and finally, we will provide earnings guidance for 2015.
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.
Thomas A. Fanning
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that Southern Company's franchise operations have
never performed better than they did in 2014. In 2014, we continued to provide the best customer service in the
business. In fact, Southern Company and its four traditional operating companies occupied the top five spots for all
customer classes combined in the customer value benchmark survey, our annual peer comparison of United States
electric utilities. This marks the 11th time in the past 13 years that Southern Company has ranked in the top quartile for
all customer classes in that survey. And earlier this month, those of our traditional operating companies that were rated
in the J.D. Power and Associates survey all ranked either first or second in their respective categories. Alabama Power
was also named the Most Trusted Residential Electric Utility in America by Lifestory Research, an independent
consumer market research firm.
In terms of system reliability, we have continued to set and raise the bar. Our 2014 peak season EFOR of 1.9% was
particularly exceptional compared to the most recent five-year national average of around 9%. And our transmission
and distribution businesses performed superbly, setting all-time system records for frequency and duration of
transmission outages as well as an all-time system record for distribution outage frequency. Meanwhile, we achieved
our second-best year ever in the duration of distribution outages.
We also continued to grow our wholesale renewable portfolio through our Southern Power subsidiary, which added
three new solar facilities in 2014. The 20-megawatt Adobe facility in California, the 50-megawatt Macho Springs
facility in New Mexico, and the 150-megawatt Solar Gen 2 facility in California. Southern Power also has a
131-megawatt solar plant under development in Georgia that is expected to begin operation in late 2016. With
completion of this facility, Southern Power is expected to own more than 460-megawatts of solar capacity and is
clearly becoming an industry leader in the advancement and operation of this important technology. In these areas and
many others, Southern Company's franchise business continues to lead the way, strengthening existing operations and
seeking new opportunities to expand our reach, all for the benefit of the customers and communities we serve.
Let's now discuss our two large construction projects, beginning with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. As you can see from
the site photo we've included in our slide deck, progress continues on Vogtle 3 and 4, including completion of the
601-foot Unit 3 cooling tower in December. Our focus continues to be on quality and safety for the entire project, with
the two nuclear islands as our critical path going forward.
Major concrete work is progressing on both units as we prepare for key module placements later this year. For Unit 3,
we are working towards installation of the CA01 module inside the containment vessel this spring and the first shield
building panel this summer. For Unit 4, we are working towards installation of the CA04 module in the containment
vessel and assembly of the CA20 auxiliary building. Vogtle 3 and 4 remain a valuable investment for customers.
Considering all of the $2.3 billion in projected customer benefits, including production tax credit, DOE loan
guarantees, and CWIP in rates, in addition to the benefits of low-cost nuclear fuel, we expect the net rate effect on
Georgia Power customers to be approximately 6.8%. Recall that when the Georgia Public Service Commission initially
approved the project in 2009, base rates were expected to increase 12%.
Now late last week, we disclosed the receipt of a revised forecast for completion from our contractors that reflects an
18-month delay from the previous estimated in-service dates. The process of reviewing the revised forecast for

completion, the drivers for change, and possible mitigation opportunities continues. We have not agreed to any change
to the guaranteed substantial completion date, nor do we believe that all efforts to mitigate the contractor delays have
been made.
Based on our review thus far and considering the fixed and firm nature of our EPC contract, we believe the contractors
are responsible for their costs associated with the delay and any costs to mitigate. We will still be responsible for our
share of the owners' costs. For example, costs associated with oversight and operational readiness, which we estimate
to be approximately $10 million per month. We will also continue to incur financing cost of approximately $30 million
per month. Our contract also provides for liquidated damages for each day the two units are late, and this stipulation
should help mitigate the cost of any delay.
Largely because of the protections provided in our EPC contract, even if one assumes the entire 18-month contractor
delay, the rate impact to customers is minimal and remains solidly inside our earlier projection of 6% to 8%. We will
continue our review process and plan to file our 12th Vogtle construction monitoring report with the Georgia Public
Service Commission on February 27.
Now let's turn to an update on the Kemper County IGCC project. As we shared with you in October, we are moving
down three parallel pads towards first syngas production in the third quarter of this year. I'm pleased to report that all
three pads, operational training, control systems validation, and start-up and checkout activities are underway and
progressing well. Steam blows in a series of low pressure tests were completed in late 2014.
The first quarter of this year will include critical airflow tests as well as first fire of the gasifiers this spring. During the
same timeframe, we will be testing and tuning our lignite delivery system. The combined cycle at Kemper project also
continues to perform very well. We expect the fine-tuning we've been able to do while operating the unit on natural gas
will benefit the project greatly during the final integration with the gasifier.
With construction largely behind us and in recognition of the critical startup and operational activities ahead, in early
December, we augmented our existing team by adding a new site Vice President, Chip Troxclair. Chip brings over 30
years of industry experience to the project, primarily in the start-up and operation of gasification plants. Chip's
extensive background combined with existing expertise already onsite will help us navigate the startup process all the
way through the operation of the facility.
Turning to the regulatory front, we continue to have constructive discussions with the PSC staff in Mississippi. As is
our usual approach, we prefer to let those discussions conclude before we share any details.
I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic review.
Arthur P. Beattie
Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the fourth quarter
2014 as well as for the full year 2014. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we earned $0.33 per share compared to $0.47 per
share in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full-year 2014, we earned $2.21 per share compared to $1.88 per share in
2013. Our results for the fourth quarter 2014 include after-tax charges of $43 million, or $0.05 per share, and the
earnings for the full-year 2014 include after-tax charges totaling $536 million, or $0.59 per share, related to increased
cost estimates for construction of Mississippi Power's Kemper County integrated gasification combined cycle project.
Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2013 include after-tax charges of $25 million, or $0.03 per share, and earnings for the
full-year 2013 include after-tax charges totaling $729 million, or $0.83 per share related to increased cost estimates for
construction of the Kemper project. As a reminder, Mississippi will not seek recovery of estimated cost to complete the
facility above the $2.88 billion cost cap net of Department of Energy grants and exceptions to the cost cap.
Results for the full year 2013 also include an after-tax charge of $16 million, or $0.02 per share, for the restructuring of
a leveraged lease investment recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Earnings for the fourth quarter and full-year 2013
also include $12 million, or $0.02 per share, of insurance recovery related to the March 2009 litigation settlement

agreement with MC Asset Recovery, LLC.
Excluding these items, earnings for the fourth quarter and full-year 2014 were $0.38 and $2.80 per share, respectively,
compared with $0.48 and $2.71 per share, respectively, for the same periods in 2013.
Earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 were positively influenced by retail revenue effects at Southern
Company's traditional operating companies, offset by increased operating and maintenance expenses. Full year 2014
earnings were further positively influenced by closer to normal weather and increased customer growth compared with
the full year 2013.
Moving now to an economic and sales review of 2014. As expected, economic growth in 2014 was modest, but after
experiencing weakness during the first quarter, the company expanded strongly throughout the remainder of the year.
This expansion was led by manufacturing output, increased exports and a stronger domestic economy. Total
weather-adjusted retail sales grew 0.9% in 2014, led by industrial sales, which were up 2.3% in the fourth quarter and
3.3% for the year. We have now enjoyed seven consecutive quarters of positive year-over-year industrial sales growth
in our region. We experienced growth across all major industrial segments, with sales now at pre-recession levels. The
strongest segments include primary metals up 8%, and Transportation up 6%, housing-related industries continued to
improve with both lumber and stone, clay, and glass up 5%.
Weather-adjusted residential sales were essentially flat for 2014. Customer gains in the first quarter of 2014 were
interrupted due to extreme weather but began recovering in the second quarter. In fact, we added more than 31,500 new
residential customers in 2014, 15% ahead of 2013, and saw the issuance of 57,000 residential building permits, or 6%
more than in 2013. Personal income, meanwhile, grew at 2% in 2014 compared with flat growth in 2013, but a higher
share of multi-family customer gains continues to challenge use per customer growth.
Weather-adjusted commercial sales were down 0.4% for the year and continue to be challenged by high office and
retail vacancy rates. In Atlanta, for example, vacancy rates were 18% versus a national average of 17%. On the bright
side, however, employment growth continues to absorb excess office and retail space in Atlanta, which is ranked
number 10 nationally in overall office market activity and number one in hotel occupancy rates. Meanwhile, our
economic development pipeline remains robust, with more than 300 projects representing 43,000 potential jobs and
over $29 billion in potential capital investment.
Major announcements in the fourth quarter of 2014 included the decision by Mercedes-Benz to relocate its U.S.
headquarters to Metro Atlanta, a move that will add some 800 jobs to the local economy. General Motors's decision to
locate a technology development center in Metro Atlanta, creating 400 jobs, and plans by Unisys for a research and
development center in Augusta, which will create some 700 jobs. In addition, Häring, a manufacturer of precision
automotive components, will locate a production facility in Hartwell, Georgia, creating an additional 800 jobs.
Looking ahead to 2015, industrial sales are expected to lead the way with growth of 1.7%, continuing the momentum of
the last seven quarters. Some of our industrial customers could be positively impacted or affected by lower oil prices,
while others could be negatively affected by an increase in the value of the dollar and a slowing global economy.
Elsewhere, we anticipate continued residential growth of around 1% and commercial sales growth of approximately
1.4%. The primary driver of residential sales growth should be continued strengthening of residential customer growth
and a continued recovery of the economy, the strengthening of personal income growth. Both residential and
commercial sales should benefit from lower oil prices, which some have characterized as a $700 per car oil dividend.
As noted earlier, the Atlanta office market is one of the most active in the U.S. with vacancy rates dropping throughout
2014. In 2015, we expect to add more than 1 million square feet of office and retail space to be added in just three new
Atlanta-area mixed-use developments: Ponce City Market, Avalon, and Buckhead Atlanta. These new commercial
projects are expected to absorb the majority of their new space during 2015 and should therefore contribute to increased
energy sales this year.
As a final note, we re-engaged earlier this month with our economic roundtable group of regional economists and
executives from several of our largest customers that meets twice a year. The panelists indicated that they expect GDP
growth of approximately 3% in 2015, consistent with our own expectations, but were cautious about the potential

impact of a stronger dollar in the short-term and higher oil prices later in the year. The group agrees with our
expectation that industrial activity will continue to improve but believes that growth will be more restrained than in
2014 and that U.S. housing markets will continue on an upward trend. Meanwhile, the group expects the global
economy to remain sluggish.
In addition to our new sales forecasts, we have included an updated capital expenditure forecast and financing plan in
our slide deck. Our CapEx forecast totals $16.6 billion for the three-year period 2015 to 2017 with environmental
compliance CapEx for MATS wrapping up in 2015 and early 2016 and Kemper CapEx concluding in early 2016. The
CapEx for our traditional operating companies is projected to decline from $5.4 billion in 2015 to $4.2 billion and $3.9
billion in 2016 and 2017, respectively. As we highlighted during our call in October, and as Tom reiterated earlier in
this call, Southern Power had tremendous success finding new renewable projects in 2014. The 2015 and 2016 base
CapEx forecast for Southern Power include the projected investments for several of these projects. As we look ahead,
Southern Power continues to pursue additional renewables projects that meet our investment criteria. To account for
these new potential investments, we have designated $1.9 billion as a placeholder CapEx for 2015 to 2017. Since the
30% investment tax credit will be reduced to 10% after 2016, most of the placeholder dollars are allocated to 2015 and
2016.
Our external financing plan reflects zero equity needs for 2015 to 2017. Our forecast assumes more than $1.8 billion in
additional draws over the three-year period on our DOE loan guarantees for Plant Vogtle 3 and 4, and I would like to
note that we have been very pleased with the success of this financing program. The financing savings we have
captured through our draws to-date have exceeded our projections, further increasing the benefits that we have gained
for customers since certification of the project.
Moving now to EPS, our earnings per share outlook. Our earnings per share guidance for 2015 and – excuse me – 2015
is $2.76 to $2.88 per share. We have slightly widened the range for 2015, particularly to account for potential
variability in Southern Power's earnings. As I discussed earlier, our plans assume that Southern Power will continue its
efforts to find renewable projects that meet our investment criteria. The middle of our guidance range assumes that
Southern Power is able to invest all of the placeholder CapEx that we have included in our forecast. The size of the
range recognizes that we may find fewer or more projects than we are currently forecasting. It is also intended to
capture the potential for projects to slip out of 2015 and into 2016, which would shift the ITC benefits accordingly. Of
course, our guidance range also accounts for the normal variability we have historically seen in our traditional
operating companies as well as Southern Power, including normal variations in weather, the economy, and wholesale
energy prices.
As has been our practice for many years, we have considered much of this potential variability in developing our
flexible O&M spending plan. Going forward, our long-term EPS growth outlook is still in the 3% to 4% range. In
addition, our earnings estimate for the first quarter of 2015 is $0.55 per share.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.
Thomas A. Fanning
Thanks, Art. After a successful year in 2014, Southern Company is entering the new year with a strong sense of
momentum. We see a franchise business that is operating better than ever, solidifying its position as an industry leader
in all phases of the business. We see important progress on major capital projects and a continued commitment to
resolving challenges in a manner that is consistent with our customer-focused business model, and we see a
strengthening economy and a region poised to grow in the months and years ahead.
In short, we believe Southern Company is well-positioned to succeed in the year ahead, behind the strength of our
26,000 employees and their commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable, and affordable energy to the customers and
communities we're proud to serve.
We are now ready to take your questions, so, operator, we'll now take the first question.

Q&A
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Hey, fellows, how are you doing?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Awesome. Hope you're well.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: I am. Thank you. So a couple of questions. When I look at the guidance range for this year, it's
like $0.03 lower on the high-end, and maybe $0.04, $0.05 lower on the low-end than the aspiration you had in last
year's fourth quarter earnings call. Those aren't big numbers, but can give us a sense of what the drivers were that
caused the range to come down slightly year-over-year?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Greg, you're right. It's a little lower. We are where we were with some minor tweaks.
We've had some cropping of the top end due to a couple of things: additional bonus depreciation that we had not
factored into last year's numbers. And we issued slightly more equity than we had communicated last year, most of that
being due to stock option exercises, primarily in the fourth quarter. So instead of raising $600 million of new equity,
we raised $800 million of new equity. So we've got more shares outstanding, and those two things will crop the top end
a little bit. The bottom end really is, as I said in the script, mostly related to performance variability around Southern
Power. If we didn't get any of those placeholder investments, then that's where we'd be at the bottom.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And timing of those as well.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Correct.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Two more questions. Second question, when I look at Southern Power on page eight of
the actual – of your earnings release, you give the quarter-ending and year-ending net income by segment, and
Southern Power did $172 million in 2014. So is it your expectation that at the midpoint of guidance, you'd be at around
the same number, the high-end, the low-end or higher or lower than that?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: It might be in and around that, maybe a little more than that. But it would require that we do
something similar that we did last year the terms of our Solar acquisition.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, Greg, the number at midpoint is $180 million.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: $180 million? Great. And that assumes you deploy the amount of capital you just articulated?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Correct.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: But as Art said, it's highly dependent on how much and when and all that. It's a little
lumpy, yeah.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: No, I get it. Final question, can you give us a sense of – I understand your legal and financial
position with regard to your relationship with your constructor at Vogtle. What are the next series of milestones that we
need to be mindful of to see how this interaction evolves? Do you work with them to get the performance that you
want, and they, in turn, either push back against you on what they deem to be their perspective on the costs?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, just recently we were given a 10,000 page document that speaks to an integrated
project schedule, and so the very first steps are to kind of wade through all of that detail and to really kind of turn data
into information. We need to work with the contractors to understand the assumptions underlying this new schedule
that they have provided. Even from the outset, we believe that they have not taken – this is in the words I've been using

consistently, this is like an unmitigated schedule and that we believe there's lots of things that they could do to improve
it. Weighing against that are the fact that – and this has been disclosed thoroughly in VCM 11, and that they just have
continued issues with respect of engineering and construction, and we look forward to their efforts to resolve those
issues.
If you want to look at something that describes those issues, it's the VCM 11 process, it's an exceedingly open process.
The independent monitor Dr. Jacobs testified at length in VCM 11, so you can get all the information you want to get. I
think it's very clear that the contractors have just had continued difficulties. We say all along that you will always have
challenges, and the issue is – how successful you are is determined by how well you resolve the challenges. We are
working with the contractors to resolve their challenges. Complicating all these issues is the fact that we believe there
are financial disputes among and between Westinghouse and Chicago Bridge & Iron and we think that's having an
impact on the schedule that they have delivered to us.
So it's really going through all that. We're very comforted by the fact that we are committed to building a quality plant
and a safe plant, and we're also very much comforted by the fact that for the additional cost, even if you believe it's
going to be an 18-month delay, which we dispute, that the rate increases to customers remains within the 6% to 8%
level, not the 12% that was originally contemplated. And we believe that for our additional costs, there are liquidated
damages to help offset those costs.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Very clear. Have a good afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thank you.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Afternoon, Greg.
Operator
Our next question comes from Dan Eggers, but before I open the line, a reminder. [Operator Instructions]
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hi, guys. How are you? Hey, how are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Awesome. Great.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Just on the CapEx plans, last year – if you compare last year's CapEx plans to this year's CapEx
plans, obviously they all have this backward shape that you shifted it out a year from what you had last year. What do
you see as the ability to fill in kind of 2016 and 2017 to maybe stabilize that CapEx plan looking out, or are we going to
have to wait until further in the decade to see that happen?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Dan, this is Art. What we've got in there now are placeholders from Southern Power.
Obviously, we could do more. We've got the tax appetite to do a little more than what we've outlined there, but we are
still incubating other opportunities at – around the things that we talked about last year, be it expansion of our ability to
take advantage of additional rate-based items, but – and our investment in pipes and other things, but we're not in a
position to work to talk about that yet. But in addition to that, we've got opportunities possibly on the environmental
side, which aren't fully vetted yet. But, Tom, do you...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, what I would add is this kind of spectrum I've chatted about here on the stump really
since the Dallas Financial Conference, and then again in South Florida. We kind of have this spectrum of opportunity,
Dan, of kind of at a minimum buying back our own shares. We've talked about how for the amount of business risk we
see, we may be equity overcapitalized. On the other hand, given the kind of high market-to-book, PE ratios, however
you want to describe it, maybe it's more attractive to buy somebody else's shares, but as we've talked in the past, that's
always been a very challenging proposition for us to cross. We were a big easy A shop. We believe that we would have
to be reasonably clear about a way to earn a return on and return of the premium associated with any sort of activity

And I think in the middle is kind of where we've tipped our hand as to our sweet spot, and that is buying other assets.
Certainly, that's what we did in 2014. So look for us to be active, creative, and aggressive, in looking for opportunities.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Now you spent a lot of money on assets this year successfully in the process, but it didn't really
change for the growth rate with the deployment of capital. Is that reflective of fact that you're seeing some pressure on
the returns you're getting on those projects? Or is it other things that are mitigating some of that upward inflation you
would have expected on growth?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We've always been reasonably conservative in terms of setting our IRR curve for the kind
of risks and projects we see. One of the things we mentioned back in October that we thought was emerging in the
market remains true, and that is we do have – compared to a lot of people – scale and a robust tax appetite, and
therefore, we look like a pretty good customer, pretty good partner in these deals. So my sense is we're still going to see
those opportunities. It's not causing us to drop our IRRs in any respect. We're able to maintain those to our satisfaction.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. And I guess just one last question on load growth. The expectation is that residential and
commercial show you have positive year-on-year comps after this year not really showing those games. What do you
think going to be the biggest factor to convert that from flat to growth this year?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Dan, this is Art. We're looking at a lot of strong employment growth. I think we've
seen that across the board, especially in the Southeast. We've actually outstripped the U.S. growth rate in employment
and our manufacturing employment is also stronger than the U.S. As the economy continues to improve, as consumers
consume the benefit of this oil dividend that we mentioned in our script, we think household income is also going to be
helped by the portion of that household income that's disposable, and that will translate, we think, into more
commercial sales and hopefully will translate into more household formations, which I believe jumped pretty strongly
in the fourth quarter nationally.
We saw pretty strong customer growth in our fourth quarter period as well, about 10,000 new customers on the
residential side. So there's a number of elements there that we're looking at. I mentioned on the commercial end, we've
got a lot of new projects coming in and around Atlanta. There are really three areas of Atlanta that are trending towards
real strong growth. One is around the perimeter, and that is where Mercedes is going to more than likely announced
their headquarters, and that's a really strong market for new office complexes. There's a midtown development in and
around Georgia Tech, which is mostly office-related, but it has been real strong as of late, as new companies have
announced sighting of that to take advantage of the technology development out of Georgia Tech.
And then most recently is Porsche moved their headquarters down near the airport, and that is a longer-term
development opportunity, but they are looking at expanding office space, Class A hotel space, and other residential
opportunities in and around that particular area, so there are a number of things that we point to. Some will affect 2015
directly, some will be later. But those are real strong indicators to us that we're going to see a turnaround in commercial
and residential growth per customer.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Dan, let me do a quick deconstruction of the household income statement. When you
look at the revenue part of a household, it's wages, and while we have seen some pressure there from a variety of
factors: people withdrawing from the workforce or people moving from full-time to part-time, or whatever full-time
jobs they have a disproportionate share going to service kind of industries, we still see pressure on the revenue side.
But on the cost side, the expense side, if you will, of the household, as Art mentioned, I think energy prices, low gas
prices have really helped. So the net consequences, net income may go up and we believe it's either going to be through
increased savings, in other words, retiring household debt, which is a good thing and makes the economy more
resilient, or more consumption.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Excellent. Thank you, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet.

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Yeah. Hi. Hey, Tom. Good afternoon. Just a first quick question, just where did 2014 CapEx
come in at?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Hold on a second, Steve. Let me get that in front of me. We were very close, I think, we
slightly under-spent the totals that we had. But...
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: ...it's lumpy [indiscernible] where it occurred.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: I guess the reason I ask is it's a bit of the same question, but from what I can tell just going
back to last year, your 2015 CapEx is up $1.4 billion from a year ago for 2015 projection, 2016 looks like it's up $1
billion. But it's the same growth rate and if not even a little bit of a lower 2015 base. So again, just to clarify, the bonus
depreciation, I guess, is a piece of that, maybe you could quantify how much that might be impacting the rate base?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. And, Steve, you're right. The delta there is Southern Power. That's kind of what
we're looking at. Remember, what we did in 2014 was essentially put almost a three-year CapEx allocation into one
year, and that was kind of $1 billion to $1.4 billion, low $1 billion kind of allocation number. We're moving that
number up to around $2.5 billion. So that's kind of what we're doing on CapEx. The delta is mostly with Southern
Power. Art?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Steve, if you look at the traditional operating companies, we were within $20 million
in total of what we budgeted for the year. You throw Southern Power in, we actually spent $310 million more than we
had forecast. So...
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: ...from a CapEx perspective.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Okay. Okay, and just separate question on the Vogtle information. Did you get any – I know
you disclosed expected monthly costs for – owners costs for delay, but did you get any update from the consortium in
terms of what the expected total construction cost of the plant will be?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: And is there any way, based on the issues that they've mentioned in the saying to kind of
estimate that?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, just remember, Steve, we are still going through the details of the latest integrated
schedule, so we really don't know what's involved and what their assumptions are and everything else. It's 10,000
pages, and so we've got to go through that. I mean – and what we really need to know, I think, is our belief and we've
received assertions from executive management of the contractors and throughout 2014, and in fact, the schedule could
be shortened. So we need to understand what their position is. We need to understand what's required. Our contract is
very clear, that it is the obligation of the contractor to undertake all methods necessary to meet the schedule
requirements in the contract. That means adding new shifts, adding more people, paying overtime. Typical things you
would expect to see in any construction undertaking. So I won't know the answer to your question until we kind of sort
through all those issues. We're working as hard as we can to do that right now. You should look to VCM 12 as
probably a more instructive kind of position for us to be in. We'll file that February 27.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Okay. Okay, thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Well, good afternoon, guys. Hi, Tom.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: So just picking up on Steve's questioning, just curious if you – you've said here today
that liquidated damages should help to mitigate the impact of your costs, which I imagine means the $40 million a
month number you referenced. So is it a safe assumption that the per diem amount adds up to a little less than $40
million a month, or have you disclosed that at any point?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We have not, but we've got a lot of questions about it, and we've informed our partners
that we probably needed to disclose what we think the amount is. So here we go. If you – there is a lot of factors that
I'm going to give you a subject to, but essentially, if you evaluate kind of the maximum amount of liquidated damages,
assuming the full 18-month delay, again, subject to a lot of factors, we believe that Georgia Power's share would be
about $240 million.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Well, wouldn't – what about – you say 18-month delay, but does the LDs kick in
April of next year pending your current litigation?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No, the – yeah, right. They would kick in as of the guaranteed substantial completion date,
which is a term in the contract of April 16 and April 17.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: So that $240 million number you've just given for Georgia Power's share, is that more
than 18 months? Is that kind of from April 16-April 17?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: So it's more like a three-year?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right. You've got it.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. And then I'm just curious on the...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, wait, Jonathan, I think...
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Sorry.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: ...an important point, excuse me – no, I apologize for interrupting. There's a limit. We
aren't anywhere close to it right now. So I just want to give you that. To the extent there's other issues, there could be
more liquidated damages.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: So what is the math behind that $240 million? Is it a daily amount or is it...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's what it is, it's a daily amount. And you can back into that if you want to.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: And the limit is $240 million? Or the limit...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It's way in excess.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: So if there's a longer delay, effectively, that would come into play?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Right. That's right.

<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. And you mentioned just a couple of times that you would remain within the 6%
to 8% range on customer rate impact?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: What are you assuming in that that you faced the incremental costs you have talked
about less this $240 million, something like that?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. And what's a rule of thumb of – is there any rule of thumb you can give us of
what would push you above that range?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We think we're still way short of exceeding that range. We've talked a lot about estimates
and all. We are more near the middle of the range than we are the top, let me say it that way. And we think we've got
lots of range to stay within that range that we've been discussing.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. And just one final housekeeping thing. There was a big downtick in
depreciation in the fourth quarter – $424 million has been $500 million-ish a quarter. Was there something unusual
happened there?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Jonathan, there was. Alabama Power had been deferring some costs, some O&M
costs, under a previous commission order, accounting order, and they filed a new depreciation study with the
Commission last year, and they found out they had available some cost of removal elements of the depreciation that
they could offset these other deferred costs with. And so there was an entry made in the fourth quarter of last year at
Alabama which actually increased non-fuel O&M and decreased depreciation. And so it had nil effect on income. But
that's why you see the deltas in those particular line items.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Oh, okay, great. Thank you. On the subject of non-fuel and O&M, as you talk about
your 2015 guidance, what's a sensible run rate given you've had obviously some noise in the numbers this year?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, we've got back to, what I would call, a more normal element this year, so I would take
the 2014 number and grow it by 3% to 3.5%, about 1% of that would be environmental, and the remainder would be
just normal company operations.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Great. Thanks for all the clarity, guys.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, sir.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Jon, let me just add a little more lagniappe on that. The reason we're able to keep the
6% to 8% range in play is because of all the benefits that we've added on this $2.3 billion, we mentioned in the course,
I think, of the opening comments that we've been very happy with our ability to finance under the DOE loan
guarantees, and in fact we're exceeding where we thought we'd be on our estimates on that. In fact, we did a draw in
December, $200 million for about 3%, and the average life was 22 years or something like that. So it's been a terrific
vehicle for us, and actually performing better than what we thought. So that $2.3 billion looks awfully good.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: So that includes the $800 million of PTCs, correct?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's right.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: And would you have any recourse against the contractor if a further delay sort of
pushed those off the table?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I don't know, Jon. Here's my view. I frankly think, in my opinion, the contractor has given
us what we believe is an unmitigated schedule. We think there's flexibility to improve the schedule. Doesn't take into
account the comparative good progress to-date of our plant, I think we still have a decent amount of room before we're
exposed to losing any of the PTCs for Unit 4. Unit 3, we're still very well protected.

Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Tom, how are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Great. Hope you're well.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: I am, thank you. What are you assuming with regards to stock options in your 2015 guidance?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Paul, we've got no assumption for additional equity in 2015, 2016, or 2017. To the degree we
have stock option exercises, we have plans to put in place a repurchase program that would, to the degree we have
proceeds, to reduce those back down to as close to a zero level as possible.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Got it.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And I guess given there, you're already $200 million ahead based on last year.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Based on last year, but that's where we're holding it.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Right.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: And we'll obviously see some more this year, but that's our plan to address it.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And then what have you achieved, what remains to be done in order to qualify for the full DOE
benefits or tax benefits at Kemper?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: We have filed for those – oh, at Kemper, I'm sorry, I was thinking Vogtle. I'm sorry. You're
talking about investment tax credits?
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Yes.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes. You're talking about the Phase 2 investment tax credits that would relate to our carbon
capture percentages. We have – yeah, we have to have it in service by April of 2016 to qualify for those. So right now,
our schedule would meet that requirement, and there would have to be 65% or proof of 65% of carbon capture for all
the gas that was produced, the syngas that's produced.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And that is our target.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: That's the only hurdle?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, it's a deadline and an amount removed.

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct. We ended up the year with a common equity ratio of about 43.5%, and so
that's still within our margin of planning. We don't plan on going north of that, but again, we'll just see what we get,
and we'll take out, as Tom described, what we – as much of what we raise as possible.

Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Michael. How are you?
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: I am fine, guys. Congrats on a good 2014. I have one or two Vogtle questions, and then
some housekeeping ones. When you go back and read the Vogtle testimony, some of the interveners, not the public
staff, are kind of waving the flag of prudency, meaning – or imprudency. Just curious for any comments you have in
that regard, whether they really have a leg to stand on by making that type of argument? What is the requirement in
Georgia for something to be – for a prudency disallowance or a prudency review of Vogtle? Can you kind of just go
through that from a regulatory construct, please?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, sure. We don't think there's been any credible testimony that suggests there's
anything imprudent in the project to-date. When you think about kind of the brick-and-mortar cost of the plant as
provided by the contractors, where – I forget the last number, I think, was 0.5%, I mean it's right on the money. In
terms of our own oversight costs, this is kind of the $10 million per month that we see. It's absolutely prudent for us to
have oversight, because we are absolutely committed to providing the highest quality, safest project possible. Recall
also part of those costs are tax issues and insurance and some other things, I just don't see very many legs at all for any
imprudent evaluations of that.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And just some housekeeping items. How much bonus depreciation cash flow benefit
do you expect in 2015, and which of your segments' rate bases will that have the greatest impact on?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Okay, Mike. Let's see. About $625 million that would impact 2015, and maybe $125 million
to $140 million in 2015 that would impact 2016, and it's mostly in the regulated OpCos, but I don't have a split for you.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We can certainly get that to you later, if you want.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. Or just kind of pro-rate it across the subs based on size and scales amount.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I mean that would be reasonable.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. And, Art, the comment – you answered an earlier question about Alabama and what
happened to D&A in the fourth quarter. When we think about going forward, is that the new run rate, kind of what we
saw, or the new base kind of a lower new base what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2014? Or is it more kind of the run
rate of what we saw in prior quarters and the fourth quarter of 2014 was a one-off?

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I think the prior quarters would be the better run rate number to go with. But when you think
about non-fuel O&M in that regard, most of those deferred costs were deferred in 2014, so I would leave those in the
base for non-fuel O&M.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Meaning grow O&M by a couple of percent a year like you commented...
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: ...but also ensure the D&A is kind of looking at the first nine months' kind of run rate-ish?

Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Good afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, how are you?
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Great. Thank you. Just wanted to talk about growth in terms of gas demand and as you
think about supplying your customers. As you think about your growth profile, are there some moving parts that could
cause you to want to be more aggressive in terms of a growth in gas infrastructure investment? How are you all
thinking about that these days?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Oh, absolutely. Yeah, really interesting stuff there. If you dial it back to 2014, remember,
we have switched a lot away from coal to natural gas. In 2014 – and one of the things that we always warned people
was that gas was more volatile and there were certain risks around it. It was not a panacea. What we saw in the year,
2014, was that we generated about the same amount of energy with coal as we did gas, about 40% each. Why was that?
Because we had the fuel flexibility during polar vortex one and two to switch off spiking gas and be able run our much
cheaper coal fleet. In fact, over the year, we saved about $125 million in fuel savings because we had that flexibility.
So let's keep in mind what's trying to happen in regulatory space in terms of shutting down coal in America.
Now, interestingly, in the fourth quarter, we flipped that with very cheap gas prices. We ran the numbers, gas
generation went up to about 49%, coal flipped back to about 31%. So going forward, what do we expect? The budget
for 2015 would show gas at 44% and coal at 36%. So we'll see. Now how does that impact kind of our appetite for gas
infrastructure? I've mentioned to you all before that we could see ourselves getting involved in gas pipeline, now
because gas is much more, kind of, synergistic with the rest of our business as opposed to, say, where we were five, six,
seven years ago.
One of the things we find is that there are lots of price disparities of gas transportation, say, from the East to West side
of our system. We've been able to evaluate a lot of opportunities. We're seeking those out aggressively, and I think the
kind of notion would be that we would, in fact, be an anchor tenant to whatever we invest in. So we're working very
hard to make those things come real. We'll see.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Okay. But – so it sounds like just given the kind of commodity environment we're in,
though, that certainly more gas supply and becoming an anchor tenant certainly very high on your list of things you're
interested in doing?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure it is. And we're going to be disciplined in how we invest. And I'll tell you something
else, here again, commenting on 111(d), to the extent that we've got to add more gas units in the future, we need more
infrastructure. We're pretty well filled up right now in terms of FT, which is how we cover all of our units. So we need

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I think it's moving along. They're resolving the valve issue there. So I think it will not
have a complete impact on kind of where we are. So when you think about the reactor coolant pumps, there have been
some design issues that have manifested themselves in China. We think those are getting dealt with satisfactorily. We
don't think that they will impact our critical path. Said another way, we're benefiting from not being the alpha plant
here, and we're learning from our Chinese experience. So we have people located in China, we follow those very
closely. We've learned from them already. We're happy with where we are, at least from our China experience.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Okay, understood. Thank you very much.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Brian Chin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Brian. Thanks for joining us.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Hey. Good afternoon. Thank you. Appreciate it. Good afternoon. Springboarding off of
Stephen's question on gas infrastructure, we've seen a little bit more color on how alternative capitalization structures
trade. Just what are your latest thoughts on, if you were to go into that route, would that be considered more part of
your regulated utility operations? Would you consider alternate capitalization structures for those? Just a little bit of
updated thoughts there?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Okay. So you guys have heard the old saying that I believe in the long-run view of
finance, there's lots of tricks, but there is no magic. If there is a structure that makes sense, then we'll certainly consider
it. We've never been a fan of YieldCos. We think those are short-term positive, long-term troublesome. If it's an MLP,
if there's a real tax advantage, we'd certainly consider those things. But we believe that keeping a simple balance sheet
and providing long-term value is really the right course of action for us. But we'll consider anything.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Got you, got you. And then one last question from me. Could you just remind us again of the
dividend policy and dividend outlook given the revised change in CapEx spending and guidance?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure. Of course, everything I say about dividend is subject to board approval, that's their
deal. But we've been on a $0.07 trajectory for some time now, and we feel that having a regular predictable sustainable
flow of earnings per share that permits for a regular predictable and sustainable dividend policy is how you maximize
value. If you look at our TSR over any kind of longish timeframe, you will see that the vast majority of TSR for us is
driven by our dividend policy. So that remains foremost in our thinking about how to grow value for shareholders. So
of course, I've got to be subject to everything. But most importantly, subject to final board authority. But we feel very
confident in our ability to deliver a sustainable dividend policy as we have in the past into the future.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Thank you very much.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet.

Our next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Ali.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Hey, Tom. How are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Super. Hope you're well.
<Q - Ali Agha>: I'm doing well, thanks. Hey, Tom or Art, I just wanted to clarify, the 3% to 4% growth rate in EPS
that you showed us off this new 2015 base, was that specifically you're referring to 2016 or 2015? Or was that a
longer-term growth rate?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Long-term. It's kind of both, but it's long-term. What we see in our projections is that
we're able to stay within that envelope pretty comfortably over a long timeframe. And I've got to give you all of the
admonishments about things that are unknown and everything else, but from what we know right now, we can stay
within that envelope for a long time.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And, Tom, just correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought previously when you guys had originally
given us 2014 through 2016 earnings guidance and then some longer-term outlook, I thought the plan was given the
way the spending was working, the 3% to 4% was 2014 through 2016, and then you would accelerate beyond that. But
I guess that's not the case?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No, no, no. Here's kind of where we are. We're kind of in the same spot. Let's think about
the years ahead here. So – and I don't want to give too much more color other than kind of the commentary we
provided in the past, but if you look at kind of 2015 to 2016, things look pretty normal there. 2016 to 2017, you have
the expiration of the 30% investment tax credit, that could have some impact on your ability to impact earnings per
share through investment tax credit investments associated with Solar. So that could have a shaping impact. And then
beyond that, we've always talked about really environmental CapEx and the startup of new generation CapEx. All of
that remains the same, and that really shifts the nature of your curve. So what we said was when you consider the
impact of 111(d), which depending on how the final rule looks, could have a dramatic effect of the backend CapEx
curve as well as coal ash and 316(d) (sic) [316(b)] and a variety of other things. We'll just have to see how those turn
out. That's all what I've been talking about.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. So think of this really 2015 through 2018 or that time period, and then later in the decade,
things change?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, certainly, as we know more, we'll adjust it. What you should take comfort in is for
what we know, we think this is a very comfortable envelope.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Separate question. Art, if I did my math right, it looked to me that your effective tax rate in 2014
came in lower than previously thought. What was driving that, and how should we think of an effective tax rate for
2015 and beyond?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Ali, are you talking about the cash tax rate? Or are you talking about the accounting book
effective tax rate?
<Q - Ali Agha>: I'm talking about the book tax rate, Art, adjusting for Kemper charges and all of that. If you exclude
all of that, the book rate looked a little low to me.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah. Well, I'm looking at over the last few years in total, though, you could have had some
effects from Southern Power and their investment tax credits, which was booked in the fourth quarter of this year, and
then you've got higher AFUDC as well, which is not taxable.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: But your book tax rate doesn't change very much. Your cash tax rate changes a lot. Right?
And for 2014, Art, it looks like a little over 8% there.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<Q - Ali Agha>: And then, Tom, as far as Kemper is concerned, are you in a position now with the latest round of
charges to kind of say, hey, is the confidence much higher that, hey, I think we've got it all now under control cost-wise
or still too early to make that statement?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, Ali, I've been burned in the past, haven't I? Look, we've got Chip Troxclair in place
here and we've had very good conversations, in fact I had the whole Management Council of Southern Company at
Kemper about a week ago, and I think the team is working hard. The thing – and so, yeah, we've got a lot of
confidence, okay, especially in the schedule. We're doing, I think, a better job at managing kind of the want-tos in
terms of CapEx as opposed to the must-haves in terms of CapEx as we finish start-up.
The one caveat I just have to throw out to you all that I've been consistent about from day one are the unknown
unknowns. As you start the thing up, something may happen that nobody thought about. We've added more inventory
to insulate ourselves against risks for machines that don't work the way they're supposed to or just defective
workmanship.
The good news is when I evaluate kind of the work we've done in pressurizing trains A and B, steam blows, welding
connections, and other things, we've done pretty well. We had some hiccups here recently in some of the pulverizers
and some of the lignite drying equipment, but we've already provided for fixing those issues. We're working hard to
stay within the estimates we've given you. So I'm as confident as I can be, there are things that could cause us trouble in
the future, but I feel as good as I've been.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And my last question, when I look at the weather normalized sales data that you provided us
and I looked at the four quarters of 2014, this fourth quarter was the slowest over the 2014 period. Was there anything
particularly that was causing the slowdown and which you don't think will continue in 2015? Or how would you
explain that?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Ali, I don't get excited about quarter evaluations whenever I look at this stuff, because
especially on whether normal adjustment, there's all sorts of variability. I tend to look at kind of longer-term, longer
trend and see what's going on. The biggest issue, I think, facing kind of residential and commercial sales growth is this
issue of – and it's curses and blessings – industrial strength during the downturn recall that a lot of our industrial
customers retooled, put in technology, and in fact, we've been able to grow but the efficiency of output has been
terrific.
Well, the good news is that's given us strength even against a weakening dollar, right? The bad news is we haven't
added jobs as much as we thought we would, and therefore, wages haven't grown. We think that we are starting to kind
of take up that slack, and we're starting to see the signals, as the things Art went through, that in fact, jobs will return,
wages will increase, and therefore, spending will increase. Those are the longer-term trends we see. And don't just hang
it on wages. Remember the information Art gave you about the household income statement and how the expense
items, largely for energy, thank goodness, are going down. People have more money in their pockets to spend.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Understood. Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, sir, thank you.

<Q - Mark Barnett>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. How are you all?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Hey, Mark.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Excellent.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: So you talked a lot about kind of the bigger projects and whatnot, and I appreciate the new
details. That's really helpful for us. Just wondering more maybe on the O&M trajectory that you've seen so far this
year? Would you say that – I mean, of the fourth quarter I haven't seen the segment breakout yet, so would you say
you're seeing more of that in one particular OpCo or another? I mean, for example, there's a lot of that being driven out
of Alabama?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, real quick: here again, as I was talking to Ali about don't go off on one quarter about
consumption, don't go off in one quarter about O&M. Because we have this flexible O&M system we have in place for
years now which helps kind of attenuate our ultimate financial results.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: But there is something, Mark, and I addressed it on an earlier question. It was related to the
Alabama entries that roughly bumped up non-fuel O&M by $100 million or so, more than what we expected in the
year, but that occurred in the fourth quarter. So Alabama, if any of them, and as I said earlier most of those were 2014
deferrals anyway, so they would've occurred throughout the year had we not deferred them and then cleared them up in
the year....
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So what's kind of a long-term O&M growth rate 2014 to 2015?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: 3% to 3.5%.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: 3% to 3.5%? That's a good trend.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Yeah. Yeah, I know there can be some quarterly noise. I just wanted to clarify, because it
sounded like it was probably related to those regulatory things. Just a second question, I guess maybe another way of
looking at some of the comments you've made already about the clean power plant. What kind of conversations have
you started, particularly in Alabama and Georgia, about kind of handling compliance and handling the plans that would
be necessary should it survive in its current state? Or how to, I guess, approach for different proposals?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, look, Mark, thanks for kind of raising that, we haven't really talked about that. You
know that we work in a real-time fashion with the folks in our states. We have a common purpose, and that is to serve
the customers and communities with clean, safe, reliable, affordable power, and I know that certain initiatives out of the
EPA or elsewhere get high focused on certain issues, particularly 111(d) would be carbon. We have to balance those
results for the benefit of the citizens and communities we're privileged to serve. When I think about where EPA is on
111(d), we know, and I think they know, that they have a flawed proposed rule. And they've received – gee-whiz, now,
I forget what the number is.
Over four million comments or something. It's unbelievable. But they're going to have to, I think, deal with some of the
low-hanging fruit, if you will, in the final rule. I'm guessing we do get a final rule sometime in the summertime, maybe
call it August. And I think they'll deal with some resolution on this kind of cliff 2020 date. I think they'll also fix things
like nuclear, particularly nuclear under construction. So, look, I think it's almost premature to comment kind of where
we think they'll end up. We've had lots of opportunities to talk to them so has everybody else. 31 states, 32 states have
come after them in terms of comments, Attorneys General, Governors, Public Service Commissions. I think there's a lot
of ground to cover before we have a final rule. Let's see what the final rule looks like, and then the ball will be in the
court of the states in order to implement their state of limitation plans.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Okay. Thanks for that.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, sir. Thank you. Appreciate you being with us.

Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with UBS. Please go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Michael.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hey, it's – well, it's Julien here. How are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Julien. Great. What happened to Michael?.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent. Glad to hear it. He's – we hid him at home, don't worry.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Got it.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Here we go. So I wanted to follow back up here quickly on Southern Power.
Rewinding back to the start of the call there, the $180 million midpoint you talked about I think for 2015, how much of
the ITC benefit is baked in there? And probably the kind of the second part of that question's really – you talked about
the 2016 to 2017 expiration, what kind of an impact do you think that is in terms of a headwind as you kind of lose
those benefits for new projects?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So I'm going to...
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: I know it's a little detailed.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to guess that kind of the benefits from ITC – and don't get too
precise on the $180 million, that's a planning estimate, it's very lumpy. Okay? But the specific question was what's the
assumption in the midpoint? It's $180 million. The contribution of ITC is probably over $40 million. Okay? So that's
what you should think of.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: But then it probably falls off pretty materially in 2016, right? So the roll off by 2017
is...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No, no, no.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Go for it. Sorry.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No. 2016's probably okay. It'll probably be a similar number, perhaps even more,
depending – say you have a project that comes in, you think it's going to come in December of 2015, slides into 2016.
So it really is lumpy and dependent upon when you close these deals and when they go in service. So 2017, you should
kind of estimate that as ITC drops from 30% to a 10% kind of number under current tax law, then you should shave off
some percentage. So let's say two-thirds of $40 million to $50 million number, just in rough math. Right? So that's the
kind of math I would use if I were you. That would be the earnings per share headwind.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: That's great. Let me just ask – oh, sorry. Go for it.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And, Julien, I'm talking specifically about solar right now. To the extent we invest in
wind, it has a different profile. To the extent that some of our CapEx is associated with gas pipelines, it has a different
profile. So I'm attaching all of that on solar.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Right. And will...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Go ahead.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: I was going to ask you even more holistically, what do you think about solar spend in
general? I mean the Southeast has seen a lot of projects but we haven't heard much on you guys from Florida or
Alabama. I mean is there a potential there, I mean, either by the utilities themselves or via Southern Power? I mean is
this something that you could see more spend in 2016? Or is it tricky to see that happening just given the timeline of
the 30% ITC, et cetera?

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, I frankly would expect to see more of the solar outside of the Southeast. There may
be more opportunities, but when we originally got into solar, we really started looking at where the solar resources
were the best, right? The Southeast tends to be kind of cloudy and has high humidity. It's not the best area for solar,
even though there's been a lot of movement in the state of Georgia. Recall, Georgia Power was voted the
Investor-Owned Utility of the Year last year by the solar industry. So we're going to continue to look wherever I think
the resources are best and where the contracts are the best. A particular area of emphasis for us also has been with the
DOD, the Department of Defense. You know that we've announced several base solar deals in Georgia, and I think
we've announced one in Gulf. And then we'll see about other bases elsewhere in the Southeast. So look for that.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Right. And then let me turn my attention just a little differently here. The cash
infrastructure that you alluded to earlier, is that under Southern Power as well? And when can we find out details about
that? I mean I imagine that's probably tied to your talk earlier about carbon rules and finalization, and ultimately what
kind of coal to gas switching we're really going to see in the Southeast, is that kind of a good way to think about it?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Julien, whatever you did to Michael is kind of what I'll have to say about gas pipelines. I
really – we can't – I don't want to reveal the nature of discussions on any gas pipelines at this point. The specific
question you asked about, kind of would it be under Southern Power, I wouldn't be surprised that if we put it in another
sub besides Southern Power. That's really kind of a governance question.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: All right, got you. And then lastly, turning back to Kemper quickly, as you had – you
kind of alluded to potentially hashing out a deal in the state again. And I know you don't want to touch it too much but
what's the timeline there? Because I know we've talked about before having a deal, and then it seems like that slid a
little bit just given the timeline of the project itself. But when could we see something come to resolution there, if you
will? I mean what – and what does it relate to specifically? Is this the first half prudency review that you guys are going
to try to hash out? And again, I don't mean to pry too much.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, you do.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: [indiscernible].
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It's your job, and I appreciate it. Hey, Julien, what we've talked about in the past is kind of
a grand settlement where we wrapped together all of the kind of issues that relate to Mississippi Power and for a host of
reasons. I know you understand we don't want to say too much about that. We would like to see those issues resolved
sooner rather than later, so let's just leave it there, if we could. I appreciate your indulgence.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: There we go, absolutely. Well, best of luck with this.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thank you, we appreciate it. Hey, and one other comment I just want to make. We talk
about other stuff, other stuff could be OpCos, right? For gas infrastructure.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: The utility OpCos?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It just depends on opportunity.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Okay?
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: You got it. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Hey. How you doing.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Awesome. How are you?
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Oh, I'm managing. I wanted to follow up on a comment you made regarding the consortium and
potential conflicts among the contractors as to who is supposed to cover what. And I was wondering if you could just
elaborate a little bit more on that?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: What I would prefer that you do is go to their own statements. CBI has been reasonably
public about these things. They have – these are my words, not theirs. With respect to the contract, they have
essentially, I call it, an intercreditor agreement, but it's an agreement to share the cost and benefits of the contract
among and between themselves. And I think there are some financial disputes between the two of them, and we
believe, anyway, that those disputes have some bearing on this unmitigated schedule we've got.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, that's great. That actually leads me to my sort of second question which is if one of the
contractors – I know this is kind of a little extreme, but let's say one of the contractors is unable to fulfill their
obligations, are the other contractors obligated? Is there a surety bond? Is there any protection, I guess?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, Paul, the major mechanism you should look for in the contract is the guarantee, the
corporate guarantee of Toshiba or the financial integrity of the obligations of the participants as contractors.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, excellent. And then finally, with respect to the sales growth, just to sort of follow up on
Dan's question, the numbers have been coming in a lot less than what you guys expected in the past, and you do
mention sort of some of the things, the oil prices and what have you and some of the developments that are happening
there that you think will be – that will improve the situation, I guess, going forward. But just, I know you guys analyze
it very closely. Have you guys reappraised what you think long-term customer usage will be, efficiency deployment,
what have you? Is there any – because the numbers do seem to have come in just historically a lot lower, and I'm just
wondering if you guys have any sort of new ideas or any differing ideas as to what you had in the past about what's
going on with electric, yeah?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet. Yeah, man, let me just kind of pick at that a little. Our plan was set last year at
0.7% sales growth, and we actually had 0.9%. The difference was the fact that industrial was a blockbuster year at
3.3% relative to weather-normal flat elsewhere.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Correct. Paul, it's a long-term sales growth number. Total retail sales are going to be in the
1.2 percentage range. Now whether that's a reassessment or not, that's kind of our current look long-term. I don't know
that it would be termed a reassessment of that, but it's probably lower than it was five years, seven years ago. A couple
of other things you need to think about is in-migration into the states, we continue to see that and to give you a little
more land gap around that, it's – we look at things like United Van Lines, it ranks their top 10 states for in-bound
moves. Georgia and Florida are number eight and number two, respectively. We've seen most of our customer growth
in those particular regions, 1.1% customer growth in both Gulf and Georgia last year.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And if you recall, during the recession, in-migration froze up.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We think that was all housing-related.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Now that housing is springing up, we're seeing the migration again.

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: So it's a reflection of, yeah, is at a turning point? We certainly hope so. But it's based on the
evidence, not just a bunch of drawing lines and hopes and wishes.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The other thing that I think I would point to is the information that we've been traveling
under is kind of similar to what the Fed has been traveling under. The Fed has called for some higher GDPs and
actually show up, and where the softness is in their projections has been in household wealth creation just as we talked
about. So as we improve that, I think our overall picture will improve.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, thanks so much.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, sir. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Dan.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: So I just had a couple clarifications related to the construction projects. First on Kemper, I think
you had mentioned on your slide that the next set of milestones are the gasifier, first fire, and I think the 8-K said that's
going to be in March. But I was wondering on the gasifier air-flow testing what the timing is of that milestone?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, we're currently in the process of that, but we still look at three main milestones here.
First, fire to the gasifier. Is it going to be this spring? Okay? The first syngas production, which is the second milestone
I would point you to, is sometime this summer. And then in the late summer and fall, we expect to have reliable syngas
to each combustion turbine. Those are the three milestones that we would rather point to than the micro-milestones of,
what did you mention? The...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Air flows.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Air flows. Those are sub-processes to the major milestones that I'm pointing to.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And in fact, Dan, what we've been doing so far, and that's what I'm kind of gratified with,
the tests that we've done so far that have gone reasonably well have been testing the financial integrity of the
construction. And it's gone very well.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: Okay. And what did you say again was the timeline for the production of the turbine, the third
milestone?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Oh, reliable syngas was...
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: Right.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: ...for one turbine, it's late summer. For the second, it's fall, this year.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: Okay. And then looking at your slides five and six, I just want to make sure I understand. So I
think you mentioned in your opening remarks that for Unit 3, the CA1 (sic) [CA01] set is going to be in the spring, but
that's not in the picture, I don't think, on slide six.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: So...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: CA01 is not in the picture.

<Q - Dan Jenkins>: Correct. Okay. But that would be – that is a near-term thing in the spring, pretty much, is that
CA01 set?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. So the spring could go – I mean theoretically, it's April, May, June.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's kind of what we're looking for on CA01.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: And then in your third quarter slide, you had some talk for Unit 4 on the horizon, the CA20,
which I think if I'm not mistaken that's what the green one is on Unit 3, right?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, that's correct.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: I'm pretty sure. So when is that supposed to be set for Unit 4, the CA20?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Dan, if I could, here – instead of getting specific here, if I could ask you on this, we just
got this new integrated project schedule, and there may be some impact for the longer-term issues. That's why we stuck
with near-term here, and kind of very near-term. The longer-term issues could be impacted by the resolution of the
schedule. And so we're going to have to be a little – oh, I don't know, a little vague until we probably get to VCM 12.
VCM 12 that we file later this month, and then will kind of be discussed throughout the spring. We'll have much more
detail there for you. I think we'll be in a much better position to estimate those kinds of issues.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: Okay. So I guess what you're saying, you want to retain some flexibility around that based on...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right. Thank you for that.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: Okay. And then just – you talk about the fact that there's been – there's this unmitigated proposal
by the contractors. But what do you see as some of the potential mitigation efforts that they have, I guess, put forward
so far that you think would give us some confidence that the schedule could be shorter than what is – the 18 months?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Dan, here again, I've got to ask your patience. Let us go through what they've given us.
We've received assurances by executive management of the contractors in 2014. We have our own ability to adjust. We
have our own schedule progress to-date. There's a host of issues here that caused the foundation for our belief to be that
there is something we could do and that the contractors aren't exercising all of their obligations required under the
contract. But let us get to the end of this discussion with the contractors before I open up what the number may be.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: Bye.

Our final question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium. Please go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Ashar, how are you?
<Q>: Pretty good, Tom. How are you? I guess most of my questions are answered, but Tom, this is a – I guess I keep
asking the strategy question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, sir.
<Q>: Because when you were the CFO, the risk adjusted was kind of the cornerstone.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.

<Q>: And so as you and the board look into investing in Solar, what it hasn't used is now a higher range on the
earnings variability...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.
<Q>: ...which further adds to the volatility of kind of a risk-free investment as there used to be. And I'm just trying to
understand why that is happening.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I got you. Absolutely. There's kind of a glib answer, and there's kind of a deeper answer.
The deeper answer is you know, having known me for gosh, over 10 years or whatever it is, a long time, that I have
been a deep proponent of the notion that value is a function of risk and return. And when we think about our business
model, we always seek to achieve the best risk-adjusted return.
When you look at the value driven by our franchise, which is the overwhelming delivery of value to Southern, the
franchise is as good as it's ever been, and I feel terrific about the state of the franchise. When I go to the opportunity
that is in front of us, with particularly solar, it's driven by kind of – that opportunity is driven by kind of the initiatives
that we have seen. When we originally dabbled our foot in the water on solar, we thought it might be applicable in the
Southeast. Sure enough, it was, and so we started slow and gained some momentum. And in fact, Georgia has turned
out to be a big participant in the solar market.
Along the way, particularly last year, we were surprised by the fact that a lot of people were really looking to Southern
because we had scale. We had a tax appetite. We're a great partner. We understand technology. And I think – and I've
mentioned before First Solar is kind of in that realm. The only risk that we see that adds to kind of our corporate data, if
you will, is just the lumpiness of the investments, not the technology of the investments. And we think the degree of
investing is achievable. So I would – while you may see some spread over time, we think we'll be able to hit the
numbers that we put out there.
The final comment: you all know that I've never been an enormous fan of tax-advantaged investing. Certainly, the ITC
profile is something that's attractive. We think we have the tax appetite to be able to consume those tax benefits in a
timely manner. And remember, too, that one of the co-incident benefits of that kind of investing has been the very
strong cash flow compared to our EBITDA in the long run.
So as we see ourselves moving through time, where we're slowing down our CapEx from a corporate standpoint,
particularly at the operating companies – we're finishing up a construction cycle – the fact that these opportunities avail
themselves, the fact that they help earnings, the fact that they improve cash flow, the fact that long-term we believe
there's very low technology risk and we're dealing with very credible partners, we think maintains this very attractive
risk-adjusted profile.
Recall, too, at the end of the day, the foundation of our investment is based on our ability to deliver long-term dividend
growth. I think we finished in 2014 with a payout ratio around 74%. We've been able to perform. The other thing that
we said, I think in October – and I always get my calls confused – but we're one of, I think, two companies in the
industry that over the last 10 years, somewhere in there, has been able to produce within our earnings range every year
100% of the time.
For all my purposes, I can't guarantee that going forward, but at least our track record is exemplary. And I think when
you think about management teams around the system, around the industry, when you think about business models
around the industry, I think Southern Company is a company that is going to continue to deliver that performance, in
my opinion, for a long time.
<Q>: No, I totally agree with your later points. But it just creates, right, Tom, as we used to write, there used to be, I
forget with those terms used to be called, synfuel tax credit earnings, which Progess used to have everything.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, right.
<Q>: These are now ITC earnings now coming into utilities of things. There is a differentiation of quality of earnings
going down.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, but, Ashar, I would really differentiate. And we should take this offline just for the
benefit of everybody else on the call. But we should really differentiate synfuel from ITC. Gee-whiz, there is an
enormous industry for solar. It's pretty clear that not only the administration but Congress is in favor of promoting tax
code that helps renewables. That's very different than synfuel. And I feel very confident about the ability to sustain
these tax credits and how they will improve our cash flow and really help Southern and, therefore, our shareholders for
years to come. I really would think about those differently.
<Q>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thank you.
Operator
And at this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?
Thomas A. Fanning
Yeah, thank you. Once again, thank you all for joining us. We really enjoy these times together. I'm really delighted
with the results that we've been able to show in 2014. When I was just talking with Ashar about the value of the
franchise, when you look at the foundation that is Southern Company, it is as good today as it has ever been in my
memory. And I think we can continue to produce the kind of results that have tremendous value to our customers and
our shareholders. We're taking advantage of other opportunities in the market in solar and other areas and we're seeking
to add to that platform of value creation. So thank you for your time today. We will continue relentlessly to meet the
challenges and provide the best opportunity available as an investment to you all. Thank you very much.
