Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call.
Altria had another terrific year in 2014. For the full year, we again delivered against our two long-term financial goals.
We grew adjusted diluted EPS by 8% and we paid out approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS to shareholders in
dividends which totaled $3.9 billion. We also raised our dividend by 8.3%, marking the 48th increase in the last 45
years. We further rewarded shareholders by repurchasing nearly $1 billion in shares between the program we
completed in 2014 and the new $1 billion program we announced in July. And in 2014, Altria delivered total
shareholder return of 34.5%, far outpacing both the S&P 500 and the Food, Beverage and Tobacco Index. We achieved
these results by the clarity of our core strategies and our talented employees' strong execution against them.
Here are some important segment highlights from the quarter and the full year. The smokeable products segment
produced outstanding results by consistently executing its strategy of maximizing income while maintaining modest
share growth on Marlboro and Black & Mild over time. The segment grew adjusted operating companies income by
almost 8% in the quarter and by nearly 7% for the full year, primarily through higher pricing. The end of the federal
tobacco quota buyout payments also contributed in the quarter. The segment also expanded adjusted operating
companies income margins in both periods.
Marlboro was the primary driver of these strong financial results. PM USA's long-term investments in the Marlboro
architecture have strengthened the brand's equity and expanded its ability to engage both loyal and competitive adult
smokers. In 2014, the brand posted its third consecutive year of retail share growth. And Marlboro continues to
innovate. In November, PM USA expanded distribution of Marlboro Menthol Rich Blue to 28 states, primarily in the
eastern U.S., to enhance Marlboro's position in the menthol segment. It's early, but Rich Blue is off to a good start.
In the machine-made large cigar category, John Middleton strengthened its leadership position in the tipped segment.
The company posted solid volume growth in the quarter and the full year, driven primarily by Black & Mild. Over
time, Middleton has enhanced the brand with innovative introductions like Black & Mild Jazz. And in December,
Middleton announced the national expansion of Black & Mild Casino, a dark tobacco blend in the tipped segment.
In the smokeless products segment, USSTC continued to execute its strategy in 2014. USSTC grew full year adjusted
operating companies income by more than 3% and expanded its already strong adjusted operating companies income
margin by more than 1% despite a slowdown in the industry volume growth rate. We estimate that growth rate to be
about 2% for the last 12 months. USSTC maintained retail share leadership in the smokeless category in 2014 with its
premium brands, as Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined share in the quarter and for the full year. Copenhagen
posted strong share gains in both periods behind the strength of Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen. In 2014, USSTC
began enhancing Skoal's value equation with a new equity campaign and targeted investments to narrow price gaps on
Skoal Classic. We're pleased with the results we've seen so far.
Turning to innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark made steady progress as it builds e-vapor category leadership. The
company is taking a disciplined approach and remains focused on building a robust portfolio of superior, innovative
products for adult smokers of e-vapor. In the fourth quarter, Nu Mark evolved MarkTen by adding a new offering with
2.5% nicotine concentration by weight in classic and menthol varieties. In December, Nu Mark completed its national
launch of MarkTen e-vapor products, achieving distribution in over 130,000 stores. And at year-end, MarkTen was
ranked among the top e-vapor brands nationally based on retail market share.
Nu Mark also acquired and integrated Green Smoke in 2014. This acquisition added great people, deep supply chain
expertise and technology, and we're excited about the brand's potential. It's still early days in this dynamic and evolving
category, but we believe Nu Mark is increasingly well-positioned for the future.

In 2014, our alcohol assets continued to diversify our income and contribute to income growth. In the wine segment
Ste. Michelle posted another year of double-digit operating companies income growth, primarily through higher
volume. Critics awarded Ste. Michelle's premium wines more than 180 ratings of 90 or better in 2014. Our earnings
also benefited from our SABMiller investment which continues to support our strong balance sheet.
So to sum up, 2014 was another excellent year for our strong premium brands, for our company, and for our
shareholders. We're maximizing income in our core premium tobacco businesses and innovating for the future. We're
extremely proud of the results produced by our very talented employees and of our track record for creating value for
shareholders. Looking ahead to 2015, Altria forecasts its 2015 adjusted diluted EPS will increase by 7% to 9% to a
range of $2.75 to $2.80 from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.57 in 2014.
Finally, today we are announcing some executive leadership changes, all to be effective March 1 this year. First Dave
Beran, our President and Chief Operating Officer, has decided to retire after 38 years of distinguished service to the
company. Dave's strong expertise, knowledge, financial acumen and leadership have contributed immeasurably to
Altria's success and he will be missed. When Dave retires, Howard Willard will become Altria's Chief Operating
Officer. He has significant experience having been with the company since 1992. In addition to his current role of CFO,
Howard has held leadership positions in numerous business functions of the Altria companies.
Billy Gifford will succeed Howard as Altria's Chief Financial Officer. Billy has been with Altria since 1994 and also
has held numerous roles including President and CEO of PM USA and his current role as Altria's Senior Vice
President, Strategy & Business Development. These moves are consistent with our long-term succession planning and
these talented experienced leaders will serve us well for the future.
I'll now turn things over to Howard who will discuss Altria's business results in more detail.
Howard A. Willard
Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. In 2014, strong performance in our smokeable products segment helped
drive adjusted diluted EPS growth of almost 16% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. A lower effective tax
rate on operations and lower interest expense were also contributors to adjusted diluted EPS growth in both periods.
The smokeable products segment delivered strong adjusted operating companies income growth in the quarter and for
the full year. The segment also expanded adjusted operating companies income margins 1.8 percentage points in the
fourth quarter and 1.9 percentage points in the full year. For the full year, PM USA grew Marlboro's retail share by 0.1
share point and grew its total cigarette category retail share by 0.2 of a share point.
L&M share gains also contributed to PM USA's full year retail share performance while the cigarette discount segment
declined slightly. The smokeable products segment's fourth quarter reported operating companies income grew 7.6%
primarily driven by higher pricing. For the full year, the segment's reported operating companies income declined
2.7%, primarily due to higher gains on NPM Adjustment Items in 2013. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and
other factors, PM USA estimates that its fourth quarter and full year cigarette shipment volume declined approximately
2% and 3% respectively and the total industry volumes declined approximately 2.5% and 3.5% respectively. The 2014
full year industry cigarette decline of 3.5% continues to be in the range of the decline rate we've seen in the last few
years.
In cigars, Middleton's reported cigar shipment volume increased by almost 4% for the fourth quarter and over 6% for
the full year driven primarily by Black & Mild's strong performance in the tipped cigar segment. Black & Mild's retail
share declined 0.4 points for the quarter and 0.3 points for the full year. In the smokeless products segment, adjusted
operating companies income was unchanged in the fourth quarter as higher pricing and higher volume were offset by
higher promotional investments and the timing of selling, general and administrative expenses.
For the full year, the segment grew adjusted operating companies income 3.3% primarily due to higher pricing and
higher volume, partially offset by higher promotional investments and product mix. Adjusted operating margins
declined 2.5 percentage points in the fourth quarter to 60% and grew 1.1 percentage points to 63.4% in the full year.

After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, USSTC estimates that its domestic smokeless products
shipment volume grew approximately 2.5% in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2014. Copenhagen and Skoal's
combined retail share grew 0.4 share point in the quarter to 51.3% and grew 0.5 share point to 51.2% for the full year.
The wine segment delivered strong results in the fourth quarter and the full year. Ste. Michelle grew operating
companies income by 17.8% in the fourth quarter and 13.6% in the full year, primarily driven by higher volume.
Shipments increased 9.6% in the quarter and 4.8% for the full year.
That wraps up our operating results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, let's
cover a few housekeeping items. As a reminder, comparisons when made are against the fourth quarter and full year of
2013 unless we note otherwise. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 32% in the fourth
quarter, down two percentage points and 33% for the full year, down one percentage point.
For the fourth quarter, Marlboro's net pack price was $6.02, up $0.16, and lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.55,
up $0.17. For the full year, Marlboro's net pack price was $5.96, up $0.13, while the lowest effective priced cigarette
was $4.49, up $0.15. The cigarette discount segment's retail share was 24.9% for the fourth quarter and full year, down
0.3% in each period. The estimated weighted average state excise tax was $1.49 per pack for the fourth quarter, up
$0.02, and $1.48 per pack for the full year, up $0.04.
Wholesale inventory changes are one factor PM USA uses to estimate adjusted PM USA and industry volumes. PM
USA estimates that its 2014 wholesale inventories were approximately 2.4 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter
and 2.3 billion units at the end of the third quarter. In 2013, PM USA's wholesale inventories were estimated to be
approximately 2.5 billion units at the end of both the fourth and third quarter.
PM USA estimates that the 2014 cigarette industry wholesale inventory levels were 5.5 billion units at the end of the
fourth quarter and 5.7 billion units at the end of the third quarter. PM USA estimates that 2013 wholesale inventory
levels were 5.9 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter and 6.3 billion units at the end of the third quarter.
Copenhagen's price gap versus the leading discount brand was 32% in the fourth quarter and full year, down three
percentage points for the fourth quarter and four percentage points for the full year. Copenhagen's retail price was
$4.19 in the fourth quarter, up $0.12, and $4.13 for the full-year, up $0.07. The price of a leading discount brand was
$3.17 in the fourth quarter and $3.14 for the full year, up $0.15 in each period.
CapEx was $47 million for the fourth quarter and $163 million for the full year. Ongoing depreciation and amortization
was $59 million for the quarter and $208 million for the full year. Looking ahead to 2015, we expect capital
expenditures will be in the range of $200 million to $250 million and the depreciation and amortization will be
approximately $200 million.
Operator, do we have any questions?

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.

<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Sure. So, Marty, I guess first I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on the current
economic outlook and how that's impacting cigarette consumption, because we've seen now two consecutive quarters
of improving volume trends, which I know generally you would attribute just to quarterly volatility, and the full year
was in line with the long-term average, but at this point can we say that we're seeing some evidence of stronger
consumption, or as you look across the industry better portfolio mix?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yes, that's a great question. Let me give you our view of the adult tobacco consumer for
2015, which I really think goes to the heart of what you're asking about. We've been cautious for the last several years,
as you know, as we went through this difficult recession. We are actually seeing a modest improvement I think in the
economic situation for the adult tobacco consumer, although it remains a bit of a mixed bag. The U.S. economy is
clearly improving, as everyone knows, and particularly in relation to the rest of the world economies. We see
unemployment and underemployment have come down. We see housing starts are coming back. We see very good
consumer confidence numbers. So I think all of those are positive factors.
On the other side of the ledger, you have labor participation rates may be not where they should be and then
year-over-year wage gains are still modest. But I think on balance, our view is that the adult tobacco consumer is
feeling better about their economic situation and their economic future and we expect some modest improvement in
that over 2015.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. And do you have any sort of industry volume outlook that you're willing to share
at this point?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: No. We don't do that, as you know. But I think, especially if you look out over the last
three to four years, which includes of course this very difficult recessionary period, you see it, Matt, really 3% to 4%
and you call it maybe 3.5% on average over the last four years and PM USA has done better than that at about 3%
because of its strong portfolio and its share gain. So we don't see any big disrupters in that, but we don't forecast
volume going forward.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thanks, Marty. And, Howard, if I could just follow up on the smokable products,
the 8% adjusted OCI growth in the quarter, obviously it's a very strong number, but I guess I'm almost surprised that it
wasn't even stronger given the absence of quota buyout cost during the quarter. Can you just talk about the increase that
we see in per pack cost year-on-year excluding the quota buyout and where within the cost architecture of smokable
products you're seeing place to reinvest back in the business?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Sure. Yes. I would tell you that as you note, the cost per pack in the smokable segment
was up quite a bit in the fourth quarter. I have to tell you, I think that is primarily driven by timing. If you looked, we
had less expense in the third quarter, and we don't tend to manage our expenses and our project execution quarter to
quarter. We're really managing to a full year and I think if you look at the trend of expenses in the full year, it was at a
much more normal level. But certainly, we felt good about the fourth quarter performance. We had strong increases in
net revenue per pack, up around 5% and of course we did receive the savings in the federal payments in the quarter.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thank you both.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Matt, thanks for calling in.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good morning, Vivien.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: So to follow up on Matt's question, clearly cigarette industry volume dynamics are easing,
but we've got a deceleration in MST. So can you talk about the interplay? I know we talked about this a little bit last

quarter and it's something we'll watch over time, but with another quarter of deceleration I was hoping you could opine
on what's causing that deceleration and whether there's the dynamics in both cigarettes as well.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: I think we'll have to say. Obviously let's start with smokable. It really had a strong –
Howard's already described a strong quarter and a strong year and we're very happy with the smokable performance.
And actually the USSTC had a very good year. It grew its income at about 3%, but we've observed this volume
deceleration now over the last three quarters and that's at odds with what we've seen for the prior several years.
So, Vivien, they have more choices today and so there's some movement there, but these things best I think are
evaluated over time. So I'm not sure I have any big insights to share with you this morning on that, except to say that it
speaks I think first of the wisdom of having a total tobacco platform. So as adult tobacco consumers move within these
categories that Altria is well-positioned to offer them premium brands with great margin structure. So that's how we
think about the business, and we'll have to study the volume I think for some time yet to know the answer to the
question you're posing.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Fair enough. For kind of modeling purposes, if you will, is this a deceleration that you guys
are planning for to continue internally as you think about 2015?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, I'd like to say we try to help you guys as much as we can with your modeling, and
I applaud your courage for trying to get me to tell you, but I really honestly, the answer I gave you was the honest
answer, which is we're going to have to see. And we've set up our year with our operating plans I think which is all
embedded in our full-year guidance, which is quite strong at 7% to 9%.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Fair enough. On the cigarette side, as we look across to 2015, can you provide an update on
the outlook for the state excise tax environment, given how benign it's been over the last few years, please?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: I missed what you said, Vivien. You faded out right at the end, I'm sorry.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Oh, I apologize. Can you provide an outlook for the 2015 state excise tax environment?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yes. Well, we're always cautious at the beginning of the year, aren't we? And we've all
seen that the state excise tax environment has been more moderate in the last several years than it has been previous,
but we go into each year prepared to answer the call, because as you've observed and others have observed, as soon as
the legislators come back in January, we see the proposals start to roll in, and there are a number of them that are out
there. We have very good government affairs people that point out that this is unfair to tobacco consumers and these
products are already highly taxed. But we'll have to see how the year plays out. It's been a fairly moderate environment
over the last several years and we hope that plays out in 2015.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Terrific. Thank you very much.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks for calling.

The next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Hi. So, in terms of your EPS growth guidance of 7% to 9% for this year, it is in line with
your historical trends and it seems very conservative given the strong pricing and tremendous cost savings you have
this year. So I assume you'll be fully reinvesting these savings into your different businesses? So my first question is
why not let some of this strength flow to the bottom line? And then second, could you give us a sense of what the
different investment buckets are? For instance, 70% of the savings will be invested in e-cigs and vapor, 30% in
combustible. Just, again, trying to get a sense of your priorities.

<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure. Let me offer you a slightly different perspective. In previous years we've come out
I think for the last several years at 6% to 9%, not at 7% to 9%, and the factors that went into our judgment this year
about how to guide include some of the things we've already spoken about on the call, which is a modestly improving
situation for our adult tobacco consumer. Obviously, we have the benefit of some federal payments, but we I think
pointed out in our release we have some pension and healthcare cost changes due to long-term assumptions. And so
every year you put your guidance together and you have puts and takes about what you're going to do. Some years we
invest, some years we have factors, which are flowing in the other direction. I think 7% to 9% in the current
environment is a strong signal about the confidence we have in our business and our operating company plans. Howard,
you may want to supplement that answer
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yes, no, I think you covered it, Marty. The only other thing I would point out, and this has
been with us for some time and I think has been quite orderly, but we're continuing to unwind the PMCC business, and
as that progresses there are fewer and fewer asset sales that are available. So that's another element that plays into the
overall company performance.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. That's really helpful, guys. And I think it also highlights the consistency of your
business as well as all the different puts and takes as you mentioned. And then I do have a broad question on the
consumer and uptrading. So I'm certainly hearing from a lot of the retailers that consumers' greater disposal income is
leading to uptrading. So is this too what you've seen in your Marlboro franchise? And has there been a mix shift to
premium Marlboro, if I could call it that? And also you generated the strong net price realization in cigs, but I'd be
curious to hear from you what happens when gas prices go back up? In other words, how sustainable do you think the
strong pricing in cigs will be especially if and when gas prices rise?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Okay. Let me try to comment on a couple of those to try to help you out. I think gas
prices for us historically, we have not called out gas prices as one of the principal drivers of consumer behavior,
although we acknowledge that it had some effect. To us it was really more about the unemployment rate, consumer
confidence, and housing starts.
Now the way that gasoline prices have gone down so precipitously has obviously had a bigger effect on the consumer
rate. The C stores, as you and others have pointed out, are seeing better traffic, and I don't think there's any question
that it's contributing to consumers feeling better about their economic situation. But historically, Bonnie, we have not
called that out as one of the big three drivers, so I don't know what people are expecting for gasoline prices but it
probably will not have that much more of an effect.
We did have very good pricing. And the way that we achieve pricing, as you know, is we took list pricing in 2014
combined $0.13 a pack, and then as always, we can moderate our promotional allowances and we did so last year. We
moderated our allowances on Marlboro Special Blend and on Black and, as you know, we're able to do that quite
tactically by state by using our SVP tool. So we did see a year in which we think we could take some pricing and I
think you'll see that in the numbers for 2014.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.

marketing and R&D expenses were up over $200 million, so I just wanted to get a bit better sense of where that
spending was allocated in 2014, how much is that sort of sustainable into 2015 in thinking about the guidance for
2015?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah. I think with regard to marketing and R&D, I really don't feel that there's been any
dramatic departure this year versus prior years that I would call out, with probably the one exception being that this was
the year that we made some significant investments through Nu Mark in the e-vapor category. And obviously that's had
an impact on our R&D investments as we build that product pipeline, and certainly there's some marketing that
supports that as well. But that's really the primary impact there.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then maybe on the e-vapor category itself, if you look at some of the measured
channel data, the category has slowed. You've obviously expanded the MarkTen distribution. I'm just wondering if you
could talk about your assessment about the category generally at this point. And then you also talked about more of a
disciplined approach to building MarkTen. So can you just elaborate on that and, in light of the dynamics, how you're
thinking about the performance that you're seeing from MarkTen?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure. Well, let's start with the category. Our estimate is that the consumer spending in
2014 increased by about 50% to about $2 billion, and that's compared to a year before, which I think you've seen the
numbers of roughly a 160% increase. So you can see that it has slowed, although its 50% increase is still fairly large.
It's growing in both traditional trade channels and it's also growing in vape shops, which are harder to get a line of sight
into. To dimensionalize that spend though, $80 billion is spent on conventional tobacco products versus the two that we
estimate, so just to put it in its proper context.
With respect to Nu Mark, our belief is is that that is an interesting enough category for us to participate in and to aspire
to have leadership in. That is a leadership that will be achieved over the long term and for the long term, which is why
we use these words about financially disciplined and over time. We want to participate there. We believe Nu Mark had
a very good year. Gosh, we got the MarkTen product in 130,000 retail stores, and I mean that's easy to say and that's
hard to do. And so our sales force in Nu Mark did a great job there. They rolled out, as we mentioned in our remarks,
the 2.5 product. Consumers continue to look for their product and so I think a lot of what's going to happen with vapor
is about manufacturers trying to bring out products that better satisfy their consumers and that's what Nu Mark is doing.
It's for the long term, it will be for the long term and we are learning our way in with our consumer and using a
disciplined approach. But with the acquisition of Green Smoke and their people and their technology, in addition to Nu
Mark, I am very encouraged about what we have in the pipeline for MarkTen.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly, Howard, just in terms of 2015 guidance, can you tell us
how much share buyback is incorporated?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah. I'm not going to guide at that level. I think we've previously talked about the fact
that we have an existing share repurchase program in place. It's got a little over $500 million left and we had
communicated we expect to finish that by the end of the year. So that hasn't changed and certainly any share repurchase
plans we have are incorporated into the 7% to 9% guidance.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks, Judy.

<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Yeah. Hi there. Good. Thank you. Just following on the vapor question and I guess just have
you got any update on potential timescale for commercialization of PMI's heat-not-burn?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: No. We're working on it. That has to go through the FDA process, as you know, and
we're working closely with them on it and I think we feel like we're making good progress and I think PMI would tell
you the same thing, but I can't give you a date because it's subject to the FDA's processes.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Chris. Thanks for calling.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Thank you. Just I have two questions. I think a bit of a follow-up from earlier
questions. The first one would be, Marty, in relation to Marlboro and the discount products on the market today, that
price gap is quite narrow at 32%. It's been there for several years. You talked about I think to an earlier question like
the improving consumer environment. Could we see that price gap expand? So therefore, are economic conditions in
such a place that it would allow for premium products to take a little bit more pricing than discount products?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: That would be our hope of course as we try to maximize income in the smokeable
segment which is the price gaps have been higher at times in its history, but you have to be thoughtful about how you
do that and when. But certainly, that would be in our interest of maximizing income.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And then another question on the, called the other division, where you have
PMCC and Nu Mark and I know it's hard to characterize each of those businesses and how they perform, but you had a
large investment and a huge national launch in MarkTen in 2014 and the investments so that operating loss in that
division obviously expanded. I'm just curious, is it such that you got a full pipeline that that operating loss couldn't
come down? Or has the Nu Mark business which is obviously generating some decent sales now gotten to a point to
where we should see less operating loss in the coming year?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah. I know that everybody's trying to get under the all other, but we've really got two
things operating there. We're investing in Nu Mark which makes sense for the long-term and Howard has pointed out
that as we wind down PMCC we have fewer asset sales and they tend to be lumpy from time to time. So that's what's
going on over there, and we're just not going to guide down too much deeper than that, Chris, if you'll allow me.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: I understand. Maybe I think I made mention earlier just to follow on about a strong
pipeline of products at Nu Mark, should we expect some more activity behind product launches this year in 2015? Is
that a fair question?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, it's a fair question and I'm going to reserve my answer so that I don't hand out my
competitive plans on the phone, but yes you should be thinking about this I think in terms of the category of we expect
to have products that will be launched that will be better and better as I expect that other people are planning similarly.
I think that's exactly the nature of the category right now. We've got good plans for that.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thanks so much for your time.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks for calling.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Can you just give a sense of what some of the investments, what type of investments would
be ideal for the savings that you've got coming from the buyout just in terms of equity building? Obviously you have
some relatively limited options in some of your marketing capabilities. Can you just give a sense of what the tools are
that would be highest priority for how you think about applying some of those extra funds?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, again, I'm not going to lay that out to tell everybody exactly how we're going to
spend our assets to improve our business. But you've seen us over time do such things as develop the Marlboro
architecture, to improve our Marlboro digital site, to roll out new products like Rich Blue and Black and so forth.
There's lots of places for us to invest in our businesses. Our goal is to keep our brand franchises strong and relevant and
there's lots of tools to do that even as you point out in a category which has higher regulation. And then we have
obviously as has previously been described, some investments to make in our innovative products. So that's how I think
about it, Michael, at a high level. I'm just not going to lay it out in detail as I'm sure you can understand.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Sure. That's fair enough. Thanks. And just looking at the 4Q market share numbers, even
with the improving consumer health, you had the discount segment really driving the share gains with Marlboro flat. Is
that a focus for 2015 to try to – obviously I'm sure you enjoy getting the lift in discount share, but is there a way you
want to try to manage that to bring Marlboro further ahead? Or is it sort of steady state also – how do you think about
Marlboro versus the total portfolio and what the priorities are in terms of just how you approach that?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, it's a good question. Our aim is modest share momentum on Marlboro, and we
previously characterized, I think that if we get a tenth or two-tenths a year, that's great for Marlboro. Listen, our focus
is on premium. Over 90% of our shipments are premium, but there is a discount segment, and so we try to participate
there. And L&M is a great offering at that price point.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just lastly on Green Smoke, the MarkTen rollout you've
taken nationally, what's the next step for Green Smoke? Would that follow it?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, we're working on that. I mentioned I think to someone else that we've been
integrating Green Smoke. They've really helped us quite a lot on the front end with supply chain. They had a
well-established supply chain and we've been relying on them quite heavily to help us in that regard. They have very
good people and they do have a good technology pipeline. We've been integrating all that in 2014. Remember we
closed on this I think in April, if memory serves. And so we've now been integrating that and we have an integrated
pipeline of products as well as we become more efficient with those two organizations. So, yes, I would expect to see
more from the combined Nu Mark Green Smoke assets.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks for calling.

Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Yeah, good morning, everyone.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Nik.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: First, I wanted to just say congrats to Howard, Dave and Billy on the all new roles, so congrats to
you guys. Two questions from my end. The first one is on the Marlboro architecture. I mean it's been a couple of years
now since it's been implemented, and I was wondering if maybe you had some context perspective you can share in

terms of brand equity scores or any kind of indicator – quantitative indicator on kind of what the effect has been? I
mean clearly we've seen the Marlboro franchise do well over this timeframe, so I just wondered if you had some more
granularity on some of the quantification behind Marlboro. And the second question is, and this is I guess more
strategic, it seems like the super-premium cigarette segment is doing fairly well, and has been doing fairly well, and
there's really not that many players in that market. And I just wondered from a strategic standpoint, how PM USA
really thinks about that?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, let me tackle those in turn. Good questions, both. You're right. Marlboro
architecture has been a terrific boost for our business. We talked previously about having the flavor families and
allowing different marketing approaches in the families. And what it's done for Marlboro.com has been great. I think
that's shown up in the performance of Marlboro. With respect to any quantitative brand equity data, we may talk about
that some in CAGNY. So if I can just ask you to hold tight on that, I think we'll have some further information for you
in that regard.
With respect to super-premium, let me just mention the strategic approach to this, which is we're always looking for
places in the market where there is business, where we either are under indexed or we don't have an offering, and so we
look at things all the time. And while I don't have anything to announce about that, I can assure you we look at places
to build our business both there and elsewhere.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Great. Thanks, Marty.

Media representatives are now invited to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line
of Michael Felberbaum of The Associated Press.
<Q - Michael Felberbaum>: Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael Felberbaum>: Hi. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color, more broadly on the
strength of the Marlboro brand, and how it's been able to sort of stave off some increased competition as well as
weather the recovering economic situation.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, Marlboro is a fantastic product for adult smokers that comes with decades of
leadership, with lots of innovation and with lots of offerings for people who are in the category. And it has consistently
grown its share over decades. We are the stewards of this brand, and we pay a good deal of attention to Marlboro. It
speaks both to the product's function and to its equity, and that's been Marlboro's story. I've commented earlier on the
call about we see that the economy is strengthening a bit hopefully for our adult tobacco consumers. We certainly hope
that's going to be the case in 2015.
<Q - Michael Felberbaum>: Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thank you for your question.
