During today's call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC's Regulation G.
Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the earnings
release or the company's supplemental information package that was included in this morning's Form 8-K. This
package is also available on the Simon website in the Investor section under Financial Information Quarterly
Supplemental Packages.
Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and
Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.
David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
All right. I'll go through some financial and operations – good morning. I'll go over some financial and operational
results. First of all, we reported funds from operations of $0.90 per diluted share for the quarter, which was First Call
consensus estimate. This was accomplished despite the recording of transaction expenses of 47.6 million in the quarter,
or $0.14 per share.
As you may know, GAAP now changed at the beginning of 2010 to require the expensing rather than the capitalizing
of transaction expenses. FFO as adjusted, which excludes the impact of the debt extinguishment charge related to our
August unsecured debt tender, was $1.43 per diluted share, an increase – very importantly, an increase of $0.05 from
$1.38 in the third quarter of 2009. It was another quarter of industry-leading operational performance. We continue to
see improvement in our business conditions.
Let me talk – the next few comments will focus on our mall and outlet business, which contributes over 90% of our
domestic NOI. Comp sales on a rolling 12-month basis were $483 per square foot, up 7.6%, as compared to $449 per
square foot as of 9/30/09. Tenant reported sales were 10.6 higher during the third quarter of 2010 as compared to the
third quarter of 2009. We are pleased to see this increase in our tenant sales. However we're more focused on growing
our own revenues, and I'm pleased to report that our third quarter consolidated revenues grew $54 million, or 5.9%
over the prior year period.
Comparable property NOI growth was 3.6% for the quarter, 2.8% for the nine months. Drivers of the increase in
comparable NOI continue to be rent growth from higher occupancy, higher overage rent and lower bad debt expense.
During the quarter, growth in base rents contributed 210 basis points to our comp NOI growth number, overage was 80
basis points and lower bad debt expense was roughly 60 basis points. As of 9/30, occupancy was 93.6%, sequentially
50 basis points higher than 6/30, and 80 basis points higher than one year ago. As at September 30, the re-leasing
spread for the trailing 12 months was $1.13 per square foot, and we're seeing gradual improvement in deal flow and the
pricing of our space.
Acquisitions, let me just give you an update on that and disposition activity. On August 30, we completed the
acquisition of Prime at a value of approximately $2.3 billion. The transaction added 21 outlet centers, outlet properties
comprising 8 million square feet, to our portfolio. As of September 30, the properties were 94.7% occupied, with
average base rents of $24.52 per square foot, and they generated sales of $406 per square foot. This portfolio is an
excellent fit for us. It presents a compelling opportunity to benefit from shoppers' demand for brand-name merchandise
at attractive pricing, and we believe that our strong track record of operational excellence, financial resources, history
of successful acquisitions, position us to meaningfully improve the performance of these assets for the benefit of
tenants, retailers and consumers.
On the disposition front, on July 15th we completed the sale of Simon Ivanhoe, our 50/50 joint venture. Simon and
Ivanhoe Cambridge, our JV partner, received consideration of 715 million euros. We recorded a gain of $281.3 million
on the transaction, and as we discussed, we retained a 25% interest in four development properties with Ivanhoe and
Unibail.
Capital markets, again we were very active in the third quarter. In August we purchased for cash outstanding notes
maturing in 2013 and 2014, 1.3 billion of the bonds were tendered at a weighted average duration of 3.5 years and a

weighted average coupon of 6.06%. We recorded a $185.1 million loss on the extinguishment of debt as was reported
in the quarter in connection with this purchase, and currently we sold $900 million of 4 3/8 senior unsecured notes due
2021. The notes were priced to yield 4.42%, the lowest coupon of a 10-year REIT bond in history. Net proceeds from
the offering were used to partially fund the purchase of the senior unsecured notes tendered.
As a result of these activities, we've significantly extended the duration of our senior unsecured notes portfolio from 6.8
years to 7.5 years and slightly decreased the weighted average interest rate on that portfolio. In the third quarter we also
closed five new loans totaling $700 million. Our share of that was approximately 300 million. The weighted average
interest rate on the loans was 5.3% with a weighted term of 9.8 years. Noteworthy, we recently locked rate at Fashion
Valley Mall in San Diego on a 10-year basis at 4.3%.
At the beginning of the year, many of you were interested in how we planned on using our significant cash on hand,
and at 12/31/09 we had 4 billion. This gives you a sense of how we deployed the cash in primarily three ways: a
reduction of our unsecured debt, including the net use of cash in connection with the tenders of 1.5 billion, retirement
of secured debt and the un-encumbering of assets of 1.1 billion, cash investment in Prime and other acquisitions of
roughly 550 million. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1.3 billion of cash on hand, which includes our
share of joint venture cash, and our availability on our corporate facility of over $3 billion for a total liquidity position
of $4.3 billion.
Capital expenditures, if I could turn to that, is a little bit higher than we originally planned, approximately 200 million,
which reflects an increase in redevelopment activity as a result of the improving economic conditions and demand. This
capital spend in 2010 includes the completion of our expansion to South Shore Plaza in Boston, The Domain in Austin
and the expansion of the Houston Premium Outlets, which will open this month, the expansion and the renovation of
Las Vegas Outlet Center, which is projected to open in March 2011, and more than 35 anchor and big box replacements
in 2010. You'll be happy to note I will not read them. You can find them in our 8-K.
And during the third quarter we constructed – we started construction on two Premium Outlet centers, Merrimack
Premium Outlets in Merrimack, New Hampshire, which is a 380,000 square foot center projected to open in June of
2012. There are 1.7 million residents living within 30 miles of this site, with an average household income of $87,000,
as the center is located one [hour] north of metropolitan Boston in sales tax-free New Hampshire.
Johor Premium Outlets in Johor, Malaysia, which is a 175,000 square foot center projected to open in November of
2011. It's located one hour north – one hour's drive from Singapore. And Johor Premium Outlets is being developed in
a joint venture with Genting Group. Our interest in that is 50%. By the end of 2011 we will have 11 Premium Outlet
centers open and operating in Asia, generating total NOI at the property level of well over $200 million.
We continue to look at opportunities to upgrade existing department store. Representation are working to identify
future department store availability based on existing performance. We have been very successful in our efforts to
re-tenant department store and other big box space, and have another 25 deals approved, with openings expected in
2011, and again, you'll be happy to note, and I won't read those.
As part of our renewed redevelopment push, we've identified 16 regional mall assets as potential transformational
properties. The scope for these projects ranges from adding department stores, restaurants, specialty store tenants, to the
redevelopment of the entire asset, and we expect work to commence on some of these in 2011.
Finally, let me conclude by saying that we are extremely pleased to announce an increase in our quarterly dividend
from $0.60 to $0.80, an increase of 33%. This number will, this getting to 2.60 for the year, which will approximate our
taxable income, and it also positioned us on a trajectory to pay at least $3.20 per share in 2011.
Based upon our results for the quarter and the expectations for the balance of the year, we're also pleased to today
increase our 2010 FFO guidance as adjusted by $0.13 on the low end and $0.08 on the high end, and again, we're
pleased to reaffirm to you that we expect to be sector-leading growth in 2011 and beyond. And we're ready for
questions.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Christine McElroy of UBS.
<Q - Christine McElroy>: Thanks, guys. I've got Ross on the line with me as well. David, just following up on your
comments on redevelopment, can you give us some of the economics behind expected redevelopment starts over the
next couple of years relating to those 16 malls? Like total spend, timing of starts, that type of thing?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well redevelopment is an art, not a science, but I think
our projected spend on these 16, depending on the scope, will be approximately 1.5 billion, and we would certainly of
the 16 hope to get a couple of them started in 2011. We're making some good progress on securing some commitments,
and then with those commitments I think we'll begin to actually start the projects. So I would hope that we would have
two to four next year, and then at least get the 16 going by 2013.
<Q - Christine McElroy>: And as you were looking at those opportunities, what kind of returns are you targeting?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I would say to you that they're consistent with what
we've done historically, and in the redevelopment we're still striving to get double-digits, around 10%. Some will
average a little bit lower than that, but some will be above that, so I would hope that we would be able to generate
about 10% on the total investment over that three or four-year period of time.
<Q - Christine McElroy>: What's your occupancy today, including temp tenants? Can you give us a sense for how
temp leasing has trended so far in the second half relative to past years? And can you discuss some of the economics of
the Toys"R"Us pop-ups as compared to normal temp leasing?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well let me just say, as you know, we don't include
seasonal or temporary tenants in our occupancies.
<Q - Christine McElroy>: Right.
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: So unless a tenant – unless a retailer is in there for over
a year, it is not included in our occupancy. So the seasonal tenants are – if you – and as you know, you've watched
plenty of our malls, our malls look 100% occupied, even though there may be some temporary tenants or a handful of
temporary tenants in the mall. So it does not include that number. So with that said, I think the demand is reasonably
better this year than last year, and the rents – I can't – I don't talk specifically about particular tenants, but I think Toys,
Rick, are doing more deals this year than last year.
<A - Richard Sokolov>: Substantially more.
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. So – but we don't talk specific rents – what
tenants, but they did have – I assume they had a successful Christmas last year, otherwise they wouldn't commit to
more this year.
<A - Richard Sokolov>: And the only other thing I would add is that of the temporary tenants that Toys opened with
us last year, we were able to convert a significant number of them into long-term permanent deals. This gives them an
opportunity to see how a given property is going to react to their offering, and if it is encouraging, they are prepared to
commit long-term, and we're anticipating to have a number of those convert this year, as well.
<Q - Christine McElroy>: Okay. And then Ross has a question or two as well.
<Q - Ross Nussbaum>: Yeah. Hi, guys. Rinascente, are you looking to monetize that investment any time soon?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I don't comment on stuff like that. I try not to.
I'm not perfect in that area. But the – actually, it's not – it's really Gallerie Commerciali, GCI, as we call it. So I really

have no comment on that, I'm sorry to say.
<Q - Ross Nussbaum>: Not a problem. The other question I have is, can you break out the same-store NOI growth on
the malls versus the Premium Outlets to get a sense of were those numbers consistent, or was one number driving it?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: The answer is, given the fact that they're both material
contributors, they both contributed significantly to our growth. And I will just say this, that based upon what I have
seen, the mall comp NOI growth is still industry-leading, if that helps you in any way. But we don't break those out, as
you know.
<Q - Ross Nussbaum>: I would assume it's fair to say that the Outlets are perhaps leading the industry-leading mall
number?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: That's correct.
<Q - Ross Nussbaum>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley of Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Bilerman>: Yes. Michael Bilerman here with Quentin. David, just in terms of the dividend, I think you
said that this would be at least to start off, and it sounds like maybe some of the gain offset by some of the charges
pushing the taxable for this year. How are you thinking about the dividend heading into 2011, as to where you would
want to set it? And is it going to be a few quarters for an increase, or you would think about it relative to when you
provide the '11 guidance in January to what level the Board is comfortable moving that 3.20 to?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, let me just say this, you may not have caught this
in my last remarks. We expect – obviously it's subject to the Board discussion, but I think it's safe for you to assume
that we're going to be paying out $0.80 per quarter next year, and there is a possibility – obviously we're going to have
to pay out – or we want to pay out 100% of our taxable income. As we look at '11, even though we haven't finalized our
budget process for '11, and there's a lot of things that go in and out in taxable income, there's, obviously government
has some involvement in that, for instance extending bonus depreciation. There are certain states that have an input on
that. But I would say that we expect to pay out at least $3.20, and to the extent that our taxable income is higher, then
we would pay out more, and that would be determined in the fourth quarter of next year.
<Q - Michael Bilerman>: That's helpful. And then in terms of the stats, in your supplemental you broke out Prime – it
was on Page 24 – in terms of the occupancy and the sales per foot, but you still kept in the Premium Outlets in with the
malls. I'm just curious why you did that.
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Just because it was – we wanted to make – scrub all
the numbers, make sure it's all – we wanted to give the market a sense of what the Prime portfolio was by itself. And
then next quarter we intend to meld those into our numbers, but we felt since it was just a month old, there hasn't been a
lot of data out there. We wanted to give the market a chance to see the portfolio, but it will be melded in next quarter.
<Q - Michael Bilerman>: Rather than meld it out and split all?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well we understand your opinion on that, and I have
an opinion on certain things as well, and we'll continue to have – we continue to welcome those opinions.
<Q - Michael Bilerman>: Thank you.

<Q - David Harris>: Yeah. Hi. I have a question on credit quality, tenant credit quality. Many of us saw Gymboree
taken out by private equity interests just recently, and obviously we've seen the JCPenney move. Tell me, is there
anything in your leases that sort of protects your position from deterioration in credit? Many of these private equity
deals will seem to involve additional debt on the balance sheet. So you've got a less credit-worthy tenant theoretically
than you had before.
<A - Richard Sokolov>: Hi, Dave. It's Rick. In certain of our leases, we do have those constraints, and we have
requirements for annual certifications and minimum net worth requirements. In the large public companies, typically
that would not be present. What we are focused on going forward, and what they're going to focus on going forward is
the ability to convince us that they're going to be able to pay their rent as it comes due, and I would tell you that we –
give you an example, Golden Gate acquired Express. That was acquired all cash, now went public. The fact that
something goes private is not synonymous with a significant lease-up adding of debt, and a decrease of the results in
EBITDA. We monitor that literally on a bi-weekly basis for all of our tenants, and if we see a tenant that is going the
wrong way, we will reach out to them and tell them we're not going to be able to do more business with you until you
get that more in line.
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. I'll just say this, David. That the – I still call
them LBOs, but the model has changed somewhat with respect to leveraged buyouts, and first of all, there's been
enough historical bad deals done where leverage was pushed too high, and I assume that a number of the sponsors
understand that.
Second, and it gets back to Rick's point with Express and others, the model today, frankly, is to grow the business, and
what we're seeing is when there are companies taken private, the growth plans in a lot of cases actually accelerate as
opposed to decelerate, so we don't expect much of a change from Gymboree. They had a pretty good growth trajectory.
We expect that to continue if not increase, so the model's a little bit different, and we can only hope that some of the
past mistakes have been thoroughly reviewed about too much leverage, but let's face it, it is a reasonable concern for us
to be focused on.
<A - Richard Sokolov>: I would just say, generally, the credit profile of our tenants has frankly never been better in
terms of their free cash flow and their multiples of EBITDA to debt. So in that regard as a macro consideration, things
are more favorable today by a significant margin than they've been in the past.
<Q - David Harris>: Okay. David, I've got a question for you on the global. I mean, obviously this is an environment
where there's a great deal of volatility in FX, and particularly the expectation that the dollar may be a weak counter
against a number of leading currencies. Has that influenced your thinking about where you want to take the company as
a global entity over the next, over recent times?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I guess – it's – if you had a – in a sense, if you
had a really negative view on the dollar, and we felt like we could put our capital to work outside of the U.S. and add
value to that real estate, then we would be somewhat motivated to do that. But it's very tough to have kind of a
permanent view on the dollar and where it's going. Obviously the last couple of months are wonderful indications of
that, where we thought we were going to have parity – not we, but the world thought we were going to have parity with
the euro, and now we're headed back in the other direction. So it certainly must factor in.
Now the fact of the matter is we could still, aside from a number of emerging markets, you could still hedge a pretty
good chunk of your investment, if you wanted to. But if you did have the view that the dollar was going to be in a
permanent decline, then as a steward of capital, it would make potentially more sense to have assets outside of the U.S.
than it does – more assets outside of the U.S. than we currently have. But at the end of the day, we've got to make real
estate decisions. We're real estate people, and we've got to believe that whatever we buy, we're buying at the right
value, where we can add value to it. Steve, I don't know if you want to add anything to it.
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: Well I think David's right, and I would just say one thing, David, that one of the things that
we do is, because we finance our existing JVs in the local currencies, we do have a bit of a natural hedge anyway, in
that we're collecting rent, as an example, in Italy in euros, but the entity is also financed primarily with

euro-denominated debt.
<Q - David Harris>: Yeah. If we just set aside then the currency issue for the moment, David, as you look at the world
as sort of a range of opportunities, do you still see the U.S. as offering you predominantly the most attractive area to
allocate your capital?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, David, I would say that the activity in the U.S. in
our sector has considerably slowed. But that doesn't mean that there aren't going to be opportunities. Sometimes they
arise when you don't expect them, and sometimes you have to be patient. But -- and that's been our mantra for quite
some time. Look – if you look at the history of our company, we've been -- the consistent history of it is we've been
criticized every step of the way, but the good news is I think we've made a lot of right decisions.
So when we bought CPI, nobody was expecting malls to really trade and everybody thought we overpaid. But
obviously the history is that we did a hell of a deal. When we got into the outlet sector after a few years of experience
understanding the business, in 2000 we built a couple, we bought it in '04, we've grown that business, we brought it out
of the dark ages into respectability, both in terms of the returns it could generate, but also in terms of what retailers
thought about it, and we've brought more retailers into the marketplace.
So my view of it is you've just got to be ready. You don't necessarily know when it might happen. We don't do deals
just to do deals. Occasionally our discipline has not been perfect, so we've – every once in a while we've done that, but
we've done it on a basis that obviously financially we could handle that.
And so I'm not – even though there's nothing imminent in the U.S., I'm certainly not thinking that that won't have
opportunities for us, but I also think internationally and in Asia – it gets lost in the sauce here, because of the size. But
as I said in my opening remarks, we're going to have 11 centers in Asia – this is the portfolio, so our share in Japan is
40%, in Korea it's 50, and so on. But that's going to generate over $220 million of NOI next year, with other growth
prospects. In fact tonight in New York I have dinner with our Japanese partner. There's other areas in Asia that we're
going to examine, so we've got lots of ways to grow the company. I'm not discouraged in the U.S. at this moment, but it
is – it's not like it was a year ago. Good news is we made a deal in '09 when others didn't, and we've also made the right
decisions. Like in 2004, we didn't buy Rouse, where others did. So I'm cool about everything.
<Q - David Harris>: Okay. Stay cool. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Paul.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: So if I look at your lease metrics, you've done 9 million, 10 million square feet of deals this year
at $41 a foot, and the lease expiration has been around $40. Could you help me kind of connect the dots between that
and next year or the year after you've got about 18 million of square feet expiring at between $33 and $34. I mean, how
much of that is just not really comparable? Or I mean, would we expect to see, I think in terms of lease spreads, lease
opening rates to go down significantly based on what you've done so far, or are your spreads going to widen out
significantly?
<A - Richard Sokolov>: Paul, it's Rick. First of all, when you're dealing with our numbers, when you say 8 million or
9 million, that's a whole lot of activity that is going to transcend any specific, for the most part, qualitative skewing in
the mall business. What we are seeing is increasing activity from our tenants. As the sales have gone up, our occupancy
costs have come in, and we're hopeful that we're going to be able to improve upon our spreads next year over this year.

That's the anticipation. We've been able to hold our numbers, and one of the things that has obviously helped, we're in a
benign bankruptcy market. And so as we are getting more demand, we have less spaces that are going out where we
have to replace it when we weren't anticipating it. So all those factors will hopefully give us a little better pricing
power.
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: Paul, this is Steve. I'd just add two things. We talked about it a little bit on the last call, but in
2010, we did lose higher-rent paying tenants like the jewelry stores. And so the dollar of the square footage that was the
denominator in the equation, it's certainly higher than what you see in the lease expiration schedule going forward. So
absent that, in 2010 we've had much fewer square footage lost, certainly than the last couple of quarters. I'd expect our
closures to be closer to our lease expirations. I think that's one. And so that does suggest that you could see an increase
in spreads next year.
Another indicator that I would offer you that I think supports that, is our calculation is an apple and an orange. We add
up all the new leases that we do, and we compare it to all the leases that close, but they're not necessarily the same
leases. But we do track internally a same-space leasing spread, and that number on a rolling 12-month basis is about
$2.30, so it's a fair bit higher than what you'd see in the publicly reported spread. And I think that goes to Rick's point
in just seeing an improved quality of the deal, and I think again as we go into 2011, knock on wood, I would think
you'd start to see some acceleration in our spreads.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: Is that $2.30 same-space number, does the pattern of it over time look similar to the number you
report here? The apples and oranges number? I mean was it in the order of kind of 8 or $10 a couple years ago?
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: It was higher a couple years ago for sure.
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I would say it matched the openings and closings until,
obviously that number is depressed from where we reported in '08, '07 and '06, given the economic conditions that
exist, and I would underline Steve's point in that what drove our closings was unanticipated, the jewelry stores and
whatnot. But if we get back to kind of the natural expirations, then our spreads ought to migrate towards where they
had been historically.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: Okay. And then on the occupancy side, now that you include Chelsea in there I have a little bit
harder time figuring out where you are in terms of occupancy versus your – how far in the malls do you think you are
off your 2007 or so peak, and do you think you can – what's the timing for you, do you think for you to get back to that
type of level?
<A - Richard Sokolov>: We're I think that – this is Rick. I think we're going to continue to make progress towards
getting back towards that peak. We have our 80 bps spread that we had through 9/30. We should hopefully hold that
through the remainder of the year, and we're anticipating continued progress on top of that going into '11. And so we
should be creeping up on that 2007 occupancy, assuming that we don't have unanticipated bankruptcies and other
things going out that we don't see today.
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: Paul, just to fill in the dots or the blanks, if you will. We're between 100 and 150 basis points
below peak occupancy in the mall business.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: Okay. Thanks. And then just last question on the outlet side. Obviously there have been people
who have been talking about new projects as well. Have you done any analysis, I mean how far – how much
opportunity do you think there is for new outlet centers in the U.S.?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, look, I don't have a specific number that I can
tell you. There's a lot being talked about, and we know what we want to build, which is the Premium Outlets. So we
think there's some of those to be built, but I can't give you a specific number, Paul.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: Okay. All right. Thanks.
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Jonathan Habermann>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: Hey.
<Q - Jonathan Habermann>: Rick, you mentioned occupancy cost has trended down a little bit as the sales have
come back, and clearly bad debt's trending in a much better direction. I guess two questions. One, how widespread is
the sales increase I guess if you strip out Apple and other stores, how widespread is it? And even looking I guess class
A malls versus class B. And number two, as you think about leasing, just following on Paul's question, what is your
target for occupancy costs I guess as you look out to 2011?
<A - Richard Sokolov>: Well let me do the first. In the mall business, it is pretty broad across project types and across
the various categories. Obviously in Juniors, some are going to be doing better than others, because that's a highly
quarter to quarter and fashion-driven business. But we've seen very good stability across those. In terms of our
occupancy costs, I think we've always said that we'd like to be in the 13 to 14% range in the mall business, and the
outlets have been operating less than that. And so long as we can stay in that range, we've seen historically that our
retailers can make very good profits, and we can make an acceptable return on our assets, and that's pretty much where
we are trying to drive the business.
<Q - Jonathan Habermann>: Okay. And maybe for David, I guess even with the dividend increase, you guys are still
going to have a fair amount of free cash flow per year. You've got 1 billion of cash, the line is free and clear. Would
you anticipate – are you looking to build cash on the balance sheet, or do you think you'd look to pay down debt?
Because it looks like you're going to have 500 to 600 million of free cash flow even after the dividend as well as the
investments in redevelopment.
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, look, we'll continue to de-lever. It's a nice spot
to be in and – but, absent specific investment opportunities, we'll continue to de-lever, which will obviously add to our
growth rate and hopefully our multiple, even though it's not clear that that's the case right this particular point.
Let me go back to Rick's earlier point. The thing that excites me is, yes, I love tenant sales growth, but I get more
excited about our own revenue growth. And there's a lot to the mall and to the outlet center that – now I understand the
correlation between the tenant sales and potentially what our revenue is, but the fact of the matter is what's most
important to me is our revenue growth. And, because part of our job is to merchandize the center, where if our retailers
aren't producing the revenues that are commensurate with that center, we ought to replace them. And that doesn't get
picked up in the comp sales numbers. So that's our – I don't want anybody mistaken about our focus is to increase our
revenues, which obviously given the high operating margins we have in our business, that tends to drop
disproportionately to the bottom line. That's our focus.
<Q - Jonathan Habermann>: Great. And lastly, any quick comments on Florida, how trends are there?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Better.
<Q - Jonathan Habermann>: Better than the average or?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Better than the average.
<A - Richard Sokolov>: Particularly in the tourist-driven properties. There have been a substantial increase in tourists
coming in from South America and Europe for that matter, and that's a significant number of properties we have in the
state, and they are outperforming.
<Q - Jonathan Habermann>: Great. Thank you.
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Craig Schmidt>: Well, thank you. The 21 Prime properties that are currently doing I guess $406 a foot and
$24.52 in average rent. Is there any reason why those metrics, after they've been managed through the Chelsea team,
they can't reach Chelsea's level, or is there some geography or something, constraint that they may not allow them to
reach that total level?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we expect to enhance the properties, Craig, like
we would hope in anything that we've done. And Prime has done a good job over the years, but we would hopefully
build upon that, and continue to increase the productivity and the cash flow from those centers.
<Q - Craig Schmidt>: Okay. And then in terms of Orlando, you already have about 550 square feet of outlet space,
and you're adding almost another 1 million. Is there anything you need to do to adapt that space, or given Rick's
comments about the strong tourist markets, that may not be necessary?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well Orlando is an interesting market, because it's
really so many different markets by themselves. They operate kind of independently, because the tourism is such that
they're different markets. So the answer is not really, I mean they all serve their current market well. And the good
news is that Orlando market is unique in terms of driving visitor traffic. There's nothing in the horizon that would
suggest that they can't continue to drive the 40-plus million visitors a year. And we're the beneficiary, as long as we
continue to maintain high quality properties catering to those individual submarkets, appealing to the tourists that go to
each individual tourist destination.
<A - Richard Sokolov>: To David's point, that they're separate markets, a substantial number of tenants are operating
in both properties, because there are a lot of people that are going to Universal and staying on International Drive that
are not going down to Disney and staying on the Disney compound. And that's – so they are two distinct properties and
two distinct markets.
<Q - Craig Schmidt>: Okay. Great. And then finally I noticed there's been a sales square foot improvement in The
Mills as well as an occupancy pick-up. Are you introducing more outlet concepts in that, or is that just standard
business as usual, and it's...?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's really – we are introducing more outlet tenants, and
additionally some that we're changing kind of what that center is going to be. For instance, in Gurnee we're actually
expecting to modify a big chunk of that center to be full price, but the rest is a lot of just bringing in the better
merchants, a number of which are brand name outlet operators.
Plus – Rick can – I don't want him to bore you with the details – because he's got the list, he's dying to read it, but we
won't let him, okay – is that we're adding – we're doing a good job of re-tenanting the boxes that we lost with the Steve
& Barry's, Linens 'n Things, Circuit Cities, et cetera. We've got a couple of Bloomingdale outlets that we've brought in
to the centers. So just better leasing management and taking advantage of a better economic scenario. And Rick is
available later to read you all of what he's done recently.
<Q - Craig Schmidt>: I'll call Rick later. Thanks a lot.
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks.

<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Alex.
<Q - Alexander Goldfarb>: Just quickly on the capital side, and this is probably more for your JV properties. Just
given where the portfolio lenders are, and it seems like they're a little behind, maybe they've caught up. But it seems
like they're behind in allocating for the year. Has any of that caused you guys or your JV partners to reconsider
refinancing plans? Or is it more that the thought of refinancing a property is a much bigger decision than just simply
where you can get a rate and a size of a loan on a project?
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: Alex, it's Steve. I think it's the latter. A refinancing decision is above and beyond just what
your capital spend is. But having said that, it's a high-class problem to have, because we do have many properties – JV
properties, where we've got substantial capital to spend. Rick whispered to me that we're in the midst of doing a
renovation of Fashion Valley, where we just refinanced. We have some other properties that are in that list of 16 assets
that David mentioned that could potentially be transformational, and a couple of them that I can think off right
off-hand, at very low leverage. So the opportunity to roll the source of capital for that transformation into a single
financing is certainly there. So we'll look at it on a case-by-case basis.
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. And look, if a mortgage is not subject to a
pre-payment penalty or yield maintenance penalty, we're actively talking to our partner about refinancing it. So
traditional secured debt usually has something along those lines. So – but, we don't have a lot of floating rate debt on
our JV at all, period. But to the extent that it's not locked out or the yield maintenance is de minimis or there is none,
then we're talking to the partner about refinancing, which is exactly what happened in Fashion Valley.
Fashion Valley is a great scenario, historically I think about kind of what happened, I think we had, I can't remember
all the details other than it came due in '08, we had – both of us had to put capital in to pay off the mortgage, which I
believe was a couple hundred million bucks. Then we got a $50 million loan, then we got – that 50 went to 100, and
then that 100 went to 200. And now the 200 went to 475, all in the span of 18 months. So that's a pretty good
recollection actually. So, that's kind of what happened. We actually had to put in equity, and thankfully our partner and
us had the equity to do it. But we had to un-encumber that asset for a while at the end of '08.
<Q - Alexander Goldfarb>: Okay. And then moving to the Prime, now that the books have been closed, can you give
us split of – originally I think on the cash yields you were talking about an 8%, but what do you think the GAAP yield
will be?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, no, but we'll do better.
<Q - Alexander Goldfarb>: Okay. And then just finally, wrapping up on Prime. There was the item in your press
release about the consent agreement. Is this just something that's just an ordinary document processing thing, or is this
anything that could linger for a while?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We don't believe so. In other words, we do think it's
ordinary course.
<Q - Alexander Goldfarb>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

<A - Stephen Sterrett>: Well, Michael, we actually don't have a lot of opportunity to un-encumber assets in 2011.
But, as David has already mentioned, we're looking at the balance sheet every day, we're certainly working it, absent of
transaction opportunities, we will de-lever – yet it was interesting you said not a lot to do, but we've still got $1 billion
plus of mortgages to redo in 2011. There's sliver interest of bonds, I think there's $400 million left in '11 that wasn't
tendered. You could certainly see us pay that down. But we'll just pay attention to where the market is.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of the ISI Group.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Hi, I have two questions. First, Rick, can you just talk about what percentage of leasing you might
have already done for 2011 at this point in the year, and compare it to say a year ago, and how much leasing you had
done in 2010?
<A - Richard Sokolov>: Yeah. We're through probably about 39%, 38%, 39% of our '11s, and that's pretty much
where we were this time last year.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. So even though you're feeling better about the world, I guess I'm trying to figure out if
maybe that 39% got committed to at lower rates, now the world's better...
<A - Richard Sokolov>: Well one of the things that we're doing is, and we said this last year, we're not in as much of a
hurry, because the world is getting better, and '11, renewals in '11, some renewals are literally still 13 months out. So
there's certainly no hurry to have to address those renewals that are in the fourth quarter where we think we're going to
be in much better shape. We could – look, we can control that by deciding how we price our space. And so we're going
to be very deliberate in how we price our space, and that's going to impact the pace of our renewals.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. And then I was wondering if you could maybe just spend a little bit of time talking about
Prime, and as you kind of look at that portfolio today, and maybe harken back to when you bought Chelsea. I didn't see
an occupancy cost, David, disclosed for that portfolio. But just what sort of upsides do you see? I mean obviously that
portfolio is not as productive as the Chelsea assets. But as you kind of look here today, you've owned it for a month,
what kind of opportunities do you see embedded in that portfolio?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well let's just say there's no way to replicate what we
got out of the Chelsea portfolio, so other than a few individual centers here or there, that's the highest portfolio out
there. So, look, I think, Steve, it's relatively straightforward stuff. It's better marketing, and it is better leasing through
better merchandise management, and when you do the two together, they kind of fuel off each other, and you get the
desired impact that you're looking to.
And there's also going to be the ability to re-claim, re-demolish certain space that we think we can make more
productive – little developments. We had our Board at Queenstown last week, as an example, and there's a little corner
of the centers. Good center, good leasing, but there's a corner that's effectively not part of the nice atmosphere that was
created there.
So trying to figure out how to anchor that and re-tenant it and make it part of the center is going to be the kind of things
that we do. And we've already identified a number of the better merchants that we think we'll be able to add to the
portfolio. There's less and less of opportunities to better merchandize the centers.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Well, David, if you don't want to disclose the occupancy costs, can you just tell us if it's above or
below where the Chelsea portfolio or the Premium Outlet portfolio is?

square feet, then we ad the outlets to it, so it's 80 million. We had like 40 Apple stores. So I don't have it off the top of
my head, but it would be de minimis in terms of the growth. I mean obviously we're – we think they're a great retailer

just not there for us.

Your next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance of Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Thank you. You have a small stake in Value Retail in Europe. What's your appetite for doing
more on the outlet side on the European continent?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, look, I would say that – put value retail aside, I
would say that we have obviously a nice U.S. outlet business. We have a nice Asian outlet business, and strategically,
given there's a commonality of the product and the retailers, it would be nice to have a European presence in that
business. But I won't talk specifically about Value Retail or anybody else, but it would make strategic sense for us to be
represented in Europe with good quality outlet centers.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: And what's the best way to approach that? Is it via development primarily? Or do you think
that there are interesting acquisition targets over time?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well I'd say both are tough, frankly, Cedrik.
Development is clearly the hardest to do, but we have looked at certain things in the past. And I would say on the
acquisition side, there could be opportunities for us down the road. So I would lean more toward acquisitions than
ground-up development, just because of the length required to develop there and all of the uncertainties and all the
stops and starts. But we look at both, we look at both.

Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies & Co. Please go ahead.
<Q - Omotayo Okusanya>: Oh, yes. Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been answered, but just a few quick
follow-up points. Could you tell us what occupancy costs actually were at the end of third quarter?
<A - Richard Sokolov>: Yes. For the end of the third quarter for combining malls and outlets, it was 12.1%.
<Q - Omotayo Okusanya>: 12.1%, that's helpful. And then the reversal of the provisioning during the quarter, could
you talk a little bit about the reasoning behind that and what we can expect in regards to credit provisioning on a
going-forward basis?
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: Yes. What happened in the third quarter, quite frankly, is we just collected some receivables
that we had fully reserved for. And when you collect something in cash and there's no longer anything to offset it with
on the balance sheet, it has to flow through income. Historically, Tayo, our bad debt expense runs about 50 basis
points, 0.5% of revenue. I would tell you, it looks like 2010 is a year where we're going to end up with literally close to
zero bad debt expense. But if you're looking on a go-forward basis, I think it'd be difficult to replicate that experience in
2011. So I'd expect to see some return to a more normal level of bad debt.
<Q - Omotayo Okusanya>: Great. That's help. And then last question, as we start to head into the holiday season, just
could you give us a general sense of what you're hearing from your tenants about what sales look like or what their
expectations are going to be?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Look, I will tell you that the good news is Christmas
holiday season is no longer make or break for our retailers the way it's been – 20 years ago, that's all you heard about
was they had to have a good Christmas season to survive. Our retailers are much better operators, so it's not make or
break the holiday season any longer.

I can tell you that generally the holiday season never meets expectations, too. I think one out of the last 10 years it's met
expectations. So much has to do with the mood and psyche of the consumer, and there's obviously a lot out there to
sway it one way or another. I'll leave my political views to the side for the time being. So the long-winded answer is,
my own personal view is it won't meet expectations, but it's just because I'm betting on history that it never seems to.
And when I say expectations, probably more of what the media or NRF or some of these other people put out. But I
don't get overly excited one way or another what it meets or beats or doesn't, just because I think from a retailer's point
of view, they've learned how to manage it appropriately. They do seem poised to have a better season, because
inventories have been built up.
That's good and bad, right? That's good in the sense that if there is demand, they can drive sales. On the other hand, it is
looking like the season could be a touch more promotional than it has been in the past. But again, I don't get caught up
in the – it's almost like the politics, who's going to win, and who's not going to win. Lots of pundits out there. The good
news is from our retailers, they seem to be able to manage it either way.
<Q - Omotayo Okusanya>: Okay. Very helpful, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ben Yang of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. David, you mentioned the occupancy cost is currently lower for
Prime versus your other outlets. I'm curious if you have the same occupancy cost target for both outlet portfolios when
you sign new leases. And if you don't, I'm wondering if there's any reason why you can't get to that same level for
Prime?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, look, I think we have enough experience that we
know what market rents ought to be. And given that, we feel good that there's growth in the Prime portfolio, not only
because of where rents are versus where market rents are, but also because we're going to make the centers better. And
by making them better, retailers are going to want to be there, and that's – Ben, that's essentially – I wish it were more
complicated than that, but that's basically what our guys are charged to do.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: I mean, but will there come a day when you can maybe narrow that occupancy cost gap, or do
maybe less productive outlet centers just naturally get a lower occupancy cost?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, there's certainly part of that. There's no question
there's part of that. I mean, typically what we've had in the outlet business is even though rents have increased, sales
have increased even at a higher rate. So the occupancy cost still can't catch up to the number that makes sense. But
clearly there are going to be centers that have lower productivity. You're not going to be able to charge the kind of rent
that you could at higher productivity. So there's certainly part of that element with Prime, and even existing outlets that
we have today. And that's the same thing for malls as well.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay. That's helpful. And just final question, did you guys revise your same-store NOI
guidance for the year? Because I think it currently stands at about 1 to 1.5%. Seems like. . .
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think – I'm looking at '11, so the answer is no. But I
think we'll do better, okay.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Richard Moore>: Hello, guys. Good afternoon.
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: How are you, Rich?
<Q - Richard Moore>: Good. Thank you. On percentage rents, we're looking at percentage rents as a percentage of
sales, and those seem to go higher. Is that the inclusion of Prime do you think? Or is there something else going on
there?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It has nothing to do with Prime at all really. We only
had Prime in for a month. It's really just better sales across the portfolio, obviously both in the mall and in the outlet
side.
<Q - Richard Moore>: Okay. So you think that could continue? You think that's sort of trending higher? Is that what it
sounds like?
<A - Richard Sokolov>: Yeah.
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, it's clearly – I mean it's clearly trending higher,
as you can see by our sales growth for our retailers, that's for sure.
<Q - Richard Moore>: Okay. But a percent...
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: But it is a – it is a variable number, and it's – once the
retailer's in there, it's out of our control. It's really how they produce. But it ought to – assuming it continues on that
path, it ought to be certainly higher than last year.
<Q - Richard Moore>: Okay, good. Thank you, David. And then in the other income line, Steve, in the joint venture
portfolio, that seemed to jump unusually. What was in there again?
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: It's two things that are primarily driving it, Rich. Number one is a property that we're a 25%
owner of had a large out-lot peripheral transaction that was about a $20 million gain. Our share of that was about $6
million. So even though you're seeing a large impact in the JV footnote, actually our share of it isn't that significant.
The other one is just – and you see this in the consolidated financials as well, we had a higher level of lease termination
activity. I think it was up about $10 million in the JVs, and I think our share of that was about 3 million. So that's the
majority of the increase, the rest of it's just normal growth in business that we're seeing across some of the line items
that flow through there.
<Q - Richard Moore>: Okay, very good. Thank you, guys.
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure.

You have a follow-up from the line of Quentin Velleley of Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Good afternoon. Just in terms of the 16 transformational redevelopment projects you were
speaking about earlier on, I think you mentioned that a few of those projects would be complete redevelopments of the
assets. So I'm just curious which assets they were? And whether or not we should be thinking about that as defensive
CapEx as well as expansion CapEx?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we have two malls that are, basically have been
de-malled and produce no income today, and in fact, they have a slight negative. So those certainly would be in that

category. And – but I don't think, given the opportunity ahead of us and given the lack of new space out there, I would
say to you that not any of this is really defensive, it's really because there's an opportunity in there and demand has
somewhat increased. When I think of defensive, it's – the way you'd describe it is maybe in connection with something
else happening in the marketplace. These are just there to be done to improve upon.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Okay. And so of the 1.5 bill, it's a very small proportion?

You have a follow-up from Dan (sic) [Dave] Harris of Gleacher & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Harris>: Hello. Well thanks for a second bite of the cherry, even if they changed my first name. Hey, I
don't know if I dare ask this question, but General Growth comes out of bankruptcy shortly and has got some powerful
backers and a rebuilt balance sheet. Have you been briefing the troops for a tougher battle ahead?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I let our performance speak for itself. So the fact of the
matter is, David, we have prospered whether General Growth was growing, in bankruptcy, or emerging from
bankruptcy. The bottom line is we've been able to grow our business and do well regardless of what they or anyone else
has done.
And I look back and say, it's very interesting to me, and I know a lot of people aren't earnings-focused. But we're going
to be one of the few – let's just take First Call as a barometer. Based on '11, we actually have the potential if you use
First Call as a barometer, to actually have the best earnings per share that we've had. So yeah we did some dilutive
deals, we sold common stock, I'm not thrilled about the price that we did. But we felt like in the scheme of things, we
had to do it. We're actually – our growth is such that we're going to, if you believe First Call, and obviously we're going
to come out with our guidance, but I wouldn't be talking like this if I didn't think that that was a possibility – we're
going to actually outgrow our dilution, and hopefully next year do better than what we've ever done, which was in '08,
correct? Our FFO – record FFO per share. So, our record FFO per share I think was $6.42.
You can see that our dividend trajectory is back to where it was. You compare all of the other REITs out there, and in
particular all the other retail REITs, they're 30%, 40% of their FFO per share, and 30% and 40% of their dividend per
share, and in some cases, even a lot worse than that. So as an example – well, I won't say it, because I mean it's really –
but so the fact of the matter is our troops know what we want them to do regardless of what happens with General
Growth or not. So I think I answered it, your question.
<Q - David Harris>: Yeah. Let's tackle it in a slightly different way. I mean – the last couple of – setting aside the
public companies, and obviously we've had a fairly good handle on that. Do you have a sense, David, that you've
picked up...
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We have an interesting chart we'd be happy to share
with you.
<Q - David Harris>: Okay. Well, at NAREIT, maybe. No, but let me ask my question, and maybe you can show me
the visuals in a couple of weeks. It's do you have a sense over the last couple of years, the stronger companies, and we'd
obviously include most of the public companies within that group, have picked up substantial market share from some
of the other players in your marketplace?
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, certainly, and certainly at a property level there's
some of that. But more importantly, it's really at a company level that you can see that differentiation easiest. So...

You have a follow-up from Steve Sakwa of ISI Group.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Hi. Yeah. I just wanted to make sure, Steve, when you're providing that same-store NOI increase
in the 8-K, that does include the benefit of lease termination income?
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: It does not include the benefit of lease termination income. We separate lease termination
income out.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. So I guess really then the figure for the nine months though does include the benefit of
basically the reversal of the bad debt this year, but not the increase in lease termination?
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: That's correct. Bad debt is a component of same-store NOI.
<A - David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, we – in our earlier comments we've mentioned
how much that was, the 3.6.
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: Right, for the quarter, bad debt's added about 60 basis points. So it'd have been 3% if bad
debts would have been the same as last year.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: And, Steve, do you know what it was for the year, the nine-month number?
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: The bad debt is 80 basis points, I believe.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
