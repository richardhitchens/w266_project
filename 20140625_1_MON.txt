This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on
assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a
material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may
cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.
So this morning, we've built our update around the opportunity we see for Monsanto's long-term growth, including
some key announcements around our growth targets, our strategy, and the next important step in our capital structure.
While we'll focus on our longer term growth horizon, let me anchor the conversation with a couple of key results on
slides 4 and 5.
Ongoing earnings for the quarter were $1.62 per share, and with those Q3 results in hand, we have the clarity on the
remainder of the year, and we've raised our outlook to the upper end of our original guidance range for ongoing EPS
and free cash flow, affirming our full-year growth this year.
With this quarter, we continue to see our Seeds and Genomics segment as the largest contributor to that full-year
growth, and we continue to make incremental progress on our overall GP contribution, margin expansion and in our
ongoing EBITDA.
So with that, let me hand it to Hugh to take us through the updates this morning and the next steps in our strategic
outlook.
Hugh Grant
Thank you, Bryan, and good morning to everybody on the line.
While we always take a look forward in Q3, today we take a bolder approach. Most importantly, we're defining our
growth strategy over the next five years and we're beginning to truly use our capital structure more aggressively. In the
last year and a half, we've crossed several key business milestones that give us a new level of clarity and confidence in
how we see our global growth over a multi-year run rate.
We've just completed an update of our strategy. The clear conclusion, we see a unique combination of core growth,
new platforms and the opportunity to better leverage our capital structure. There's a lot of news in our announcement
today. Let me walk you through each element starting on slide six and tie the headlines to my strategic priorities for our
company.
First, we're unlocking the next evolution in our strategy. We're not simply a seed company. Today, we're providing
multiple solutions to farmers by delivering improved yield technology in the seed, in the bank and in the field. That
translates to a compelling vision of how this industry can expand yield and productivity through the convergence of
biology, technology and information.
As farmers become increasingly digitized information and specifically platforms like precision agriculture become the
integrator expanding from our core seed business to create opportunity to optimize yield across the 40-plus key
decisions that farmers make every season. There's no company better positioned to lead this evolution. That's who we
are and just as we led the seed revolution, we're driving the industry to expand the view on how we deliver yield and
productivity to our grower customers.
The second point I'd emphasize is on slide seven. With such a compelling vision, we're willing to back our confidence
in long-term growth with a new target to at least double our ongoing EPS over the next five years. We haven't laid out
multiyear targets for the past several years. Doing so today is evidence of the confidence that we have in our core
business and the transformational potential in our growth platforms. It's also backed by our focus in our farmer
customers and the success that we've had over the past few years as farmers have responded well to our effort to
provide more options and value with better performing products.
We believe we've positioned ourselves to sustain the mid-teens plus EPS growth, that's been our hallmark through a full
decade. The ability to target continued growth at that level of a revenue base in the range of $15 billion speaks to the

depth of the Monsanto portfolio and the magnitude of the opportunity that our strategy unlocks.
The foundation of our confidence is our core business and as we've listed our outlook to the high end of the guidance
range today we see it as an important proof point. Our core business performance is allowing us to deliver our growth
commitments in the toughest Ag environment in the past several years.
Within that, corn certainly has been more challenged by the industry headwinds of declining acres, a tougher
commodity environment and direct currency effects, but it's still a source of expected full-year growth in our portfolio.
With some of the macro shifting soybeans have emerged as a true fiscal year 2014 highlight, delivering record growth
that foreshadows the opportunity ahead in the decade of the soybean.
So, despite a year where commodity price is reset, corn acres declined in the world's biggest regions and global
currencies became a significant headwind, there's no hesitation. We see seeds and traits delivering a majority of the
full-year growth to back our guidance. And that performance is a key proof point of our portfolio balance that turns into
opportunity as we see this core seeds and traits engine delivering more than $4 billion in total GP growth as the largest
driver in our five-year target.
The third key point I'd emphasize is on slide eight, our plan to return an additional $10 billion to our shareowners over
the next two years, which is another important expression of our confidence in Monsanto's long-term growth.
Today, we've announced a major step forward that allows us to use the strength of our cash generation and balance
sheet. We're now targeting a net-debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.5 times by the end of fiscal year 2015. That level
would reflect the seasonality of our business, but importantly it takes our balance sheet from a negative net debt
position to one providing an opportunity to use our capital structure and return significant cash directly to shareowners.
Over the past year and a half, we've been working on this plan, as we've passed several key business milestones and we
move quickly to get to our target level. One of our first capital allocation priorities will be a new two-year $10 billion
share buyback program, with an expected accelerated share repurchase of approximately $6 billion in the near-term.
And that leads to my final point. With everything that we've assembled today, the roadmap for our growth is as clear as
ever. Brett will describe this in detail, but our future growth is enabled by three key elements: we're a global company
that has strong embedded organic growth; we're a company that's building transformational new platforms with
compelling growth prospects; and we're a company that now intends to use our powerful cash generation and capital
structure to compound growth and create value for our owners.
One of the most exciting elements of that is, we are now at pivot point where our new platform starts to deliver real
growth. These are platforms that we expect will form a key part of our earnings profile in the next five-year period.
And this will be one of the focal points of our Summer Field event as we host our VII Whistle Stop Tour this August.
The springboard this year has actually exceeded our initial plans as we have more customers and more acres in all of
our Climate Corporation platform products and services. That in turn provides an early confidence point for the
ramp-up over the next few years for what we see as a transformational platform.
We'll outline our specific expectations for the fiscal year 2015 outlook as we close out this fiscal year. But
fundamentally, we certainly see fiscal year 2015 as the beginning of the next half decade of growth. At no point have
we this much clarity on both the opportunity ahead as well as on the roadmap that gets us there. We're a company that
sees growth five years down the line, and it's compelling. We have the strategy, we have the tools, and we're focused on
delivering.
So with that, let me give the time remaining to Brett to give you the deeper dive into our business platforms.
Brett D. Begemann
Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line.

Our confidence in committing to a long-term growth target is a function of both our core business and the new
platforms that strengthen our growth opportunity. On slide nine, you'll see that confidence has increased as we've
delivered a handful of critical milestones over the past year and a half. Those range from the reinvigoration of our
soybean platform with the launch of Intacta and our agreement with DuPont to the establishment of new growth
platforms in precision Ag and biologicals. Those milestones set the roadmap to our growth on slide 10.
We believe we've derisked some of the biggest factors, crystallizing our line of sight on what drives our opportunity.
That obviously has its start in fiscal year 2014. It is clear that what we needed to demonstrate this year was that our
seeds and traits business is returning as the biggest driver of our growth, and that's on track.
As we walk through the elements, let's start with corn. Despite continued softening across the macro environment, we
expect corn to be a source of full-year growth and part of the seeds and traits rebound. That's highlighted by the most
strategically important drivers. We're seeing good price/mix lift, driven by our portfolio upgrades in all regions, and
we've seen the COGS improvement we anticipated, highlighted by the U.S. That's even more meaningful in a tougher
macro environment.
For perspective, this year corn acres have come down in the Americas by about 5%, and currency reflects an
incremental headwind to our business of roughly another 3%. Those factors have tempered some of the upside growth
this year along with continued volatility in the Ukraine and some incremental effects in Latin America. There was
widespread rain and flooding in Argentina that has significantly reduced our production yields, resulting in much
higher costs in the current sales season.
Likewise, in Brazil, our largest competitor has acknowledged it had some challenges with insect resistance to its key
traits, making some late pricing adjustments across the current market. Those are all realities of the current macro
conditions. We work through variations every year. We've made our adjustments, and we feel good that our global corn
portfolio allows us to continue to grow, even in a year like this.
Our portfolio clearly positions us well for some of this macro shifting, and you see some of the corresponding positives
in soybeans, where we're on track for record growth this year. That includes both the pure pickup in the core business
as planted acres favor soybeans, as well as the compounded benefit from drivers that we expect to elevate the earnings
power of this platform over the next few years, notably Intacta in Latin America and the overall Roundup Ready 2
Yield platform in the U.S. The rest of the portfolio is effectively where we expected and complementing the bigger
corn and soy engines.
In cotton, there has been a little pickup in U.S. acres that offset a bit of the declining acres in Australia. And in
vegetables, we're now tracking with the turnaround in revenue and gross profit contribution we anticipated for the full
year.
Delivering in this tougher environment pressure tests our strategy and validates the value of our portfolio, and that
culminates in how we see our growth setup for the next five years. To be clear, we expect the largest driver of our
overall opportunity through 2019 is growth in the core seeds and traits business. In that time, we expect to deliver more
than $4 billion in new total gross profit growth.
There's no better example of that opportunity and earnings power than the emergence of the soybean platform on slide
11. It's a platform with the fastest expected rate of growth in the next five years. With the progression of Roundup
Ready 2 Yield, Intacta, and Roundup Ready Xtend, for the first time the soybean platform mirrors the multi-stack rapid
upgrade opportunity in our corn business.
The most visible proof point is Intacta on slide 12. Today, we take the early step in what we see as the fastest historical
ramp of any soybean trait. The full supply availability is still coming together, as wet weather has delayed harvest in
Argentina and we work through the qualification process given the end-season drought in Brazil. So while it's early,
we're very comfortable being able to target 10 million to 12 million acres in the upcoming season. That's our biggest
second year step-up in soybeans. It's three to four times the reach of this year's launch and twice the level that we saw
with the ramp-up of Roundup Ready 2 Yield in its second year. That's a clear validation of Intacta's performance and
the opportunity. The majority of next year's expected step-up will be in Brazil, but we'll also begin commercial launch

across Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, passing another key strategic milestone in this 100 million acre opportunity.
That catalytic opportunity in soybeans is backed by the continued growth and expansion we see in our biggest platform,
our global corn business. More than half of our seeds and traits revenues are driven by corn, reflecting the opportunity
across multiple layers and multiple geographies. This is the extension of growth we've proven for the past decade,
including portfolio upgrades, our expanded footprint, and continued trade opportunity, all of which drive our mix and
volume.
The biggest factor in that opportunity is on slide 13, our ability to leverage our industry-leading breeding program to
upgrade our portfolio every year in every key corn growing region. There's real power in this significant, steady engine
across our biggest business.
There's also a multiplier effect on slide 14, as we use that same breeding engine to expand our opportunity as we target
new high-growth markets that drive volume. Today, it's playing out in areas like Eastern Europe, one of our fastest
growing corn regions this year, despite the political unrest in the Ukraine. That's the kind of opportunity that allows us
to be on par this year with our record volume years, even as acres have shrunk in key markets in North and South
America.
That core growth in seeds and traits is complemented by our Ag Productivity segment. Going forward, we continue to
see Ag Productivity as an important strategic support for the seeds and traits growth. And while it's likely there will be
some variability in any year, we see this more in a support role than as a growth driver itself.
My final area of emphasis is on what I think will be one of the most significant incremental drivers, and that's our
Climate Corporation platform on slide 15. This year is a pivot point. We have some important proof points this year
that increase our confidence in the ramp-up to what we see as 1 billion-acre runway and a $20 billion market
opportunity. As farms are increasingly digitized, precision Ag can become an integrating point for information, seed,
equipment and other inputs.
One of the most important areas of progress on slide 16 has been in building out that platform. In the short time, since
our Climate Corporation acquisition, this partner opportunity has been a highlight, beginning with our early
collaboration with WinField. We also have agreements with additional anchor partners, including Agrium's Crop
Production Services, GROWMARK, Wilbur-Ellis, and Helena, as well as our first equipment partner, CNH Industrial.
Including Monsanto, this is a base with more than $60 billion in total annual sales, and just as importantly, these are
partners that touch virtually every corn and soybean acre in the U.S. in some form. That reach can help us take the next
step in building an industry platform that makes precision agriculture a bigger tool for our farmer customers.
The next validation point is the interest in the suite of products in our Climate Corporation platform. The response has
been far stronger than we anticipated. We wanted to see Climate basically get a foothold as a free service to build
exposure and interest, and we believed if we could validate that on 20 million acres, it would be a strong year.
As of the end of May, we had more than 40 million installed acres or total acres for all accounts, and more than 30
million of those acres are active users, using the service in the last 30 days. That means nearly 1 in 5 acres of U.S. corn
and soybeans are enrolled, giving us an account base that represents an important foundation for expansion and active
usage that demonstrates the practical value on the farm.
We also entered the year planning for groundbreakers like experience on premium services like Climate PRO targeting
hundreds of thousands of acres. The response has been equally good in this area and we now anticipate the premium
offerings will be used on more than 1 million acres across the U.S. Corn Belt this year. We know this is just a start, but
these milestones are a springboard that we expect to move us from an investment platform this year to a real earnings
contributor in the next few years on to what we truly believe is a multibillion-dollar long-term opportunity.
Let me bring all these points together. We've passed a number of key milestones in the past 18 months. Those give us
greater clarity on our growth outlook for the next five years. Those drivers come directly from the success we've had
over the past decade, reflecting a strong growing core and new platforms that draw on our powerful technology,
Headstart. And that's both a source of confidence and the point of focus as we target the compelling opportunity in

front of us.
So with that, let me hand it over to Pierre.
Pierre Courduroux
Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. As CFO, my priority is to have a clear view of what drives growth and
how we translate into the financials. So let me give you the highlights from today through a financial lens.
Number one, our growth plan builds on the strong growth we've delivered in our business over the past few years,
continuing that momentum. And with our improved outlook today, we're on track to both deliver our bottom line
guidance and to affirm seeds and traits as the biggest contributor of that full-year growth.
Number two, setting a multi-year target underscores our confidence in our continued opportunity. I take the prudent
approach to our guidance outlook. So, establishing a long-term metric is a reflection of our confidence in our core
business, the compelling strategy, and a clear view on the factors that drive growth.
And number three, having surpassed several key milestones in our business, we are now well-positioned to better
optimize our capital structure. Given the strength of our current balance sheet and our confidence in our growth
prospect, we have decided to take advantage of the favorable debt market. By the end of FY 2015, we intend to target a
net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5.
And one of the ways we'll immediately put that structure to work is through a new $10 billion share buyback
authorization, which includes our intent to use $6 billion in the near-term for an accelerated buyback program.
I'll cover how we'll use our capital structure in more detail, but before I do so, let me anchor on the business
performance in the current fiscal year on slide 17. With the visibility from Q3, we now expect to be at the upper end of
our original ongoing EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges. With one quarter left, we have good clarity in delivering
that updated range, reinforcing our growth even in a challenging macro environment and with roughly $0.15 to $0.20
EPS impact from currency headwinds.
Q3 came in somewhat better than we projected during our Q2 call, with ongoing EPS of $1.62. That relative
performance came across the P&L and includes some timing benefits from the core business, operating expenses and
taxes.
If you look at the quarter on a year-over-year basis, as expected, the most direct factor in the comparison was the
significant tax benefit that increased Q3 in 2013 and did not repeat this year. As we expected, the corn quarterly gross
profit contribution was down versus last year, primarily as a function of the reduced acre base both for the U.S. season
as well as in Latin America, where Safrinha sales also carry into our third quarter.
But overall seeds and traits' GP was up in the quarter, as continued strong contribution in our soybean business largely
offset the timing and acre effects in corn. The year-to-date performance keeps us on track to achieve strong gross profit
growth across seeds and traits for the full-year, marking the biggest overall contributor to our fiscal 2014 outlook.
Through Q3, we've also seen incremental margin improvements in Seeds and Genomics and within the soybean and
corn segments. And that extrapolates to our full-year outlook, where we continue to project margin improvements
across all three areas.
In soybeans, we'll expect another increment of contribution coming from Q4 Intacta sales in Latin America and the
second installment of the DuPont royalty reinforcing our full-year expectation for a margin increase of 6 points to 8
points.
In corn, we've seen very good margin growth in our U.S. business, as we've seen the COGS benefit flow-through
together with the expected gains from our mix uplift. Those benefits have been offset some in Latin America, including
the COGS effect in Argentina and the corn pricing dynamics in Brazil that Brett described.

Page 7 of 18
For the full-year, we expect overall corn margin to still step-up, but with those Latin American effects, it will likely
come in somewhat lower than our original 3-point target.
With our updated guidance, we still project a stronger fourth quarter; but given the timing benefit we see in Q3, we
now expect to deliver a loss rather than breakeven EPS in Q4.
Aside from some of that Q3 effect, we still see the same drivers that reduced the overall year-over-year loss, including
the next increments of soybean growth, and uptick in corn as we anticipate less adjustments in U.S. returns and a more
typical contribution from our vegetable business. And as a result, we expect to see the last incremental contribution that
allows us to get to our full-year ongoing EBITDA target of mid to high-teens growth.
If we move to the longer view, our fiscal year 2014 performance becomes the foundation for how we see our strategy
unfolding over the next five years on slide 18. Working from the fiscal year 2014 base, we are targeting at least
doubling our ongoing EPS by 2019. And I'm comfortable that there are multiple sources backing that target, reflecting
a good line of sights on the core business, on the new platforms, and on the benefit of our capital structure.
And the reality is that all those factors should contribute. Likewise, we build our plan on baseline assumption, so each
factor holds the potential to be a bigger relative contributor depending on the different growth trajectories.
We have also left ourselves room to invest for growth, including CapEx to expand our base business as well as for
M&A. The single biggest contributor is pure gross profit expansion, reflecting the embedded opportunity in the core
business.
Logically, the biggest source of that growth comes from corn and soybean, but it is also complemented by the
expansion of the broader portfolio ranging from crops like vegetables, canola, and cotton to continued technology
development and licensing agreements.
We see this opportunity translating to more than $4 billion in total incremental GP, which would mark our largest
incremental seeds and traits' GP growth in any five-year period in our history. We also anticipate that the precision
agriculture platform will become a meaningful contributor to earnings with this five-year period. The contribution in
the early years is expected to be relatively small, but as that business ramps up we expect an accelerated contribution.
As we look to build these new platforms, we plan to align our investments and support them appropriately – putting
more resources behind these high-growth areas and streamlining or redeploying some operating expenses from lower
growth business areas. The performance and operating expense discipline in our core business allows us to make some
near-term investments in our new platforms to jump start those opportunities.
In FY 2014, we have invested a little more than $200 million of combined operating expense in precision Ag and
biologicals. We are planning to ramp that to an expected level of more than $350 million in FY 2015, as we make
investment in the people and infrastructure that reflects our confidence in the earnings potential of these platforms; that
is a conscious investment. And while we will step-up our spending in FY 2015, I continue to expect to generate overall
leverage from GP to earnings once we passed this initial uptick.
One of the most important elements of our conversation today is our approach to capital allocation on slide 19. Our
decision to return an additional $10 billion to shareowners is a result of careful consideration by our teams and the
board over the last 18 months, as we've achieved several business milestones that provide clarity on our planning and
capital allocation.
We are targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5 times by the end of fiscal year 2015. That's obviously subject to the
seasonality of our business; but fundamentally, we are comfortable with this leverage level, and as part of our ongoing
strategic planning, we will continue to review and recalibrate our capital allocation as appropriate with the goal of
remaining both opportunistic and disciplined.
At the level of 1.5 times debt, we expect to be able to better optimize our cost of capital, while balancing a few key
priorities, on slide 20. Our first priority is to continue to invest in high-growth opportunities that support our strategy
and drive growth. We have the financial flexibility to pursue both organic and external growth, including investments

in our business, in technology deals and M&A. We'll be disciplined in our use of capital in this regard, focusing on
opportunities that meet our growth and return criteria.
At the same time, we are committed to returning capital to our owners, and this capital structure affords us the
flexibility to deliver further value to our owners with an accelerated buyback program and through dividends. Another
important priority is to maintain our strong investment-grade credit ratings to provide access to attractive financing for
our long-term needs as well as in-season borrowings for our working capital needs.
One of the first priorities of our capital allocation will be on share buybacks. Our board just approved the new two-year
$10 billion buyback program. We'll use it in combination with approximately $1 billion that remains in our current
program; and as an important first step, we intend to use a combination in cash and new debt to target $6 billion for an
accelerated share buyback, which we anticipate beginning in the near-term and completing in about 6 months to 12
months. We'll likewise continue our focus on the dividend, as I view that as a priority element of our strategy, as a
source of direct income to our long-term owners.
With that, let me bring this all together. Monsanto is at a unique point in our history. We have the confidence and
visibility into our business to talk about delivering growth that effectively spans a decade. That visibility in turn allows
us to take the next step in our capital allocation, and from there, I believe we can use a unique combination of organic
growth, new opportunities and our business structure to meaningfully grow our earnings, our cash generation, and
ultimately, our return to our shareowners.
Thanks. And I'll hand it back to Bryan for the Q&A.
Bryan Hurley
Thanks, Pierre. With that, we'll now open the line for questions. As we typically do, I'd ask you to please hold your
questions to one per person, so that we can take as many from as many people as possible.
So, Kevin, I think we're ready to open the line for questions at this point.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thank you, good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the balance sheet
announcement, really well thought out and well done; a question on the corn business. I just want to understand both
how to connect what's taken place this year with what's underlying the target out to 2019. And I guess in particular, this
year, is there any issue in terms of returns that you are reserved for in the third quarter because of what's gone on with
planted acreage in the North or the recent flooding that you just don't know what the numbers are and we might learn
more about that in 2014?
And then as it relates to going forward, as you went through the presentation, and we saw some familiar stuff on some
of the slides, some of the things that I noticed you didn't mention that I want to understand what your view is going
forward was, you've historically talked about the 5% to 10% price/mix lift, and you also had a target of $1 billion in
sales coming from that. Are those numbers still good, or are we thinking about things differently now?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Vincent, thanks for the question. I think all three of us will take a piece of this. Let me start by
saying I think corn had a good year, not a great year. Beans picked up a lot of that slack. But if you look across the
Americas, we saw acreage contract, and I think a big piece of our numbers reflects that contraction. And I would say
even with that contraction, we see volume about flat year on year. So if you step back, I feel pretty good about the corn

performance given the challenges. But I'll maybe ask Brett to say a little bit about the market, and then Pierre maybe a
few words on returns and how you see that playing out in the piece of mix as well.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Thanks, Vince, and good morning. I think there are a couple of really key points to think
about, and it is both this year and as we start to progress into next year. First of all, as we mentioned, we've seen
hundreds of millions of dollars lost to less acres and currency this year in our corn business. But as we look at the core
of our corn business, that was offset by our mix gains in the various regions and the significant COGS improvement
that we expected to get in the U.S. And in the U.S, we remain on target for those. And as Hugh mentioned, along with
that, our soybean businesses is having an absolutely record year, driven by, of course, the new products in soybeans
and the build-out of Roundup Ready 2 Yield, but also the portfolio advantage we have as those corn acres shifted to
bean acres and we picked up on that.
And then also, looking at next year in the corn business, as you mentioned, we're going to be challenged on COGS in
South America with the production issues that we faced in Argentina with the floods that we had late in the year. But I
think as I step back and look at it, I feel good about the fundamentals of our corn business and the strength that we have
in the fundamental corn business. And that is literally what gives us the confidence to speak to a five-year plan where
the vast majority of that growth is going to come from our core seeds and traits business.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Pierre, maybe a few words on...
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: Maybe to address the specifics of your question, Vincent, regarding returns, as we
mentioned during the previous call, last year we got surprised in the fourth quarter with higher returns. We and the
farmers actually got surprised with higher returns, related to basically the fact that the market was anticipating 97
million acres planting and it ended up being more like 95 million acres.
This year we've been very prudent, I think, and we shouldn't be facing such an issue. And this was one of the reasons
actually we were anticipating Q3 to be lower than last year in corn, so there's no surprise to that. That's the message we
tried to send during the Q2 earnings call, and that's what we see today. So we feel very comfortable that during our Q4,
we shouldn't see any significant adjustments to our returns.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: So could you just speak to the 5% to 10% price/mix uplift and that $1 billion target? Are
those still good?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So as far as the 5% to 10% price/mix uplift, what we see this year is from a margins
perspective, we feel really good about the situation in the U.S., where we've seen both the cost of goods upgrades we
were anticipating and also the price/mix uplift. It was a more difficult year than we've seen in the past, but we've seen
very nice price uplift. So we still think this is a key driver of our growth going forward.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thank you.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes, good morning. As you execute on the $10 billion recapitalization, can you speak to
what implications, if any, the new program will have for alternative uses of capital? I'm thinking about the trajectory on
capital expenditures, SG&A expense. And what are your latest thoughts on M&A?
<A - Hugh Grant>: I'll maybe ask Pierre to say a few words. Our M&A, let me take a step back and kick this up a
piece, Kevin. As Brett made the point on the last question, on our five-year growth targets, we see the lion's share of
that growth coming out of our core. So any growth that we see from Climate Corp and some of the new platforms lays
on top of that, and then the capital allocation piece leverages that growth. So that's how we're thinking about it.

On CapEx, we'll continue to invest on building out our plants to drive capacity, as we see share gains.
I think as you look at the Climate Corp deal, we see that as a central integrator. And that brings together our seed,
chemistry opportunities, fertilizer, machinery and our retail partners. It integrates them around that hub. But within that
play, I would assume there are probably still going to be M&A opportunities, and we're looking at keeping powder dry
to do that. So I think with the five-year view, the key in this is it's our core business that drives the lion's share of that
growth.
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: And maybe as a complement to what Hugh just said, you're still looking at a business with
strong cash generation, strong free cash generation. So when our board made the decision to vote on this buyback
program, we had assessed our potential for growth and the potential for cash generation. So we feel actually very good
that we're going to be able to fund our business and the growth that we have in our plan going forward.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: As a follow-up, if I may, on the precision Ag component of your plan, I think you
described it is meaningful. You were over-delivering in the near term on the acreage. Can you talk about what that
acreage ramp could look like into fiscal 2015 and beyond? And also update us on the economics of your partnership
arrangement and how that flows through to Monsanto on a gross and net basis.
<A - Hugh Grant>: It's still early for how we're seeing that flow through, Kevin. I would say we're delighted in the
performance this year. So when we laid out a goal and hit the 20 million acres, if you draw that against any
conventional ramp that we've seen in the last 15 years in our seeds and traits business, it surpasses any of that. It grew
from 20 million to 40 million acres in the first year, and then see 30 million of that 40 million acres as real users or
users that are using it on a regular basis. It gives us cause for optimism that we're delivering value and that we're
growing the consumer experience; but, Brett, maybe a few words on how these partners are linking in.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I think, Kevin, as we look at this, it's clearly continuing to build out the platform in the
early years, and the contribution will be in the later years of the five-year plan. I'd say as Hugh mentioned, I think this
platform is demonstrating that it can be the integrator of bringing together decisions around how the farmer manages
his land, his seed choices, his crop protection choices, his fertility programs, his equipment, et cetera. And our goal will
be to continue to build out that platform with our partners. And I'm thrilled at this point to have basically all of our
large retail partners on board with us. We're in conversations with lots of other potential partners to bring that together.
So I continue to look at this as very excited, given the success we've had in the early years and the real expression of
interest from the farmer level with these early acres. That's huge. If farmers are telling us that they're really interested,
the key is their behavior followed what they've been telling us that they were interested in. But the build-out from a
financial standpoint will be later in that five-year plan, Kevin.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Roberts from UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Thank you. Could you give us the Roundup or the glyphosate price volume trends in the
quarter and do you become capacity-constraint in glyphosate anytime in this five-year plan that you've got?
<A - Hugh Grant>: John, thanks for your question. I used to say, we're half the business and the Chinese are the other
half. We are the smaller half of it now, so we – I like the strategy we make what we sell. So, we make a bunch of
Roundup and we sell everything that we make every year and that's a pretty good model for a business. And we lay our
price in pretty much right on top of the generic glyphosate, so there's nothing fancy in this, but it works, it's simple, and
it's served us well this year. Trends in the quarter, Brett, and maybe a word on this year versus next year, that may be
helpful.

<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I don't think that we saw the trends change all that much this year. We started this year
saying, we would be flat to up through the year. And as I look to the future, I expect Roundup to be flat to down going
forwards versus the uptrend, and we see that playing out in the marketplace going through next year. So, I don't see
significant movement on that going forwards next year, but the trend would be flat to down. But again, it's in a
supporting role of our core seeds and traits business, and as you said, we sell out Roundup every year, and we're going
to focus on our core seeds and traits. I just...
<Q - John E. Roberts>: We wouldn't expect any significant capital then to go to that business, I would suspect, over
this five-year plan?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: No, we would not. And that's a great segue, John. Today, we announced a five-year goal of
doubling EPS. We see significant growth in the business. Roundup is a great product, it's a great cash generator, but for
more than 2019 looking back, it's going to be our seeds and traits business that really drives that growth. It's the
integration of the Climate Corp platform and how we integrate those two pieces together, and that's really going to be
the central – that's the central core of our growth story at Monsanto going forward.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you, Hugh. I know on Syngenta, you can't say too much, but should we take that
interest, perhaps, as signs of, one, either increased interest in crop chemicals, or two, increased confidence by you of
the introduction of GMCs into Europe, given recent rulings by the EU?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thanks for the question. I don't think there's an awful lot of value in speculation. I've always been
a big believer in actions speaking louder than words. And I think this morning, there are probably 10 billion good
reasons why we should be focusing on our growth opportunities. Here's how I would frame it. Since November, since
the back-end of last year, when we announced the Climate Corp deal, we've been focused and we've talked a lot about
the 40 decisions that a grower needs to make, when he's producing a crop. And I see clearly in the next five years that,
that Climate Corp deal becomes the center of an integrating platform.
And if you say, so how does M&A play in that, I think that there's obviously – we talked to his, Pierre mentioned it
earlier – there's obviously M&A opportunities there, but my guess is more of this is going to be done through
partnerships, partnerships at the seed level, the chemistry, because chemistry then becomes an integrated part in those
40 decisions; fertilizer, machinery and our key retail partners and how they all come together in that orchestra to play a
vital part.
So, when you think about it that way, I don't think this is as much about M&A as much is building that network of
partnerships. And I would say this morning, and we've been working on this for a long time, but the decision this
morning on this new path, I think is an inflection point for the company, and as you look at future growth, the $10
billion reinvestment in our own growth story I think is more compelling than the M&A argument.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Very clear. And you just saw in the GM issue in Europe, given the EU, given I guess
approval to the authority to those individual countries to make decisions. Has your confidence increased what we might
see GMCs in Europe in the next 3 years to 5 years?
<A - Hugh Grant>: In our five-year growth plan, so as we commit to doubling our EPS, we're not holding our breath
on that. I think it's encouraging that member states are going to start choosing their own destiny, but it just moves
achingly slowly. So I think as we think about the growth opportunities ahead in seeds and traits, we see very real
opportunities in Eastern Europe. We see great opportunities emerging in the Ukraine, but our core growth areas are
going to get bigger in the next five years, and I don't think Europe's going to play a major part in that, in the next three
to five years.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Don Carson from Susquehanna. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Yes, thank you; Hugh, a question on your growth target. Is growth from the traditional GMO
pipeline diminishing as a contributor to earnings growth? Post Intacta, I know you've got a few things in the pipeline
like dicamba tolerance, corn rootworm 3, and the yield and stress, but is that why you're focusing more on the new
transformational platforms like precision Ag and biologicals?
<A - Hugh Grant>: No, we've always been very careful, Don, on what really is in adjacency, and I think the Climate
Corp deal and the biologicals is a natural extension from driving value in the bank and driving value simultaneously
outside the bank. The crunch for us is real simple; how do you deliver more yield to the grower on the same acres over
time? And if you look, we talked about this in our Investor Day, if you look forward than the next 10 to 20 years, there
are no new acres. With one or two exceptions, there are no new acres, and then sustainable intensification of yield
becomes more and more important.
And the way you unlock that on a sustainable basis is by providing better advice to the grower that allows him or her to
get more bushels on that same footprint. So, you run through exactly our pipeline opportunities. They come in the next
half decade to decade. They're all significant opportunities, and during that time, I think we have the opportunity to
integrate, as I mentioned earlier, a bunch of other inputs and use them more efficiently to unlock that yield. So I really,
really don't see this as an either/or. I see this as both pieces playing together. And I think that's the beauty in the
strategy, and that's what triggered the reinvestment decision in putting $10 billion behind that goal.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Just two clarifications. Do biologicals contribute at all to your 2019 earnings growth target?
And you say precision Ag will be a meaningful contributor. Can you define meaningful or be more quantitative on how
you define that?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So, Don, it's a little early for us to give precise numbers regarding the 2019. The number
we laid out was the $4 billion from the core business, from the base business, which is really seeds and traits only.
Actually biologicals and Climate and the new platforms are separate from this $4 billion. So, biologicals, by the end of
this five-year period is not going to be very significant. Climate, however, we'll have to do some work there to let you
guys think about it, and we'll come back to you at Whistle Stop with maybe a little more detail on how we think about
Climate in our projections.

questions.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Perfect. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the monetization of Intacta,
specifically what you're seeing from your Brazilian customer base as we head into next year? And then also out of your
10 million to 12 million acre estimate, what expectation, if any, do you have for Argentinean and Latin American south

<A - Brett D. Begemann>: One thing I look at this year with the tremendous performance we had in Intacta, meeting
or exciting our yield expectations and insect control replacement speaks volumes to the performance of the product,
which then looking at 10 million to 12 million acres next year, which is a huge step-up from where we were at 3
million acres this year.
So, the monetization is going really well. Farmers are seeing the value, and they're stepping up to the plate. As to the
breakout between Brazil and Argentina, the 10 million to 12 million acres is inclusive of all of it. The vast majority of it
will come from Brazil next year. We're just getting started in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Gulley from BGC Financial. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: Hey, good morning, guys, and let me add my congratulations on the share repurchase. As you
move towards getting to $11-plus a share in 2019, what how much of that is going to come from share repurchases?
And how much, let's say, from net income growth?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Mark, thanks for the question. We see the lion's share is coming from our core business. Pierre,
maybe a few words on Climate Corp and how the other pieces layer in?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: Really, as Hugh was mentioning, the lion's share of the growth is going to be coming from
the business, and past the impact of the original huge buyback we're going to be doing, we are banking on the growth
of our business to lay out this target of doubling our EPS. And that's really on the confidence actually we have that
we're going to be able to grow our base business and to grow our earnings during that period. That's one of the key
drivers for a decision now to buyback our stock. Because we think that's one of the best investments we could make in
our own stock, basically.
<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: As a follow-up, just a couple, credit-type questions. What debt rating do you anticipate having
as you move through this share repurchase and what interest rate should we use in our modeling for this?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So obviously the rating agencies will have to do their work and come back to us and come
back to the markets with the rating of our debt. It was a priority for us to still be a strong credit rating, and we are
confident we'll be in a good place, but we should hear from the rating agencies shortly, so I cannot anticipate on their
final ratings.
<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: And interest rate?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: It will depend, obviously, on the credit rating, and will depend also on the appetite for the
market for our bond.

<A - Hugh Grant>: Thanks for the question. The first build-out will be in the U.S., so the encouraging news today is
20 million going to 40 million acres. So it's a great groundbreaker start. But I would guess by the five-year period, we'll
start to see that build-out occurring in our Brazilian and Argentinean markets as well. There's tremendous interest there
already.
<Q - Daniel Jester>: Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tim Tiberio from Miller Tabak + Co. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Tim J. Tiberio>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a clarifying question around your
comments around capital allocations to Ag Productivity. I wasn't certain whether that was for the overall Ag
Productivity segment or just for Roundup. And as a tie-in there, I noticed that one of your partners has announced
dicamba production expansion in the U.S. And I was just wondering if we're at a point where you can start talking
about whether you anticipate that dicamba would be produced internally, or whether there's a higher probability that
maybe we should be looking more towards a JV type structure.
<A - Hugh Grant>: That's a great distinction. I think the earlier question really related specifically to Roundup. As
you look at dicamba, it's hard to call at the moment. But if I was looking ahead, certainly in the next five years, I would
anticipate there's a likelihood that we would be investing in capital and production.
I would anticipate also that our partner, BASF may as well. And I would expect that beyond us, we'll see increased
capacity going in, in China and in India as well. So there's tremendous anticipation and noise in the market. The
groundbreaker work, the early trials have really lit up the performance of the product, and I think it's an opportunity to
upgrade our Roundup Ready 2s one more time. But I would expect that we'll see capital flowing in this opportunity
from a range of sources.
<Q - Tim J. Tiberio>: Great, thanks for your time and congratulations again on the buyback.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thanks very much.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Carly Mattson from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Carly L. Mattson>: Great, thank you. In the context of your capital structure, could you talk to whether there are
strategic or commercial reasons to maintain a single-A rating, or if we should view the new leverage guidance as an
indication that Monsanto could be comfortable operating as a BBB credit?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: That's pretty much the question I answered. We cannot share with – we don't have,
obviously, the final credit ratings from the credit rating agencies. And they will decide, we feel comfortable based on
the work we've been doing that we'll end up in a good place. But obviously, it's totally depending on the credit rating
agencies. And as I said, they'll have to do their work and we are expecting them to come back to us fairly shortly.
<Q - Carly L. Mattson>: So there's no strategic or commercial reason though from a business perspective to have a
single-A rating?
<A - Hugh Grant>: As I said, we feel based on our personal work – the work of our teams that we're in a really good
position to run our business going forward.
<Q - Carly L. Mattson>: Okay.

Sure. Our next question is coming from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Thanks for slipping me in there, Bryan, two quick questions. One, on the Roundup
Ready 2 Xtend, I think you've targeted 65 million acres. Could you give us a sense of what that average acre might
spend today on secondary herbicide treatment, so we can think about the opportunity set?
And then secondly, Pierre, we know you love to be conservative. But I guess if I look at your forecast, you've got seeds
and traits gross profits growing to about 60% in the next five years compared to maybe 50% in the prior five years. If
you did the math, you could get to a doubling of EPS just from that alone. So obviously, you're buying back some stock
in that timeframe, and I think you've talked about having some accretive benefit from some of the new programs. Are
there some offsets that we should think about that limit that growth to only 15% a year?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Let me start, Bob, so thanks for your questions. On the 65 million acres, it's probably bigger than
that I think. We're chasing 100 million acres on our Intacta opportunity. You layer Roundup Ready 2 Xtend on top of
that, Brett, I think 65 million acres would be – using Bob words, a conservative – 65 million acres would be a
conservative assessment, right?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: That's a North America number...
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yes, so that would be the U.S. And then any insight to Bob's question on spend, on acre spend?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I think the way to look at it, Bob, is that will be something that we'll do extensive work on
as we get ready to commercialize the product. But a significant number of farmers have moved to multiple molecules
on the field, which we have encouraged over the years to minimize the development of resistant weeds. And the
Roundup Ready Xtend program becomes a component within that, but there are farmers using multiple herbicides now
to get those multiple modes of action. So there's clearly an opportunity to reduce the number of products that they're
using and what they're spending today by substituting in Roundup Ready Xtend. But that's the analysis we're doing
now as we look at the product in the field, and we'll be more dependent upon that as we go forward.
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: And maybe answering the second part of your question, Bob, as I mentioned, we feel the
lion's share of our growth is going to be coming from our core business. That's really the key driver behind the numbers
we are laying out and our target to more than double – to at least double our EPS going forward.
We are projecting five years down the road and we've got really good visibility on a couple of things and mainly on our
seeds and traits business. And that's where the core of the growth is going to be coming with this $4 billion of
additional GP we are talking about. But laying out a five-years target, I wouldn't say we want to be conservative, but
we want to be very realistic about the number we are laying out in front of our investors. So that's one of the reasons we
laid out this target. And we actually feel really good about our approach there.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Great, thank you.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thank you very much.
<A - Bryan Hurley>: Kevin, I recognize that we are at the bottom of the hour. Given the breadth of the information
we've covered here today, let's maybe extend it just a little bit and get a couple more questions in.
Operator
Certainly. Our next question is coming from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Joel D. Jackson>: Hi, thanks for fitting me in as well. I had a couple questions on your target leverage. So maybe
you could talk about how you came up with the 1.5 times target leverage range. It would seem like if you didn't do any

M&A – I guess what I'm trying to get at is, if you didn't do any M&A, are you holding by that 1.5 times leverage where
in two years you would do more buybacks than the $10 billion to get there? Thanks.
<A - Hugh Grant>: I was just going to say, as I mentioned in my remarks, it's the end of 18 months of a lot of careful
work, and it gives us the ability to continue to invest, as we said earlier, in CapEx and M&A. But, Pierre, maybe your
view on how you came to the 1.5 times?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So we came to this 1.5 times – thinking about how we were going to be able to operate our
business, we wanted to keep room for M&A, as Hugh was mentioning, and investing in our business. So this was really
the result of the work we've been doing over the last 18 months. That's how we ended up in this place.
And one of the things I'd like to mention is coming from almost minus 0.5 leverage ratio, a negative, minus 0.5 times
leverage ratio and going to the 1.5 times leverage ratio, we are freeing up 2x our net debt-to-EBITDA, and that's worth
about $10 billion, so that's really how we came to that and where we feel good about the move we've just made.
<Q - Joel D. Jackson>: And would you hold by that 1.5 times leverage? Is that a rigid target that you'll hit regardless
of M&A opportunities come two years from now?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So we've mentioned in the script that we would recalibrate over time, but we feel really
good about this number, and that's really the target we have for the foreseeable future.
<Q - Joel D. Jackson>: Thank you.
<A - Bryan Hurley>: Kevin, why don't we try to squeeze in two more questions here?
Operator
Certainly. Our next question is coming from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Michael L. Piken>: Yes. Thank you for the question. I just wanted to break down in a little bit more detail this $4
billion in growth from seeds and traits. If you could break out between soybeans and corn and maybe some of your
other crops, where you see the biggest growth drivers? I know, you've talked about the decade of the soybeans, but if
you could give us some ballpark guidance, that'd be helpful?
<A - Hugh Grant>: So, our goal was not to break down the $4 billion by crops, because as we said, there are a number
of things that are going to happen and the trajectory may be slightly different from a crop – on a crop-by-crop basis, but
what is really clear to us is that corn will have to play a major role as far as the growth.
And if you remember, what we laid out during our Investor Day earlier in the year, price only should be able to yield
about $1 billion, so if you add volume benefits to that over time, you can get an order of magnitude regarding corn and
similarly for soybeans, which is going to be the other key player in this $4 billion. I mean, we laid that out at Investor
Day as well, more than $1 billion of GP coming from soybeans. So, it gives you the order of magnitude. But as we
mentioned, I mean, we are anticipating that our crops are going to be playing a nice parts also in the $4 billion.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: The gorgeous thing is, we've got such a nice hedge between corn and soybeans, when you
look this year to the growth in beans, it's still going to be a corn story, but the beans performance is really a huge
contributor as well.
<A - Bryan Hurley>: Why don't we move on and make that our – make our last question here before we wrap up with
a couple of final comments by Hugh?
Operator
Certainly. Our final question today is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.

<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Thank you very much. Is the $10 billion in announced share repurchase over and above the
$1 billion that's remaining from your old share repurchase? And could you make a quick comment on the rise in
receivables and inventories year-over-year, which are up about 20%, even though your sales were up about 4%?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So, regarding your first question, the answer is yes. So, the $10 billion is additional to the
$1 billion.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Yes.
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So, that's an easy answer. Regarding our working capital, we announced really early in the
year that we were rebuilding our seeds inventories following two years of challenging production, so the spike you see
in inventories was really expected.
Regarding the receivables, it's a combination of factors, one of which being the weights that we've seen in the early
days from our Ag Productivity business, which is usually collected during the fourth quarter. So this is something,
we're going to be collecting in the fourth quarter we feel really good about.
And the second element is just a management decision we made not to use some of our credit facilities, customer
financing in the third quarter. We'll use that facility in the fourth quarter. So, that's really the high-level story for our
receivables increase.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Okay, thank you very much.
Hugh Grant
Okay, so let me thank everybody for your patience and for joining us on the call this morning. As you can tell, it's
obviously a very important day for us, as we've laid out a strategy that guides our growth through the next season, but
also for the next five years. So let me just conclude this morning by emphasizing a few points.
We haven't laid out a multiyear target for several years, and our ability to do so today is a real statement on the
confidence that we have in our core growth, and as our core growth, and the expansion of our strategy as new platforms
like The Climate Corporation start defining even more opportunities going forward. And we're backing that confidence
today with $10 billion in share buybacks, resulting in the capital structure that I think is a major step forward in our
capital allocation and further strengthen our growth going forward.
So we're focused on delivering that opportunity, and we look forward to continuing to share our progress with you. And
we sincerely hope that many of you'll be able to join us in August in the field for our Whistle Stop event, where we'll
have a firsthand look at this growth story going forward. So thanks very much for your attention and your support this
morning.
Operator
Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a
wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.
