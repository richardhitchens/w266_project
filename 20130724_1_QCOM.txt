Now to comments from Qualcomm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Paul Jacobs.
Paul E. Jacobs
Good afternoon, everyone. I'm sorry I can't be with you live today, but I did want to give you my comments before
passing it onto the team. We're pleased with our strong results this quarter with revenues up 35% and non-GAAP EPS
up 21% versus a year-ago. Licensing revenues were driven by strong smartphone sales in the March quarter and our
Snapdragon and Gobi products were featured in an extensive set of flagship devices. The tremendous success of the
business puts us in a strong position to return capital to stockholders.
During the third fiscal quarter and up through today, we returned approximately $2.2 billion. This includes dividends
paid, and approximately $1.5 billion in stock repurchases, made under our previously announced $5 billion stock
repurchase program. We're confident in our business outlook, and we'll continue to return capital to stockholders
consistent with this view.
I'd like to focus my comments today on smartphone innovation before turning it over to Steve for a more
comprehensive update on our QCT and QTL businesses. I'm often asked about the potential slowing pace of innovation
in smartphones. I can assure you that we do not see it here at Qualcomm.
The breadth of technologies that are being developed and the demand for new features and device capabilities from our
customers remains extremely strong. There are at least seven major technology areas in which significant advances are
continuing to be made, including the modem, including RF, the CPU, the graphics processing unit, digital signal
processing and multimedia, connectivity, sensors and displays.
Innovations such as LTE advanced, LTE broadcast, multi-band RF front-ends, Ultra HD video, augmented reality,
computational photography, continuous interaction user interfaces, H.265 video compression, HD audio, sensor
monitoring. 802.11ac and ah, indoor position locations, proximity-based communications, wireless charging, new
display technologies, mobile payment capabilities, security features, and remote device management are some of the
many features that will increase the utility of 3G and 4G devices, any one of which could provide a catalyst for a
smartphone user to upgrade.
Throughout the history of the industry, we've seen a series of technology advancements that have driven new
innovative devices, which have fueled upgrade and replacement cycles. This has continued over the last several years
as we've seen the introduction of many new technologies including LTE, dual- and quad-core processors, improved
graphics, higher resolution displays, and more capable operating systems.
In the near future, we'll see the broad adoption of LTE Advanced which doubles the peak data rate and provides higher
average throughput. That's not all. The scale of the smartphone platform is unparalleled, and it is at the center of
technology innovation. New technologies used to be commercialized through discrete consumer electronics products,
but today we see innovations moving rapidly into smartphones. For example, the first place most consumers will see
high-quality Ultra HD video recording is on a Snapdragon-enabled smartphone.
Looking at this now from a regional perspective, there seems to be some concern that developed regions are becoming
saturated with smartphones. The fact is that these regions have been primarily replacement-cycle driven for some time
as handset penetrations are already quite high. Subscribers have already been cycling through devices and are used to

doing so. Certain large carriers routinely provide incentives for subscribers to purchase a new phone every two years
and although we may see different programs or replacement initiatives in the future, these types of programs are
working successfully and competitive dynamics favor their continuance in the future. Interestingly, there have been
some recent plans launched by operators that could actually accelerate the replacement cycle, so we'll continue to
monitor those. In sum, our long-term plans continue to include a very modest decrease in the developed region
replacement rate.
Turning to emerging regions, we view the opportunity as very significant when you consider that according to our
geographic definition, approximately 80% of the world's population resides in these locations with a relatively youthful
demographic, and the GDP in emerging regions is expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 6% for the next
five years, according to consensus estimates. And according to Gartner, in these countries at the end of 2012, the
average penetration rate of smartphones relative to the installed base of handsets sits at approximately 18%, or only
10% of the total population.
As we've pointed out during the last couple of years, we're seeing the rapid adoption of mobile technologies, and in fact
rising average selling prices in these locations, as the mix shifts to smartphones. In these regions, there are limited fixed
broadband alternatives and users are getting excellent utility from their wireless devices.
So in summary, although we expect to experience quarterly growth rate fluctuations for a variety of reasons, 3G/4G
mobile computing technology and devices are still in an early stage of adoption in the majority of the world and have a
very long runway of attractive growth potential. This adoption is fueling new innovation and perpetuating that cycle.
Gartner estimates that approximately 700 million smartphones were sold in calendar 2012, and that number will grow
to $1.7 billion in 2017, representing an approximately 20% compound annual growth base. Building off fiscal year
2012, we believe we'll experience a double-digit average annual growth rate in total reported device sales over our
five-year planning period, which includes an estimated average low-single digit percentage decline in average selling
prices over this period.
So again, I'm sorry I can't be on the call live today, but I am pleased with our results and outlook and Steve and George
will now comment on that. Thank you very much.
Steven M. Mollenkopf
Good afternoon, everyone. I will provide some comments on our QTL and QCT businesses, which both delivered
strong financial results this quarter. In QTL, total reported device sales by our licensees were up 18% year-over-year
and above our prior expectations driven by stronger than expected average selling prices. Average selling prices were
up $13 sequentially at the midpoint, despite $3 of foreign exchange unfavorability, reflecting an increased mix of
mid-tier and high tier handsets.
The quarter-over-quarter increase was driven by ASP strength in both emerging and developed regions. As Paul noted
in his comments, although the developed regions have been primarily driven by replacements and smartphone
penetration is relatively high, our calendar year 2013 unit shipment estimates include year-over-year growth of
approximately 6% in developed regions, well ahead of GDP estimates.
This quarter, we also continue to see an increasing mix of handsets at the mid and high tiers. And we expect this
distribution to remain relatively stable going forward in developed regions. In the emerging regions, we expect to
continue to see strong unit growth and increasing average selling prices. We also continue to grow our licensee base
and now have over 240 CDMA licensees and more than 65 single mode OFDMA licensees. Our patent portfolio
continues to be the most widely licensed in the industry.
QCT also had another strong quarter with record revenues. Results either met or exceeded each of our prior key
guidance metrics with revenues and earnings before tax increasing 47% and 56% year-over-year, respectively. MSM
shipments were up 22% year-over-year and at the high end of our prior guidance range. Implied revenue per MSM was
higher sequentially as we increased our share of content in devices.

Versus expectation, we had a greater mix of shipments of mid, low tier products and to Chinese emerging accounts,
offsetting a bit of softness we saw from some Tier 1 OEMs. Our scale and broad diversified customer base are key
strengths to our business and allows us to deliver strong results, despite quarterly fluctuations in mix or OEM share.
Looking to the fourth fiscal quarter, we had a similar product mix shift versus prior expectation. We expect MSM
shipments to be slightly higher sequentially, driven by anticipated new device launches and the seasonality associated
with this quarter.
Similar to what we have seen in the last couple of years, it is important to note that our MSM volumes for each of the
next two quarters are dependent on timing and success of OEM product launches for the holiday selling season. We're
encouraged by a strong pipeline of Snapdragon 800 and Snapdragon 200 products launching over the next two quarters
along with shipments for the China Mobile LTE trial beginning in September and ramping into the December quarter.
Our design traction remains strong. We have just crossed a new milestone with more than 1,000 designs announced or
shipping with Snapdragon processors and have over 500 designs in the pipeline. We are also seeing increased
momentum in tablets as OEMs leverage phone designs for tablets with over 40 design wins in the pipeline including
the recently announced new Nexus 7 by Google.
Our latest Snapdragon 800 processor has again raised the bar, combining the industry's most advanced mobile
application processor with the industry's most advanced multimode LTE modem. Designs are in process with many
major OEMs for a very broad set of opportunities worldwide. Flagship devices announced with the Snapdragon 800
include the next generation LG G smartphone, Samsung Galaxy S4 LTE-Advanced and the Sony Xperia Z Ultra.
We remain confident in our LTE leadership position moving forward. Though LTE competition exists today and new
suppliers are hoping to enter, the complexity of a multimode LTE modem feature set and the integration of a high
performance application processor into the same solution is proving to be technically challenging for many.
The modem roadmap of the industry remains robust as carriers move to LTE-Advanced and utilize complicated
spectrum allocations to meet the increasing data demands of mobile devices and support roaming.
We are building momentum in China and our emerging account shipments were up 35% sequentially in the June
quarter. We continue to add new design wins. We expect competition for low cost solutions to remain strong, however,
we believe the expected launch of LTE in China will be a differentiator for us and enable us to gain broader access,
including into China Mobile.
Further, many of the leading emerging account OEMs hope to expand their businesses internationally, which also
aligns well with our tiered roadmap. We won 30 new designs in the China Mobile large scale LTE trial, and including
increasing share of new designs in the second wave of the LTE device awards.
Our connectivity and networking products continue to do well with record revenue and unit shipments in the June
quarter. Connectivity design traction continues to be strong across the mobile, networking and consumer electronics
segments. We are also pleased with the growing success of our new 802.11ac product, the WCN3680, which was the
first 11ac mobile solution in the industry to achieve Wi-Fi certification, and is also featured in the Samsung Galaxy
Mega.
Our RF360 Front End Solution is an opportunity for us to solve further complexity at the chipset level and grow our
content in the device. The first product in this family of products is on track and currently sampling to a major Tier 1
OEM. Though still early in the lifecycle of this new solution, we are very encouraged by early OEM interest and design
traction.
Looking ahead, we see very strong trends for both QTL and QCT, with many exciting devices expected this holiday
season.
That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to George.

George S. Davis
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.
We are pleased to be reporting another quarter of strong financial results, reflecting significant year-over-year growth
in both QCT and QTL. This performance also provides the basis for an increase in our financial outlook for fiscal 2013.
Fiscal third quarter revenues were a record $6.2 billion, up 35% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Non-GAAP
operating income of $2.2 billion was up 18% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03 was up 21%
year-over-year and down 12% quarter-over-quarter.
These results included a $158 million impairment charge or $0.06 cents per share related to QMT assets. Without this
impairment, non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $1.09, well above the high end of our prior guidance
range.
Our major businesses performed quite well in the quarter on strong device ASPs and demand from emerging regions in
QTL, while higher implied revenue per MSM and strong volumes led to solid results for QCT.
In QTL, total reported device sales by our licensees were $56.5 billion, above the high end of our prior guidance range.
We estimate that 244 million to 248 million 3G/4G-based devices were shipped by our licensees in the March quarter
at an average selling price of $227 to $233, up approximately $13 sequentially at the midpoint.
QCT had record revenues in the quarter, and MSM shipments were 172 million units, towards the high end of our prior
guidance range. Implied revenue per MSM was $24.55, which was higher sequentially, as expected. Fiscal third quarter
QCT operating margin was 17%, in line with our prior expectations. Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses
grew 1% sequentially, slightly below our prior expectations.
As Paul mentioned during the third fiscal quarter and the first few weeks of this current quarter, we returned
approximately $2.15 billion to stockholders, including $600 million of dividends paid and $1.55 billion in stock
repurchases. We now have just under $3.5 billion remaining on our $5 billion authorization as a result of these
activities. Cash flow from operations was strong at 33% of revenues, and we ended the quarter with cash and
marketable securities of $30.4 billion.
In other balance sheet matters, I am pleased to report that we have taken another step forward in our partnership with
Bharti in India. Consistent with our previous plans, Bharti funded repayment of $492 million in debt that Qualcomm
had previously guaranteed. The remaining $484 million in debt guaranteed by Qualcomm was deconsolidated due to a
change in control of the joint venture, which included Bharti subscribing to additional shares. We expect the remaining
guarantee to be released prior to the end of this fiscal year.
Now turning to our guidance, we are raising our financial outlook for fiscal 2013. We estimate fiscal 2013 revenues to
be in the range of approximately $24.3 billion to $25 billion, up approximately 29% year-over-year at the midpoint. We
expect fiscal 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.48 to $4.56, up approximately 22%
year-over-year at the midpoint.
We are increasing our forecast for the fiscal 2013 QTL average selling price to approximately $223 to $229, which is
$6 above our prior $220 midpoint estimate, reflecting higher handset prices in multiple regions.
For calendar 2013 global 3G/4G-based device shipments, we continue to estimate that between 1.015 and 1.085 billion
devices will be shipped by our licensees, up approximately 12% year-over-year at the midpoint. While our calendar
year range is unchanged, we are more upwardly biased in our outlook than we were previously.
Consistent with our prior expectations, we estimate fiscal 2013 QTL operating margins to be 85.5% to 87.5% and QCT
operating margins to be 18.5% to 20.5%. We expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow
approximately 22% to 23% year-over-year.

Now turning to the fourth fiscal quarter, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.9 billion to $6.6
billion, up approximately 28% year-over-year at the midpoint. Our estimates reflect continued strength in QTL and
QCT, balanced by higher operating expenses and some uncertainty around the timing and success of product launches.
As Steve mentioned, we are very confident in our positioning in these leading-edge devices. It is more a matter of
timing.
We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fourth fiscal quarter to be approximately $1.02 to $1.10 per share, up
approximately 19% year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate fourth fiscal quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and
SG&A expenses will increase sequentially, approximately 4% to 6%, reflecting increased patent expense in QTL and
R&D expense in QCT.
In QTL, we estimate that total reported device sales of $55 billion to $60 billion will be reported by our licensees in the
September quarter for shipments they made in the June quarter, up approximately 24% year-over-year at the midpoint.
In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 171 million to 181 million units during the September
quarter, and QCT operating margin to be approximately 16% to 17%. We expect implied revenue per MSM to be flat to
slightly down off a strong third quarter.
Consistent with our prior view, we estimate that the 3G/4G channel inventory will decline further in the September
quarter as OEMs and operators prepare for new product launches for the holiday season, though we continue to expect
it to remain within the normal 11- to 16-week range.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.
Warren Kneeshaw
Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead with your question.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi, thank you very much. George, I wanted to ask you a question first on your capital
allocation strategy. That was one of the highlights in Paul's prepared remarks as well, and obviously you stepped up the
buybacks quite significantly here. Is your strategy here to basically continue to buy opportunistically, especially when
there's pullbacks in the stock like we've seen recently? Or is there any thought at the Board level or in your office about
something that is a little bit more structured and more significant, and perhaps including levering the balance sheet?
And then a question for Steve on chipset margins. It seems like we continue to be in the high teens there even though
you're gaining quite significant content share, and also volumes are coming up nicely in the next quarter. Can you just
go through the puts and takes of why we are not seeing that move higher? Thank you.
<A - George S. Davis>: Hi, Simona. Thanks for your question. I think what you're seeing is definitely a step up in the
return of capital for the quarter. And actually, for the full year, as you may have seen, we've returned $3.3 billion in
buyback and dividends. We just feel at the levels of the stock today and the strength of the balance sheet and quite
frankly, the strength of the businesses that it's a good time to be buying.
You can see that we continued to buy through the end of the quarter, up about $500 million on top of the $1 billion that
we did in the quarter. We have about $3.5 million remaining on the current authorization and we're really not in a
position, at this point, to make any broader statement about a change in capital policy. We've always been supportive of
returning capital to shareholders and we have had a bias and will continue to have a bias to step up more heavily when

the markets provide a good opportunity.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: And Simona, this is Steve. On your second question, I think it was really – if you think
about the mix, it was a little bit – look at the June quarter, probably a little weaker on the premium tier and it was offset
by some strengths at the emerging accounts tier. We have forecasted a similar trend going into September, which is
essentially a little bit less premium. Of course, it's always – that's always a weird quarter to predict sometimes because
of the importance of the flagship launches. So I think you're probably seeing a little bit of just the – maybe a lull before
we see flagship devices launch.
Now we do have a fair bit of investment in the business as George mentioned. We continue to invest quite heavily
actually in the modem and in the – those areas of innovation that Paul mentioned in his prepared remarks. We think
we're actually very well positioned at the premium tier moving forward. And we consider ourselves to be really
differentiated there. So we're continuing to drive that in the business and we think it will pay off long-term.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Matt Hoffman from Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Matthew L. Hoffman>: Steve, strong ASPs were certainly one of the positives here in the quarter. So since the
company highlighted the Snapdragon 800 in the release, can we assume that's the product which is really driving those
chip ASPs up so sharply? I guess it was up 8% sequentially in the June quarter. And also if you could comment on mix
moving forward. Thanks.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Sure. With the chip ASPs, really the 800 has really hasn't launched yet, actually. We're
anticipating over the next two quarters to start to see some exciting devices come out of the 800, but that really hasn't
started launching yet. What we saw in the June quarter was really more of a mix toward, relative to our expectation, as
I said a little bit less premium, a little bit more emerging markets. And we did have some improvements in gross
margin, primarily in the cost area.
<Q - Matthew L. Hoffman>: Okay. So as you start to bring your mix back toward more than modems and some of the
high-end smartphone guys bringing their shipments back up in the back half of the calendar year, do ASPs continue to
move up?
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Well, I think we forecasted, excuse me, as George mentioned the – that to be flat and
really what you see in our product line, because there's such a big mix difference or there's a big difference in ASP
between the premium devices and the mid-tier and low tier devices, that can change a lot, actually, based on the mix
moving forward.
Now in the holiday season, as I think is behind your question, you tend to see more flagship launches and you tend to
see more premium devices launch as well, same thing following Mobile World Congress in the first half of the calendar
year as well. So we'll see how that plays out, but we think we're well positioned in terms of design wins. It's just a
question of what happens.
Operator
Tavis McCourt from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Tavis C. McCourt>: A couple of questions. First on the license ASP reported this quarter of roughly $230 at the
midpoint. I guess it's a little surprising to me that the – we're talking about a March quarter here which I would think
would have a lower mix of flagship smartphones relative to a December quarter, and yet the ASP was up quite a bit. Is
it just that the China low end or emerging market, low end market was so strong in that December quarter that it caused
your ASPs to come down that $10 or so when you reported March?

<A - Derek K. Aberle>: So, I think – this is Derek. I think we highlighted during the last call that we're starting to see
a little more volatility in the quarter-over-quarter ASP changes, and we indicated our belief was that we were going to
see an upward movement in the ASP this quarter, which is in line with what happened. It was actually a little stronger
than what we expected. But really that came from strength in both developed and emerging regions, as Steve noted in
his remarks. In developed, I think we started to see an increasing mix this quarter of devices at the mid and high tier,
while at the same time the prices within those tiers remaining relatively stable. And there were actually some new
launches within the quarter, the March quarter.
And then in emerging regions I think it's much of the same story in developed, meaning we have an increasing
percentage of devices going into the mid and high tier, but also I think an acceleration more so than we expected of
feature phones moving over to smartphones. And as we've pointed out in the past, the ASP uplift, when moving from
feature phones even to the lower tier smartphones, is quite meaningful. So we're continuing to see upward movement in
the emerging region ASPs, so really all of those things came together to get us where we ended up this quarter.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long from BMO Capitals. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Tim Long>: Two related ones on chips here. First, I think, Steve, you mentioned that the gross margin was up a
little in the June quarter due to some cost savings there. Just give us a sense on kind of what's the strategy for pricing.
We still see some pretty aggressive competition in Asia, given that gross margins for this business have come down
meaningfully in the last two years. Do we think we're bumping along a level where we're not likely to see gross
margins any lower?
And then Steve, a second one. Just maybe you could just talk a little bit about, there's a lot out there lately on
benchmarking of different chips and it's been a pretty controversial topic, so we'd just love your take on how we should
look at kind of comparing a lot of these new chips and new features out there. What's the best way for us to look at how
companies will be successful? Thanks.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Okay, Tim, so on the pricing side, as I mentioned in my remarks, we saw some – I think
some sequential strength in the emerging accounts, and we're probably up 35% quarter-over-quarter there.
That – those products for us really fall into two buckets though. We do quite well from a margin as well as a units
perspective kind of at the performance tier of the emerging accounts, and I think one of the misconceptions is that that's
all just at the bottom. It's not. A lot of the OEMs there are trying to build both a brand as well as volume.
Now in the very low tier, it is a very, very aggressive time period. It's really the 2G-to-3G conversion market, and it's
quite aggressive. We are continuing to price aggressively there. Quite frankly, we don't have the best cost structure at
that time. We're working to improve that, so we hope that that will improve over time. But we're pleased because we
think, although our units are growing, they still have further to go. And my guess is that our revenue share is probably
pretty strong, certainly stronger than our unit share in that area.
Remember too that we don't participate really in China Mobile yet, which is the largest carrier in the region and
certainly the largest carrier in the world So we look at that and we say there's an opportunity there for us to grow the
business, and we look forward to it. That being said, a very competitive market as you know.
With respect to benchmarks, good question. Actually I'm glad you asked. What's interesting about it is, I think there's
probably a little bit – I don't know the right word, but basically I think it's a little bit dubious, the way that some of
those benchmarks have led to certain conclusions and then other conclusions.
But at the end when we look at the results, we conclude that we're definitely in the lead there. More importantly
though, when we look at our position at the OEM base and in the near term or even the midterm, we're quite confident
about how we fit. And I think it comes down from the fact that we think we have the best technology across all of the
vectors that matter, but most importantly we have it together. We have the ability to put multiple things into one SoC,

and I think that's served us quite well. And we expect that to serve us quite well moving forward.

Mike Walkley from Canaccord, please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mike Walkley>: Thanks, Steve. I just want to go back to the margins, and clearly there are some high-end
platforms that, uncertain timing, you're ramping some R&D ahead of that. But maybe on an intermediate term basis,
you've grown content share with both some chipsets that aren't MSM-related helping you grow your content and
they've tended to be lower margins also. Can you just share with us, kind of an intermediate term, how we should think
about the margins as you invest for more content share opportunities versus maybe a longer-term operating margin plan
you want to execute against?
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Sure, maybe I can provide a little bit of color, and then George I think probably could
also jump in here as well. We look at our business right now, and we definitely don't subscribe to the view that the high
tier is going away in terms of innovation. In fact, if you look at the speed at which we're being asked to cycle through
chipsets, I would argue that it's actually accelerating in terms of feature velocity. So we're driving that. We think that's
a competitive strength for us. We also believe that, moving forward over the next couple of years, that will be really the
thing that determines profitability, is driving that tier, and we think we have the ability to do that.
That being said, today we're – I would say we're probably at a point where we have some additional R&D because
we're moving through the process nodes faster than is traditional in our business, and the complexity of doing that has
actually increased. But we think that scale is actually a differentiator for us. So we're continuing to do that. We'll
probably – you'll see us over the years not have to do that, and we hope that that makes it easier for us from a business
perspective, but maybe George can comment a little bit on the other question.
<A - George S. Davis>: Yeah. Mike, hi. The outlook for the margin is, for the full year obviously, is right in line with
where we started the year overall, so the concern about something having changed in the marketplace that is driving a
change in our outlook is, I think, exacerbated a little bit by the fact that we're looking at seasonal quarters here in terms
of margin. So we'll update the longer-term outlook at the November meeting. And again, I think concerns about further
erosion in margin are really overplayed.

Brian Modoff from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Yeah. Hi, guys. So Steve, a couple of questions. One, just if you can elaborate a little bit on what
you think your share is in the China market?
When do you see the impact – you've had TDD LTE in your devices for a little bit of time, so when do you start seeing
the impact from that?
And then can you talk a little bit about your midrange LTE chips coming into the market, the timing on that, and how
you see kind of a, more of a midrange lineup of LTE devices impacting overall LTE volumes as we move into next
year, particularly as some of your competitors try to bring competing products to the market, albeit later than they may
have thought?
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Okay, Brian. Yeah, on the share side of the China market, it's interesting. When we
look at where we really compete, we really compete – we don't support an EDGE product, we don't support a low-tier
TD-SCDMA product. We think that that – by the time that we would have that out, that market will transition to LTE
and really intercept with the rest of our product line.

So if you just look at kind of where we compete, we're quite pleased actually with how we've been able to develop what
is essentially a new channel for us. All of those units that I mentioned that were sequentially strong, those are new
customers, customers that we wouldn't normally deal with. And I think we're intercepting those customers, but at the
same time that we're also getting, I think, the premium SKUs that are coming in that market. So we're actually fairly
pleased with how we're doing there from a share perspective, and probably more pleased from a revenue dollars
perspective.
But the part that we're most excited about is that, when that business, when the China market starts to go toward LTE,
which we think will start at the second half of this calendar year with the start of the trial, we'll be positioned even
better because that will really intercept our tiered roadmap from the 800 all the way down to some new products that
we haven't announced, but we're clearly working on in that tier. So we look at that as a disrupter for us.
The other aspect which we think will be a good thing for us is that a lot of the big OEMs that have started to build their
name through the transition to smartphones in China, domestic OEMs, are looking to go international. And we have,
we think, a good onramp for them to drive their international business.
So as you may know, if you look at our product lines, one of the big advantages we have is that we have all of the band
support. And that enables you to design a product in China and use that other places in the world, which we think is
going to be something that's good for us to be able to intersect a number of the other OEMs that we haven't been strong
in heretofore.

Ehud Gelblum from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead with your question.
<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: Hi. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Question for clarification, George. Did I hear you correctly
that at the end there that the QCT op margin you're guiding to 16% to 17%, so down in the fiscal fourth quarter? I just
want to make sure, just clarification that I heard that right.
<A - George S. Davis>: That is correct.
<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: Okay. And I guess that has to do with mix?
<A - George S. Davis>: Correct.
<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: And the lull before flagship the way Steve talked about it. Okay.
<A - George S. Davis>: Exactly.
<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: Steve, and maybe this is actually a combination between the two of you. What's the time
between when you recognize revenue on a chip and you call it an actual shipment and the time when the phone ends up
in a store? So if I say a phone is going to – I walk into a store and that phone shows up there for the first time
tomorrow, when did you actually ship that chip? I'm just trying to get a sense as to the timing with respect to the
difference from there.
And then I ask this every quarter, but is there any way you can give us a sense as to the chips that you ship into phones
that are LTE phones, used as LTE phones versus ones that are non-LTE phones? If you can take the 172 million chips,
give us a sense as to what percent of the modems on those 172 million are used for LTE? Although probably many
more of them are capable of LTE, but how many of them are actually in LTE phones versus not?
And the same thing for Snapdragon versus thin modem? And give us a sense of the ASP differential between those two
so we can in our head model out what we think may happen with MSM revenue for – ASP per MSM chip?
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Ehud, this is Steve. On the timing question, it's pretty difficult. It varies from customer
to customer. And I apologize, I actually don't know even the range. But with some customers, they have the ability to

move very, very rapidly. Other customers, through their manufacturing, they may have a more complicated
manufacturing process and other subcontractors, what have you, and it may take them longer. So I don't have a great
sense as to what – how long that would take for them to have sell-through. Maybe some of my other colleagues could –
perhaps could comment.
But on the LTE mix, I also don't have that mix right now. I think we could probably provide some color in New York
about that. I would say directionally we're doing quite well in LTE and it's clearly moving very rapidly throughout our
portfolio. But we're also selling, allowing customers or enabling customers to sell that same device in non-LTE markets
as well. I just don't know the mix between those two.

Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two quick ones. Firstly, around your
guidance for next quarter, you said that there was uncertainty around the timing of the flagship devices in that. Can you
give us some feeling of what is actually baked into the guidance in terms of how conservative or not you might be on
that timing?
Second question around, again, the capital allocation and the buybacks. So you've bought more than $10 billion in
stock back over the last five years. Your share count is actually up over that time. You said you're waiting for the
markets to provide a good opportunity. Your valuation right now is lower than it ever has been. Why is right now not
the best opportunity to do maybe a much bigger buyback than you've done historically?
<A - George S. Davis>: So let's start with Q4 first. I think what you're seeing with Q4 is even though we're calling for
MSMs to be up, if you look at our view of pricing, it's suggesting that mix is going to be impacted by some of the
emerging market volumes, more than the flagship volumes. So I think that's what we're talking about in terms of
conservatism.
So, but if you think about where we came in on MSMs in Q3 which was well ahead of our guidance, Q3 and Q4
together look actually quite good. And Q4 is a very similar, overall in terms of the business for both QTL and QCT. It's
really some of the higher spending eroding a little bit of the strong performance that we saw in Q3, but still very strong
performance overall.
On the capital allocation front, no, we do agree it's a good time to be buying stock and that's why we are – we've
ramped significantly the repurchase activity and it's continuing into Q4. As I said, we have $3.5 billion outstanding. We
don't forecast our share repurchase activity, but as Paul said in his own quote, we're confident in the business and we'll
continue to return capital consistent with that view. So we'll stay in contact on that.
Operator
Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse, please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. A question for Steve, I guess. Steve, a lot of things went – have gone right this
year so far on QCT, whether it's flagship high-end share gains, your LTE position is definitely coming through, your
ASPs are very high in the QCT business. And there are lots of reasons you've given, but I understand them in terms of
pricing and whatnot, but they're just not leveraging QCT. So I'm curious, as you look out over the next medium term,
would you think this is an acceptable level of margin for that business? I'm just curious how you see it because I would
have thought this year of all years, especially with the revenue growth you saw, there would have been a bit more
leverage. It seems that there's basically not. And so, can you speak a little bit about that dynamic?
And a question for Derek, I guess, on the licensing business. It's quite clear in this last quarter especially that MediaTek
and Spreadtrum and the like have seen very strong sequential and year-on-year volume increases, selling chips to the

extreme low end of the smartphone market, I would say. Is the – is your ability to license them there? And if so, your
volume number for the overall addressable market just seems a little bit conservative, so I'm just kind of curious as to
how you would reconcile that dynamic? Thanks.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Kulbinder, this is Steve. A quick answer to your question on op margin target, now we
actually would expect that business to do better, and our plans are to make that happen. I think one of the things that,
when I listen to people talk about the competitive environment that probably is a difference between our outlook and
what other people see, is that today it's already very competitive. I mean, if you look at the market structure, we
essentially compete in Samsung against Samsung, and that – and we do quite well. And so, I don't think there's a much
more competitive dynamic than that dynamic, and we do, I think, quite well in that environment.
That being said, we believe that the investments that we're making, and really it is our level of spending that I think is
probably the easiest lever to deal with. That level of spending, we think, is creating technology distance between what
our roadmap is providing and what I think other people can get by doing their own chipsets. And if you just look at
over the last several years how much we've started to, at least in our minds, move ahead from the competition, both on
an integrated scale but also individual technology vectors, we think that will play well to our strengths moving forward
and there will be more leverage in the business moving forward.
We're also not seeing additional markets, most of it being tablet market in the revenue line, but it's clearly in the cost
line. Now I think it's too early to make a call on that, but your outlook on that business I think also has a big lever in
terms of what will happen long-term.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Kulbinder, this is Derek. Yeah, on your second question, I think we've been pretty transparent
that we're continuing to grow the licensing base, and I think we went up another 10 licensees this quarter. Most of that
growth has continued to come from China. So we feel very confident that we are collecting under our agreements and
that we have the main customers of MediaTek and Spreadtrum and others, as well as even the mid and smaller
customers licensed and paying.
The one exception that we have discussed a number of times is TD-SCDMA, and I think that may be driving a little bit
of the difference in the numbers that you're seeing versus the numbers that we're reporting to you as royalty-bearing
units. And as you know, we've had some difficulties collecting on TD-SCDMA in China.
This year in particular, we've seen pretty meaningful growth in TD-SCDMA units in China and so as we go forward,
that's having sort of a muted impact on the growth overall of the units reported to us. But as I look ahead, our
expectation is though, as China Mobile launches LTE, that a significant portion of that volume will start to, fairly
quickly, transition over to including LTE and or UMTS and that will provide a basis for us to collect royalties on those
devices. Hopefully without the same types of challenges we've had historically around TD-SCDMA. So that would
drive accelerated growth year-over-year when you start looking out into 2014 and 2015 from a unit standpoint.

Mark McKechnie from Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mark McKechnie>: Thanks. Couple questions. One for Steve. How big has your connectivity business grown
to? And maybe you could talk a bit about the attach rates of MSMs versus how many standalone connectivity solutions
you have?
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Sure, Mark. If you look at our business, the connectivity business, I mentioned earlier
that it was actually a record quarter in June for it. And now it's also not just a cellular connectivity business. It includes
consumer electronics. There's networking in that as well. So it's actually a little bit more diversified than probably what
people think.
Now that being said, on the phone side, we've been, I think, done a good job in terms of getting pull through for our
connectivity solutions either through integrated or through standalone on our mid-tier and low-tier platforms. I gave

some comments last year actually about how strong that was in terms of attach rate.
What we're starting to see and one of the things we're excited about, is that now we're starting to see Tier 1s start to use
the products. And we think that's an onramp, one of the necessary or first steps to getting us into the flagship devices as
well. That'll be – I think it's a long road to – ahead of us on that. But we see the first signs of success there.
We also believe that our integration story, which has served us well with RF, power management, Bluetooth and GPS
will also serve us well in the connectivity space as well. So we're continuing to invest in that area. We're bullish about
it long-term.

Romit Shah from Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Steve, you mentioned that your share of content improved in the quarter is a factor driving
chipset ASPs up. I know that it's coming down a little bit here in the September period. But can you just give us more
color on what's driving that and would you expect chipset ASPs to continue to grind higher after this period?
I also – I just wanted to also ask about LTE competition. Broadcom indicated yesterday that their LTE solution would
be pushed out to the second half of next year. So your assessment of the competitive landscape and how big of a lead
do you guys think you have today?
And then just finally for George, you mentioned on the buyback, that you were going to be – you guys were being
opportunistic here in July. The stock price feels like it's been out of favor for most of the year. So I'm just curious, what
was it or what are you guys seeing here in July that pushed you to be more opportunistic with the share buyback?
Thank you.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Romit, maybe I'll start with the LTE question first. I think that's probably an accurate
view of what we're seeing. I mean, if we look at our feedback from the OEMs, it seems like we don't see anyone
knocking on the door, the near term door with the feature set that we're already delivering. As you know, we are on our
third generation, and we're going to continue to move that forward into next year. So it looks like people are having
trouble ramping this year or last year's feature set. And we're going to be delivering next year's feature set next year. So
we think we're continuing to be strong in the LTE space.
I would point people to the importance of an SOC strategy in LTE and essentially that's – in the flagship tier, you need
to be able to deliver solutions in the developed world. The developed world because of spectrum constraints, really
needs to embrace LTE-Advanced next year. And should you be able to produce a product like that, and compete with
us on the modem space, you will also need to do that in an integrated SOC, which means that you need to make sure
that you have a world-class application processor in connectivity and graphics. And we think we're differentiated across
all of those vectors. And certainly if you put them together, we feel quite strong.
On the first question, I actually forgot what it was. Could you remind me, please?
<A - Warren Kneeshaw>: Share of content...
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Oh, share of content. Yes. Thank you. On share of content essentially what's happened,
we're growing our position in the phone. As I mentioned on previous calls, sometimes that comes at less gross margin
percentage than our traditional modem business, but it comes at more dollars and it's a good growth business for us as
you've seen in the year-over-year numbers, so you're seeing some of that.
We also, from time to time are able to collect essentially value-added software fees for additional functionality that we
can sell alongside the chip. You start to see that sometimes move around from quarter-to-quarter.
So all in all I think a strong story for us, although, from a dollar perspective but not at the traditional gross margin
percentages that you saw in the traditional modem business, but a good business for us.

<A - George S. Davis>: Let me just cover your question on – again, on share buyback. What I talked about when I was
using the term opportunistic, it was really in response to the question that the company has valued an opportunistic
strategy over time and I still believe that to be the case. The decision to start purchasing in Q3 was clearly coming out
of the earnings call, the stock reacted and came down and we felt it was an extremely attractive time to start buying
back shares. So it kind of goes beyond opportunistic and really a view of valuation and, again, I think you can see from
the outlook, and from the performance in the quarter that the company is performing strongly and we think it's a good
time to be buying.

Rod Hall from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Yeah. Thanks for getting me in, guys. Just a couple of questions. So I wanted to see, Steve, if you
could comment again. I mean the question that was asked earlier on Wi-Fi, there have been some various blog reports
and so on suggesting that you guys have had some pretty good size Wi-Fi wins for standalone chips with some big
vendors. And I just wonder if you could comment on whether there's been anything, you know, I think the basic
situation has been that the underlying driver software favored another large vendor that kind of dominates that space
and that's why we hadn't seen as much attach. I wonder if you could comment on whether there's been any change
there. Do you think there are more software support now that might enable people to use the onboard Snapdragon
connectivity solution as we move forward more? So, I'd just be curious to get your comment on that.
And then the other thing that I'd like to get you guys to comment on, we've got these new replacement programs
coming out from U.S. carriers and there's a lot of speculation over whether that means people replace less or replace
more. I just wonder if you could comment on your thinking there. Do you think it would impact consumer behavior at
all? And if so, how does it impact it? Thanks.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Rod, this is Steve. On the connectivity piece, essentially the – we've been working quite
hard to bring both the maturity and the feature set of our wireless LAN solution up to what would be considered a
leadership position. We think we're at that point now. We've been able to also exploit one of the benefits of our
platform which essentially is that we've had the 11ac- or n solution which is the 3660 and it's pin for pin compatible
with the 3680. So I think it's been somewhat of misunderstood but we're actually at the lead in terms of mobile ac and
it's a very easy migration for people to have.
So we do, I think, quite well at the mid-tier in terms of design win percentages and I think that's a great on-ramp to
convince people that at the flagship tier can be used as well. And as I said earlier those things won't switch overnight
but I think the integration story is quite strong on this technology as it is with many technologies. It's just the right thing
to move the customer in that direction.
The other thing to remember as well, is that eventually the modem, the wireless WAN modem and the wireless LAN
model actually have to coordinate to manage interference and manage off load in a very, you know, coordinated way.
That particularly becomes important as networks get more dense. So over time, the good technical reasons of
integration are augmented by just that's the way the system's going to need to work to be successful. So that's a good
trend for us.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Rod, this is Derek. Obviously it's early days and we'll have to see how some of these new
programs play out, but I think our view is generally positive that they should have a positive impact on replacement
cycles. There's been some concern about whether operators are going to step back a bit from subsidies, and given the
smartphone penetration that is in some of the developed regions. And I think we're going to see – I believe we'll
continue to see a number of different kinds of programs that will help drive replacement.
If you look at AT&T, I think they just announced results and they said 35% of their smartphone users are on LTE,
which is still relatively low. And yet they're seeing higher data usage across the LTE subscribers, so you would think
that the operators will continue to be motivated, even with smartphone penetration where it is, to drive replacement

cycle. So we'll see how these play out, but I think generally a positive development.

James Faucette from Pacific Crest, you may go ahead with your question.
<Q - James E. Faucette>: One quick question and then a more elaborate question, I guess, on China. First, the quick
question is that you mentioned that you would expect channel inventories to come down during the course of the
September quarter, even though you expect them to remain in their typical range. Can you just talk about quickly where
you think channel inventories, or how big you think channel inventories developed, during the June quarter?
And then on China, you mentioned that you expect to start to ramp into China Mobile for their testing later this quarter
and through the end of this year. How are you thinking about the actual activation of the commercial network for
TD-LTE and its timing, and what about the other carriers and their eventual move to 4G? And how do you think about
the chipset share opportunity on those migrations? Thank you very much.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: So on channel inventory, the channel inventory peaked in our second fiscal quarter or
the first calendar quarter in the 15- to 16-week range. And we saw it come down about a week in our fiscal third
quarter, and we think it will come down at least another week and a half or so in our fourth fiscal quarter, so a pretty
continuous decline since the peak of Q2.
And with respect to LTE in China, we're being driven quite hard to start supporting what our, I think, very large-scale
trials at the end of this year. And also, as I understand it, the spectrum situation and the – from the government
perspective, has been a lot more clarity given over the last month or so with respect to that. So we expect that to start in
the second half of this year, and then I would expect the other carriers to follow. I think it will start in LTE TDD in
China Mobile and then follow in the other carriers. But again, it's very difficult to predict what happens in China, but
we are being pushed hard in that direction.
