Thomas A. Fanning
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. 2015 was
a tremendous year for Southern Company, as we continued to see outstanding performance in our franchise operations.
We saw strong financial performance from both our wholesale subsidiary Southern Power and our traditional operating
companies. Our state regulated utilities delivered these 2015 results despite the warmest December in the last 120
years.
We continued our longstanding tradition of operational excellence once again ranking among the best in our industry
for customer satisfaction and solidifying our reputation as one of the most trusted energy providers in America. We
experienced great success with strategic initiatives as both Southern Power and our traditional operating companies
continue to build the energy portfolio of the future with significant expansions of their renewable energy resources.
And in our ongoing quest to deliver superior risk adjusted long-term growth, we entered into an agreement to acquire
AGL Resources and create a platform from which we expect to compete for growth more broadly across the energy
value chain.
Now, regarding AGL Resources, I will just briefly add that activities related to the proposed merger are progressing in
a timely fashion. The waiting period under the HSR Antitrust Improvements Act expired in late 2015, a necessary
milestone for closing the transaction. In addition, AGL Resources' shareholders voted in November to approve the
merger. The merger remains subject to certain other customary closing condition including state regulatory approvals.
And we are currently engaged in regulatory proceedings before the various state commissions. The transaction is
expected to close in the second half of 2016.
In a few moments, Art will discuss the drivers of our financial performance in more detail and provide guidance for
2016. Before that, however, I will address the progress we've experienced with our major construction projects at Plant
Vogtle and in Kemper County, Mississippi. First, an update on the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. As reported in our last
quarterly call, we agreed to a settlement with our contractors for the two new units at Plant Vogtle. We have now
finalized that settlement and the related litigation has been dismissed.
As a reminder, this $350 million settlement resolves all outstanding commercial issues for the project and amends our
EPC agreement to provide even greater protections for customers. The settlement affirms and provides incentives for
anticipated fuel load dates in December 2018 and 2019, as well as our expected in-service dates in June 2019 and 2020.
In a related transaction, Westinghouse acquired the nuclear construction arm of Chicago Bridge & Iron. This move
positions Westinghouse and its affiliates as the primary contractor under our EPC agreement. And they have engaged
with Fluor to provide day-to-day construction leadership. We have worked very closely with the contractors through
this transition, and I'm pleased to say that thus far, we are very encouraged by the improved communication and
efficiencies we have observed on-site.
On January 21, Georgia Power filed an application for review of this settlement with the Georgia PSC. Yesterday, the
PSC made an approved a motion asking Georgia Power to file further information within the next 60 days pertaining to
the prudence of the project to-date, as well as the current schedule and cost forecast. Other interested parties will have
an opportunity to make filings of their own in response. This will allow the PSC to consider the settlement agreement
in the context of a more comprehensive review of the full project cost and schedule.
The Commission staff, which will not make any separate filings, will have six months to analyze these filings. If the
staff identifies any issues of imprudence or unreasonableness, they are directed to work with Georgia Power toward a

possible settlement of any such issues within that same six-month period. During this six-month period, there will be no
hearings. If there is a settlement between the company and the staff, Georgia Power and the Commission staff will file
that for the Commission to consider in the fall. If the parties do not come to a settlement, the Commission will decide
how to proceed.
Let's turn now to an update on the Kemper County facility. The combined cycle performed exceptionally well in 2015,
providing over one-third of the electricity consumed by Mississippi Power customers last year. Major start-up activities
are ongoing, and we continue to transition to operational testing. Fluidization trials on the first of two gasifiers are
complete, and we were able to begin the cure out process for gasifier refractory. The fluidization process was an
important validation of the scale-up of the technology as the operators were able to use the control system to circulate
sand and air at design flow rates through the gasifier, a good rehearsal for the eventual introduction of lignite to the
operation.
The team is currently working to repair a portion of the refractory on the first gasifier and making improvements to all
of the nozzles in the refractory lining of both gasifiers to address hot spots identified during the initial cure out process
for the first gasifier. The type of work to repair and improve the refractory lining is similar to the refractory
replacement that will be a common part of the plant's long-term maintenance. However, these activities are time
intensive and they are the primary driver for our schedule extension into the third quarter of 2016.
As always, quality and safety are our top priorities as we are taking steps to help ensure that Mississippi Power's
customers will enjoy the benefits of a reliable source of low-cost energy for decades to come. We expect to introduce
lignite to Gasifier A this spring. This critical step is the beginning of the important process of integrating all of the
various systems of the facility.
In December, the Mississippi Public Service Commission unanimously approved rates for the combined cycle assets
already in service. Mississippi Power plans to seek recovery of the remaining assets after they are placed into service.
Art will now provide a financial update, including an outlook for 2016 and beyond.
Arthur P. Beattie
Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials released this morning, we had solid results
for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year 2015.
For the fourth quarter of 2015, we earned $0.30 per share compared to $0.31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
For the full year 2015, we earned $2.60 per share compared to $2.19 per share in 2014, an increase of $0.41 per share.
Excluding certain adjustments listed in the earnings materials, earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were
$0.44 per share and $2.89 per share respectively, compared with $0.38 per share and $2.80 per share respectively for
the same periods in 2014.
As Tom mentioned earlier, our adjusted annual result of $2.89 was just above the top of our 2015 guidance range we
established a year ago. The major earnings drivers when compared to our $2.80 adjusted result for 2014 were
residential and commercial sales growth, retail revenue effects, and tremendous success with renewable projects at
Southern Power. These positive drivers were partially offset by increased shares, higher depreciation, operation and
maintenance costs, and weather. A more comprehensive list of drivers is included in the materials we released this
morning.
Moving now to an economic and sales review of 2015. The economy within our region continues to experience modest
growth. Favorable domestic market fundamentals include strong employment growth that have served to underpin
consumer confidence and spending. At the same time, the effects of the strong dollar, low commodity prices, and
economic weakness abroad have combined to constrain manufacturing growth in our region.
Total weather-adjusted retail sales grew by 0.3% in 2015, led by commercial sales which were up almost 1% for the
year. We experienced positive growth for the commercial sales in every quarter in 2015, which we have not seen since

before the recession. Weather-adjusted residential sales grew by 0.4% during 2015. Growth in the residential sector has
been fueled largely by customer growth as the Southeast continues to see positive in-migration. More than 37,000 new
residential customers were added in 2015, an increase from 2014 when we added some 31,500 new customers.
Industrial sales fell by 0.3% in 2015. We experienced a modest deceleration in industrial growth in our region as a
result of the strong dollar, low oil price and natural gas prices, and significant economic slowdown in China and other
emerging markets. We have seen the impact of these factors on three of our largest industrial segments: primary metals,
chemicals, and paper. However transportation and housing-related industries have supported growth, and we expect
those segments to continue to do well in 2016.
Economic development activity remains robust and consistent with previous quarters' activities. Job creation and
capital investment for 2015 exceeded 2014 levels, and the pipeline of potential projects grew significantly compared to
recent years. Corporate announcements and potential projects represent a broad cross-section of industries including
automotive, primary and fabricated metals, aerospace, and chemical segments. Also within our region, Alabama was
named the top state for economic development by Business Facilities Magazine, and Georgia has been ranked first for
business climate by Site Selection magazine for the third consecutive year.
Despite economic headwinds from overseas, our regional economy remains in a positive growth mode. During our
most recent economic roundtable, the consensus of the participants was that the economy will grow in 2016 supported
by robust employment and spending growth, modest income gains, and a steady housing recovery, all pointing to
further growth in energy demand. Our sales growth guidance for 2016 is 1.1% for retail sales, 1.2% for residential
sales, and 1% for both commercial and industrial sales.
Before we cover the details of our capital expenditure forecast, financing plan and earnings per share guidance, I'd like
to speak to the impact of the recent extension of tax benefits on our financial outlook. We currently project that a
five-year extension of bonus depreciation will improve cash flows by approximately $4 billion through 2020, and
potentially more assuming Southern Power is able to execute on its growth plan. This translates to a significant uplift in
the value of the enterprise.
Over the next few years, some of the biggest tax benefits are expected to be generated by Plant Ratcliffe, Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4, along with a variety of renewable energy projects and environmental compliance investments.
Considering our customer-focused business model, this is very good news. All else being equal, our customers should
benefit from lower retail rates over time. In addition to the implied reduction in regulatory risk, we expect to enjoy
reduced exposure to both debt and equity capital markets over the next several years.
Perhaps the greatest benefit of all these tax benefits is the level of cash flow support we project for our common
dividend. Of course, dividend policy is ultimately subject to the approval of our board of directors. But our expected
cash coverage of dividends is greatly improved compared to how we characterized our dividend growth at the time of
the AGL Resources merger announcement. We fundamentally believe that value is a function of risk and return. Given
the magnitude of the dollars and the high degree of certainty inherent in these deductions, Southern Company's value
proposition should be greatly improved.
We provided an updated forecast of capital expenditures for 2016 through 2018 in our slide presentation. This
stand-alone projection does not include AGL Resources. Anticipating continued success at Southern Power, we are
excited about the possibilities that exist with the extension of tax benefits for both wind and solar projects. We have
enjoyed a higher than anticipated growth from Southern Power in recent years. In fact, a year ago, our 2015 through
2017 CapEx forecast was approximately $3 billion. Today, based on our recent success, we estimate the same period to
be about $5 billion of investment for Southern Power. Going forward, we expect to sustain that same level of activity
and success. In fact, our Southern Power forecast for 2016 through 2018 includes CapEx of $5 billion for wind, solar,
and traditional natural gas generation projects.
Our CapEx forecast for our traditional operating companies does not include projects specific to the Clean Power Plan.
If our ultimate compliance plans require investment prior to 2019, our current CapEx projection could or would
increase. Our forecasted $1.8 billion investment in environmental compliance over the next three years is largely

associated with EPA's Effluent Guidelines and Final Coal Combustion Residuals Rule.
Included in the appendix of our slide deck are our projected financing plan, credit ratings, and a schedule of maturities
and a liquidity summary. Within our financing plan, you will note the anticipated debt issuances to fund the AGL
Resources merger. We expect these notes to be issued shortly before the closing of the acquisition and to include a
blend of maturities. Additionally, we are planning on a $1.2 billion in equity issuances in the calendar year 2016. As
discussed earlier, the extension of bonus depreciation is expected to reduce our exposure to the capital markets, and that
has resulted in a favorable impact to the remainder of our financing plan.
Considering the incremental cash flow along with our Department of Energy loan facility for Plant Vogtle construction
and an assumption that we will utilize securitized financing for a significant portion of Kemper, which is subject to
approval by the Mississippi Public Service Commission, our exposure to the debt markets for our traditional operating
companies over the next three years should be limited. Southern Power's debt financing needs will be driven largely by
their success in finding suitable projects to fill the placeholders in the CapEx forecast.
An additional benefit of the incremental cash flow from bonus depreciation is the effect on our need to issue new
equity. We currently project no additional equity issuances beyond the $1.2 billion in 2016. Financial integrity and
strong credit ratings have always been priorities for us, and that emphasis remains unchanged. Our financial outlook,
including our expected credit metrics in 2016 through 2018 has improved, and we continue to believe our credit profile
is fully supportive of our credit ratings.
Moving now to our earnings per share outlook. You'll recall that we began issuing new shares in the fourth quarter of
2015 under our internal equity programs, largely to fund the AGL transaction and to reinforce our commitment to
financial integrity. The cumulative effect of the shares issued in 2015, and projected for 2016 equates to a $0.06
dilutive impact on our standalone 2016 earnings per share.
In addition, the estimated impact of bonus depreciation is $0.04. But for the cumulative impact of these shares and
bonus depreciation, we would have been in the top half of our 3% to 4% standalone trajectory for 2016. Considering
these drivers, our standalone 2016 earnings per share guidance, excluding any cost to achieve the AGL Resources
merger, is $2.76 per share to $2.88 per share. Assuming the AGL merger closes later this year, our long-term earnings
per share growth outlook remains a range of 4% to 5%. In addition, our earnings estimate for the first quarter of 2016 is
$0.53 per share.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks
Thomas A. Fanning
Thanks, Art. As evidenced by our discussion today, 2015 was indeed a remarkable year for Southern Company, and we
enter 2016 with strong momentum. Our franchise business is performing at a high level, solidifying its industry
leadership. We see great progress on major capital projects with the completion of the Kemper County facility on a
near-term horizon, and Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 over 60% complete. We anticipate the addition of AGL Resources
later this year, and we see a stable economy in a region poised for continued growth.
Our cash flow and credit profiles are significantly improved, and we continue to project 4% to 5% long-term growth in
our business. With the strength of our 26,000 employees and their commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable, and
affordable energy to the customers and communities we are privileged to serve, we believe Southern Company is
well-positioned to succeed in the months and years ahead.
We are now ready to take your questions. Operator, we'll now take the first question.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: How are you?
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: I'm good. Thank you. First question for you, just on the load growth outlook, kind of, 2015
seemed maybe a little bit tougher than hoped and you look at the kind of the rally in 2016. Can you just...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: ...maybe share a little bit more what you're seeing, particularly on the residential side, that are
you seeing some usage gains, or what do you see kind of sprucing that up? And then kind of on the industrial front, it
doesn't seem like the world is getting a whole lot better, that the idea that that's going to bounce this year also?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: For residential, we're seeing a continued in-migration of customers. That's the big deal.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And we think that our projection of 1% is going to be driven largely by that. Interestingly,
through the work I see in the Fed, we see similarly here in terms of consumption. Consumption is kind of flattish. And
you're seeing that also in the Federal Reserve data as well. That's not all bad. There's this long-term dividend by cheap
oil, therefore cheap gasoline prices, cheap natural gas prices, always accruing to increase essentially the disposable
income of households throughout the Southeast. Interestingly, they're tending to increase their savings rate rather than
their consumption rate at that point. Not all bad, because that typically serves as an insulator against future economic
shocks. So that would be kind of my first comment.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah Dan, you asked about industrial. We commented about the three largest segments,
primary metals and chemicals and paper were down last year. We expect them to kind of be flattish this year. There are
still elements of strength in the primary metals group. I think if you look at automotive steel, there's still a good demand
for that. Architectural steel is actually doing pretty well to boot. And then in the automotive sector, automotive is – or
transportation is expected to expand, and we've got expansions going on at some of the customers in our jurisdiction.
Mercedes being one of those. There's model expansions as well, so we expect those numbers to actually do well next
year. And then the housing-related industries, primarily in Georgia, are expected to continue to grow, which is kind of a
reflection of the continued growth on the residential and commercial end.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: When I commented earlier this morning on Squawk Box about this, throughout 2015, as I
appeared in that forum, culminating in a December meeting I had with Dennis Lockhart there on set, it was interesting.
Our leading indicators started showing softening, our lagging indicators, commercial, were really good. And I had been
kind of bearish, particularly in the December telecast.
Our guide to a bottom-up forecast, and we've done this business round table discussion here in the Southeast with all
the economists of the major entities here. And based on a bottoms-up analysis, plus what we're seeing from the round
table here in the Southeast, we do expect these major industrial participants to start adjusting to this new reality and
improve their performance into the end of the year.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Got it. And I guess just the bonus depreciation cash is a pretty huge amount of money
coming back to you guys. Was there any way for some of that cash to offset the equity raise you guys needed at AGL?
And was that...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.

<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: ... so is there a way to mitigate down the numbers you guys gave when you announced the deal,
so maybe the equity position is going to be less than the $1.1 billion, or whatever that number was originally?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Let me take it through dumb math, and then we'll talk about how we attributed it here.
Dumb math. The number is going to be somewhere between $4 billion and maybe over $5 billion of cash. The $4
billion of cash that we talked about is really through 2020 and doesn't really assume that Southern Power executes its
growth plan, which we think they will. So the number could be higher maybe over a longer timeframe. So that's kind of
a source of cash.
When we look at the uses of cash over time, we got into an argument here internally about how to attribute the benefits
of that cash. So let's go through it, and let's just use the $4 billion number, although the number could be higher. We
had always assumed in our former financial plan, assuming we buy AGL, a $3 billion equity issuance over the
timeframe. We're going to do $4 billion in cash. If you just use a 40% equity ratio, 40% times $4 billion.
So if the cash retires a mix of capital requirement, the equity portion of that would be $1.6 billion. If the total amount of
equity was $3 billion and you don't have to issue $1.6 million now, that leaves you $1.4 billion to issue. When you look
at the uses of cash, we could go through a variety of ways to attribute these shares. But since the biggest issue of cash is
a near-term use and that is to acquire AGL. So we decided to allocate the new equity essentially to that project.
And so, if you think about it, $200 million issued in 2015, plus another $1.2 billion represents the balance of $3 billion
less $1.6 billion equals $1.4 billion. So that's really the simple math. Look Dan, we could have allocated the equity to
Southern Power. We could have taken a pro rata approach. This is just the way we decided to do it to keep the plans in
place through 2016.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. And I guess just one last question. Just, you know, that cash or the reduction in the other
rate-based growth because of bonus depreciation, there was enough room in the 4% to 5% earnings growth band that
that reduced rate based deployment is not going to work you guys down in the growth rate you had originally provided
in the fall?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, there's a give and a take there, right? Essentially the take is, yeah, sure, it reduces
growth. But the other side is, there's the benefit of excess cash and therefore less shares, as I just outlined with you,
$1.6 billion less equity raise over the same timeframe. And remember, part of this appropriations bill was not just
bonus depreciation, it was ITC and PTC. So you'll see a sustained Southern Power growth plan through this period, and
we think we're within that range. We're able to maintain it.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Got it. Thank you, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Steve.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Yeah, hi. Hey, Tom and Art. How are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Good.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Just wanted to kind of clarify something here. So, when you announced the AGL deal, I
think you said it was 4% to 5% growth off of your standalone 2015 base?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right.

<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: And the midpoint of that was $2.82. Now you're saying 4% to 5% growth off of your
2016 guidance, which is also still midpoint of $2.82. So if I go out and look at the future, like I'll look out to 2018, if
you just take the 4% to 5% define that way, what was going to be $3.22 by 2018 would essentially be $3.08? So could
you just be specific on what is the $0.14 difference between what you had said before and what you're saying now?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It's simply the shares associated with the preliminary issuance to support AGL plus the
estimated impact of bonus depreciation. Look, P/E times EPS is a shorthand for value. When you think about the
intrinsic value of Southern, we got bumped from the passage of this Bill an additional $4 billion to $5 billion and
perhaps more of cash. So when you look at the delta, the number is $ 0.04 here. That's how you get to $2.82, and we
grow off of that 4% to 5%. It is inescapable. And in fact, I would argue that the adjustment from a book standpoint is in
earnings per share, but the value adjustment is probably in the P/E ratio. If you do a DCF on Southern, we just
increased $4 billion to $5 billion just on cash from where we were before. So it takes $2.88 at 5%, $2.76 at 4%, and
that will be our growth trajectory going forward.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. And then in terms of...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Steve – hey bud, Steve, one more thing real quick.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Recall also, we talked about – of course this is all subject to the board approval, all of our
credit metrics are improved now. We got lots more cash, so all of our credit metrics are better. And when you look at
the dividend thing, if you want to do a Gordon Model approach evaluation, we're better off than we were. In other
words, we said given the earnings profiles and the growth rates and everything else, according to the board approval,
we'll pay an additional $0.07 in 2016, and then we would grow that to $0.08, okay? We're on the same trajectory,
assuming the board approves, and our cash flow metrics covering that dividend are somewhere between 20% better to
historical performance, around 10% better to what we thought it was when we announced the AGL deal. In other
words, our ability to pay the dividend because of this cash is enhanced relative to where we are, consistent with the
value proposition.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. Should I read that as this just supports better the higher dividend growth that you
talked about on the deal, or are you suggesting that there might be a chance to grow it even faster than you said?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Let's say at a minimum it supports the growth that we said before. We'll always evaluate it
year-to-year based on the board. But my point to you is, we're significantly better from a cash flow coverage and
dividend standpoint than we were before this thing. And so we're able – according the board approves, we're able to
maintain what we said before, and we're even better off from a credit standpoint.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: And that includes assumption of an increase.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And that included going from $0.07 to $0.08 in the increase.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's right. Yeah.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. So, I get that. It's just – okay. Okay. One other question just on the Georgia review.
Do you view this, I mean, the commentary about the commissioner seem to be constructive, so do you view this as an
opportunity to kind of go back to kind of getting a bit of a pre-prudence decision, because I know that was initially the
law, and then it kind of – you settled that away. And so there's an opportunity to do that, or is this – do you view this as
kind of a risk, or how should we interpret this review?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Steve, we think this is bullish. This is all associated with the settlement of the litigation.
And recall if you dial the numbers back around VCM 8, we decided not to pursue these courses, because we were in
front of litigation, and we didn't want to do all that. So the Commission felt, and you've seen a lot of public discourse
about this, that the settlement was good for everybody. The Commission is taking the lead in evaluating now, is this the

right time to pursue prudence? So we're following their lead. We'll prepare these exhibits in the next 60 days, and we'll
pursue this process as outlined by the Commission. But overall, we think this is very constructive.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. I'm sorry, I just want to go back one more time. So the difference in the future
earnings that we discussed, that is really all due longer term to the bonus depreciation not having as much rate base
because of that?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, that's right.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Obviously, that's offset by financing, but net-net, if that is the reason for the difference?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right. And we're going to maintain the – you know, you go through your Gordon
Model stuff.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We're going to maintain the trajectory of the dividends, so payout ratio is up, but cash
flow coverage of dividends is significantly higher.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Got t.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And as our growth rate goes from 4% to 5%, payout ratio comes down pretty quickly in
the years ahead. So all we're doing is maintaining with better credit posture what we said before.

Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey Anthony.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey. How are you?
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Never been better. How about yourself?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Awesome.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Just two real softball questions, I guess. One is on Kemper. You know, you had some, I
don't know, but you called it hot spots, so you had to, I guess cure the refractory.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: I mean is there a period where you get to where you're comfortable with now, the
gasifier, and I don't want to say out of the woods, but maybe the high cost or whatever, of trying to get this thing online
is past you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, and let's be very clear. What we're doing with the refractory is not high-tech. It
really involved finding some hot spots, looking at that, not only fixing what was there, but making an improvement to
both gasifiers. So we're taking the opportunity to once we get this thing up and running, it will run in a safe reliable
manner for years to come. So we took the opportunity to make improvement. These are not high-tech, nor are they
reasonably expensive. However, they are time intensive. Taking these steps right now, we think will benefit us
long-term. Unfortunately, they do add about two months to schedule. So that's what we have done.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The start-up process otherwise, as we were so excited, I guess the last time we spoke, the
fluidization test and the more technical tests have gone beautifully. So we're very kind of energized by the steady rate
of progress on start-up. Didn't like the delay, but we think that will serve us right in the long run.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: And just lastly, if I move to Southern Power, it seemed like, I don't want to say a perfect
storm, but you have maybe YieldCos or other companies that were investing in a lot of the projects that Southern
Power was also investing in. I mean, is there a lot more potential, you guys have a lot of cash, great cost of capital, that
Southern Power really just takes tremendous advantage of this downturn in the market and sees a lot more projects
open to them?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We're very excited about the opportunity for Southern Power in the next few years. We've
demonstrated our ability to execute like champions. We've developed terrific relationships with the people in the field.
Anthony, I think the first comment I want to make is, recall this $2 billion out-performance in capital deployment from
2015 through 2017, we think it's sustained from 2016 into 2018.
Now, I feel very confident we're going to be able to execute there. There's some wildcards out there. It will be fun to
see when gas starts re-emerging, okay? And so that could even accelerate beyond what we're showing right now. But
right now, I think we've got a good plan. We continue to execute in a very disciplined way, and we'll see what goes. I
have very kind of positive views about our ability to execute for Southern Power in the years ahead. And you know,
one other thing, we just moved Buzz Miller over there. He's a very talented guy, and I think we'll do great.

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go head
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Tom, how are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Awesome. How are you?
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Well, thank you. I just want to make sure I understand, you've got in your guidance the shares
to fund the acquisition, but no revenues from the acquisition?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's why basically they're excluded from kind of ongoing EPS. Exactly right.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: So when you're assuming the deal closes or you're just assuming it doesn't close in this year?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, no. Remember, remember the earnings profile of AGL says that it's front-end
loaded. All their earnings are in the first half of the year. They don't really earn very much in the second half of the
year. And so what I've been telling everybody is you shouldn't expect any contribution in 2016 out of AGL. And on a
standalone basis, as we suggested in the script, if you remove these kind of one-off items, we were in the high-end of
the 3% to 4% range. Now, when you bring AGL on, beginning in 2017 and beyond, we change our growth rate to 4%
to 5%. We feel very comfortable about that.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: And that includes AGL, obviously.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes. And that includes everything.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Right. 2016 doesn't include anything for AGL.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So remember AGL, plus the fewer shares, plus the growth rate of Southern Power gets us
back to the 4% to 5% that we told you we would do before. And we think even with a higher payout ratio as the book
EPS would suggest, the cash flow coverages allow us to pay that with even greater safety. We're in a better position on
the dividend than we were before when we announced AGL.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: So bonus D?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And then just back to your comments on Southern Power, should we look for you to kind of –
what's the right scale in your tax appetite for doing more renewables?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So I'll let Art kind of fill you in on that. We find ourselves, because of this excess cash
and tax benefit, in a carry-forward position. We've adjusted, we are adjusting our IRR requirements. We have this very
disciplined process we go through, particularly for the solar deals, and I'll let Art go through that. Unchanged probably
is our wind deals.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I think you just wrapped it up. It's just like you said, Paul, we're going to not be able to
monetize some of the investment tax credits quite as quickly as we had expected for solar. However, it's a little bit
different for wind, because production tax credits are spread over a 10-year period. So we'll still look at incremental
solar. We'll look at incremental wind, and we'll still apply a very disciplined process, as Tom talked about, to our
approach to every project.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And we talked to you before in October about, when we had a great backlog already in
2016. We think all those projects fit underneath our curves even as they are adjusted.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And then, Tom, I kind heard you in the background this morning on TV, but you didn't have
my undivided attention. I had a couple things going on. Can you just...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Come on, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: ...and I've been looking forward to a replay of it. But can you just kind of review your
comments you had about kind of a new age because of e-commerce or electronic data?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, yeah, it's fascinating stuff. We really do have a great team of economists here, and
we're just seeing this now in a broader sense. Here's the issue, we had talked historically about leading and lagging
indicators, and in fact I would argue our stuff is as good as anybody's in predicting the direction of the market. And
what we had been seeing historically is that industrial sales are the leading indicator. Even better than that is economic
development.
But let's just stay with industrial sales. They create jobs. They grow personal incomes that are above normal for the
Southeast. As we create jobs, people move in, they get those jobs, they get the higher incomes, they start consuming
more. That's residential. And then as more people move in, the commercial sector comes in, they do dry cleaners and
grocery stores and hospitals and schools.
Now, there is an emerging segment in the commercial class, so the commercial class is the lagging indicator, and it
matured really well during 2015. And so you say, is that a bearish signal? There is an emerging important segment in
commercial sales that really relate to the electrification of the economy. As the whole economy becomes more digital
in its composition, we're seeing, especially in the Southeast, the advent of data farms, of server farms, of IT
professionals. And these jobs are two times to three times higher than typically what would you see in a normal
commercial job like a restaurant or a school. These are really high-paying jobs and they don't have the kind of
correlation to industrial activity that you see typically from commercial to industrial.
And just as a supporting statistic, Georgia was just named the seventh fastest-growing state in the United States for
technology employment. This is a sustainable growth rate and doesn't have that correlation. So even if industrial starts
to take off and all that again, these guys are going to sustain, and we're very excited about that. The buying power, the

economic quality of this segment is really good.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And then your 1% forecast for industrial sales growth, that's just based on economic
development activity you expect to start taking root?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, plus I think even the people that had been damaged a bit by the downturn and the
malaise in international economies, and cheap oil, and the strong dollar, and all that, even there we're seeing these
people adjust to this new market reality. Let me give you a fun statistic there. Nationally, we're seeing United States
exporting down around 7%. In the Southeast, it was down only 2% and that really picked up at the end of the year. The
Savannah Port had a record year in terms of its activity.
So I think what we're seeing is some of these industries that had been hurt pretty bad, and maybe they're coming off a
low base, chemicals, primary metals, et cetera, now adjusting to this new reality.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, I agree with that.

Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Hey, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: I don't think that it's possible to patent a dividend discount model. I think that was already done
by someone else, but thanks. So a little bit more on this, the question of the visibility on the solar and wind stuff. I
understand, you said you're going to – because you – theoretically you're going to be able to monetize ITCs now over a
longer timeframe, your IRRs are higher.
Every other utility holding company is in the same boat, so if your marginal competitor for an incremental solar project
is just ConEd or Dominion or Duke, then you're all on the same boat and it doesn't really change the competitive
landscape. But if your marginal competitor is someone who is – got a similar credit rating and still has a tax appetite,
doesn't that put you at a theoretical disadvantage going forward in order to achieve your targets?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, sure. As you posited your question, yeah. But, and what we've already seen for the
projects that we've already circled for 2016, remember in October, I gave you great confidence about our ability to
execute 2016 in a similar manner. I think we're going to be able to do that. We already know that those projects meet
our hurdle rates even with the adjustments. And don't forget about the importance of relationships, our ability to close,
the fact that we've worked in joint development, if you will, for people to get power sales agreements that are suitable
to our risk return profiles.
And so, I think all this will work to our benefit. We don't see really any significant slowdown. I just wanted to let you
know that we were looking at the time value of the cash, but it doesn't make a substantial difference, to be honest with
you. I feel very bullish about our ability to execute the growth program.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Great. And I know that Steve asked this question a million different ways, and I come up
with a slightly less, you know, lower number in 2018 than he does, but semantics. Is it solely the impact of bonus
depreciation, all things equal, or are we also sort of seeing the compounding effect of slightly lower than expected sales
growth in terms of sort of earnings returns across the business as well?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It's all bonus.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, bonus lowers your growth rate. Improving your growth rate is going to be less

<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Last question...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Remember...
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Sorry. Go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, remember, we talked about $4 billion. I mean, I know we're conservative on all these
things, but if Southern Power executes its growth program, it's going to be more than $4 billion. It could be, in fact, a
little higher than $5 billion.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Got you. Last question, Georgia, you know, things look like they're going in a positive direction
in terms of them reviewing the settlement, them doing prudence. You also have a rate plan that you'll either get an
accounting order for again this year or go through a normal rate case process as you usually do when you roll these
things. Is that workload sort of theoretically like achievable by the Georgia Commission? It's just a lot of stuff for them
to get done this year, or should we expect some of this stuff to sort of roll into 2017 just by the sheer magnitude of what
they're trying to accomplish with three major approvals pending here, the settlements, the prudence review, and the rate
case?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, I mean, add to that, I think you know we're doing the Integrated Resource Plan. We
have VCM 14 filed in February to be done at whenever it is, July, August. And then we have VCM 15 in the middle of
the year. So if you think about it, we've got a lot of activity. And I know when they had the suggestion to go through
this process, the staff rates and the issues about workload. Look, we all get that. We have a history since really 1995 of
working very constructively with the staff and the Commission. And we'll find a way to balance the workload and
achieve good results for everybody. So it's a great point. Let's let the Commission figure that out, and we'll work with
them to get good results.

baking in there? Is there an offset to the bonus depreciation potentially with more solar ITCs?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, the problem is the bonus depreciation pushes out, stands in front of the monetization of
the ITCs. So the more solar you do, the more bonus you book kind of pushes out the equation a bit. But if you look at
2016 and 2017, it looks we'll be back into utilizing tax credits, I believe, sometime in 2018.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: And how much – I'm just kind of curious, how much is baked into the 2018 number
then, just to be very clear about it, or are you saying...?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So if I had to read, I mean, I'm looking at something Art has, I mean it looks like, yeah,
you're in there, you're kind of done in 2017, you're into consuming it in 2018, and you're done by 2020, 2021. It gathers
itself up pretty quickly. It consumes it pretty quickly. We can give you breakdown year-by-year, I guess later, but.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: And is there any incentive to delaying projects? Just to kind of think about it out loud,
if you're not getting the tax benefits now, why not push them off if you can renegotiate the deals, get a little bit better
uplift?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Are you talking about solar deals?
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Yeah, there's talk out there in the industry of it. I suppose you guys could potentially
be a leading indicator on it.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No, you know what? It's an interesting question. Here is something that we have talked
about, but so far we haven't seen much of it. Remember, when we thought there was going to be a cliff from 2016 to
2017, and we all said, boy, there's a freight train running to get deals done in 2016, and we kind of said, well, you know
what, if we get this extension, which we did, would all the activity show up in 2016, or would it start to spillover into
2017? We're seeing some of that, okay? But we still feel that for the projects that were circled by us back in 2015 for
2016, that they're still going to happen pretty much in 2016. There could be some minor spillage, if you will, into 2017.
But here's what I think you're going to find more likely, and that is more projects now come to light when you think
about people starting to anticipate proactive responses to the Clean Power Plan, other states' activities with respect to
renewable portfolio standards. Look, I think there is a tremendous appetite to grow both solar and wind in the years
ahead. So my sense is, with the added ITC and PTC extensions, the market is going to well exceed, I'm just going to
guess, what we all think is out there. And the price for those projects will reflect the fact that the general participants in
the United States are going to have bonus depreciation sitting on top of them. In other words, I think this will all
resolve itself, and we will see additional growth. That would be my guess.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Got it. Can I just go back real quickly and clarify? We're getting some questions here.
When we're talking about the ITCs, I was specifically inquiring around the earnings impact, not necessarily the cash. Is
there any solar ITC earnings impact reflected in the 2016 guidance and 2017, or are you also delaying the earnings
recognition?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: No. For book purposes you will still recognize the benefit of ITC. The recognition for cash,
that will be delayed until you got room to take them.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So the cash benefit gets delayed a bit, and you're in the kind of – I don't know, if I did an
average of that, it's kind of an average of, I don't know, two and a half – with a four-year total kind of thing.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's kind of the time value magnitudes you're talking about. It doesn't have...
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: But just to be clear, how much in like EPS are we talking about in 2016 guidance?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: In total for Southern Power?
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Yeah, yeah – or for the ITC? Just I'm thinking about like that being something of a
quasi-one-time that you want to think about...

<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: All right. Great. And 2017 and 2018 I suppose is proportionately lower based on the
CapEx you're projecting? Is that probably a fair statement?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct. It depends on the mix, remember, the mix of wind and solar. So we've just
given you a number. We've not defined it in any way between what's solar, what's wind and what's gas.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Got it. All right. Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi, Stephen. How are you?
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Great. How are you doing?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Awesome.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Awesome. Most of my questions have been addressed. I just wanted to touch on new
nuclear and check in on the Sanman project in China. What's your sense in terms of the progress at Sanman?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It's good. There were the – I guess, their big holdups relate to the reactor cooling pump.
Resolving those technical issues, those have been resolved. I think they're moving forward. I forget which one's which,
but one is going to go into service this year and I think Sanman this year, and early next year will be Haiyang. They're
going well.
With respect to new nuclear, certainly as the Clean Power Plan starts to mature and states responses, we've said it
before, there's really a big three, maybe a big four in responding to that. I think new nuclear makes a lot of sense, big
scale, base load, no carbon emissions. Clearly, renewables will be a big player, will be for us, have been for us. And
then when you see kind of intermittent resources, like wind and solar come to play, you're going to need two types of
gas come in. One piece of gas, which will be the ability for generation to follow. The intermittency will be CTs. So we
think you'll start to see CTs in a big way. And then, you know, it looks tough for coal, certainly new coal. So if you
want to look at base load looking gas, that looks like CCs.
So those are going to be the trends that I think you'll see going forward. Right now, Georgia has filed its Integrated
Resource Plan, but that really is not particularly responsive to the Clean Power Plan. It is way too far early to get a kind
of cogent response by the states. So you should view the IRP in Georgia as being pre-Clean Power Plan in its
composition.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Understood. So that could add – as you think about the Clean Power Plan, that can add
additional opportunities, but probably a bit later on just given the timeframe of that regulation?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, and then that's right. But you're going to get into this conundrum of whenever you
decide, whenever it's accepted by EPA and everything else, if gas is going to be a big deal, and if you've got four years
to start building combined cycles and you've got have a response in place by 2022, for example, you've got to start right
away. And that's why I guess Art made the comment that you're going to start seeing potential changes in the CapEx
budget if CCs start to show up in the back-end of this three-year budget we've laid out for you.

<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: That makes a lot of sense.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We don't have that in there.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Okay. I just had one last question just on Toshiba and Westinghouse. We're very pleased
obviously with the settlement and improvement of the risk position. There's a little bit of press reports about the
position of Toshiba potentially looking at their investment in Westinghouse. But that looks more like a financial test
rather than anything operational. I assume it's the case that the people that you want in terms of the team involved from
Westinghouse, et cetera, they're there. If Toshiba were to take a write-off of Westinghouse, that's not necessarily really
translates into anything different in terms of team composition or commitment to the business, or anything of that sort.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: No. No, not at all, Stephen.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: In fact, we would argue, look, we're in such a better spot than we were. Think about the
relative positions of the partners. We have a single point of contact now. They're not having to fight with each other. In
fact, we're already seeing improvements on the site. We're going to 24-hour coverage, which we didn't had before.
We're seeing an acceleration in the subcontractors for things like panels, Newport News, Oregon Iron Works, a much
more focused work force on-site. No, this thing has been terrific. And with respect to any, and I'll get Art to comment
on this, but with respect to any credit issues at Toshiba, with respect to their ability to undertake their financial
obligations under the contract, they provided us LCs to meet their obligations.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct. And they were downgraded for low investment grade, the terms of the
contract required them to commit letters of credit which we received about a month ago.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And they're written by strong banks that we're completely happy with.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.

Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.

<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Hey, Art and Tom. How are you?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Good.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Super.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: So just looking at slide 10, the dip in CapEx that you're showing for Southern Power, I'm
still trying to just figure out, is this the pull forward of demand under the old tax regime, or is that sort of Southern
Power shifting out their CapEx profile given the higher hurdle rate or the less tax appetite?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: You're talking in 2017, Shar?
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: That's right. Yeah, in 2017, exactly.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, I think it's a bit of the lack of supply at this point is that's going to have to adjust to the
new market reality that you now have extended the ITCs beyond down to 2021, that you don't have as many projects
that were in the mill, so to speak.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, and you know what, I mean, I think Art is right on the money there. I wouldn't be
surprised that the market for that number grows. And I feel good about our ability to execute within that growing

market. Look at what we've done. That's why we want to make a point in the script about kind of the last three-year
forecast we gave you was $3 billion and we did $5 billion, for heaven's sake. Right now we're saying, it's going to be
$5 billion for the next three years, and we're going to do $2.4 billion in 2016. Now that says, well there's only $2.6
billion in the last two years. I wouldn't be surprised if that number grows. When you see the availability of these tax
credits, when you think about people getting ready for the Clean Power Plan, the market's going to grow. That's what
we're showing right now. That's what we're going to stick with in our plan, but I think there's room to grow.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: If you look at the RPS standards expansions, that will certainly drive some of the growth
naturally anyway.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Absolutely.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: And then just sticking with the growth, large-scale acquisitions on the renewables side, I
have to imagine there's willing sellers. And maybe you could just touch on, if you can, the recent media report that
Southern Power was potentially looking at SunEdison's portfolio?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, I haven't seen that, and I'm not going to comment on it. We are active. We have
terrific relationships – have had terrific relationships with major developers. First Solar has been one...
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Recurrent.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: ...Recurrent's another. And so we work lockstep with those guys and that's why we're so
confident about kind of our forward supply. Certainly, there are projects that are in existence, and if we're a logical
buyer, we will participate really hard. I'll give you examples of where we've done that. In Georgia, after the solicitation
process that went through a lot of developers, went and did deals there, we became a very attractive participant because
we could execute with a great deal of financial resources and just work it really well. That's going to be in existence.
But with respect to any particular name, we would never comment on that. There's going to be stuff available though.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Got it. Thanks so much.

Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Ali, how are you?
<Q - Ali Agha>: Good, Tom. Good afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Ali Agha>: I just wanted to clarify a couple of points you had made earlier, just to make sure I'm getting them
right. So first-off on bonus depreciation, is it fair to assume that the $0.04 hit that you assumed in 2016, is this a good
annual number to think about for 2017-2018 as well?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: No, it'll go up as we move out in time, Ali. The facts are that we were actually a cash tax
payer in 2015, and would it – before the extension of bonus, we probably have been one in 2016. So it is a smaller
effect in 2016, but it will grow over time.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: But just remember consistent with the guidance we've given you, we're going to overcome
a continuing burden by less shares, growth plan, addition of AGL.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Right.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Yeah, no, I get that. And then secondly, so given this ITC and PTC extension and, Tom, you alluded
to the fact that previously you were looking at a bit of a cliff in 2017. So of that 2015 earnings base for Southern

Power, how should we be looking at the next three years, relatively flat or growing given that these things are
extended? I mean, how should we think about that change now from your perspective?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: These guys hate me talking about this. But...
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Of course we do.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I know. Normally, I could've done that at Southern Power, not you. We have continued to
beat Southern Power's goals every year. Gosh, when I think about – I want to go back to 2014, we estimated around
$150 million, or so and we got $170 million or so. When we estimated 2015, we estimated $180 million, and we're
going to get $215 million.
Now here's what's interesting, I'm going to give you a number in 2016 that's going to knock your socks off, I think. But
remember we added to the CapEx, so our CapEx went from, I forget what we estimated, $1.2 billion to $2.4 billion,
round numbers in 2015. And then we said we're going to execute similarly in 2016. So imagine the CapEx that we've
been expending on projects, and while we jumped up to $215 million, the effect of this acceleration of CapEx at the
end of 2015, we were spending CapEx, but didn't have projects in service. Once we go into service in 2016, you're
going to see a great, big jump. And that jump could be as high as the high-$200 million to $300 million in net income.
So it's going to be a big bump.
Now consistent with the CapEx that we're showing you here, that number is not sustained, and in fact the – I mean, the
less CapEx, and the idea of the cliff and all that would show that our net income will come down in Southern Power to
some level in 2017. I'm not prepared to talk about what that level is, but I want you to know don't expect $300 million
to stay the same every year thereafter. I will just say, 2016 we expect a great year in net income contribution from
Southern Power
<Q - Ali Agha>: Yeah absolutely.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Just remember in 2017 and 2018 going forward, AGL pops in, and we estimated way back
when I think about $0.10 a year on the average. So that's what really picks up for Southern in 2017, 2018 and beyond.
<Q - Ali Agha>: And also can you remind us, Art, again of the 2015 O&M number expense that you posted, what kind
of growth rate should we be looking at maybe going forward?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Okay. Ali, going forward, we're going to stick with our 3% to 3.5% number. But understand
that there's no such thing as a normal year in non-fuel O&M. Looking back to 2014, I mean, for the operating
companies alone, year-over-year it's only up 1.2%. If you look at total Southern, it was up 2.3%. So lots of things
influence those numbers. But as a planning guide, I think 3% to 3.5% is a good number.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And you guys know for years really, heck, going back when I was in the CFO rank, we
developed this dynamic budgeting process where actually we approve a lower level of budget and then above that we
developed some flexibility. It essentially creates optionality in our spending plan to match for different economic
conditions and different weather such that that's why we always hit our numbers. We're able to adjust spending when
we have, you know, warm weather during the summer, we're able to do more outages and more work. And what
underpins all that, the result is we have the best reliability for the wires and our generating system in the industry. So it
works exceedingly well. But Art's right. I mean, I guess you should use a 3.5% looking number, but just be cautious.
We'll match that with revenue over time.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, and there's other exogenous factors. We'll bring Kemper on line. That will certainly
make a difference in non-fuel O&M. And as we bring over environmental pieces of equipment on, that will impact
O&M as well. So I'm really talking about base kind of stuff.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Yeah, understood. Last question, Tom, now with all these moving parts and, you know, these
extensions and bonus, et cetera, if you look at your company on a stand-alone basis and, you know, pre the AGL
acquisition announcement and the financing that goes with that obviously, if none of that had happened, what kind of
growth rate were you looking at for Southern sort of on a standalone basis?

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Okay. Absent AGL, absent bonus, and all that?
<Q - Ali Agha>: Well, bonus obviously...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: [indiscernible] (01:11:40).
<Q - Ali Agha>: ...Sorry, go head.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Okay. I'll answer it. Absent AGL, absent bonus and all the new tax law we just got, it
would have been 3% to 4%. And we would have been back to the litany of me kind of posing to you all the rhetorical
question that we in fact face, that is we would become way excess cash flow, it's what we talked about before. And we
said there's kind of three things you can do with it. One is buy back your own stock, one is buy somebody else's stock,
and in the middle buy assets. And what we had been seeing, which you've seen us do in that strategy, was to buy up a
bunch of assets particularly at Southern Power.
We saw an opportunity with AGL, not only to buy somebody else's stock at a premium that is enormously accretive,
especially given where they were trading relative to their peers, so our premium wasn't nearly as high as what you see
in the media, and especially relative to other deals. And it accretes to our growth rate. And so this thing has been a
home run ever since we've announced, and I think our stock has performed accordingly. But it would have been 3% to
4%, but we would have been dealing with what do we do with the excess cash.

<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Now, when I look back at what you guys had for this time last year, you guys had about
3%, and you expected 1.3%.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: So when we're looking at this, have you guys changed your GDP growth rate? And also, by the
way, I hate to do this, but is a leap year in this as well, this new...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That does matter.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: I know.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah Paul, this is Art. I think certainly GDP is a factor that we put into our forecast, and it
does have an influence. But one other thing, and Tom has already kind of mentioned it, is our bottom-up approach.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: As that we talk to all of our large industrial customers and we get a lot of information from
them about what their plans are, what their expansions, what new models they might be bringing online, whatever. And
we factor that in as well. So it's not just a top-down GDP driven number. So it's not going to always match up.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And let me just give you a story about that. So when we went from 2014 to 2015, we had
gas prices on average be kind of in the $4s to now in the $2s. Okay? So there were some people on the margin with
co-generation facilities. So as prices in gas went down, they turned on their co-gen and stopped buying from us. That
also impacted industrial sales in a big way. You're not going to see that same delta this year, because you're at a super
low gas price. I don't know how much further lower they can go. But we're not going to see that delta. And so what
you're remaining with is an industrial growth rate that we think is achievable.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It is absolutely a bottoms-up, boots on the ground kind of analysis. We do check it with
our kind of big mega trend looking stats. But we're pretty confident with what we've got.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then with respect to Julien's question on the solar ITC, I wasn't really completely
clear about what the 2017 impact was. It sounded like it was, if I got it right, $150 million that you guys saw in 2016
for the ITCs. And then I just I apologize, I just didn't really catch what you guys expected to have happen with that in
2017?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, it really depends on whether we're going to do solar deals, wind deals or natural
gas.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So it's hard to say what it's going to be then, because it depends on what we commit to do
and what we spend CapEx on, what clears into service.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. But directionally, do you think it might go down? Is that what...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure. Yeah, absolutely.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: But what you're going to do probably is, you know, I don't know. Well, I'll tell you under
the current plan that we forecast here, who knows what's going to show up in the market, and we'll adjust accordingly
as we see it show up. But one of the things you can pivot to do is do more wins, for example. That would make it go
down.

<Q - Paul Patterson>: Right. And that would suggest that that would be...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: [inaudible] (01:16:45).
<Q - Paul Patterson>: But that could be a little bit of a drag, is that what we should think at least in the near term
year-over-year?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No. Listen, we feel comfortable about hitting our numbers that we're showing you guys.
Look, we're giving you our best guess, and we're giving you a conservative case. My sense is there's going to be a
bigger market, and certainly I will challenge Southern Power to participate fully in that bigger market than what they're
committing to right now. Remember, we went through the discussion earlier on the call about going from a big CapEx
number in 2016 to a lower CapEx number in 2017. That's really just a reflection of where we are. We'll push then to do
more.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then just with Kemper, and the negotiations on the CO2 contracts, how is that
going? And how should we think about the impact of low oil prices and the economics of Kemper on an operational
basis, given what we've seen with the big dramatic drop in oil and gas?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Interestingly, I asked that question yesterday in terms of appetite for CO2. People still
have an appetite for CO2. For the EOR business, there's a tremendous demand. And in fact we have been approached –
forget Kemper, we've been approached about getting in the business of producing CO2 from other places. You may
remember way back when, we did one of our early pilots on carbon capture and sequestration out of Plant Barry. And
we were sequestering the CO2 in the Citronelle field there. We think there's tremendous demand for CO2 in the EOR
business even at these prices. And I was a little surprised at that.
In terms of the relative cost of energy, we've kind of covered that in other calls. And I just remember my base lines
here, so I'm just going to quote what I quoted before. But at $100 a barrel, the value of CO2 plus a host of other
assumptions got us to about $1.25 per million Btu equivalent. At $50 a barrel, it was somewhere around $2 to $2.25
equivalent. And so we'll see what happens now.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Is that linear or, II mean – because, as you know, we've had a drop from there [indiscernible]
(01:19:14).
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, of course. Yeah, we get that. But, listen, you know what, and that – I get this
question all the time about how can you justify building nuclear when gas prices are low. One of the things we do know
is that we don't know what's going to happen with gas prices. And they tend to be much more volatile than other fuel
stocks. One of the advantages of Kemper relative to even other natural gas plants is that we've essentially fixed out our
cost of supply. We have mine mouth lignite. We know what that cost. That's not going to vary.
And so we're going to be able to produce, assuming a reliability profile, at a very constant level. And recall also what
has changed over time, look at the performance of Kemper in the past year just purely by running natural gas through
the combined cycle units. We supplied one-third of the energy consumed by Mississippi Power customers out of the
Kemper site. So we're going to be able to provide reliability assurances in the regulatory process that we think is going
to be very attractive.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then just, there have been some reports about large coal inventory in light of the low
gas prices and what have you. And I was just wondering if there is any issue or any comment that you guys have in
terms of the level of coal inventory? And if anything has to change contractually, or anything else you might see in
terms of coal-gas dynamics in the Southeast because of the inventories you're seeing?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Paul, thanks for asking that. I won a monetary bet with Art Beattie on that. We prepare the
most arcane data. And in preparation for this one, I think I just beat him.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I told him you wouldn't ask this, Paul.

remains a certain set of supply. So we've been able to shift our supply.
But the other thing that we've been able to do is work on transportation. We've been able to work constructively with
the railroads, and here is my arcane data. When we talk about train sets, and 2014, at our peak, we had 95 train sets
moving coal around the United States. In 2015, that number's gone down to 75 train sets, and for 2016, we have 45
train sets active. So we've been able to take down the number of assets that are moving coal around the United States.
That will serve to balance out our fuel loads in an economic manner for the benefit of our customers throughout this
year and then going forward.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Great. I really appreciate it. Thanks so much.

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Hey, guys. Hey, Tom. Just a question on thinking about kind of Vogtle with the bonus
depreciation. Does the $4 billion or $5 billion of cash include getting bonus kind of on Vogtle, at least one of the units?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, it does.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: When it comes in?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. Just one of them or both of them?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Both.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. And does the 4% to 5% growth rate include like the rate base impact of Vogtle
from bonus depreciation too? So it's kind of everything together?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I would imagine that it does.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I can't imagine it not being impacted.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. So you're including the full impact, bonus depreciation, cash and rate base for
Vogtle?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct. That's correct.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: And we mentioned that in our script actually. It was going to pick up both Kemper and
Vogtle. So within those time frames, that's true.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of [ph] Ashar Khan (01:23:37) with Visium. Please go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, [ph] Ashar (01:23:40).
<Q>: Hey, Tom. How are you doing?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Awesome.
<Q>: Tom, I'm a little bit – a lot of numbers, but I don't know if you can kind of like simplify, or I heard something
wrong. And this I'm trying to understand the merger. So you said, if I heard in the commentary, that the merger is going
to add $0.10 in 2017 and 2018, if I heard it correctly?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Round numbers. That's right. Through the period it's $0.10 accretive per year. And the
numbers, you know, are $0.09 and $0.10 and $0.11, but whatever.
<Q>: Okay. But then I also heard that you said that you're using $1.4 billion of equity from the bonus depreciation
windfall in terms of investing that into this new investment, which is AGL. So we don't have to utilize it. And to me
$1.4 billion of equity is equivalent to – on current today's stock price – is equivalent to about $0.10 a share. And then
we are saying that's also hitting us by $0.06 in 2016. So to me that implies that the transaction is dilutive by $0.05. So
what am I missing? The numbers don't add up. The $0.06 plus $0.10 on equity avoidance, plus $0.10? I'm just not
getting it.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, I would go back to the math. I tried to do before, the kind of caveman stuff. We
were always – when you think about – and it really get into an argument of attribution of shares, okay? And we argued
about whether to put it all on Southern Power and say that we are financing all of AGL with cash coming from bonus
and all this other stuff, or whether to do a mix, or whether just to say, look, the nearest term use of cash is AGL, and so
therefore, keeping the $1.4 billion remaining, which we did $200 million in 2015, $1.2 billion is our plan in 2016, we
have just chosen to associate that with AGL. We could have done a variety of things. When you consider the total
amount of CapEx including the acquisition amount less the benefit of cash, we could have attributed that on a pro rata
basis.
The economic impact of AGL remains the same. Once we get a full year of earnings, remember, maybe this will be
helpful just to recall when we did the announcement, their EPS growth rate on a stand-alone basis was between 6% and
9%. And their base case assumed essentially 7.5%. And we thought there were opportunities to improve that a wee bit.
When you add AGL into Southern, it increases our overall growth 1%, from 3% to 4% to 4% to 5%. That represents
about $0.10 a year. We're going to sustain that into the future. How you want to count the shares is almost a term of art.
But the truth is that the fact that we're going to get at least $4 billion, potentially over $5 billion, allows us to offset a
significant amount of shares that otherwise we would have issued. The firm is better off $4 billion to $5 billion in total.
<Q>: Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll go back and do, but I don't know the math didn't work out. Second question, Tom, on the
more macro thing, I guess you were not the only one of the companies that reported earlier. All three of them showed a
huge drop in industrial sales in the fourth quarter.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.
<Q>: Is this – and I think so, what you mentioned in your macro piece and I guess mentioned by Dudley last night, is
that the strong dollar is hurting the industrial manufacturing side? How long do you think that this remains there? Is this
just last quarter, or are we going to see weak numbers, a year-over-year comparisons for the first half of the year, or
could you just give us from your macro perspective?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, man. And in fact if you want to go back and look at the clip, look at the clip that
CNBC has when I was on Squawk Box with Dennis Lockhart in December. So let me give you just kind of the dumb
overview again. When you look at quarter-by-quarter performance, we track very closely the top 10, I used to call them
SIC codes. I understand they're called something else now, but Standard Industrial Classification segments. That

represents 80% to 85% of our sales in the industrial sector. So 2014, all 10 of those segments showed year-over-year
growth. So it was a terrific forward-looking story. And then we projected I guess a 1.3% increase in industrial sales.
Then all of a sudden, with worldwide economies, China, all that other stuff that we're talking about, dollar, exporting
going down, we started seeing those segments start to show year-over-year weakness. In the first quarter, two of them
turned negative. In the second quarter, I want to say three of them turned negative. In the third quarter, six of them
turned negative. In the fourth quarter, it turns out seven of them turned negative. And then even now my momentum
analysis would have showed that even if you were still positive, this is the momentum comment, you were less positive.
Everything started showing that it was slowing down in the industrial sector.
Now, what Art said is true, and here's what's interesting. When these guys, we were preparing for this call, first started
coming up with the sales forecast and they were showing renewed growth in industrial, we had a lot of give and take
and pushback, and why do you really believe that. It goes to a variety of factors. I think this notion that the industrial
class is adjusting to the high dollar and low commodity prices in this new market reality is one factor. Second factor,
remember I mentioned before that with gas prices falling, we saw a bunch of co-gen turn on. That tended to depress
industrial sales. That delta won't show in 2016 anymore.
So as people adjust to new reality, like for example, primary metals, we saw that go way down. We think now some of
primary metals is going to grow with the – associated with automobiles, with transportation. We're going to see that
renew. We have reason to believe from our bottoms up analysis, and I'll tell you another thing, Mike Jackson of
AutoNation commented on this in some of his commentary. Other foreign operations are being relocated in the United
States. A story for that, Art, is in Alabama with Mercedes-Benz.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So some of our bottoms-up stories are giving us the reason to believe that in the Southeast,
now this is probably not true across the United States, in the Southeast, we're going to see a renewal of industrial sales
off of 2015. So look for it to occur in transportation. Look for it to occur in housing, and maybe some of the other
sectors.
<Q>: But would you agree that might show up more in the second half of the year rather than the first half?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes. That would be my guess also. Yes.
<Q>: Okay. That was my – thank you so much.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet. Thank you. Operator, any more questions?

next six months, there won't be a public disclosure of those discussions, or...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, no.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I mean, let me just clarify that and let me get the time frames right too. We have 60 days
in which to make filings with the Commission, with the staff. Then a six-month clock starts. Okay? After we make the
filings, there's a 30-day clock that will allow interested parties to file their own information. Then we have an
evaluation of all this information with the staff and we try and reach a settlement as to its conclusion. Okay? Once we
reach that conclusion, if we reach a settlement, there will be a period of time in which interested parties can finally
evaluate it, and it would be ultimately adjudicated in a normal course, as we do with almost any rate case or any other
proceeding that we have. So there will be ultimately a hearing resulting after assuming we have a settlement agreement.
Rest assured of that.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Okay. Okay. I just wanted to clarify that, otherwise thanks for everything today. It was great.
Appreciate it.

Our next question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP. Please go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Vedula.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: Hey. Good afternoon, Tom and how are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Great. How are you?
<Q - Vedula Murti>: I'm doing okay. A couple things, in terms of Southern Power, it seems like obviously with the
higher CapEx and everything like that, it's very production tax credit, investment tax credit driven.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: How much of this stuff stands alone by itself? I'm just wondering like, how much of this is just,
you know, all tax driven as opposed to underlying economics without Federal tax policies?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Now that's an interesting question. I mean, look, I've been on record a lot and how even
the EIA would say that tax preference items accorded renewables are way in excess of anything associated with coal,
oil, gas, and even compared to nuclear was estimated to be 35 times what's available there.
What's fascinating is I think these are mature industries. And certainly with the way the Clean Power Plan is structured,
even without tax benefits there would be a great demand to do wind and solar, just because of their carbon profile.
Recall also that I think the United States in general is going to be really well-served if we pursue the full portfolio that
I'm always fond of saying we're the only one really doing all of it, new nuclear, 21 century coal, natural gas, renewables
energy efficiency.
Look, Vedula, behind your question is the notion that these things have, in my opinion, excess economic returns
relative to a tax policy that didn't favor one technology or another. But I think given where EPA is going, especially
with the price of carbon that's implied in what they say, even without these tax preference items being so tilted towards
renewables, there would still be renewables growth.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: And do you think that when you take a look at your own portfolio, and your own projects, how
those fit within that construct that you just described?

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, to the extent we sign up for them, they're under current tax law. And so certainly if
you didn't have those tax benefits, they would have a different profile. Certainly, the market would reduce, but for what
we have, I mean it fits under the commercial terms in which we entered into on that. It's hard for me to imagine,
certainly you're not suggesting would we have still done have we had not had the tax benefits. I mean, that is the law. I
don't know...
<Q - Vedula Murti>: No, I understand. I understand that's the law. But I'm just wondering how much of this is only
because of the tax law that allows all this to happen versus, you know, just...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, who knows.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: You know, just the practical economics? Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, I don't know.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: Right. Also, if we just think about back on the history of Southern Power over time, as I recall,
there have been monetizations, and just like recycling capital, whatever.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: So if we think about your capital program over the next few years here, what type of
monetizations, or pruning, or whatever you want to call it, do you think either is built in or is possible?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, Vedula, we don't have anything built in, okay? But as we have demonstrated in the
past, and I'm fond of saying, we're an EVA shop. If there is a better owner for our assets, in other words, they have a
different discount rate, they have a different whatever, assets should sit in the hands of the best owner on a risk-return
basis. We're always open for business, for good ideas, about how to deploy assets or bring them back in. So we'll see.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: I mean, I'm curious if you look back in your history here, if you've never had – if you generally
work on a nothing built in, what do you end up usually realizing typically as opposed to a zero baseline?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, I'm a little reluctant to kind of do that, because those kind of deals are very
opportunistic. We get approached all the time by people. We're always interested in doing what's best for our
stockholders in this case. And in some cases, these impact directly our customers. We just have to balance all that. I'd
be reluctant to kind of give a statistic like that.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: Okay. And one last thing, you may have addressed some of this in your opening script and I
missed the – I only got in on the Q&A. but I'm just wondering, can you maybe update us in terms of your current
thoughts about how within the retail and the commercial sectors, how efficiency and technology is dampening sales and
everything like that? And how you're trying to work either through rate structures and regulatory mechanisms in order
to offset that dampening? Because I would assume that it's both in your interest and everyone's interest to try to do that
as much as you can, as long as it doesn't impair your ability to earn your authorized returns.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: What we're seeing right now is even despite energy efficiency and everything else, we
have a growing economy, and a growing sales picture. Obviously, we're always interested in the best rate design that
we can possibly have. We're certainly open to any good ideas there. And I know as our companies consider their kind
of ongoing discussions with regulators, that we will think about good ideas. But overall, we still feel good about our
growth profile.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: So then I guess my last follow-up on that, does that mean that because of the growth profile that
you see economically that trying to move more to not a decoupled model, but getting more – moving more in terms of
having base rates being covered, but to a fix charge and becoming less volumetric. Is that something that you're willing
to, because you like the growth profile, you're willing to hold off on, or is that something that over time you feel like
you're probably going to move to anyway or not?

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, by the way, we're getting into a history lesson now. The industry has grown up
basically on volumetric pricing, okay? We have a whole lot of fixed assets. It stands to reason if you more wanted to
closely get a fair picture with customers that you would price fix assets in a fixed way. And volumetric base measures
in a volumetric way. Certainly, I would say the pendulum is swinging more to kind of the fixed asset approach, see
Nevada, et cetera.
Certainly, room to go there. We're willing to listen to any good ideas going forward. And just, remember that any
pricing scheme, remember, we're still in a growing area in the Southeast. And I think there's a mega trend. We ought to
keep in mind, the economy is getting more electrified as a result of the digital nature of the economy. And I think we'll
still see growth going forward for some time to come. Thanks a lot, bud.

Our last question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Big Dan, how are you doing?
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Hi. Good afternoon. Doing well. I just wanted to get a little more transparency maybe into
your residential sales growth expectations. You know, it's up quite a bit from 2015 to 2016. I was wondering if you
could give us maybe some granularity into customer growth you're expecting? And it looks like maybe some usage
growth, is that being driven by like maybe more single-family homes as opposed to apartments, or what's kind of the
thinking there?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Dan. This is Art. Again, customer growth, we looked at last year, it was about just
under 1%. We're looking for something kind of that or maybe a little more in 2016. And again, that goes back to our
comment about in-migration into the region. Home values around the country have risen back to a level where people
are more willing to transfer, sell their homes, and move than they were, say, in the last three years or four years. We've
seen a number of new corporate headquarters moving into the Southeast as well. Those are having a positive effect.
We're still seeing, I guess, a higher level of multi-family, although that is beginning to peak at some point. So you're
going to see it balance out a little bit. And I think that's part of our expectations. But you're still going to see a
continuing use, weather normal use, erosion, as you still have a new era's of appliances coming in that are more
efficient. That's just going to be a natural subtraction from customer growth that we see.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: But the big slugs in the path were HVAC. And now we kind of see it, lighting kind of
being a big deal with LEDs and all that other stuff.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: But HVAC is the biggest issue in the Southeast.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Okay. And then on Vogtle, just the major modules in the critical path items coming up. I was
wondering if you could just update kind of the timing, like, what are the next things for both Unit 3 and Unit 4?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, we've got a slide on the deck on that, Dan. But Unit 3, it's probably CaO-3, Ca-O2. I
think those are the last big modules that go inside containment. They are near completion and are scheduled for
insertion, I guess, within the next few months. Unit 4, they're talking completing the cooling tower installation. It's
about 50% complete, so that'll be done in the near future. And then you'll add another ring on to Unit 4 along with the
major modules on Unit 4. That's Ca-20, Ca-01, all the big modules that will be repeated on Unit 4.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: So just to make sure I'm clear, so you're saying for Unit 3, Ca-03 and Ca-02 is probably our
first half-type things?

turbines.

Mr. Fanning, I'll turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks.
Thomas A. Fanning
Thank you very much. Boy, I don't know whether this is a combination of a Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting or an
F-Session, but it was an all-timer in terms of length. I appreciate your patience and we appreciate your interest in our
company.
I really feel like Southern had a great 2015. We're turning the edge. Value is a function of risk and return. Not only did
we exceed our targets that we set out for you, but also we have been cleaning up, continue to clean up significant risk
hurdles. When you think about settling the litigation at Vogtle, when you think about getting significant rates in place
at Kemper, when you think about successful technical start-up activities, I think the company is on a terrific upswing.
When you think about adding AGL into the mix for the future, I think the future is quite bright indeed.
So, thank you again, everybody, and I look forward to chatting with you soon. Take care.
