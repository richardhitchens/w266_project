As a reminder, during today's call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in
addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may
cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-K
on file with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we undertake no duty to update or revise them.
Finally, reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part
of the earnings release.
I would now like to the turn the call over to Bob.
Robert J. Hugin
Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. I appreciate the opportunity to review the
very positive results and the progress achieved on important corporate initiatives during the first quarter of the year.
2013 is off to an outstanding start with strong momentum across all aspects of our business. Our teams have produced
exceptional commercial and financial results and achieved multiple significant clinical and regulatory milestones.
These results and accomplishments position us extremely well to deliver on the potential of the numerous upcoming
catalysts throughout the remainder of the year. Our commercial performance in the first quarter was outstanding.
REVLIMID produced excellent results in markets around the globe. We're also very encouraged by the acceleration of
the ABRAXANE growth trajectory following last fall's non-small cell lung cancer approval in the United States.
Clearly one of the brightest highlights of the quarter was the promising launch of POMALYST in the United States.
Mark will provide his analysis but I can that say to date the launch is meeting or exceeding all of our expectations.
Our global regulatory and clinical teams achieved several meaningful regulatory milestones during the quarter. In
addition to the approval of POMALYST in the United States on February the 8th we submitted regulatory applications
for ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer to both the FDA and E.U. authorities and submitted our psoriatic arthritis
application for apremilast in the United States and Canada. These are all very exciting developments with enormous
potential for patients and for Celgene.
Our teams are also working with regulatory agencies to advance pending applications for REVLIMID in deletion 5q
MDS in Europe, for mantle cell lymphoma in the United States and for POMALYST in relapsed refractory multiple
myeloma in Europe. Action on these applications is expected in the next few months, all important upcoming
milestones.
In a few minutes Jackie will review our financial results and Mark will provide his perspective on our hematology
oncology franchise. As Scott Smith, the head of our inflammation and immunology franchise is not on the call today I'll
briefly review the status of the apremilast program on which we're making excellent progress.
In addition to our submitted regulatory applications for apremilast for psoriatic arthritis in the United States and Canada
our submission for psoriasis in the United States and for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis in Europe are on track for the
second half of the year. These submissions are based on five positive Phase III registration trials: three in psoriatic
arthritis and two in psoriasis. Enrollment in our Phase III ankylosing spondylitis trial is accelerating rapidly and is
significantly ahead of our original internal expectations.
Positive results from the ESTEEM program in moderate to severe psoriasis were presented at the American Academy
of Dermatology meeting in March. We're also well positioned for a major presence at the European League Against
Rheumatism [EULAR] meeting in Madrid this coming June. At EULAR we expect presentations of additional data
from the PALACE psoriatic arthritis pivotal program including top line results of PALACE 3 and importantly 52-week
data from PALACE 1. Data from the Behçet's disease Phase II study is also expected to be presented.
With our submissions advancing and continued positive data flow we're preparing for the apremilast global launch and
accelerating our hiring of key franchise leadership. We're very encouraged by the top talent we are attracting and are
focused on building a world-class organization. The accomplishments of the first quarter were substantial and provide

us with strong momentum for the rest of the year. We're excited about the data flow and regulatory events expected in
the coming months and look forward to updating you on those throughout the year.
These accomplishments position Celgene for our next phase of growth and illustrate our accelerated progress on our
strategic imperatives. We're focused on maximizing the full potential of our hematology franchise, expanding our
oncology franchise and building a global I&I [Inflammation and Immunology] franchise while we advance our
innovative early pipeline. We're very excited about both the meaningful opportunities on the near term horizon and our
extraordinary potential for long-term growth.
Let me now turn the call over to Jackie.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse
Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call today.
We started the year at Celgene with excellent momentum in Q1 and we see that momentum reflected in our results
across all of our major performance metrics. Net product sales growth of 15% for the Q1 year-over-year comparison
was driven by REVLIMID growth of 16.5% and was broad based across the globe. Total revenues also grew 15% and
sequential growth in both product and total revenues was 1% off of a strong Q4 of 2012.
Our business model continues to perform well and we leveraged this top line growth to 27% year-over-year Q1
adjusted earnings per share growth and improved our adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter by 320 basis
points. We continued to add value with our share repurchase program and even more importantly we saw numerous
successes from our clinical and regulatory efforts, successes that will fuel our future growth plans. These included the
approval and launch of POMALYST in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in the U.S. Mark will comment more
about this launch in a moment. We also invested further for our long-term future via new R&D collaborations and
expansions of existing collaborations.
All of our major products contributed to the 15% growth in total net product sales and all grew at double-digit rates. I
mentioned REVLIMID with 16.5% growth. VIDAZA grew 10% year-over-year and ABRAXANE 18%. All major
geographies contributed to produce these results and they were volume driven as we will see in a moment.
POMALYST is off to a strong start and is now making its contribution to our total multiple myeloma franchise growth
profile.
On this slide you can see the components of our net product sales growth. All of the 15% year-over-year growth came
from volume. The net global impact of price was somewhat favorable with a 2-percentage point positive contribution
but was offset by a 2-percentage point negative foreign exchange impact. This FX impact was about $27 million for the
quarter year-over-year comparison and was in line with our expectations for the quarter. We previously highlighted for
you and expect a full year impact of FX of about $100 million negative and that is included in our full year guidance.
We are currently tracking to that estimate.
With a 27% increase, earnings per share grew much faster than revenues. This growth came mainly from operating
profit growth of 23% as our operating margin expanded by 320 basis points for the Q1 year-over-year comparison. The
operating margin expansion came mostly from lower R&D and SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues with a
modest contribution from a higher gross margin.
As you can see from the next slide of the $0.29 absolute growth in EPS, $0.25 came from operating income and a net
$0.04 from financial drivers, mainly share count, as we see the cumulative impact of our ongoing share repurchase
program.
Turning to the details of our net product sales, REVLIMID growth of 16.5% came from across the globe with similar
growth rates in both the U.S. and international. Sequential growth over Q4 was impacted by the usual seasonality of
Medicare coverage gap expense in the U.S. with that sequential impact being $11 million and sequential growth in
international was impacted by negative foreign exchange of $18 million. Both of these effects were in line with our

internal estimates. REVLIMID's growth continues to be volume driven as the dynamics for market share, duration and
global expansion remain quite positive.
VIDAZA continues its double-digit gains on year-over-year basis. International growth was impacted by distributor
buying patterns particularly in the sequential comparison. ABRAXANE grew by an outstanding 18% year-over-year
and a strong 15% sequentially as the U.S. had its strongest ABRAXANE performance ever for a quarter and as the
international business continues to expand. The momentum behind the product is favorable post the launch of the lung
indication in the U.S. Finally, we are off to a great start with POMALYST thanks to the excellent work of our U.S.
commercial team and our launch in the middle of Q1. I'll let Mark comment further on what we're seeing in the market
with POMALYST.
Let me make one additional comment about the components of REVLIMID's growth. As we've seen, REVLIMID's
growth for Q1 year-over-year was 16.5%. All of that growth came from volume. The impact of FX on total product
sales is most felt by REVLIMID and that impact in Q1 was $19 million or 2.2% negative. This negative impact was
offset by price in the quarter. The estimated FX impact for the year is included in our REVLIMID guidance for the full
year.
On the next slide you can see the details of the key line items of our P&L and how we deliver the operating margin
improvement in Q1. We are tracking nicely against our guidance and are quite pleased with our first quarter
performance, which is all operations driven, and how we see the remainder of the year unfolding.
Our business model continues to deliver sustainable operating leverage and on this chart we track our progress in that
regard on a year-to-date basis every quarter. So you can see we're off to a strong start to the year and you can put this
year into perspective with the past five years. All of our P&L metrics are strong and our model is delivering on its
promise as a result of the efforts of all Celgene employees around the world and across all functions.
We also remain focused on returns and how we invest our capital. In this chart we calculate ROIC using GAAP income
and invested capital figures, a very conservative picture. We calculate the current year on a trailing 12-month basis, so
at this time of the year we would not expect to see a difference in the ROIC trajectory versus the prior year. We track
our performance on this metric every quarter and we'll discuss it with you as we move through the year.
Our cash and marketable securities balance declined somewhat versus year end 2012 due to the magnitude of our share
repurchase activity in the first quarter as we used $1 billion for repurchases during the quarter. We began execution of a
$600 million Accelerated Share Repurchase [ASR] program in February and expect that program to complete in May.
In addition, we bought back about $400 million worth of shares outside of the ASR program. Our cash flow from
operations for the quarter was $367 million.
Let me wrap up my comments with a quick look at our full year outlook and financial guidance. We are reaffirming
total net product sales of $6 billion, annual growth of about 11% and REVLIMID net product sales in a range of $4.1
billion to $4.2 billion, growth of 10% at the midpoint of the range. Given the strong start to the year we are increasingly
confident in our ability to hit these targets.
In light of our strong start and the visibility we have to our P&L dynamic now that we're about four months into the
year, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $5.55 to $5.65, 14% growth at the
midpoint up from our original guidance of $5.50 to $5.60 and 13% growth. Both our product sales and EPS guidance
include the possibility of a generic VIDAZA entering in the U.S. during the second half of this year. EPS guidance
includes our forecasted investment spend in our emerging inflammation and immunology business unit. That spend is
more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. EPS guidance assumes a weighted average fully diluted share
count for the full year of 430 million and an effective tax rate of 16.5%.
Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Mark.

Thanks very much, Jackie. Good morning, everyone.
We produced excellent year on year growth in the first quarter. We delivered meaningful clinical and regulatory
catalysts that will add to our short and longer term growth opportunities and we built a strong foundation to achieve our
full year 2013 sales targets. First quarter total product sales grew 15% year on year to $1.429 billion. Greater customer
demand across our brands and our core markets combined to offset the negative gross to net and foreign exchange
impact that Jackie has discussed. Even with these first quarter challenges year-on-year REVLIMID sales grew 16.5% to
$1.003 billion.
Through the first four months of this year our franchise regulatory and clinical teams have been remarkably productive.
Let me summarize the highlights. In February, the U.S. FDA approved POMALYST for patients with multiple
myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including REVLIMID and bortezomib and who have
demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completing their last therapy. In China, REVLIMID was
approved by the SFDA for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. In the United
States the REVLIMID supplemental new drug application for relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma remains
on track for approval by the June 5th PDUFA date.
The CHMP review of our POMALYST marketing application for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma is
progressing well and we expect a decision in the E.U. during the third quarter. Patient enrollment into our early access
programs across Europe suggest very significant patient need for POMALYST. We are working hard to meet this need.
We submitted marketing applications to the FDA in March and to the CHMP in April for the innovation drug
combination ABRAXANE plus gemcitabine for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. This follows the January ASCO
[American Society of Clinical Oncology] GI meeting and the oral presentation demonstrating the significant overall
survival benefit in metastatic pancreatic cancer.
During the next few minutes I would like to focus your attention on five specific topics: Q1 REVLIMID results; the
current status of the four pivotal Phase III studies that support our regulatory strategy to expand REVLIMID into newly
diagnosed multiple myeloma; the early launch success of POMALYST in the U.S.; ABRAXANE performance and
momentum; and our current perspective on the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting.
Turning to Q1 REVLIMID sales, our global year-on-year sales increased by over 16%. In the United States
year-on-year sales grew by 16%. Even though sequential quarterly sales growth was impacted by the coverage gap
rebate overall market share increased slightly during the quarter as more unique patients were treated with REVLIMID
than in any previous quarter and as duration of therapy continued to increase.
Given the ongoing economic conditions in Europe we were very pleased with this region's 16% year-on-year and 6%
quarter-on-quarter REVLIMID sales growth. Market share gains in second line multiple myeloma and increases in
duration in our major markets combined to produce very positive results. France was a particularly strong contributor
re-emerging as a critical growth driver.
Q1 REVLIMID sales in Japan, Canada and Australia were excellent. We have made outstanding progress preparing to
launch REVLIMID in China and expect to generate our first REVLIMID commercial sales later this quarter. During
the first quarter we successfully expanded REVLIMID reimbursement for deletion 5q MDS in Australia and achieved
full public reimbursement for REVLIMID in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in Taiwan.
There is no greater corporate priority for us than to expand the clinical benefit of REVLIMID to patients with newly
diagnosed multiple myeloma. Results from three large randomized Phase III studies: MM-015, CALGB-100104 and
the IFM 0502 have been presented at numerous major medical meetings and were published in a May 2012 edition of
the New England Journal of Medicine. Until now these published and presented results have been accompanied by
relatively short follow-up for overall survival.
As forecasted, overall survival events in our sponsored trial MM-015 now exceed 50% of the overall study population
and the incidence rate of second primary malignancies has plateaued and can be considered mature. We have conducted
analyses to update the overall and event free survival results for the intention to treat population and for patients less

than 75 years of age. The overall and event free survival trends remain positive. We plan to discuss these updated data
with regulatory agencies in the coming months and will submit an abstract with the results to the American Society of
Hematology [ASH] meeting in December of this year.
An updated analysis of the significant overall survival event is from the use of REVLIMID as maintenance therapy
following autologous stem cell transplantation in the randomized Phase III placebo controlled study CALGB-100104
was presented during the recent International Multiple Myeloma Workshop meeting in Kyoto, Japan. Median follow-up
is now four years and the updated overall survival analysis confirms treatment with REVLIMID continues to
demonstrate a significant overall survival benefit with a P-value of P = 0.008 and a hazard ratio of 0.61. This result is
despite crossover of more than 70% of patients from placebo to REVLIMID maintenance prior to disease progression.
Compared with previously reported analyses of SPMs, the update from Kyoto demonstrated a numerical increase in the
REVLIMID and placebo arms but concluded that the benefit risk profile for REVLIMID remains positive.
It is our understanding that updated results including overall survival and the incidence rates of SPMs in the IFM 05-02
study following Stem Cell Transplantation will be submitted to this year's ASH meeting. Once these data are available
to us we will immediately consider the [ph] IFM field (21:03) to be results to develop our global regulatory submission
strategy for REVLIMID as maintenance therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma following stem cell
transplantation.
The un-blinded efficacy and safety analysis of MM-020, our international Phase III study of REVLIMID plus low dose
dexamethasone versus the standard melphalan prednisone thalidomide regimen are forecasted to be available late this
quarter or early in the third quarter. The exact timing of data availability is dependent on when the protocol required
number of progression events is met.
The efficacy results will include the final analysis for the primary end point, progression free survival, and an interim
analysis of overall survival. Important secondary end points and safety data will be included. Given the current timeline
we expect that these results will be available in time to be submitted to the ASH meeting in December. Considered
separately and together the results from these four REVLIMID studies in patients with newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma will inform and dictate our global regulatory submission strategies.
We are encouraged by the early commercial success of POMALYST in the U.S. market. As Jackie outlined, U.S. sales
from mid-February to the end of March were $22 million and global Q1 sales were $29 million. We made excellent
progress introducing our harmonized risk management program so that hematologists and their patients were able to
immediately access POMALYST. More than 1,000 patients were registered and more than 1,000 prescriptions were
dispensed during the first quarter. Early feedback from hematologists about their clinical experience was very positive.
And we've received broad coverage and reimbursements from national and regional payers.
Not surprisingly, thought leaders are developing clinical trial strategies to combine POMALYST with other approved
and investigational agents. With approval in Europe expected later this year we remain confident that this important
therapy will become our next blockbuster hematology brand.
The string of good news and momentum for ABRAXANE continued into the first quarter driven by stable share of the
U.S. metastatic breast cancer market and measurable market share gains in the non-small cell lung cancer market. Q1
net sales reached an all-time high of $123 million. ABRAXANE year-on-year sales increased 15% in the U.S. and 28%
internationally.
We also advanced a number of new clinical studies of ABRAXANE including triple negative breast cancer, squamous
cell non-small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer and adjuvant pancreatic cancer. Recently the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network or NCCN updated its practice guidelines for the combination of ABRAXANE plus gemcitabine as a
treatment for pancreatic cancer from category 2B to category 1.
We expect final overall survival data, which is event driven, from our Phase III study of ABRAXANE in metastatic
melanoma during the second half of 2013. The 2013 calendar of academic cancer meetings offers significant and
numerous opportunities for new and updated presentations of clinical data for our portfolio. Through April we have
benefited by feature presentations of data in pancreatic cancer, multiple myeloma, AML and MDS. Next up is the

American Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting in Chicago. We are currently aware of approximately 50 abstracts on
Celgene products that have been accepted. Importantly these abstracts provide data on one or more of our products
across nine diseases and more than 20 unique clinical studies. We believe five abstracts have important and immediate
clinical considerations.
In newly diagnosed multiple myeloma the efficacy and safety of MPR compared with high dose melphalan and stem
cell transplantation followed by a second randomization comparing REVLIMID maintenance versus placebo will help
further define the benefit of REVLIMID maintenance therapy in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
In lower risk transfusion dependent non-deletion 5q MDS the transfusion independent response rate for the
combination of REVLIMID plus erythropoietin will be reported.
Pooled response and safety data from the REVLIMID Mantle Cell Lymphoma study, MCL-001, plus data from two
additional REVLIMID studies in patients with aggressive NHL and mantle cell lymphoma will be available.
Robust pharma-economic and safety data about the use of POMALYST in patients with multiple myeloma and renal
impairment was accepted. Given the clinical concerns about renal function in patients with multiple myeloma this is
critically important information.
And the abstract reporting updated results of our ABRAXANE Phase III study in metastatic pancreatic cancer has been
accepted and will be an oral presentation.
We are at the beginning of a new phase of growth driven by very good operating momentum. We have and continue to
build opportunities for accelerated sales growth. Throughout 2013 we expect global regulatory approvals for new
indications that will support the growth of our existing products to launch REVLIMID in new markets, to successfully
launch POMALYST in the U.S. and in Europe and to benefit from robust new data coming from studies of novel drug
combinations. We are extremely confident in our full year outlook.
Thank you very much. And I will now turn the call back to Bob.

Thanks, Mark, and thanks, Jackie.
The first quarter was a great start to 2013 as Celgene delivered excellent operating results and advanced our portfolio.
We're energized by our progress to date and focused on our near term objectives with multiple clinical and regulatory
milestones throughout the remainder of the year.
I want to thank all of my colleagues at Celgene for their dedication and commitment to delivering outstanding results
and advancing our strategic initiatives and most of all for striving to improve the lives of patients worldwide.
I hope you'll be able to join us either in person or on the internet for our upcoming analyst day on May the 6th in New
York City. This meeting offers us the opportunity to provide you with a more in-depth review of our research and
development programs. Thank you for joining us today.

<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thanks for taking my question and congrats on all the recent progress. Mark, I just wanted to
clarify on the MM-015 study. It sounds like you have the mature overall survival data in-house and did you confirm the
positive trend in patients over the age of 75?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yeah, hi, Eric. Thanks for the question. So we confirmed the positive trends overall but the trend
that we are focused on is the less than 75 population and that trend is quite favorable. So we are beyond 50% events but
I'll just remind everyone that 50% is a bit of an arbitrary cut. We want that as a minimum but we continue to follow and
will continue to look at updated cuts of survival as we go forward. We thought that was the minimum threshold. And
we would look to continue to update appropriately and engage the regulatory agencies in the coming months.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Okay. Thanks for the clarification. Just a quick one for Jackie if I may, she didn't mention any
Q1 impact from the donut hole or patient assistance programs. Was that not a particular seasonal headwind this year?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Yeah, just on the coverage gap – the sequential change is 11 million unfavorable for
REVLIMID. So the actual number for REVLIMID for the quarter in 2013 for the coverage gap expense is $15 million,
Q4 2012 it was $4 million, in Q1 of 2012 just by way of reference also, it was $13 million. That was in line with our
expectation. It is an $11 million sequential headwind for REVLIMID.

Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. One for you on POMALYST. Can you give us a
sense as to the line of therapy, is it mostly second or third line? I know it's early but I just wanted to get some initial
feedback. Then maybe tell us so far where you think patients are coming from? Is it mostly REVLIMID or Velcade?
Thanks
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Geoff, thanks. It's Mark. It's an important question. So on our analysis first it's important that
virtually 100% of patients who are receiving POMALYST have previously been treated with REVLIMID. So that's the
first metric. We believe that the vast majority of these patients are third, fourth line. And given the recent introduction
of Kyprolis, we're aware that many patients are either finishing or switching from Kyprolis to POMALYST and then
we see a dynamic where that's moving up.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Just a follow up on the myeloma franchise. I know you guys have talked about the filing
strategy in the U.S. and Europe for newly diagnosed but how are you thinking about other regions beyond U.S. and
Europe? Are you waiting on 020 to mature and to have four full packages or four full trials to submit? Or should we
think about say Japan or other regions as the next wave for first line newly diagnosed as an opportunity? Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: I think it's very fair to think about rest of world beyond Europe, U.S. as a next wave. I think
that's a fair characterization but what we're really doing is focused on getting a reference country, so either the U.S. or
Europe and following that we would have a cascade of other markets.

Europe about that before the 50% mark?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Wes. It's Jackie. Let me take the first question. So there are multiple drivers within the
P&L dynamic of EPS growth. So given that we're four months into the year now, essentially we've got a bit more
visibility to our operating expenses. We feel like we can increase the EPS guidance now and be very, very comfortable
with that. We feel quite optimistic about where we are revenue wise as well and very confident of hitting those revenue
targets across the board as we've outlined them. It's just that there are more drivers of EPS, we thought we had a bit
more visibility to the overall P&L dynamics, it's nothing more than that.
Maybe I'll turn it over to Mark on the CALGB question.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Absolutely. I think we're encouraged by the updated analysis of survival from CALGB that
included now more mature date on the crossover effect. The SPM rate has, for all intents and purposes, plateaued and
matured but that was important to have as an update. Our intent is to look now to segment the newly diagnosed
myeloma regulatory considerations as well as the market into the elderly non-transplant eligible and still the
post-transplant maintenance setting for younger patients. And we think that the IFM update later this year will be
important. But this composite of the four studies, 020, 015, IFM and CALGB remains a bit of an ongoing composite
opportunity for us to consider what our final or comprehensive approach would be to a regulatory approval for
REVLIMID in newly-diagnosed myeloma. So nothing's ruled in and nothing's ruled out yet but we're very, very
encouraged by the Kyoto update.

Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much, and congrats on the quarter. Look, sorry to keep harping on these
four trials, Mark. But first, on MM-O20 you've said recently, I thought that the results could come as late as the end of
Q3. I was wondering, is that still your expectation?
And have your expectations changed since you've seen the analysis of CALGB in terms of what you think the outcome
in those arms will be for the SPM rate?
And lastly related to that, U.S. filing for maintenance, are you expecting to go ahead with just what you have now? Or
are you going to wait for 020? Or is that still up in the air? Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks very much. On MM-020, of course it is an event driven analysis that we've been talking
about a lot. The timing continues to be on an almost every other week to every month basis because it is event driven.
So we are getting closer to that protocol specified number. But it really depends on when we would hit it, adjudicate
those progression events and then turn it over to the DMC [Data Monitoring Committee] for a final decision on
un-blinding.
So we're in this window of two to three to four months where it's just very difficult to be more precise than what we've
done. So your question about Q3, is that possible? I think it's in the range. Yes, it's possible, but exactly what the timing
would be is other than what we're saying today is very difficult to pin down. I can say we would expect that certainly
this year but we're trying to narrow it down because we need that information as much as you do.
With respect to maintenance, the sort of post-transplant maintenance environment, the survival data from CALGB is
still only about 30%. We don't know what the IFM update will be at the end of the year but we're hopeful that that
would show survival as well. So then we would be looking at two studies. Robust PFS, a mature SPM rate we would
expect, because the follow-up from the two studies should be much longer than four years at that point. And then we
would be able to put the benefit risk into the context for regulators whether it's the U.S. or Europe for the specific
indication of maintenance plus transplant.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Okay. What about maintenance, not post-transplant but in the U.S.? 015 or are you
going to wait for 020?

<A - Mark J. Alles>: I think in the U.S., like Europe, we would want to try to look at the opportunity of both studies,
not one or the other, and see if again, we could combine data or have one lead, one be supportive. But I'm happy that
we have the opportunity to potentially choose.

Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So just on the apremilast, you mentioned that the
spondylitis trial is enrolling faster. Maybe you can give us update on what could be the earliest timeframe we could get
the data?
And regarding the market opportunity, you said it was around 2.5 million patients, what percentage are treated?
And then second regarding apremilast, for PALACE 4, how do you view the opportunity and when could we get data in
the naive population? Thanks.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Robyn, on the ankylosing spondylitis, we had targeted originally early in next year that the
ankylosing spondylitis trial would fully accrue. That was our internal estimate. We're probably close to six months
ahead of that in terms of the speed at which it accelerated in the last few months. We are going to have at least a six
month follow-up after that so we'd hope to see top-line data in that timeframe, assuming that the accrual data continues
these next few months and finishes again in the next few months. And then we'll, hopefully six months after that, see
the data.
And PALACE 4, I think we're expecting that data imminently. So we'd expect some top-line results hopefully here in
the next month or so.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: And the market opportunities for naïves in spondylitis as far as what percentage of these
2.5 million actually get treated?
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Yeah, I think that certainly with ankylosing spondylitis, there really has never been a therapy
similar to apremilast in terms of an oral opportunity for that disease. Obviously we have to see the data to know the
magnitude of effect and the profile, et cetera, before we can really quantify what that market opportunity is. But it is a
tremendously unmet need that if we do get positive data, it really does expand the opportunity very significantly for us.
And on the naïve population, I think that it's been rare that therapies in different arthritities have looked at this
population because of the failed results that have been seen in rheumatoid arthritis, et cetera. So if we can show a
positive result there, that also would be a significant market expansion for us. So I think again, when we see the data,
understand the durability of the data, the magnitude of effect, I think then if that turns out to be positive it is another
very significant expansion of the opportunity for apremilast.

the 015 under-75 data. And when can you update us on kind of feedback from regulators on how they're looking at now
the combination of the trend, the trend in OS in that population? And if you can give us how that compared to the last
cut I think we saw which was July of last year, and kind of how that's developed? Has it gotten better? Is it consistent

with what we saw last time?
And then second, just for everyone, it would be helpful ahead of the R&D day maybe just to highlight a couple other
things that you guys expect to be kind of most interesting from the pipeline side for people as we think about what
we're going to hear then? Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Marshall, it's Mark. Thanks for the questions. So you know the regulatory discussion
environment is always dynamic. So we recently updated our analyses for overall and the target population less than 75
years of age. So we'll begin to engage regulators, especially in Europe, over the next coming months. So we schedule
these events. We have a dynamic process. So we're on the front end of that.
There's no question that as soon as we're able to update you on the progress of those discussions and the strategy for a
submission on the transplant ineligible population in Europe we would speak to that. So I think it's a dynamic, active
environment. And we're at the front end of that. I think the notion that we would, in the interim, as we're having these
discussions, expect or hope that we would have other data sets including maybe MM-020 is important not just for us
but the dynamic discussion with regulatory agencies. So we will update you when we can but we're at the beginning of
it and we'll see where we go.
With respect to R&D day I don't know if Bob or anyone wants to make a comment, but I'll just tell you our agenda is
robust. We've been working to bring together from our early research group, Tom Daniel's shop, what I believe is a
very comprehensive view of our alliances, the platforms we have across external partnerships, the very, very exciting
data that's emerging around our global leadership in epigenetics and these mechanisms that work around the
macro-environment of epigenetic therapy. So we're excited about that.
On the hematology-oncology franchise, my colleague Jean-Pierre Bizzari, who runs our Global Research Organization;
and then our new Head of Global Medical Affairs, Markus Renschler – Dr. Markus Renschler, we intend to go through
a very structured well laid out view of the next five to seven years of how our hem-onc franchise in line and then how
our early drug pipeline would lay on top of that. So we're putting this together today but I hope you'll show up.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And also we obviously will spend time to go through where exactly we are with apremilast –
the opportunity there. There will be a good I&I franchise review and also discussion of our focus and where we are on
our cellular therapy initiatives. So our goal is to give you a very broad based – there will be some financial components
to it. So we'll give you – it's an Analyst Day not just an R&D day. So we'll give you a good idea of our strategy –
financial strategy and our business strategy. The franchises, the research programs, so our goal is to give you the
opportunity to hear what we're really doing more in-depth than we ever have a chance at an investor presentation or a
conference call and the opportunity to make it interactive with a broader sense – a set of Celgene leaders so you really
can get in-depth discussions both from the presentations and in discussions with people throughout the course of the
day.
<Q - Marshall Urist>: Great, thanks. And, Mark, just to follow up just on the most recent 015 analysis, even some
qualitative comments on how it compares to the last cut in the under 75 from I think summer of last year?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: So qualitatively the trends are – remain positive and we think that the trends are supportive of the
overall benefit risk that we need to be able to secure label expansion in Europe – ultimately secure label expansion in
Europe.

an economic alternative to injectables especially in multiple myeloma, are you seeing any dynamics out there that you
can describe in terms of what physicians are doing? Is there any sort of benefit that perhaps you describe to the
REVLIMID and other compounds in your franchise?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Chris. It's Jackie. Let me make just a very high level sort of financial comment. I think
all this is a little bit early as we watch it play out, but you might imagine that when you look at the composition of our
portfolio versus maybe other companies in the industry you can think through what some of the issues would be and
maybe some of the ways that we could be positioned well in the grand scheme of an overall sometimes difficult
environment. But just from a very high level when we take a look at the totality of what we think all the impacts could
be of the current budget proposal, it's less than 0.5% of Celgene's global revenue that could be impacted by that. So it's
a very modest impact that again I think relates to the portfolio of products that we have and the therapeutic categories
in which we compete.
Now Bob may have some higher-level macro comments. Mark may as well.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: I think with sequestration specifically, putting aside the budget proposals from the different
entities – sequestration would be expected, all things considered, to have a slightly positive impact on orals compared
to other programs just in that period through October the 1st. After that it's really dependent on other issues in the
budget and as Jackie pointed out, so far we seem to be not having any kind of dramatic effect on any of the proposals
excluding the President's which we don't think is included in either the House or the Senate budget proposals. So we'll
see. But again, not dramatic, but if there is any benefit, oral should be slightly preferred for the next four or five
months.

Our next question comes from Rachel McMinn of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Yeah, can you hear me okay?
Operator
I can hear you.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: I'm wanting to follow up on ABRAXANE. Jackie, you had given guidance in the earlier in
the year of $600 to $700 million in 2013. With the first quarter under your belt and looking out with lung and
pancreatic launching, how confident are you in your ability to meet that guidance range?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: I guess the short answer is very confident. We think we're going to have accelerating
momentum in ABRAXANE over the course of the year. And we like very much how we came out of the gates in the
first quarter.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: And do you see the momentum primarily from pancreatic? Or is it a combination of
pancreatic and lung at this point?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: The primary driver at this point in time is momentum behind the lung launch, which
occurred in the middle of the fourth quarter. So now as we move into the first full quarter of that and I think Mark made
some comments about share gains in that segment in the U.S. in his remarks. So it's mostly positive momentum from
lung in the U.S. and then as you saw in the international numbers, nice strong growth there from the continued
expansion of the ABRAXANE product outside the U.S. I think Mark might want to add.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: And to that point, Jackie, just as a reminder. We were very pleased for our partner in Japan,
Taiho, where they received approval for not just lung cancer but also gastric cancer. So we've seen these incremental
upsides in label expansions in certain markets. Of course we have – we're benefiting from royalties from that
opportunity.

So I think the composite for ABRAXANE from geographic contribution from the lung launch, which is really still
relatively early. And then Rachel, as you know, you and I were in San Francisco for the ASCO GI presentation of the
panc data, that was late January. And we really think the pancreatic market dynamic is that new patient starts versus
existing therapy is really the sort of go-forward opportunity for pancreatic cancer, but again, very encouraged that the
NCCN guidelines were just updated to reflect the highest level of evidence category in support of the combination.
So I think we're confident about the outlook for the year, and we like the different elements coming together to support

Our next question comes from Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Thanks. On 020, we're doing a lot of work obviously on REV/dex maintenance versus the
control, but of course there's also another arm with a fixed dosing regimen of I think 18 months. Can you just give us
some expectation so when investors see this, they know where we should be thinking about for the fixed dose? What
are you expecting? What did you power for? What the importance of that arm in thinking about the totality of this
study? Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks for the question. So just as a reminder so we're all on the same page, the study has 1,600
patients, a little more than 500 per arm. Arm A is REV/dex continuous; Arm B is REV/dex for 18 months of therapy,
that's the fixed arm; and then MPT as the control arm, which on a dose-intensity basis is 18 months of therapy.
So we are looking for the primary comparison of arm A, so R/d continuous, to the control arm. And the study assumed
a 25% improvement in progression free survival. That approximately is around 30 months versus around 24 months for
the control. So those were our assumptions.
It is our strong expectation that the two REVLIMID arms at 18 months will be super-imposable because it's the same
regimen for up to 18 months. And then what we've seen in many data sets that have been reported is as soon as therapy
is discontinued either for tolerability, or in this case, a protocol defined stop, progression begins. So we have an
assumption built on Arm A versus Arm C and Arm B will, over time, show progression.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Okay.

Our next question comes from Mara Goldstein with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Great. Thanks very much. A question on ABRAXANE and on REVLIMID. On ABRAXANE,
the inclusion in the Compendium, does that change any of the marketing work that you can do prior to NDA approval
of ABRAXANE on pancreatic cancer?
And then secondarily on REVLIMID, the guidance for the year is about 10% growth. The first quarter saw 16% growth
and offsetting price and currency. So I was hoping that you might be able to give us some thoughts about any quarterly
fluctuations given that the overall growth guidance for the year is lower than what we saw in the first quarter?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Maria (sic) [Mara]. Let me take the REVLIMID question first. I mean this is simply a
function of the continuously increasing base for REVLIMID. And when we start the year and do that first quarter
comparison, I think we may be a little bit ahead of where we expected to be. We feel very good about how we started
the year. But I think you would expect that to kind of converge a bit over time towards our 10% guidance for the full
year. But we like where we are. We like the momentum as we started the year with REVLIMID.

<A - Mark J. Alles>: On the ABRAXANE question, with respect to the NCCN guideline update. It doesn't change
anything that we can do commercially or from a marketing point of view because we don't have the indication yet. So
that doesn't have any impact. I think on the payer's side there is a sense of confidence in that if they would see a claim
for the combination, they would recognize that it is supported by the highest level of evidence.
I think the other area that dynamically is evolving, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is that the investigator
community in pancreatic cancer, some of the top thought leaders in the world are aggressively working with our
clinical resource organization to develop and launch an adjuvant pancreatic study. There's a lot of interest in advancing
the clinical profile into the resectable or surgical setting. And I think the triple negative opportunity and some other
study opportunities really are where we are in the current lifecycle.

think you are at this point in terms of regaining sort of from a market share perspective in that particular country

Our next question comes from Terrence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering first, just a follow up on POM, if you
can provide any color in terms of trends you're seeing in April versus March in terms of new adds? And then anything
on combo usage with Kyprolis?
Separately on apremilast, can you remind us of the potential sizing of the sales force and when you might start to take
those actions to build out the commercial side there? Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks for the question. So I will tell you the trends in April for POMALYST are accelerating
and we don't not see any use of POMALYST with Kyprolis in the market. Investigator interest is high. We had a
number of investigators in Kyoto who would like to see if, for example, POM, Kyprolis, dex might be somewhat
superior indirectly to what people are already seeing with REVLIMID, Kyprolis, dex.
I will tell you that the RCD or CRD combination, as it's called, was very, very well received during the Kyoto, Japan,
meeting. Particularly in settings like smoldering myeloma and newly diagnosed myeloma. So I think the marketplace,
whether we're talking about academic research or combination therapy is really thinking that REV, Kyprolis,
dexamethasone could end up being the top regimen especially for high risk patients or in the setting of
newly-diagnosed myeloma. I don't think that there is any real momentum around POM, Kyprolis, dex yet. But of
course over time that study will happen whether it's a Phase I/II or Phase III. It will happen at some point in the future.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And then on apremilast, the build out accelerates in the second half of the year as we get
closer to the launch time in the U.S. And in terms of sizing, we'll get an opportunity at the analyst day to go into more
depth and more discussion on some of these issues. But slightly bigger investment on the dermatology side to cover
that marketplace. We're talking about 100 plus, maybe 120 and on the Rheumatology side and the psoriatic arthritis
side we've targeted 100, maybe slightly less is the order of magnitude of the type of sales force that we're talking about
now. I think that as that plays out in the second half of the year, we can continue to update you and we'll have a more
robust discussion on it on May 6.

Second of all, just the rationale behind running the 009 and 010 studies for POMALYST, the PEIXIUS and STRATUS
studies?
And then lastly timing for POMALYST or pomalidomide in Japan? It looks like there's a bridging, dose-escalation
study ongoing.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, there. It's Jackie. Let me quickly take the inventory question. So with the launch in the
U.S., we had what you would expect in terms of putting some product into the pipeline. We think the impact of that
was probably on the order of $6 million to $8 million. And now what we see is the prescriptions catching up with that
and that inventory coming down to what we would expect and over the course of the coming months and throughout
the year it's going to come down to a "Normal level," along the lines of what we would see with REVLIMID. So that's
going as we thought.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yeah, just a little bit of an extended comment on inventory, the level that we saw, Jackie
outlined the number, was what we expected given the footprint of our specialty pharmacies in the U.S. So it's about
what we expected.
With respect to the expanded access protocols, so PEXIUS, 009, and then 010 for Europe, this is a very important part
of cancer drug development. And I think if you look across different portfolios from cancer companies, when
regulatory certainty starts to become more focused or the opportunity is clearer for the drug to be approved, creating an
expanded-access program following the pivotal results you have and regulatory discussions is really an important part
of the launch as well as the access opportunity for patients. So I think the logic is that we want patients who have
exhausted existing therapy to be able to, in a pre-launch period, get access.
That said, the 009 study, the PEXIUS study, did not have much participation really at all. We had the protocol open for
about six or seven months but the participation was again, what we expected, but not a huge number of patients
enrolled. Again, I think it was the dynamic nature of drugs becoming available. Kyprolis became available and then, as
you know, POMALYST got approved in a fairly rapid fashion.
In Europe the access programs are expanding because with approval the dynamic is a little bit different. We want to
make sure we have access through the course of time where we get reimbursement country by country. That's the
dynamic and the logic for Europe.

<Q - Matthew J. Andrews>: Okay. Thank you. And then just Japan?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: We are conducting the bridging study and we will, once completed, and again have a reference
country, we have the U.S. now but a European dossier, which is very important. Remember in Europe, our dossier is
supported by the survival benefit from MM-003. And that's really the international label including Japan that we would
want to have.

Our next question comes from Mike King with JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mike G. King>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in and congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to focus
on VIDAZA if we could. Jackie, you didn't mention anything about expectations in the guidance for generics. I was
just wondering if we could get a quick update on that.
And then I just wanted to ask also about when we might see the first evidence of efficacy in the oral VIDAZA? And
when we might see some – you mentioned in the slides – some epigenetic programming I guess you could call it with
VIDAZA? When might we see the first evidence of that data?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Mike. So the 2013 full year guidance can accommodate a generic VIDAZA entrant
here in the U.S. any time in the second half of the year. That's how we put it together originally. It continues to be that
way. Not much has changed but we want to be able to accommodate that should it come in the second half of the year.
The latest date for our assumption of generic VIDAZA competition in the U.S. and that is built into the targets that go
out to 2017 is the first of January of 2014.
And on the other questions around oral azacitidine and solid tumor priming and things like that I'll turn it over to Bob
or Mark. You will see that as one of the key feature topics at our Investor Analyst Day on May 6th. So I think we are
getting pretty excited about that program. Go ahead, Mark.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yeah, and just to add. Jackie's exactly right. Thanks for the question. The way I would frame it is
you'll see data at R&D day in solid tumor oncology as well as existing data. Recall that at ASH last year, MD Anderson
reported on oral aza [azacitidine] in a couple of abstracts and we can provide them to you following this conference
call. So there is some data available but we continue to update it and our enthusiasm for combination therapy as well as
how we could build priming and sensitizing strategies with oral aza is growing.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: We have four of you left in the queue and we're going to go ahead and try to get all four of
you so – operator, please go ahead.

Are you ready for the next question?

Our next question comes from Matt Roden with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. Question for Jackie. On your 2015 and
2017 EPS guidance, can you talk about the various ways by which you could protect EPS if for any reason the top line
scenarios don't play out as projected? We get a lot of questions on this and I thought it would be helpful if you could

talk about the ways – what levers you could pull – to what extent you have flexibility to protect the bottom line under a
wide range of circumstances? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thanks for the question, Matt. So I think one thing that I would point out first is that even
when we think about the top line targets, now we have more and more drivers of that top line growth through an
increasingly diversified product portfolio, increasingly diversified number of indications and increasingly diversified
geography. So even when we think about our ability to have some upside on things that might offset downside on
things within the revenue portfolio I think that is one thing to consider.
Then beyond that, when you look at our P&L dynamic and whether you go back and look at how it's evolved over time
as the company built out the global commercial infrastructure and then what that gives us the ability to do particularly
on the size and scale that we have now and with that increasing diversification, the focused model that we have on
specialty physician channels and the clear benefit profiles of our products, what you see is in the P&L we have positive
dynamics at the gross margin level. Those are modest but they're there. And we have positive dynamics in the R&D
line as a percent of revenues and the SG&A line as a percentage of revenues. We have large buckets of spend where
we've still got efficiencies to capture over time and leverage that we're going get with additional scale. So that's why
you continue to see our results being driven by leverage at the operating profit line item in the P&L. And that is going
be a story for a very long time with Celgene.
You've heard us talk about going from 49% this year even while we're investing in inflammation and immunology
franchise to 52% to 53% in 2015 and into the mid-50% range by 2017. All imminently doable because there's multiple
line items in the P&L that are contributing to that while we continue to invest for the long-term future growth in the
business. And then when you look below that at the financial drivers obviously you know what the assumption is for
share count, flat at 430 million. You know what the assumption is for the tax rate at 16.5% which I feel very confident
is not going to go up and maybe there is a little bit of room there over time as well, so a lot of levers to pull.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Appreciate all the color. Congrats on the progress.

Our next question comes from Thomas Wei of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Thomas A. Wei>: Thanks. I just had a couple on MM-020. First, just how would you guide or direct us to think
about the prospects on the overall survival end point? And then I wanted to see if you could help us with any
interpretation of the delay in the time to the MM-020 readout. Is that something that would have been actually expected
based on prior historical data? A lot of these capital markers look very linear initially but then they start becoming
nonlinear when you get to the tail end of the curve. Or is this something that given the timing of follow-up was
unanticipated and so this population seems to be acting quite differently from historical cohorts treated with REV/dex
or MPT? Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yeah, thanks for the questions. So the first part of your question was about overall survival and
what we anticipate is that the overall survival in terms of follow-up on events would be rather immature given the
nature of the population and, of course, the crossover therapies that exist in the market after REV/dex or after MPT. So
there are a number of dynamics where we would think the overall survival would be rather immature. That said, there
will be an interim survival analysis done in conjunction with the un-blinding. So we look to that as a very interesting
part of the analysis.
With respect to your other questions, I suppose that if we had to bracket where we are, we don't think that there's any
change that has any sort of dimension to it that we don't understand. Whether we talk about the population of newly
diagnosed multiple myeloma, the performance of MPT, what we would expect from R/d . So really what we've been
talking about is, would we land some time in Q2, let's say in the June timeframe or would we potentially land sometime
in the August, September timeframe? And I think our thinking is not changed from what it's been. The constant feature
or factor, variable that is driving all this is the rate with which progression events occur. So I would leave it there. And

I guess I would tell you that as the study continues to mature there still are patients on therapy in Arm A which is
another reason why the study continues to have this window for when progression events will occur.

Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jim Birchenough>: Hi, guys. Two questions. Just coming out of Kyoto, one of the things we heard is you guys
are making a big push in China and folks were impressed with that push. So could you maybe provide some guidance
on the opportunity in China? It always seems to be this market that never gets realized because it's just one off private
pay. But how are you thinking about that?
And then just quickly on 020, in terms of what we should be focused on when we get the data, is the median benefit
important versus the hazard ratio? And the reason I ask that is as we get deeper into the tail of the curve, I'm just
wondering whether that 24 month versus 30 month improvement at the median is realistic? Is that still a goal or should
we expect something lesser? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Jim. It's Jackie. Let me jump in on China first. So obviously we're very excited about it
because the REVLIMID approval in China is completely incremental for us. Our teams in China and Asia Pacific are
quite excited about it.
We've been in China for a while now, with great infrastructure and people on the solid tumor side with ABRAXANE
already. So we've got the country platform if you will and are looking forward to the launch later this year of
REVLIMID in relapsed and refractory multiple myelomas.
To put it in perspective though I do think that we all have to look at what other drugs have done in that market. And it
can take several years for you to get up to $100 million or over $100 million opportunity, which is a very nice
opportunity but let's not get carried away. In the grand scheme of the Celgene portfolio by 2017 it's going be enormous.
We like it a lot because it's incrementally positive. It adds incremental growth. It will help us solidify the platform
there. And with more products coming in the future and all those kinds of things we think it's going be a very nice
market for us. And let's just put it in perspective as everything else. It's part of the continuing global expansion strategy
for all of our products.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: It's Bob. Just in general as a corporate philosophy, where we don't have experience – dramatic
experience in the marketplace, it's appropriate for us to be relatively conservative in our modeling as to what the
potential benefit can be to our long-range plan. And that's certainly the case for us in China. So if anything to our
models, China would be limited risk and potential upside if we outperform our conservative expectations over the next
five years.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Completely agree. I think Mark has a comment on the 020 question.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Again, thanks. We absolutely believe that a difference of six months or longer in
progression-free survival in this very, very important clinical trial is clinically meaningful. And we have good context
from regulatory agencies that a win on the primary end-point with all the appropriate secondary end-points, the analysis
for safety, that this would be quite acceptable.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: I think we have time for one last question, operator, please.

Our final question comes from Joel Sendek with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Thanks for fitting me in. I'll make it quick. On ABRAXANE it looks like you're not getting
much growth out of breast cancer. I'm wondering is that how we should model it or is there still growth available there?

And on the re-filing, I know this might be hard to answer but can you give us any sense as to how long it will take the
E.U. regulators to review the filing once you get it in? Especially as you're starting to talk to them now. Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: So let me start with breast cancer and then I'm going ask you to clarify the other part of your
question.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Sure.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: So with breast cancer, what was very important as I think you know and everyone knows, there's
been a dynamic window over the last 12 to 14 months following the CALGB breast cancer results that included
AVASTIN in three arms of a trial. The U.S. market has been quite dynamic trying to sort out between the arms and in
the marketplace what to do. We were very encouraged that in the fourth quarter and then into the first quarter the use of
ABRAXANE in metastatic breast cancer in the U.S. market has stabilized and we believe we can re-accelerate from
here.
Importantly, the read-through of ABRAXANE gemcitabine in our metastatic pancreatic cancer trial has drawn the
attention of the marketplace and investigators to look at the combination in triple-negative breast cancer, which is a
significant unmet medical need remaining because of the failure of multiple previous strategies to try to treat those
patients in a more unique way. We are pursuing that aggressively and had great encouragement from the same thought
leaders involved in the CALGB trial to endorse the ABRAXANE gemcitabine clinical-trial strategy. So we look for
that to be supportive of a re-acceleration in breast cancer.
Your other question I just didn't hear the beginning of it. Could you ask it again?
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Sure. Just wondering how long it will take post the filing in the E.U. for them to make their
regulatory decision? Whether it will be accelerated given the fact that you're talking to regulators now or whether it will
require a full review?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: No, thanks for the question. I wish I could give you better color on that. But as I said we're so
early with the new data we have. There are a number of dynamics that we don't have time to get in on the call today
including for example some draft items that European regulators are looking at to adopt over the summer that may or
may not have implications for new data like the data we're talking about from MM-015. So I think it's just too early to
give any color on timing.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: I guess the conservative thing to do is to assume that it's standard review...
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Standard review.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
