Stephen I. Chazen
Thanks, Chris. I'd like to start with some highlights from our accomplishments in the past year. We executed many of
our strategic initiatives, including the spin-off of California Resources, the sale of our Hugoton gas properties,
BridgeTex pipeline, and PAGP units. At the end of the year, our cash balance of $7.8 billion exceeded our total debt of
$6.8 billion.
We grew our domestic oil production by 11,000 barrels a day over 2013 to 181,000 barrels a day. We grew our
Permian Resources production from 65,000 barrel equivalents a day over 2013 to 75,000 equivalent barrels a day this
year.
The 2004 (sic) [2014] (02:42) capital program added 395 million barrels of proved reserves, a replacement ratio of
181% before dispositions. Our costs incurred with these reserve additions were about $6.7 billion, resulted in an
apparent finding and development cost of under $17 of BOE. We added 363 million barrels of liquid proved reserves, a
replacement ratio of 223% before dispositions. We completed the Al Hosn gas project, on budget and on time, which
started production in early January.
A few comments about the macro environment. The confluence of U.S. supply growth, weaker Asian demand and
extreme currency movements have led a significant decline in product prices. Our company is resilient and built to
weather price shocks typical to this industry. Obviously, we have the financial resource to continue drilling at the 2004
(sic) [2014] (03:40) rate. However, the current service company cost structure is more reflective of a $100 oil price
environment rather than the $50 environment we have today.
All service companies have offered modest price reductions. They still do not reflect the current reality. We're focused
on reducing our costs, which include renegotiating our supplier contracts that are not reflective of weaker oil prices. We
expect these efforts to result in a reduction in the cost of executing our capital program, as well as reducing our
operating expense. It makes little sense for us to push production so as to sell our oil at $50 or less.
I'd like to talk about briefly about the impairments. We have virtually eliminated our capital spending in the Williston
Basin on domestic gas properties in Bahrain, and the Joslyn oil sands projects, as these have unacceptable returns in the
current price environment.
As a result of a thorough portfolio review, we reduced the carrying value of the assets in the areas where we are
minimizing development activity. This resulted in an after-tax charge of $5.1 billion. These charges do not affect our
cash position. Chris will detail the charges. Our policy has been and will continue to be to write down assets to
approximately fair market value when we believe that the impairment is other than temporary.
In 2015, we will focus our capital spending on the core areas we operate, principally the Permian Basin. Our capital
budget is $5.8 billion, which is a 33% decline from 2014. Two-thirds of the capital budget will be allocated to
maintenance capital and one-third allocated to growth capital. To the start of several long-term projects, notably the Al
Hosn gas project and the BridgeTex pipeline, our 2015 capital program was on course to decline before the recent fall
in product prices.
Our capital run rate in the first quarter will be higher than the $5.8 billion level and will decline all year unless product
prices significantly improve. Given our large acreage position and deep inventory, we have the flexibility to defer
drilling and appraisal activity.

Although we will likely outspend our cash flow during the first half of the year, we expect that by the end of the year,
our operating cash flow will cover our capital expenditures and dividend payments, assuming a recovery to $60 oil
price environment. Willie Chiang will provide more details on our capital program later in the call.
Despite the lower capital program, we expected to deliver 6% to 10% annual production growth in 2015, driven by the
start-up of the Al Hosn gas projects and the focused development program we will run in the Permian Resources
business. In the United States, we expect oil production to grow about 6%, partially offset by declines in NGLs and
natural gas production. Vicki Hollub will provide further details on the outlook for the U.S. Oil and Gas business.
We had a successful year in growing the company's reserve base by adding substantially more reserves than we
produced. Company-wide, we replaced 174% of our production before asset sales. We ended the year based on a
preliminary estimate with about 2.8 billion BOEs of reserves. Through our organic development program, we replaced
181% of our production. This estimate excludes acquisitions, asset sales, and revisions of prior period estimates.
Our reserve replacement ratio for liquids from all categories before asset sales was 223%. This reflects our emphasis on
oil drilling. Our total costs incurred related to the reserve additions for the year, on a preliminary basis, were
approximately $8.3 billion. As a result of our organic development program, we estimate an apparent finding cost of
under $17 a barrel.
Our 2004 (sic) [2014] (07:28) acquisitions were approximately $1.6 billion and we booked a conservative amount of
proved developed reserves. We expect to add incremental reserves as we exploit this acreage.
At the end of the year, we estimate that 76% of our total proved reserves were liquids, increasing from 71% in 2013. Of
the total reserves, about 71% were proved developed reserves, compared to 70% in 2013.
Over the past several years, we have built a large portfolio of growth-oriented assets in the United States. In 2014, we
spent a larger proportion of our investment dollars on these resources. Our organic reserve replacement for the year
reflects the positive results of the appraisal and development efforts capitalizing on the large portfolio built over time.
In the United States, we replaced 266% of our production before asset sales. We ended the year based on a preliminary
estimate with about 1.8 BOE of reserves. Our organic development program replaced 286% of our production. This
estimate excludes acquisitions, asset sales, and revisions of prior estimates.
Our reverse reserve replacement ratio for liquids from all categories, before asset sales, was 306%. Our total costs
incurred related to the domestic reserve additions for the year, on a preliminary basis, were approximately $5.7 billion.
As a result of our organic development program, we estimate an apparent finding and development cost of about $12 a
BOE.
Through the success of our drilling program and capital efficiency initiatives, we lowered our finding and development
costs over recent years. As a result, we expect our DD&A expense to be approximately $15 a barrel in 2015, a decrease
from $17 a barrel in 2014. This is consistent with our expectation that DD&A rate of growth should flatten out as
recent investments come online and finding and development costs come down.
The success of our organic reserve additions and the efficiencies we have achieved in our operation demonstrates the
significant progress we have made in turning the company into competitive domestic producer.
Through the execution of our strategic initiative, we have raised enough cash to exceed our debt at year-end. Slide 14
outlines priorities of our use of cash. This is the same slide we have shown for at least a decade.
After spending on maintenance capital, the top priority for our cash flow is to continue to increase the dividend. We've
increased the dividend for 12 consecutive years and are committed to annual increases. Given the uncertainty in
product price, a decision on the size of the increase will be made on the declaration of the third quarter dividend. Our
remaining cash flow will be allocated to growth capital, share repurchases and acquisitions.
In 2014, we repurchased $2.5 billion of shares. We have approximately 71 million shares remaining under our current
authorization. We will continue to repurchase shares subject to stock price and market conditions and expect to

ultimately repurchase the entire amount.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris Stavros for a review of our financial results.
Christopher G. Stavros
Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Oxy completed the spin-off of California Resources at the end of
November. Accordingly, we have reclassified the financial and operational results to discontinued operations for our
core results disclosure. As such, our fourth quarter 2014 core income excludes all the California results, and income on
a reported basis includes two months of California results. Total year 2014 results on a reported basis include 11
months contribution from the California operations, classified as discontinued.
We generated core income of $560 million for the fourth quarter 2014, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.72,
a decrease in both the year ago quarter and the third quarter of 2014. The decline in core earnings was attributable
mainly to sharply lower realized oil prices on our worldwide production. Net results for the quarter were a loss of $3.4
billion or $4.41 per diluted share.
In accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting which Oxy follows, we review our proved oil and gas
properties for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the oil
and gas properties may not be adequately recovered, such as when there's a significant drop in the futures price curve.
Under the successful efforts method, if an oil and gas property's estimated future net cash flows are not sufficient to
recover its carrying amount using the period end futures curve, an impairment charge must be recorded. As of
December 31, Oxy recorded property impairments due to the fall in the futures curve for oil as of that date.
The 2014 fourth quarter includes after-tax non-core net charges of $4 billion. Approximately $2.7 billion of this was a
result of the sharp decline in the year-end WTI price curve that affected our domestic properties. Most notably, this
included a charge of $1.7 billion in the Williston Basin, $600 million related to our gas and gas condensate assets, and
$350 million for other domestic acreage.
Foreign impairments amounted to $1.1 billion, principally related to our operations in Bahrain. Additional charges
included $700 million for our interest in the Joslyn oil sands project, and a $550 million mark-to-market adjustment for
the carrying value related to our remaining 19% interest in California Resources.
The fourth quarter also included after-tax gains of $900 million from the sale of a portion of our investment in the
Plains All American Pipeline, GP, and $400 million from the sale of our 50% interest in the BridgeTex pipeline. We
continued our strong domestic oil production growth and achieved a year-over-year quarterly production increase of
19,000 BOE per day or about 11%, led by our Permian Resources assets. We also purchased 4.8 million shares of our
stock during the fourth quarter and ended the period with $7.8 billion of total cash on our balance sheet.
In oil and gas, our core after-tax earnings for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $368 million, $549 million lower than the
third quarter of this year and $731 million lower than last year's fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2014, total
company oil and gas production volumes from continuing operations averaged 616,000 BOE per day, an increase of
21,000 BOE per day in daily production from the third quarter, and 41,000 BOE per day from the same period a year
ago. This excludes production from the Hugoton and the California assets for all periods disclosed. Our fourth quarter
2014 worldwide realized oil price of $71.58 per barrel fell by $22.68 or 24%, compared to the third quarter realizations
of $94.26 per barrel.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, after-tax core income for our domestic oil and gas operations was $59 million, compared
with $310 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $391 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. On both a sequential
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, results at our domestic operations were mainly impacted by lower
realized oil prices and to a lesser degree lower NGL prices.
Higher oil production had a meaningful positive impact to both earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2014
compared to both periods. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we experienced a narrowing of the differentials in the Permian

Basin from what we realized in the third quarter of last year.
Total domestic oil and gas production averaged 321,000 BOE per day during the fourth quarter of 2014, up 6,000 BOE
per day sequentially and 26,000 BOE on a year-over-year basis. Domestic oil production was 189,000 barrels per day
during the fourth quarter, an increase of 19,000 barrels per day from the year ago period with our Permian Resources
business growing its oil production by 42% to 51,000 barrels per day. On a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis, total
domestic oil production growth was 7,000 barrels per day.
International after-tax core income was $355 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, a decline of 43% from the third
quarter of last year and 50% lower on a year-over-year basis. The decline for both periods was driven mainly by lower
realized oil prices with the sequential quarter-over-quarter period favorably impacted by higher liftings in both Iraq and
Colombia.
International oil and gas sales volumes rose by 39,000 BOE per day on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis. The
improvement was largely due to higher volumes in Iraq, resulting from liftings that slipped from prior periods as well
as higher spending levels, higher production volumes in Colombia, along with increased volumes in the Middle East
resulting from lower prices affecting our production sharing contracts.
Oil and gas cash operating costs were $13.50 per barrel for the total year 2014, compared to $12.56 per barrel for full
year 2013 and reclassified to exclude California. The increase in cost reflects increased activity in downhole
maintenance and higher costs for purchased injectants. The DD&A rate for full year 2014 was $17 per barrel. Taxes
other than on income, which are directly related to product prices, were $2.45 per barrel for the 12 months of 2014,
compared to $2.48 for the same period of 2013. Fourth quarter exploration expense was $59 million.
Chemical fourth quarter 2014 pre-tax core earnings were $160 million compared with third quarter results of $140
million and $128 million in the year ago quarter. The sequential improvement primarily reflected lower ethylene and
energy costs partially offset by lower vinyls pricing and a reduction of volumes across most product lines due to a
combination of maintenance outages, holiday shutdowns, and customer initiatives to reduce year-end inventories.
Midstream pre-tax core earnings were $168 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $155 in the third
quarter and $106 million in the same period a year ago. Phibro's domestic trading book was closed in the fourth quarter
of 2014 and we expect to wind down the remainder of the business in the current quarter. As such, Phibro's results have
been eliminated from all core income periods.
In the 12 months of 2014, we generated $9.4 billion of cash from continuing operations, a decline of approximately $1
billion compared to the year ago period. Capital expenditures for 2014 were $8.7 billion net of partner contributions.
Last year's capital outlays included $1.1 billion associated with the Al Hosn gas project, including $470 million related
to the rail and sulfur handling facilities and $285 million for the BridgeTex pipeline.
We received proceeds of $4.2 billion from the sale of assets which included fourth quarter proceeds of $1.1 billion
from the sale of our investment in BridgeTex, $1.7 billion from the sale of a portion of our investment in Plains All
American Pipeline, GP, as well as $1.3 billion from the sale of our Hugoton assets in the first quarter of last year. We
spent about $1.7 billion on bolt-on property acquisitions, of which $1.3 billion was spent in the fourth quarter on a
single acquisition in the Permian totaling 100,000 net acres and including a modest amount of oil production.
In October, we received cash proceeds of $4.95 billion from the bond offering completed by California Resources. IRS
rules mandate that the use of these proceeds be restricted to share repurchase, dividend payments, or debt retirement.
We paid the fourth quarter dividend and repurchased our shares in December using the restricted cash resulting in a $4
billion balance at December 31. We received an additional $1.15 billion of cash from California Resources concurrent
with the spin-off in late November. The use of those proceeds is unrestricted.
We returned $4.7 billion of cash to our shareholders by paying $2.2 billion in dividends and repurchasing 25.8 million
of our shares for $2.5 billion. Last year's share repurchase activity has the benefit of reducing our current dividend
outlays by approximately $75 million. Our cash balance, including restricted cash, was $7.8 billion at December 31.

Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 16% at year-end. After excluding the impact of non-core adjustments and
discontinued California operations, our 2014 return on equity was 9% and return on capital employed was 8%. The
worldwide effective tax rate on our core income was 39% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 41% for the total year.
Focusing on 2015, our capital program this year is expected to be about $5.8 billion, a decrease of 33% from our 2014
spending level of $8.7 billion. Willie Chiang will discuss the specifics of the 2015 capital program in a moment.
Using a $55 WTI and $60 Brent price curve, we expect total company production to be between 630,000 and 650,000
BOE per day in 2015, or an increase of roughly 6% to 10%. Domestically, we expect our oil production for the total
year to grow in the 6% range with the increase coming from the Permian Resources business.
We expect gas volumes to decline modestly as we cease development activities in our gas properties. In the first
quarter, we expect to lose approximately 4,000 BOE per day of production in our Permian Basin operations due to
weather-related shutdowns and freezing conditions that occur during January.
Domestic gas production is expected to decline from fourth quarter levels, resulting in a slight sequential production
decline on a BOE basis. We expect our international volumes to increase in the first quarter with the Al Hosn gas
project having started up earlier this month. Volumes from Al Hosn should average roughly 20,000 BOE per day in the
first quarter as the facilities ramp up through the first half of the year. Full year 2015 volumes from Al Hosn should
average about 50,000 BOE per day with more than 40% of the production coming from NGLs and condensate.
Production volumes should also be positively impacted from our production sharing contracts that are sensitive to the
decline in oil prices.
Oil and gas DD&A expense is expected to be approximately $15 per BOE this year. Combined depreciation for the
Midstream and Chemical segments should be approximately $675 million. Price changes at current global prices affect
our quarterly earnings before income taxes by $32 million for a $1 per barrel change in oil prices and $7 million for a
$1 per barrel change in NGL prices. A swing in a $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices affects quarterly
pre-tax earnings by about $15 million. These price change sensitivities include the impact of production sharing
contract volume changes on income.
Our first quarter 2015 exploration expense is anticipated to be about $30 million pre-tax. We expect our first quarter
2015 pre-tax chemical earnings to be about $140 million. Lower chlorovinyl margins are the primary driver for this
sequential decrease in earnings. Using current strip prices for oil and gas, we expect our 2015 domestic tax rate to be at
36% and our international tax rates to be about 65%.
I'll now turn the call over to Willie Chiang, who'll provide more detail on our 2015 capital program.
Willie C. W. Chiang
Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. And as you now know, our 2015 capital program is expected to be $5.8
billion, a 33% reduction from our 2014 capital program. All business segments will see cuts in capital spending versus
the 2014 levels with the exception of Chemicals, which is in a peak year of spending for the Ingleside ethylene cracker
JV project. Despite the lower capital program, we expect to deliver the production growths in 2015, as Steve has said.
Now let me expand on the 2015 program of which 80% is in the Oil and Gas segment and 10% each is in the
Chemicals and Midstream segments. Domestic oil and gas capital will be about $2.5 billion or 43% of our total capital
program, a decline of about $1 billion from 2014 levels. Overall spending levels in the Permian will decline slightly
and significant reductions will come from Williston and South Texas, which are most impacted by the sharp declines in
product prices. Vicki Hollub will provide more details on that later in the call.
International development capital will be about $2 billion or 33% of our total capital program. Spending levels in the
Middle East and North Africa, MENA region, will decline by approximately $1.4 billion, mostly from the Al Hosn gas
project, Qatar, and other mature projects.

Exploration capital is expected to decrease significantly from the 2014 levels to roughly $150 million. Our 2014
exploration program was successful in supporting the appraisal and delineation of a strong inventory of drilling
locations, which is the basis of our development program this year.
Chemicals segment capital will be about $600 million, which includes the Ingleside cracker project that we expect to
complete late 2016 and commissioned in the first quarter of 2017. We expect OxyChem to be free cash flow positive
through the construction of this project.
U.S. Midstream capital will be about $600 million, a decrease of about $150 million from the 2014 levels, driven
primarily by the completion of BridgeTex pipeline. Key projects include the continued development of the Ingleside
terminal for both propane and crude export terminaling, as well as gas processing infrastructure in support of our key
development programs in the Delaware Basin.
The 2015 capital program I've described ramps down over this year in where we expect to end the year at a balanced
free cash flow run rate, which will cover capital, interest and dividend payments at the $60 oil environment. It also
allows us to develop profitable production growth and allows us to continue to develop the key strategic projects in our
Chemicals and Midstream segments.
I'd like to take a few minutes to share with you the status on our reductions of our cost structure. Clearly, lower oil
price environments require lower cost structures to be competitive. Our 2015 plan assumes a very conservative amount
of pricing concessions from our suppliers of roughly $250 million for key services.
If the market environment remains where it is, we expect to see this increase to $500 million or more, which will give
us the flexibility to increase activity. We have been very engaged with our suppliers and service providers to capture
immediate reductions in costs ranging from 10% to 40%. In many cases, we have amended existing agreements to tie
discounts to oil price. The lower the oil price, the greater the discount needed to meet the market environment. We're in
the early stages of this process and have finalized agreements with about half of our key suppliers to-date.
Most of the cost savings that we've incorporated are capital costs, but we also expect operating cost reductions from the
$15 per BOE domestic operating cost level. Beyond what we normally look at pure lifting costs of the business, there
are a number of cost categories that comprise the total operating costs. Some of these categories are fairly consistent
year-to-year and include labor, generally operating support and staff, plant expenses, pipeline transportation costs,
surface maintenance. This activity allows us to produce our product reliably, safely and responsibly.
Now highlighted are a number of categories where we do expect to see significant reductions and are much more
discretionary in nature. These include well workovers, well enhancements, downhole maintenance, and purchased
injectant costs, primarily CO2. Clearly, in a low product price environment, many of these activities are just not
economic to pursue.
We also expect to see energy cost reductions, which are linked to oil and gas prices, so they too will come down in this
price environment. This should give you more perspective on another key area of opportunity that we're working hard
on, and we'll share more specifics with you as we develop more certainty around market environment and other
optimization and efficiency improvements.
I'll conclude my remarks by emphasizing that our capital allocation is very dynamic in nature. We will proactively
manage our program and we have ample flexibility to respond to both stronger and weaker conditions.
I'll turn the call over now to Vicki Hollub, who'll review our 2015 domestic oil and gas plans.
Vicki A. Hollub
Thank you, Willie. Today, I'll review the highlights of our the Permian Resources activities in the fourth quarter, and
then I'll provide more details about the 2015 capital programs in our U.S. operations.

In the fourth quarter, Permian Resources achieved daily production of 84,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is
a 9% increase from the 77,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day that were produced in the third quarter. With regard to
oil, we produced 51,000 barrels of oil per day for the fourth quarter. This is a 42% increase from a year ago and a 19%
increase from the previous quarter.
During the fourth quarter, our capital expenditures were $791 million. We operated 29 rigs and drilled 85 wells
including 56 horizontals. We placed 70 wells on production, including 44 horizontals. At year end, 11 wells were on
flow back and 61 were not yet completed.
In the Delaware Basin, we operated 14 horizontal drilling rigs and one vertical drilling rig in the fourth quarter. We
drilled 47 wells and placed 39 wells on production. In our Barilla Draw area, we placed seven horizontal wells on
production in the Wolfcamp A and B benches. These wells achieved an average peak rate of 1,500 BOE per day and a
30-day rate of 1,190 BOE per day.
We're extremely excited by the results achieved on the Peck State 258 #6H, where we optimized the landing point and
cluster spacing. This well achieved a peak rate of 2,400 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,760 BOE per day.
Additionally, we placed our first two 7,500-foot lateral wells, the Buzzard State #9H and #10H on production with
excellent results. Both are completed in the Wolfcamp A. The Buzzard State #9H achieved a peak rate of 2,020 BOE
per day and a 30-day rate of 1,780 BOE per day. We're achieving excellent initial results on our wells with sand
concentrations ranging from 1,750 to 2,250 pounds per foot. For example, our Chevron Minerals 17-5 well achieved a
peak rate of 1,800 BOE per day.
In New Mexico, we continue to be pleased by the performance of our Bone Spring wells. Recently, our Cedar Canyon
27 State 4H was placed online, with an average peak rate of 1,790 and a 30-day rate of 1,030 BOE per day.
In the Midland Basin, we operated 10 horizontal drilling rigs and four vertical drilling rigs during the fourth quarter.
We drilled 38 wells and placed 31 on production. In the Sprayberry Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B benches, we placed
17 horizontal wells online with an average peak rate of 950 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 790 BOE per day.
To-date we placed 10 Sprayberry wells online with an average peak rate of 900 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 850
BOE per day.
And last quarter, we discussed our South Curtis Ranch 3526H well in the lower Sprayberry. We're excited to report the
six-month average production for this well was 740 BOE per day. In one of our new development areas, the Merchant
1411 well achieved a peak rate of 1,560 BOE per day and a 30-day rate of 1,140 BOE per day from the Wolfcamp A.
The aggressive exploration and appraisal programs we completed in 2014 have helped us to clearly identify our best
benches and to achieve significant improvements in well productivity and operational efficiency. We'll continue to
improve these results in 2015.
Now, I'll provide additional details about our 2015 capital plans and our domestic operations. Our most significant
capital reduction will come in our Midcontinent business unit, which includes our Williston operations and our gas
properties in the Piceance in South Texas. We plan to spend $285 million in 2015 versus $570 million spent in 2014.
The 2015 capital program will focus on maintenance activities along with high return workovers. This fits with our
strategy to focus capital on higher margin oil production.
In the Permian Basin, we have two distinct but synergistic businesses, resources and enhanced oil recovery. The
resources business provides the unconventional portfolio and expertise to achieve accelerated growth, supported by our
EOR business, which provides the cash flow from efficient high volume production.
In Permian Resources, our capital expenditures will be approximately $1.7 billion. This is a $200 million reduction
from 2014 expenditures. We plan to operate an average of 19 rigs and drill approximately 167 horizontal wells, which
is equal to the number of horizontal wells we drilled in 2014. Additionally, we'll drill only 48 vertical wells versus the
137 vertical wells drilled in 2014. Vertical wells are drilled to hold acreage or to appraise new benches.

Our 2015 capital program will focus on the development of our best benches in concentrated geographic areas. In the
Midland Basin, our development activity will be mainly in South Curtis Ranch and Merchant. Here, we plan to drill 45
Sprayberry wells where performance is matching a 750,000 BOE type curve. In the Delaware Basin, we plan to drill 67
Wolfcamp A wells and a concentrated number of leases in the greater Barilla Draw area. Our Wolfcamp A wells in the
Delaware are exceeding a 900,000 BOE type curve.
In New Mexico, we plan to drill 22 Bone Spring wells. We'll execute this targeted capital program utilizing a
manufacturing approach, which will include the efficiencies of pad drilling, batch drilling of the vertical and lateral
sections of the well, along with zipper fracs. This strategy will enable us to grow our production at a higher rate with
less capital than in our 2014 appraisal program.
In the first quarter of 2015, we plan to operate an average of 29 rigs, we expect to drill 85 wells and place 108 wells on
production, including 63 horizontal wells. We're on pace to have 42 wells on flow back or on production in January.
Permian Resources has a sufficient inventory of wells to continue profitable development in a low price environment.
Based on our current cost structure, we have the ability to continue drilling profitable wells for several years.
We're taking the following actions to ensure we can deliver even more locations in this low price environment. First,
we'll continue our investment in reservoir characterization and optimization of key variables such as wellbore spacing,
lateral length, propping concentration, surfactants, cluster count, and spacing. These investments drive resource
recovery and are fundamental at any price. Second, we'll continue to apply enhanced manufacturing principles to our
development program. This will enable us to achieve efficiencies at an accelerated pace. Third, we'll continue our
efforts to enhance our base management and maintenance activities. This will ensure optimized production levels while
minimizing associated operating costs.
Lastly, we continue to aggressively work with our suppliers to improve operating productivity, eliminate constraints
and lower cost. These actions are consistent with the long-term strategy I've discussed in previous calls. I'm encouraged
by the urgency in actions our employees and contractors have already demonstrated in delivering on these initiatives.
I'll now discuss our Permian EOR business. While it hasn't drawn much attention in the last couple years with the
industry focused on high growth resource programs, our Permian EOR business remains very profitable. Oxy is the
leader in Permian Basin CO2 flooding with over 30 active floods and 40 years of experience. This business has
weathered prior downturns with resilience, and the low decline of these large properties provides a stable base to our
production at an advantaged cost.
The Permian EOR business has the agility, scale and cost structure to operate in an ultra-low pricing environment.
Currently, our total cash cost in Permian EOR is $30 a BOE, as shown on the slide. This takes into account the cost
reductions that we've already achieved. If prices stabilize at today's level or continue to decline, all costs that are linked
to oil prices would also decline, including energy, CO2, production taxes, and discretionary well maintenance
activities. For example, in a $35 per barrel oil price scenario, our total cost would reduce to approximately $22 a BOE.
Our DD&A cost is approximately $10 a BOE.
We continue to see opportunity for investment in CO2 projects in the current oil price environment. Last year, we
drilled 277 in-fill wells and continued construction of facilities for new CO2 projects. When completed, our new
project at South Hobbs will develop 28 million barrels of oil equivalent of reserves at a cost of $10.60 per BOE.
The CO2 floods have remained a strong business through technology advancement that improves recovery from our
large portfolio of conventional reservoirs. In the Permian, Oxy operates reservoirs that collectively contained
approximately 18 billion barrels of original oil in place, hence even small improvements in recovery efficiency can add
significant reserves.
An example of this has been the recent trend towards vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded interval into residual oil
zones or ROZ targets. Over the last few years, we've had an ongoing program of deepening wells with 109 wells
deepened in 2014 and 81 wells planned in 2015.

This activity escapes much attention, because we utilize workover rigs to drill the extra depth into additional
CO2-floodable sections of the reservoir. These low-cost projects add reserves at development rates ranging from $3 to
$7 per BOE. These opportunities exist under many of our CO2 projects, and thus far only a fraction of the CO2 flood
wells have been deepened.
The Permian EOR 2015 capital expenditures will be approximately $500 million to continue expansion of CO2 floods
and water floods. The EOR business is expected to generate free cash flow this year even in the current oil price
environment.
We will complete construction and begin injection at the new South Hobbs project. Additionally, we will also start
construction of a significant expansion at the successful North Hobbs CO2 flood, where CO2 flooding has added a
sustained 5,300 barrels of oil per day to the unit's production since this project began in 2003.
Our EOR business has unrisked gross resource potential of up to 1.9 billion barrels, providing us with a vast inventory
of future CO2 projects which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated depending on market
conditions. Our current strategy for this business is to invest sufficient capital to maintain current production, thereby
providing cash flow to support growth in our Permian Resources business. By exploiting natural synergies between our
EOR and Resources businesses, Oxy is able to deliver unique advantages, efficiencies and expertise across our Permian
Basin operations.
In closing, our 2014 exploration and appraisal programs have successfully set us up for a strong 2015 development
program at Permian Resources. Our portfolio of high quality assets combined with our value-oriented discipline
enables us to deliver efficient growth. We'll execute a focused development strategy in 2015 and continue to pursue
step changes in well productivity and cost structure.
Our first quarter production of 2015 will be negatively impacted by approximately 4,000 BOE per day due to the winter
weather events that occurred in the Permian Basin in January, but we do expect to deliver our previously stated target
of 100,000 BOE per day from Permian Resources in 2015. Our combined EOR and Resources production is significant
and accounts for 15% of the production from the Permian Basin. Our development program, along with the synergies
delivered by our Resources, EOR, and Midstream businesses, have us well-positioned to meet the challenges of this
lower price environment.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Chris.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from
Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks and good morning, everybody. I wonder if I could take two, please. Vicki, this one is
probably for you. I guess, just to be absolutely clear, in this current oil price environment, not the $55 that you've put in
the plan, I guess, but, is the Permian program delivering positive returns? And if you could maybe give some color as
to what royalty ownership or what royalty rates you might have in the program for the current year, I guess, in the
Delaware Basin?
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Yes, Doug. Currently, our program at today's prices will deliver about 15% to 20% rates of
return. And the reason for that is, we had an aggressive program, appraisal program in 2014. So we have – we are

targeting in 2015 our best benches in our best areas. And we've had really good success recently with improving our
completion designs. So we expect the returns to be in the 15% to 20% range. And if you'll refer back to the chart I
included in the presentation in Q3, you'll see that, if you look at the areas where we're developing, I think I have some
numbers there that generally would enable you to get to the net interest.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. And maybe just not to belabor the point, Vicki, but what kind of inventory in terms of at
the current pace the wells that would achieve or the program would achieve that kind of return at $45 oil? Is that like
high-grading the portfolio or is that a multi-year inventory that you believe to achieve that?
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Yeah. We have high-graded the portfolio, but we expect to be able to, at this pace, go at least
three years to five years with the inventory that we have. And if prices continue to improve with respect to the cost
structure, and I'm not – I don't mean prices, oil prices, I mean if our cost structure continues to improve based on prices,
we expect that inventory to increase. So we expect over time to be able to increase the inventory that we have today,
but at today's pace it would be about three years to five years.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. Thank you. My follow up is, I guess, I know there's going to be a lot of other questions on
the operations, but, Steve, I wonder if I could go back just to the progress on the asset sales in the Middle East. Any
updates you can provide, especially now that Al Hosn is on stream and given that the Omani contract expires this year,
could you help us with how you see maybe things changing in this oil price environment, if at all?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, of course, the countries are saying that the prices will quickly rebound once the evil
shale producers stop producing so. So I – but I think until that happens, I think that it's going to be slow. I mean,
obviously, the countries are affected by this and they're actually affected more by the decline in oil prices than anybody
really. So I suspect it to be slow. I think Oman will move along all year. We just don't know what's going on in Abu
Dhabi at this point.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks, everybody.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thanks.
Operator
Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Benedict Sankey>: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Steve, talking again back to the CapEx program, it seems
that you've used the strip to come up with the 2015 number. I just wondered how much lower would you have to take
CapEx if we stay at this more like $45 environment, so, let's say, another year, right?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, for another year, it gets a little more complicated. The capital spending on the
Chemicals and the Midstream stuff will fall off naturally going into next year. So the capital would come down
anyway. We've only built in the cost savings that sort of have been achieved at this point, and there's at least another
$250 million and maybe another $500 million in savings just from the suppliers if prices continue to be low, because
we basically for a lot of them we've indexed the – how much we're paying to the oil price.
So I don't really know exactly what it would be, but I would guess that if you use the – if it's $60, we're covering
everything at the end of the year. There's some other stuff that would be reduced and it's probably a little lower than
$60 actually. And so if you said, okay, it's going to be $10 less, $10 less is $1 billion, so we'd have to reduce the capital
by $1 billion. Most of that we get from suppliers, but there would be some things that would have to be cut.
<Q - Paul Benedict Sankey>: Thank you. That's helpful. And then my follow up would be, have you considered
selling Oxy and have you considered any major acquisitions? Thank you.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Right now people are cash flow challenged, so I suspect selling Oxy is probably not real
likely. But I looked at Chevron. It looks like they don't have any free cash either. So anyway, if you look at – we
haven't considered any major acquisitions. It's way too early to be talking about acquisitions. I think there's still a lot of

whistling in the graveyard going on and way too early to consider any kind of acquisitions. Again, we generally are not
interested in public acquisitions.
<Q - Paul Benedict Sankey>: Got it. Thanks. Helpful. Steve, thank you.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah.
Operator
Our next question is from Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's a nice new name.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: How about that? I had a question about divestitures as well. There's some commentary in the
market about possible divestiture of the Al Hosn project, which you guys have just completed. And so just wanted to
ask, is that a possibility? Just if you could provide some color on that. And again it wasn't your commentary, it was that
from others, but could you just give us an update on the strategic attractiveness of that position?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, let's talk about what it is.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We've already spent the money.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Yeah.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah. So there's not really much capital going forward. There might be an expansion, which
is relatively cheap capital out in a year or so. But putting that aside, so in a crappy oil price environment, it'd probably
generate about $300 million of free cash. In sort of a decent one, about $600 million of free cash a year. So if you
multiply it out by the 25 years that remain roughly, you multiply through so you get somewhere between $7.5 billion
and whatever it is $12.5 billion of cash generated over the 25-year period.
So from our perspective, for a company that pays a lot of dividends and that sort of thing, having that sort of asset
makes good sense to us. If on the other hand, for a variety of reasons somebody wanted to buy 20%, 30% of it to free
up cash for something that maybe works better, I guess, we're open to that.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: But only in a – if you just look at it intrinsically, for somebody who pays a lot of dividends,
I think it's a pretty good asset over time.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. It seems like it. And then also, there was lot of commentary about Oxy's historical
proficiency in enhanced oil recovery, and so I wanted to see how you're thinking about the opportunity in Mexico or
potential opportunity, meaning, do you consider this to be kind of an area of natural alignment for Oxy? And if you do,
how do you think about the opportunity in Mexico?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, I mean, there's two issues like always in foreign activities. One is the quality of the
asset being offered...
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Yeah.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: ... and I think it's intrinsically, they have some decent enhanced oil recovery assets on offer.
The other part of it is, what's the financial arrangements.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: All right.

<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I mean, if you look at some of the other places, I won't say where, but look at some of the
other places where intrinsically the asset might work at $20 a barrel or something like that. But if you lay the contract
over, it doesn't really work at today's prices. And I think that's the issue in Mexico. While the asset may be attractive
and you can get a lot of – if you had 100% of it, it'd be something we'd work pretty well, but they've taken a pretty
aggressive view about contract terms.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Yeah.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think they took the Chinese menu approach where they picked one from every column in
everybody's contract. So I think they got a pretty difficult contract to want to do it, and we're not doing it for
advertising expense. I think we'd rather frankly put the money into the CO2 projects in the United States where we
have low royalties back of this, and in some cases we own the royalties, than to fool around with some ridiculous
contract and hope it gets better over time.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. Thanks a lot, Steve.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thanks.
Operator
Our next question is from Leo Mariani of RBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Hey, guys. Obviously a lot of focus here in terms of how you guys can kind of conservatively
manage things. I wanted to kind of flip the question around and just get a sense, if we do start to see an oil price
recovery in the second half of the year in 2016, kind of, how quickly you can bring rigs back in the Permian?
And then just additionally, is there any kind of loose price framework we should think about where if we do get to $70,
the number where you start adding rigs, anything could help in terms of price would be great.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think the answer to your question is, there's a lot of rigs around the Permian and there's
more available every day. So I don't think bringing rigs back is going to be a problem. I think the program has to be
somewhat disciplined, and so we'll be cautious in adding rigs, because, well, the prices may rebound or may go back
down again. I mean I'm more concerned really about the demand issues in the world than I am how much the U.S.
business is producing.
But I think if you look at it and said, we – clearly, if you hit to $60, the program will be the way we've described it. As
you get to $70, we may be a little more aggressive. And as you get north of $70, I think we'd be somewhat more
aggressive. But I really think that if you look at – if you were able to see the layers inside the company, we've got it all
matrix and we can actually figure what makes sense at whatever price you want. And so our program going forward
would reflect that expectation. But right now our expectation is conservative, I would guess.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: All right. And maybe could you just talk a little bit about the importance of returns on the drilling
program plus kind of versus desire to kind of stay cash flow positive or cash flow neutral? When you include
dividends, obviously, you focused on getting back to this cash flow neutrality exiting the year at $60. So as we think
about a recovery case in 2016, how much are you focused on making sure you don't outspend versus, hey, if the returns
are good at $70, we're willing to outspend. Can you just talk to that?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: You got to be pretty certain about your returns before you outspend. No offense to any oil
engineers, but they tend to be a little more optimistic than the actual outcome. And so the corporate management will
be fairly conservative about that thing. So we need some margin of error.
A lot of damage being done in the business. I think people underestimate the amount of damage being done when this
current down cycle is complete whether it's a year or two years. Everybody's balance sheet is going to be not quite as
good as when they started. I mean, we started in a good spot, but I think even the large companies will have more debt
laden balance sheets and not really much to show for it.

So I think you just got to be pretty careful in this environment about what you're doing. No one really – even though
the price may recover in the back-half of the year, I'm still concerned about world demand for oil although I am
heartened to see that in the United States at least a lower gasoline prices have created more and more people riding
around in big cars. We're doing our part.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: That makes sense.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We're riding around the corner.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: That makes sense for sure. And I guess just lastly in terms of M&A, I just wanted to kind of
clarify some of the comments. You certainly talked about sort of a challenging market for acquisitions at this point in
time. It sounds like the bid/ask spreads haven't reset, but I also hear in the prepared comments that you had made an
acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2014 for 100,000 acres in the Permian for around $1.3 billion. Can you give us some
more color on what you picked up there and what you think about it?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah, it was early in the quarter, probably a little early in the acquisition cycle. We got we
think a price that works in this environment. It's good acreage and we got picked up a modest amount of production. So
the goal of the acquisition program in the Permian is to add to our current position so we can drill more efficiently.
It's not really to get more acreage. We got plenty of acres. I mean the question really is, can we fill in our play what we
currently own and allow us to drill more efficiently without moving the rigs so much. So this sort of acquisition was
designed with that intention that we could – that it would allow us to be more efficient. Without efficiency gains, I
think acquisitions are not very interesting.

Our next question is from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeffrey L. Campbell>: Good morning. First, just a couple of quick Vicki questions. I notice that the Delaware's
Basin second Bone Spring had been re-rated from appraisal to development from last quarter for this one. Is that the
zone that you're focusing on in New Mexico?
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Yes, it is. We're only going to drill second Bone Spring wells in New Mexico in 2015.
<Q - Jeffrey L. Campbell>: Okay. Great. It sounded like the reduced vertical drilling is tied to less appraisal work.
Can you identify which appraisal zones are likely to be most effective to reduce 2015 CapEx?
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: It would really be the zones, the benches that are away from our current development areas.
So, for example, we've appraised the benches at South Curtis Ranch and several in the Barilla Draw area. So what we're
really going to try to do now is, focus on the development in those areas. And our appraisal program was so far ahead.
We still know a lot about some of our other areas. We just wanted to get to manufacturing mode so that we could
improve our cost efficiency. So we're still – we're pretty much way ahead with our appraisal program right now. The
thing that we want to do next is to continue to improve on our completion efficiency.
<Q - Jeffrey L. Campbell>: Thank you. And, Steve, this is the last question. You've spoken some about concerns on
demand. Can you outline where you look for signs of improvement particularly as we all can expect that U.S. oil
production is going to increase as oil prices begin some kind of recovery?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, I think if I look at U.S. oil production, it will probably increase in the first and second
quarter. Maybe the rate of increase in the third quarter will fall off and maybe there'll be some decline in the fourth.
The main consumer of oil today is China. Any recovery in Europe would be helpful, but it's not a driver. And so it's
China and maybe India. Also the Middle East has been a large consumer of oil recently.

And the current environment is, it's just hard to say whether that growth will continue or not. I think the world
economy, I think that's the big question mark going forward. If we get demand growth, lower oil prices stimulate
demand, this current situation will be over fairly quickly. If we don't, this could drag on quite a while.

Our next question is from Jason Gammel of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Thanks. I wanted to ask a question about the importance of operational momentum in the
Permian Basin. And really, where I'm coming from here is you're generating very acceptable returns at current prices,
but that could potentially be significantly higher rates of return assuming a recovery in the oil price. So given that
you're more or less flat on horizontal drilling activity, what stops you from, let's say, having the rig count in the first
half of the year and then moving up to a much higher count at the back-half of the year?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's basically the contractual position we have. We've contracted for some rigs that basically
come off at midyear. And by the time you drill, let's think about the timing, let's say you actually drill a well in the first
quarter, it's the third quarter before it actually produce – you actually get any revenue. So the stuff in the first quarter
will basically be a third and fourth quarter production for us. But I think we have some contracts, so that need to roll
off, and that's really controlling the timing more than anything right now.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Okay. So there's nothing related to utilization of workforce and efficiencies that could be
lost if you did have a sudden shutdown or anything --?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, it's always inefficient. If you just all of a sudden stop in the middle, it's always going
to be a problem. So it's got to be a phase-down, but it's contractual and the notion that maybe there will be some
recovery in the back-half of the year and you need to drill wells sort of in this first and second quarter to have
production in the back-half of the year. We're pretty cautious about the whole thing. You just can't send things to zero.
It's just an impractical thing to do right now.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Sure.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We're doing the best we can to manage through it, and I think we'll be all right.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Okay. And if I could ask one more on a completely unrelated topic, you mentioned that the
restricted cash was used to pay the dividend in the 4Q. Should we think about, in a low price environment, restricted
cash essentially funding the dividend? And how does that affect then the pace of share repurchases? I know you said
the 71 million you still ultimately expect to buy in on the share repurchase program, but could that be a five-year period
or are you thinking more like a two-year period?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We'll start with – I wouldn't get wrapped around the axel on this restricted cash stuff. Cash
is reasonably fungible and all we're doing is showing you the account paying down. It's not really – rather than keep
more restricted, we just say the dividend comes out of that bank account. So it's got to come from somewhere.
We don't really know about the pace. We are price-sensitive. I'd point out that really the domestic program last year had
an F&D, if you just cut through all the BS of $13, $14, and we expect to bring that down some more. So we're running
a pretty profitable program. Maybe not at $25 oil, but certainly in the $50s.
So you know, as far as the pace of the share repurchase, the stocks are volatile and when there's negative volatility – I
guess volatility is always used negatively, but nobody ever talks about upside volatility – but downside volatility,
which I'm sure will come at some point, that's when we'll step up and buy a lot of shares rather than just sort of treat it
as a constant flow. So I don't really know. We've set aside a fair amount of money for that this year, but if prices are
more attractive, we'll spend more. I don't really have a budget in the usual sense of the word.

Our next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on a couple of the earlier questions. First,
you mentioned that you would have flexibility to increase activity if you can get another $250 million in savings. Can
you just talk more to what that scenario looks like?
Would that mean your portfolio would achieve attractive returns at $60 Brent and you'd ramp back up in the areas that
you're currently ramping down, i.e. you'd recommit to the Midcon? Or would you just ultimately look to focus more on
the Permian incrementally when prices come back?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It would be all Permian. The Midcon is, well, putting aside North Dakota, is basically gas.
So the Brent price is sort of irrelevant. And it really can't compete for dollars for quite a while against the Permian.
North Dakota has this huge differential to price right now. So that's really what's discouraging us up there. So I think
you should plan that in a $60 environment, or $65 environment or whatever you're thinking, that we would spend more
in the Permian.
The savings, $250 million, we could add about three rigs on an annual basis to cover that. So I give you it was running
about $100 million a year, so it's probably running a little less now. So, I mean, that's the way to think about how much
more we would do. But we've got a fair inventory. And as prices move up, the inventory obviously expands.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Great. Thanks. And back to the Permian acquisition and looking at that 100,000-acre deal, you
mentioned the strength was the efficiency that it has with existing positions. Based on the placement of your existing
acreage within the Permian, can you just talk to the scope for how many more fill-in acres would be optimal for you
with your acreage positions, and whether you see those opportunities becoming available?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We don't know about opportunities, because some people may have debt, and they probably
don't want to sell for less than their debt. We just don't have any way on pacing that at this point. We don't really know.
If we found more in the Barilla Draw area, that would be real interesting, and there is acreage around there that's held
by others. And a little bit in the Midland Basin that fits with what we have. I don't know whether it's 300,000 acres or
200,000 acres, but it's not millions of acres.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Great. Thank you for the color.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thanks.

Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe a couple more follow up questions on the Permian. Can you
talk a little bit about what you're seeing from a well performance point of view in 2015 and 2016? Production targets
seem largely unchanged despite CapEx cuts. Is this efficiency gains, better well performance, a combination of both?
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: It is. We haven't changed our 2016 target yet, because we're still anticipating that if prices
were to go up, we'd have the flexibility to add rigs. We may have to adjust that a little bit toward the end of this year if
prices remain where they are. But one of the things that we're encouraged with is, we certainly are seeing better
performance, particularly in the Barilla Draw area, and particularly with the last well that I mentioned in the call today.

We're seeing not only opportunities to improve our landing points within the benches but our completion efficiencies
are improving. And so we're really encouraged with what we're seeing there and with what we're seeing from the
Sprayberry in the Midland Basin.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Okay. Thanks. And then maybe on costs at this point, the 2015 budget, your per well budget cost in
the Permian in 2015, what is it relative to 2014 costs? And is that mostly efficiency gains or do you have anything
priced in for price deflation or is that additional upside?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah. We priced about $250 million for cost reductions that we pretty much achieved and
we expect to get some more, but we certainly price that in already. And efficiency gains are built in. Efficiency gains
really come from focusing on a few places rather than going all over creation. I mean, that's really what causes them
and we built that in.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Okay. So additional – I guess, the additional $250 million that you had highlighted on the slides,
there's certainly potential downside from a price deflation point of view, but efficiency gains or at least mark-to-market
from where you guys are right now, I guess?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I guess that's right.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Hi. Good morning, guys. A few quick follow ups from me. First on the buyback, I presume most of
the buyback in 4Q was executed after or in December after the spin?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Sure.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great. And the second, I know that you're price-sensitive and/or I'd say price aware. I mean, so do
you see the flexibility to use your currency for adding assets, if your view was it were to be expensive relative?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, that's a – we've never – I think I used stock once in the last 20 years and have
regretted it ever since. Maybe I've been doing this too long. So – too good of a memory of bad, bad outcomes. If you're
going to use your stock, you really have to make sure that whatever you're doing is significantly accretive.
Cash, at least cash, you're only paying 3% or whatever it is interest. But if you're using stock, we're paying almost 4%
in dividends. But putting – even putting that aside, we don't want to dilute the quality of portfolio with some wacky
deal. And so if you're going to gamble on wackiness, you probably ought to gamble with cash rather than stock.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Right. So maybe a follow up on the Permian acquisition that you made in the quarter. I mean, any
color in terms of location, well inventory?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's a Midland Basin acquisition and I – there's a – what – I mean, just a matter of price. I
mean, when you talk about locations, you've also got to factor in price. I think going in, I thought – I think it was 2,700,
about 2,700 locations.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Okay. And will you expect activity there in 2015, or will that be part of your focus area...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: No, we...

Our last question is from Matt Portillo of TPH. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Merrel Portillo>: Good morning, all.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew Merrel Portillo>: Just a quick follow-up question in regards to your Permian rig count and spending
program. I believe you mentioned you're running roughly 29 rigs coming into the first quarter. I was curious if you
could give us a little bit of color on the cadence of kind of that rig drop as you move through the year to average the 19
rigs in 2015, and then I have a follow-up question in regards to your overall capital program.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Yeah, well, currently we're going to average also 29 rigs in Q1. And then we – as – toward the
end of Q1 we start to ramp down and by Q3, the beginning of Q3, we'll be at 15 rigs and at 15 through the rest of the
year.
<Q - Matthew Merrel Portillo>: Thank you. And then in regards to your corporate capital program, you mentioned
the first quarter will be a bit heavier in terms of CapEx versus the...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: You can see that in the rig count. I mean, it just flows out of that rig count.
<Q - Matthew Merrel Portillo>: Right. And I guess just to maybe try to get a little bit of color around how we should
think about the magnitude of the change on CapEx, is there any color you can provide as we think about kind of the
exit capital program you've talked about in the fourth quarter 2015, how we should kind of think about the magnitude
of the change over the year?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Willie can answer that.
<A - Willie C. W. Chiang>: I would say directionally, it's – we're starting off at about $1.8 billion of Q1 and ramping
down to about $1.2 billion, rough numbers.
<Q - Matthew Merrel Portillo>: Perfect. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.
