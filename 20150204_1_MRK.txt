MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to Merck's fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings call. Today's call is being
recorded.
At this time I would like to turn the call over to Joseph Romanelli, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go
ahead, sir.
Joseph Romanelli
Thank you, Christie, and good morning, everyone. We'd also like to say good afternoon and good evening to everyone
listening outside the United States. Welcome to Merck's fourth quarter 2014 conference call.
Before I turn the call over to Ken, I just want to point out a couple of items. First, you'll see that we have items in our
GAAP results such as the acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that
we have excluded those items from our non-GAAP results. There are reconciliation tables available in our press release
so you can get a better understanding of the underlying performance.
We have also provided tables to help you understand the sales results in the quarter for the business units as well as for
the products. This can be found in table three of our press release and the reconciliation table I mentioned earlier is in
table two of the release. During the call, we will be referring to table two for the P&L and table three is it relates to

revenue.
Second, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call might be considered
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to
significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize,
actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2013 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could
cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements
made this morning. Merck underscores no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, and you can
see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on merck.com.
So with that, this morning I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Schechter,
Present of Global Human Health; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of
Merck Research Labs.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.
Kenneth C. Frazier
Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining the call today.
Our performance this quarter is the result of the proactive steps we are taking to further sharpen our commercial and
R&D focus, redesign our operating model, and reduce our cost base. We are evolving Merck's operating model in
recognition of the evolution underway in healthcare markets across the world and we will continue to focus our
resources on those internal and external opportunities that can generate the most value for patients, customers, and
shareholders.
While we made real progress in 2014, you should all know that we are by no means content. Over the past year, our
greater focus has led to better execution, a point underscored by the effort that led to KEYTRUDA being the first PD-1
inhibitor approved in the United States. Another example of focused execution is restoring JANUVIA's growth. It is
our intention to continue this focused, disciplined execution, especially in areas where we have the greatest
opportunities to grow and to lead.
While we are transforming the way Merck operates and executes, our fundamental strategy has remained consistent.
Our success and our future will continue to be predicated upon what has long defined Merck; innovating at the
intersection of scientific opportunity and global unmet medical need. In short, there is no substitution for innovation,
which we believe remains the best path to intrinsic, long-term value creation. We intend to stay at the forefront of
biopharmaceutical science and innovation.
Now turning to our results. I'm pleased that both on an annual and quarterly basis, excluding exchange, we reported
sales growth in Diabetes, Hospital, Acute Care, and Vaccines, as well as in our Animal Health business. We also
delivered on both our quarterly and full-year non-GAAP EPS commitments. Our core underlying portfolio continues to
perform well, and our commercial organization remains focused on those areas where Merck medicines and vaccines
can make their greatest contributions.
We've also said that an important part of our strategy is actively pursuing the best external opportunities to augment our
portfolio, while divesting products and businesses that we believe can be better maximized outside of Merck. The
divestiture of our Consumer Care business as well as the acquisition of Cubist, are examples of how we are executing
this strategy. As we move into 2015, we'll continue to look for the best opportunities to collaborate with academia and
pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms to bring forward the next generation of medical breakthroughs that can deliver
value to patients, physicians and payers, and fuel our future.

Our increased commercial focus, acquisition of key assets, and an unprecedented number of regulatory approvals in
2014 will enable us to launch several new innovative products in 2015, each with the potential to serve a critical unmet
medical need. We are poised to capitalize on each of these opportunities. I'm pleased that last year, we not only
achieved six new product approvals in the U.S., but also made steady progress in advancing our late-stage pipeline.
We now have over 10 Phase III programs targeting many of the world's largest public health needs. Roger will talk
more about the exciting programs in our pipeline shortly but let me reiterate, our industry is built on a foundation of
innovation. Effectively pursuing the most promising scientific discoveries both internally and externally ultimately will
be the key differentiator in determining companies' ability to create long-term value for their shareholders and society.
Reducing our operating costs has allowed us to respond more rapidly to changes in the healthcare environment, drive
greater profitability, and invest in our late-stage portfolio. A little over a year ago, we pledged to reduce R&D and
SG&A costs by $2.5 billion by the end of 2015, and I'm pleased to say that we are on track to meet this goal.
Finally, we have not lost focus on the importance of returning cash to our shareholders. The past year allowed us to
return approximately $13 billion to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. In 2015, our framework
for deploying capital will remain consistent. We will balance investing in our business with funding compelling
business development opportunities, and we remain firmly committed to returning cash to our shareholders.
Today, Merck has the opportunity to reduce the burden of disease in five of the most significant global health battles:
cancer, Hepatitis C, cardio-metabolic disease, resistant microbial infection, and Alzheimer's disease. This is only
possible because of our unwavering commitment to the discovery and development of transformational medicines, and
our willingness to challenge how we operate. These are both important forms of innovation and both will enhance our
ability to thrive in a changing healthcare environment and produce long-term value for patients, customers, society, and
shareholders.
In closing, we are continuing the strong momentum we achieved in 2014. We've made significant strides in our
strategic initiatives and accomplished groundbreaking milestones in our R&D labs. Moving forward, we expect to
continue making major progress in advancing our late-stage pipeline, gaining first-in-class approvals, and launching
new innovative products.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Adam Schechter.
Adam H. Schechter
Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone.
This morning I'll provide you with an overview of the Global Human Health fourth quarter results, but I'll also provide
you with some context on 2015's outlook. My comments will be on a constant currency basis.
We finished 2014 with solid performance. Sales reached $9.4 billion in the fourth quarter, and they reflected growth in
our four core areas of Diabetes, Hospital Acute Care, Vaccines, and Oncology, and those were partly offset by
Hepatitis C market dynamics and product divestitures. If you exclude the divestitures, sales grew 3%.
First, I will review performance of several key products, and then I'll provide an update by region and I'll begin with
JANUVIA. The JANUVIA franchise reached approximately $1.7 billion in sales and grew 6% in the quarter and 4%
for the full year. In the fourth quarter sales in the United States grew 5%. Our increased focus and investments enabled
us to defend our 75% market share and to grow the DPP-4 class. In our international markets, sales grew 6%. Europe
and emerging markets continued to grow on strong demand. In Japan, sales declined as a result of DPP-4 class
repricing and the competitive environment. We committed to grow JANUVIA in 2014 and our team worked hard to
deliver on that commitment. We are entering 2015 with momentum to deliver another year of growth.
Next in Hospital and Specialty Care, sales of ISENTRESS were approximately $420 million in the fourth quarter, a
decline of 1%. Internationally, we drove growth in Europe on continued volume increases. Emerging market sales grew
as a result of demand and of tenders. In the United States, sales declined due to a tough year-over-year comparison and

competitive dynamics. On a full-year basis, ISENTRESS grew 3%. We expect continued competitive pressure in 2015
and we believe that based on its efficacy and tolerability that ISENTRESS will remain a compelling treatment option
for physicians.
Sales of our immunology products reached approximately $750 million in the fourth quarter, growing 5%. SIMPONI
remains the fastest growing anti-TNF in the markets where we promote the brand.
REMICADE sales declined 3%, reflecting biosimilar competition in smaller E.U. markets partially offset by growth in
core markets. For the full year, our immunology business grew 10%. However, we will lose patent protection for
REMICADE this month across the remainder of our European markets. We expect competition for biosimilars to begin
upon patent expiry. While we believe that we will retain many current patients being treated with REMICADE, we will
face increased competition for new patients and there will be mandatory price reductions in certain markets.
In Hospital Acute Care sales were approximately $650 million and grew by 12% this quarter. We saw continued uptake
of BRIDION in Europe and emerging markets as well as solid performances from our antibiotic and anti-fungal
treatments. Our Hospital Acute Care business grew 11% for the full year. In 2015, we expect continued growth, driven
by the strength of our legacy brands and the acquisition of Cubist. As a global leader in Hospital Acute Care, we look
forward to this business being a significant contributor to growth for Merck.
Now tuning to our Vaccine business. In the fourth quarter, vaccine sales grew 18% to $1.6 billion. Growth was driven
by pediatric vaccines, Pneumovax, and ZOSTAVAX, and they were partially offset by GARDASIL. Sales of
ZOSTAVAX were $285 million in the quarter, the highest quarter of sales of the brand. In the United States sales grew
7%, in part as a result of our new DTC campaign. Internationally, sales grew 15%. We're now launching in more than
25 markets globally. GARDASIL sales declined 6% due to timing of customer purchases as well as fewer catch-up
cohort vaccinations in certain emerging markets.
We look forward to the launch of GARDASIL 9 in the U.S. in the coming months. The ACIP is expected to discuss
GARDASIL 9 at its meeting in late February. We see GARDASIL 9 as the best-in-class HPV vaccine that will offer
greater protection against cervical cancer and build upon our legacy in this important market. On a full year basis our
Vaccine business grew 4% to sales of $5.7 billion. Vaccines remains an important core focus area in 2015.
Now turning to some geographic commentary for the fourth quarter. Sales increased 1% in the U.S., but decreased 4%
in Europe. In both regions, we drove growth in JANUVIA and Hospital Acute Care. But sales were impacted by
continued declines in Hepatitis C portfolio and from product divestitures. Sales in Japan grew 1% despite increases in
Pneumovax sales, the biannual price decreases and ophthalmology product divestitures, impacted growth this quarter.
Additionally in Japan, we launched BELSOMRA in November, and we are encouraged by the early results of our
launch efforts and from feedback by physicians. Sales in emerging markets grew 7%, driven by strong performance in
China, which grew 14%. Mexico and Turkey also contributed meaningfully to emerging market growth this quarter.
Now I'll spend a few moments speaking about the KEYTRUDA launch. We have made significant progress in bringing
KEYTRUDA to patients in the United States and through our expanded access program in several markets around the
world. Sales of KEYTRUDA were $50 million in the fourth quarter. Important to the early success of our launch is the
strong market access we secured for KEYTRUDA. Virtually all claims for the label indication are reimbursed without
restriction within two months. In December, through broad acceptance of academic centers and community treaters, we
estimate roughly 2,000 patients were receiving treatment with KEYTRUDA. These figures indicate rapid uptake in
patients fighting refractory metastatic melanoma. Furthermore, we continue to fortify our Oncology business unit as we
prepare for potential launches in other tumors, such as non-small lung cancer. We are investing to be a global leader in
Oncology.
Now I'll briefly discuss 2015. 2015 will be an exciting year for Merck with current and new product launches. We'll be
launching GARDASIL 9, and as we speak, the launch meetings for ZERBAXA and BELSOMRA are occurring in the
United States. We also look forward to the potential launch of BRIDION in the United States later this year. And of
course, we will continue to maximize the potential for KEYTRUDA.

In summary, Global Human Health executed on our strategy in 2014. We focused investments in priority commercial
areas and priority markets. We drove growth in JANUVIA, in Hospital Acute Care and in Vaccines. We acquired key
assets from Cubist with near-term revenue and good long-term growth prospects to solidify our leadership position in
Hospital Acute Care. We divested several non-core products and franchises to increase our focus while reducing our
costs. And at the same time, we executed on our robust launch of KEYTRUDA. I believe that the strength of our
underlying business, our commercial strategy, and our new launch opportunities position us well for future growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis.
Robert M. Davis
Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone.
As Ken and Adam shared with you, 2014 was a year of strong execution and solid performance for Merck. From a
financial perspective, we're leading a transformation of the business and are on track to achieve our strategic goals by
sharpening our focus.
From a deal perspective, we executed a significant number of business development deals in 2014. From our divestiture
of the Consumer Care business to the acquisitions of Idenix, Cubist and OncoEthics, our deal strategy shows we are
focusing our business on our core areas, which we believe will help drive future growth.
We are also making steady progress to change the business model and achieve our cost production goals. Consistent
with our guidance for 2014, we were successful in lowering our M&A and R&D expenses below 2013 levels. This
drove a leveraged P&L and is an example of how we've changed the way we're operating.
For shareholders, 2014 was a significant year from a capital allocation perspective. We returned approximately $13
billion to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. This was a record year for Merck in terms of
returning cash to shareholders and shows our commitment to being operationally focused and shareholder-minded.
Lastly, we met our guidance targets in 2014. We achieved the top end of our EPS guidance range by delivering $3.49
of earnings. Our performance throughout the year shows that we will manage our business to achieve our financial
goals.
Now turning to the fourth quarter and as a reminder, my remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. Total
company revenues were $10.5 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 7% year-over-year, which includes a negative 3%
impact from foreign exchange. This decrease reflects $600 million in lost sales due to divestitures including the sale of
the Consumer Care business to Bayer and approximately $200 million from the now-ended joint venture with
AstraZeneca. Excluding these items as well as the impact from patent expiries and foreign exchange, the underlying
business grew 3% in the quarter.
As Adam stated, sales in the Pharmaceutical business were driven by growth in our core areas, offset by divestitures
and competition for our Hep C vaccine franchise. Animal health delivered a strong quarter with revenues of $885
million, an increase of 8% year-over-year, excluding exchange. We had strong growth throughout our portfolio across
both species and regions. We continued to see the benefit from the launch of BRAVECTO, which is now in 30
markets. The Animal Health business grew 5% ex-exchange, and for the full year 2014, and we continue to expect
mid-single-digit growth in 2015.
Now moving to expenses. Gross margin was 74.6% in the quarter, which represents a 160 basis point increase
year-over-year. Full your gross margin of 73.9% was approximately 40 basis points below prior year, in line with our
guidance. For operating expenses, we continue to manage our costs base and met our fourth quarter guidance. For the
full year, we reduced our operating expenses by $1.3 billion year-over-year by disproportionally focusing our resources
on key clinical programs, core brands, and new product launches. We remain on track to deliver $2.5 billion of cost
savings versus our 2012 base by the end of 2015.

Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 20% and 24.3% for the full year. The quarterly and full year rates
reflect a benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit for 2014. Taken together, we earned $0.87 per share in the
fourth quarter as compared to $0.88 per share in the prior year and delivered full-year EPS at the high end of our
guidance range.
Now as we turn to guidance and our outlook for 2015. On the top line, we expect revenue to be $38.3 billion to $39.8
billion in 2015 using mid-January exchange rates. This range takes into account several key assumptions including the
negative impact of generic and biosimilar competition, approximately $1 billion of net lost sales from acquisitions and
divestitures and $500 million from the end of AstraZeneca joint venture. Additionally, this range reflects $2.6 billion of
negative impact of revenue due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against virtually all other currencies.
This foreign exchange headwind will also impact our EPS in 2015. At mid-January rates we expect non-GAAP EPS to
be in the range of $3.32 to $3.47 which reflects a $0.27 impact from foreign currency. If you exclude the impact of
exchange, we expect mid-single-digit EPS growth in 2015. We also expect EPS in the first half of the year to be lower
than EPS in the second half of the year. On a GAAP basis, we expect to earn between $1.62 and $1.91 in 2015.
Now I would look to provide some additional color on the other elements we have built into our EPS guidance. We
expect product gross margin to be 75 to 100 basis points higher year-over-year as we see margin expansion from the
divestiture of lower margin businesses and products, improving product mix, and manufacturing cost improvements. In
2015, we expect operating expenses overall to be lower year-over-year. For our marketing and administrative expense,
we expect a decline versus 2014 as we continued focus on our operating model.
For research and development, we plan to invest in our innovative late-stage pipeline, and therefore expect a modest
increase in our R&D line year-over-year. Altogether, we remain on track to achieve our target of a $2.5 billion
reduction in expenses off of the 2000 base by the end of 2015. I'm sorry, that was a 2012 base.
Regarding tax, we expect the full-year tax rate to be 22% to 23%. As in prior years, our guidance does not assume a
renewal of the R&D tax credit in 2015. Finally, we project average diluted shares outstanding will be approximately
2.86 billion for 2015, reflecting a decrease versus the prior year.
In summary, 2014 was a year of focused execution for Merck. Our commitment to the strategic reshaping of our
company has been evident in the actions we've taken over the past year. We've been able to execute against our goals
while thoughtfully removing expenses from our operating base and continuing to drive productivity in our commercial
business and in our labs.
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger.
Roger M. Perlmutter
Thanks, Rob.
The fourth quarter saw increased investment in discovery research, clinical development, and in regulatory affairs
activities at Merck Research Laboratories.
Turning first to product registrations, in December we obtained FDA approval for GARDASIL 9, our nine-valent
human papilloma virus vaccine. As previously discussed, this vaccine will permit immunization against more than 90%
of HPV strains associated with the development of cervical cancer.
Summing over the calendar year, in 2014 we received U.S. approval for more new molecular entities, that is new drugs
and vaccines, than in any previous year in the history of Merck & Company. Also during the fourth quarter, we
submitted our file supporting the registration BRIDION, for which we had previously received a complete response
letter. It is our expectation that the FDA will convene an Advisory Committee in the BRIDION file with an action
expected in the second quarter of this year.

On the development side, we continue to make progress in the evaluation of grazoprevir, elbasvir, together known as
our doublet therapy, for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection. Phase III studies for this once-daily therapy were
fully enrolled during the fourth quarter which, assuming that these data recapitulate what we have described previously
in our Phase II program, should permit FDA filing in the first half of 2015. Results from some of these Phase III studies
demonstrating the favorable attributes of our doublet therapy will be presented at the European Liver Meetings to be
held in Vienna in April.
As noted in our press release, last week the U.S. FDA informed us of their intention to rescind our breakthrough
designation for grazoprevir, elbasvir for the treatment of genotype-1 HCV infection, based on the availability of newly
registered drugs that address this medical need. We intend to discuss this matter with the agency in the coming weeks. I
will remind you that data presented during the AASLD meetings in November demonstrated the potential of our HCV
doublet therapy to provide impressive sustained virologic responses in the vast majority of infected patients,
irrespective of comorbidities.
We also provided data on our polymerase inhibitor now called MK-3682, which we hope to use as part of future triplet
therapy for HCV infection. A robust Phase II program testing MK-3682 in combination with doublet therapies is
already underway, and we expect to initiate Phase III studies with MK-3682 by the end of the year.
Also in the fourth quarter, we provided data at the Society for Melanoma Research on the treatment of patients with
advanced metastatic melanoma with KEYTRUDA. In a randomized trial compared with chemotherapy, the objective
response rate was 21% versus 4% for chemotherapy at the labeled KEYTRUDA dose, and the hazard ratio for
progression-free survival was 0.57, favoring KEYTRUDA.
We continue to study KEYTRUDA in earlier lines of therapy for malignant melanoma. Data from our KEYNOTE-006
study comparing KEYTRUDA with ipilimumab in first- or second-line therapy in advanced disease will become
available by mid-year, and we have registration-enabling studies ongoing or planned in six other tumor types. As
previously disclosed, we intend to file for approval of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in
mid-2015.
In December we also announced the acquisition of OncoEthics, which provides us with access to their leaving BET
domain antagonist for hematologic and other malignancies, and I will have more to say about this molecule during
future earnings calls.
The fourth quarter saw important progress in other therapeutic areas. In November, we presented the results of the
IMPROVE-IT trial, demonstrating that VYTORIN provides significant benefit versus simvastatin in reducing the risk
of major cardiovascular events in patients hospitalized following an acute coronary syndrome. The fact that two
different mechanisms of LDL cholesterol lowering, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, that is statins, and cholesterol
absorption inhibitors, that is ZETIA, both reduced cardiovascular risk, suggests that LDL cholesterol is itself the target
of action of these drugs, and augurs well for our favorable outcome in the REVEAL study of anacetrapib. Although an
interim analysis of REVEAL will take place in 2015, we expect the trial to continue to an event-driven completion.
Also in the metabolic disease area, we have been informed by the Executive Committee of the TECOS study that they
expect to have results available for presentation at the American Diabetes Association meetings in June. The trial is
being administered by the Duke Clinical Research Institute and is currently still accruing data.
As Ken mentioned, we are delighted to have the opportunity to form common cause with colleagues in the Cubist
research and development organization. We've just embarked upon a holistic review of Cubist programs, but suffice it
to say that this group complements our already strong programs in anti-viral agents and vaccines.
Finally, I should note that our 2015 schedule promises to be exceptionally busy with substantial new data becoming
available across all of our major programs. I look forward to sharing this information with you on future calls.

Okay, great. Thank you, Roger. And, Christie, I think we're ready to turn it over to the Q&A portion of the call. And
why don't we go ahead and take our first caller?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Yeah, hi. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just a couple on the Hep C breakthrough
therapy designation being rescinded. This has got to have implications on other companies that have received
breakthrough therapies designations for their products, so is there any other color you can provide on the back and forth
around this decision? Did you have a sense this was coming? Or was this a real surprise to you when it came last week?
And then just on the pricing side, a lot of investor focus there as well in Hep C. Are the dynamics in that market
playing out in terms of pricing similar to the way you expected? Is it changing in any way how you view the longevity
of this market?
And then maybe if I could just throw in along pricing, is there any comments you could give on the PD-1 in terms of
access and in the level of discounting necessary there, given that Bristol has a somewhat similar asset as well? Thanks.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Sure, Vamil. Let me just – this is Roger. Let me just comment with respect to
breakthrough designation. We continue to have the sorts of discussions that we've been having with the agency with
regard to our doublet therapy, which we're very excited about. Breakthrough designation, of course, doesn't affect our
filing strategy, and the data are the data. We have our Phase III data and we're moving along with our program.
The agency has invited us to comment on their intent to withdraw breakthrough designation, and we intend to have
those discussions with the agency, and we'll see where that goes. But meanwhile, we're moving forward with our
program. And Adam, I think you have some more.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yeah, hi, Vamil. So with regard to Hepatitis C first, the first thing I want to say is that it is
still a large market. There's over 3 million patients in the U.S. alone and 100 million patients worldwide, so we believe
that this is a market that will be sustainable for a long period of time. Whenever there's competitors, there's going to be
increased competition in the U.S. on pricing and rebates. And although the magnitude may be discussed, I think the fact
that there is competition is not a surprise at all.
The good news is as we look at our success in managed care over the years, we've had a lot of success across every
therapeutic area that we compete within, whether it be diabetes or cholesterol or HIV, even HCV when we had
VICTRELIS in the marketplace. So we still feel good that we'll be able to compete in the competitive environment with
our very strong managed care capabilities. And I want to remind you, we have the doublet coming, which we're excited
about, but we're also excited about the potential of a triplet in the future as well.
As you look at KEYTRUDA, so we are very pleased with the market access that we have today and the fact that
reimbursement is happening very quickly for the proved indication. We continue to believe that the market is going to
reward innovation, particularly innovation that is going to lead to improved clinical outcomes over the current
therapies. And if you look at KEYTRUDA, the key is building a wall of data around that product; and we've got a very
broad clinical program with over 60 studies, and we're looking at KEYTRUDA in monotherapy as well as in
combination therapies, and we believe as that data comes out it will continue to reinforce the value proposition that we
have for KEYTRUDA.

So we're pleased with the initial access, and we're going to continue to compete very effectively in that marketplace as
well.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Thanks, Vamil. And, Christie, next caller?
Operator
Your next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bernstein.
<Q - Timothy Minton Anderson>: Thank you. A couple of questions on KEYTRUDA and then on REMICADE. On
KEYTRUDA, can you give us an updated timing on KEYNOTE-010, which is Phase III in lung cancer survival data.
Clin Trial seems to suggest that it could report out later this year. And on that will there be an interim look at any point
at those results?
And second KEYTRUDA question, can you comment on how you view the impact of KEYTRUDA from the new
compendia listing that supports the use of both your product and Opdivo in first-line melanoma? It seems like an
unexpected win for you guys given the fact that, at least to my knowledge, you don't have any first-line melanoma data
yet, yet NCCN just recently gave you this recommendation.
And then on REMICADE pricing in Europe, in Norway the product – the biosimilar product looks like it's coming in at
something like a 60% discount. I know that's a small market, but I'm wondering if you can talk about where you think
biosimilar pricing might land in major markets in Europe in 2015?
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: So, Roger, do you want to comment on KEYNOTE-010?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: So with respect – Tim, with respect to KEYNOTE-010, this trial, as with most all the
others, is an event-driven trial, and so the overall survival results will be looked at as a function of the number of events
that occur in order to be adequately powered to see a difference, which we would hope, would anticipate, would exist.
So we can't really predict what the timing will be. The timing that is in clinicaltrials.gov is our best estimate of what
we're expecting and we, of course, have a Data Safety Monitoring Board that's reviewing these data. There always
could be changes in terms of what's seen and they might call us and want us to look at it, but that's really the status of
the trial as it currently stands.
I would just like to say that with respect to melanoma data, the question that Adam will take on, but we do have a
considerable amount of data in all lines of therapy in melanoma, which we presented in various different settings, so we
have a lot of efficacy data that's already available and in the first-line setting in ipi [ipilimumab] naïve patients.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: So, Tim, let me give some context on KEYTRUDA and then I'll get directly to your
question on NCCN. So we believe there's about 2,000 patients that were being treated in December, and we believe that
virtually all those patients were treated on the current label. And to give you some perspective on compendia, if you
look at the approval in 2014, NCCN compendia guidelines added KEYTRUDA for melanoma treatment consistent
with our label very quickly.
But as you mentioned, in mid-January, NCCN updated the guidelines for melanoma, and they broadened their
recommendations for melanoma, and I'll give you a sense of what they did. First, there was consensus among NCCN
panel that KEYTRUDA and Opdivo has a higher response rate and less toxicity compared to ipilimumab. Second, both
drugs are included as options for first-line treatment and included on the list of preferred regimens.
So, although we promote on label only, it's clearly a positive for the anti-PD-1 class, and it's a positive for the future of
cancer treatment. So we'll see how this plays out over the coming months. But we believe, obviously, it's a positive for
the class.
And if you look at REMICADE, I think there's a couple of things to think about. First of all, we had continued growth
of SIMPONI, but we had a decline in REMICADE of 3%. And we are certainly starting to see some impact from the
20% of markets that had availability of biosimilars last year, and Norway is one of those. And what we saw in Norway

is, first of all, it's been available for over a year. It was launched in October 2013, the biosimilar. And I don't want to
comment on the commercial strategy of the competitors, but we have seen this tender at a very sharp discount, as you
mentioned. But our expectation remains that customers will continue to take a measured approach in how they use
biosimilars, and especially for the patients who are well-controlled, at least at this early stage as we go into the broader
European markets.
So therefore, we believe in the broader European markets, we will see significant price decreases from the competition,
but that it will impact primarily the new patients coming in. Therefore, we'll try to hang on to the existing patients for
as long as we can.
At the same time, there will be certain markets, like France and Spain, that even if you hold 100% of market share,
because of reference pricing, we're going to have a lower price there, no matter what happens in terms of market share.
So we'll be monitoring in discussing that as we get through this year. And the key for us is to continuing to have strong
growth of SIMPONI, and as you saw, SIMPONI grew about 40% in the fourth quarter versus prior year fourth quarter.
So we are seeing good growth there. I'll say, though, that we don't expect the growth of SIMPONI to offset the decline
in REMICADE as we are in 2015.
<Q - Timothy Minton Anderson>: Thank you.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay. Thank you, Tim, and, Christie, next caller?

Your next question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes. Can you give us a little bit more color on the Animal Health, it seems to have gotten
much stronger?
Second, can you talk about the FX impact on the expense side for this year? You mentioned, obviously a lot of color on
the top line.
And then just update us on when we're going to see the Phase III data for the C. diff product? Thanks.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: So, Rob, do you want to talk about FX and expense for 2015?
<A - Robert M. Davis>: Sure. So as you look at foreign currency in the prepared comments, as we mentioned, given
what we've seen really since September of last year, the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus pretty much
all currencies, we are seeing an impact. And as we said in our prepared comments, we see $0.27 of potential FX impact
built into our assumptions. As we look at how this flows through the P&L, we do get some natural hedge ability
through our numbers, and we are hedging actively in the marketplace, but we can only offset a small percentage of the
impact. And in fact, I would call it more blunting of the impact than the ability to mitigate it.
As we look at the flow-through from sales to EPS, you will see it flow through at a slightly greater rate due to the fact
that we do have more expenses in U.S. dollar driven primarily due to our R&D expenses in the United States, and our
headquarter expenses, relative to the percentage of our revenues. So that's all kind of the dynamic of what's playing
through in the numbers you've seen. But as I mentioned in the prepared comments, if you exclude FX from an earnings
perspective, we actually grew, we will be growing from 2014 to 2015.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: So on Animal Health, you can see the fourth quarter showed very strong performance from
our Animal Health unit, and overall 2014 was a very strong year. And the good news is that it is driven by strength
across all regions and all species. And in particular in companion animals it was really supported, as we said, by the
launch of BRAVECTO, which is underway all over the world. And this year, we're looking forward to mid-single-digit
growth in 2015. We've also said that we will continue to look for opportunities to augment our Animal Health business
in ways that create overall value for our shareholders. So we're very excited by that business and it is performing very

well.
<A - Robert M. Davis>: It might be worth adding that recall that we've now lapped the ZILMAX impact, so part of
what you're seeing is the strengthening quarter-on-quarter, or quarter, fourth quarter of this year versus fourth quarter of
last year is in fact the fact that ZILMAX is now out of that compare.

Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Oh, thanks for the questions. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Yes, we can hear you, Seamus.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Okay, great. So just first off, I wanted to get a little bit of color on the tax rate and the
significant drop in the tax rate. Rob, can you just give us a little color on what the changes are there, particularly in the
context of a – no R&D credit actually being incorporated into that number?
And then the second question is for Roger. Roger, can you help me understand a little bit more the differentiation about
– between the tests and the biomarker – the potential availability of a biomarker? A competitor just received
breakthrough designation on the basis of PD-L1 status so I'm just wondering, will Merck, or would you expect Merck,
to have their diagnostic available or the Dako diagnostic available within the context of the lung cancer filing? And
then also, would it be available at launch? I think there's a lot of confusion amongst investors as to the realities of the
PD-L1 biomarker tests. Thanks.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay. So, Rob?
<A - Robert M. Davis>: Yes, so good morning. I'll answer the first question around tax. There are really several things
contributing to the decrease in our tax rate year-over-year. First, the divestiture of the Consumer Care business is
expected to benefit our 2015 tax rate given the fact that the majority of the U.S. Consumer Care, of the Consumer Care
business was a U.S.-based business and that more than offsets the fact that there is a slight impact and then from a
negative perspective to the acquisition of Cubist. So net of acquisitions and divestitures, we actually see a benefit
flowing through our tax rate.
And then outside of these factors, we do have favorable product and geographic mix year-on-year. We have some
one-time items, I don't want to get into them, but flowing through. And then but probably most importantly, we have
and continue to look for specific strategies to actively manage the tax rate going forward, and why don't we give
longer-term guidance. Clearly that is something we're very focused on and will continue to see as an important
contributor.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay, Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: And, Seamus, just on PD-L1 biomarker, so first with respect to what it's actually good
for in non-small cell lung cancer, there is no doubt that there is a correlation between PD-L1 expression in the
pre-treatment specimens and response rate, progression-free survival, than we measure after treatment. So we will in
fact have the Dako-associated PD-L1 antibody test for immuno-histochemistry available for filing and available for use
with the drug, because that is an important aspect of treating patients.
On the other hand, it is important to recognize that PD-L1 is not an absolute predictor of responsiveness. That is to say
that there are PD-L1 negative patients who nevertheless respond to therapy. So the issue will be how to capture in
labeling language the way in which to use this test. It's not an absolutely predictive biomarker, but it is an important
indicator of prognosis with respect to response.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay, great. Thank you, Seamus. And, Christie, next caller?

Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Oh, hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate all the clarity. Several but very
short, one on JANUVIA, Adam. What – in the U.S. in 2014, would you mind giving us the volume versus price
component? Particularly curious about price. What happened to your net price in 2014?
And then on the CETP, Roger, you mentioned your expectation is that's going to go to final analysis. I just want to be
clear, so you're basically telling us that you just don't expect that to be stopped early? And any expansion on that
comment would be appreciated.
And then on TECOS, if I may, you mentioned ADA, that you'll have the data, but should investors expect a top line
release before that? Yes or no? Thanks a lot.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: So hi, Mark. This is Adam. With regards to JANUVIA in the U.S., there was some
positive impact from price, but it's mostly from volume. And if you look at TRx volume and you look at whether it's
the current week or rolling 12 weeks, you're seeing anywhere from a 6% to 7% increase for same-week or same rolling
12-week time period in the prior year. So a little bit from price, but mostly volume.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah, and, Mark, it's Roger. On CETP, yes, I think it's very unlikely that the study would
be stopped early. It is important in general to the Executive Committee of the study, I think speaking for those groups
that are involved, Oxford and TIMI, they're extremely anxious to have a definitive answer with respect to the question
of whether HDL elevation of the kind that you achieve with anacetrapib through CETP inhibition actually has a
meaningful additive or better effect on cardiovascular outcomes when used in combination with – when used as a
treatment for cardiovascular risk.
And keep in mind again as you know well, Mark, that anacetrapib lowers LDL cholesterol dramatically, so my
comments were meant to say that since we know that LDL cholesterol lowering is itself associated with a favorable
outcome, one expects a favorable outcome. The question that's being asked is, can we do still more through CETP
inhibition? I think we'll go to the end trying to find that out. Of course, we're all looking very carefully at safety all
along the way and that could be a reason to stop the study, but on efficacy I think it's very unlikely to stop at an interim,
I think it will go to completion.
And then with respect to TECOS, we just have to see what the data look like. We're – we – the study is being of course
run by an independent executive committee, Duke Center is coordinating it, they're going to pull together the data.
They are – believe that they're going to be able to pull that together in time for presentation at the ADA meetings. And
depending on what we see, I mean, that will decide how that's announced to you and to the public at large.

commentary, Adam, you gave on REMICADE. I think you've indicated, in France and Spain there's been some
reference pricing. What is your – across the major European countries, what is your assumption about price
compression across the major European countries in your plan for that franchise?

And then the second question on your HIV strategy, Roger, ISENTRESS and [indiscernible] (49:12) in a combination,
secured approval on it, can you talk about doravirine product profile, timing for completion of Phase III trials and how
that fits into a more broader combination strategy with the other assets that you have within the HIV portfolio?
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay. Adam?
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yes. So – hi, John. So first of all with regard to REMICADE, it's hard to say because
you've never had a product of this magnitude have biosimilar competition in major European markets and it's hard to
predict based upon what happened in the smaller markets as to exactly what will happen in large markets. What we're
assuming is that we can maintain a large number of the currently-treated patients and we'll see the most pressure in new
patients coming into the markets. The immediate mandatory price reductions, there's really four or five markets where
that occurs, specifically France, Spain, Austria, and Belgium. And those are market that it's going to depend on what
the biosimilars do in other parts of Europe in terms of competition and what they do discount versus how they try to
compete for the business in certain other markets.
So what we've assumed is that we keep the majority of patients. There will be some pricing pressure. If you look at the
overall franchise, we think that it will decline versus the prior year because the growth in SIMPONI, which will remain
strong, will not offset the pressure that we'll see on the REMICADE and the price erosion, but it's just too early to
know exactly what could happen. We've seen discounts so far of approximately 30% but then you see what happened
in Norway, which was more steep than that. So we'll have to see where they go and we'll report over time what we see
in the marketplace.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay. Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: John, with respect to HIV strategy, without going into an enormous amount of detail and
the totality of it, as you know, ISENTRESS is an extremely important platform for therapy, and the data that we
prescribed last year from the ADVANCE study that demonstrate that moving ISENTRESS to once-daily platform
obviously is something that is important to do. MK-1439, doravirine, is intended ultimately if it reaches its objectives,
to replace efavirenz, which is another platform, and the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor category, what
we know is that this is an extremely important aspect of combination therapy, and yet there are some real concerns
about the ability of patients to adhere to efavirenz because of adverse experiences. 1439 has very favorable properties,
doravirine has very favorable properties.
We're expecting to see – we're in Phase III now for that study, we're expecting to see data in the 2016, late 2016
timeframe, and based on what those data show us, then we'll be in a position to put that molecule in combination with
the other programs that we have, including ISENTRESS. So that's an aspect. There are many, many aspects of
combination therapy and that gives you a sense of where we think we are right now.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay, great. Thanks. And, Christie, your next caller?

Your next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jay Olson>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. It's Jay Olson on behalf of Jami. A couple of questions for Roger.
The first question is about Hep C from a regulatory perspective. With the recent approvals of oral Hep C regimens,
does it change the way you plan to run your Phase III program? And specifically, will you include the new standard of
care as an active comparator in your Phase III studies?
And then second, can you update us on the development plans for MK-4166? When should we expect to see clinical
data, and when should we look for new studies to be posted on clinicaltrials.gov? Thank you.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Okay. First of all, for the Hep C program, our Phase III studies, the first wave of Phase
III studies that support registration are essentially complete. So those data are being prepared, and our expectation is
that we are going to be able to file the Hep C program in the first half of this year. That's what we've said. And so there

is really no change to those programs that we can engineer at this point. The studies are done, and of course those
studies were studies that we designed following lots of discussions with the FDA.
So that's kind of where we are with respect to those. And we're looking forward to having the opportunity to describe
those data to you, and the data will be presented in significant part at EASL.
With respect to 4166, which others know as our GITR agonist program, which is one of the combination programs in
our immuno-oncology program, it's in Phase 1, has been since the middle of last year, data are accruing, and we hope to
have the opportunity to share this data with you in the not-too-distant future.

Your next question comes from Colin Bristow of Bank of America.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Just a few quick ones. On odanacatib, can
you give us an update on the progress towards regulatory submission?
On the business development front, can you give us an update on your strategy with respect to therapeutic areas of
interest and optimal deal size and whether any of this had been impacted at all by the recent high profile pricing
headlines?
And then finally, on the Animal Health business, are there any specific internal reviews scheduled with regards to the
potential divestiture of this unit, or is this more of an ongoing fluid process? Thanks.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: So with respect to refining the overall portfolio, not with respect to animal health
specifically, we continue to evaluate our strategy and our opportunities to create greater value for shareholders and for
customers. I have said very clearly that we see animal health as a great business. We are very interested in that
business. We're looking to augment that business.
From a business development standpoint, first of all, we do remain committed to business development as a way of
augmenting our pipeline with programs that, as Roger said, provide unambiguous promotable advantage and while we
had a significant number of deals last year, including Cubist, Idenix and OncoEthix, in 2015, we will also pursue the
right kinds of deals, which for us are bolt-on opportunities that will either drive our pipeline, which of course is the
most important thing to our future growth, or we might pursue additional commercial assets, if we believe that we have
the ability in our portfolio to maximize with our reach, our expertise, and our fit what those molecules can do.
So I would tell you we will continue to look for value-added bolt-on opportunities and I'll remind you that we believe
we have the right balance sheet to continue to do this.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: And with respect, Colin, with respect to odanacatib, as we said, as we showed at last
year's meetings, odanacatib has a very impressive effect in terms of reducing the risk of vertebral, non-vertebral and hip
fracture and has a particularly strong effect on reducing the risk of clinical vertebral fractures in women with
postmenopausal osteoporosis. The problem in our data set was that there were some inconsistencies with respect to
MACE events and we decided after looking at that and after discussions with the FDA that we would re-adjudicate all
those events.
So we're in the process of doing that, the re-adjudication is going forward. FDA has participated in the design of that
process, and we're working through it. As soon as those data are complete, we'll pull it all together and we'll have the
opportunity to file it, which we expect to do by the end of the year.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Thank you, Colin, and Colin, congratulations on the arrival of your first baby, your
daughter, a few weeks ago.

Your next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. First to follow up on pembrolizumab in lung and the filing around midyear. It
would seem that the data available in the PD-1 negative population is too limited to support a filing in that population.
I'm wondering if you disagree.
Secondly, to clarify on your comments on the REVEAL trial, are you saying that it won't stop because the DSMB
wants a definitive answer and not because there won't be a reduction in the event rate at the interim? So there could be
a reduction in the event rate at the interim but it won't stop because a definitive answer is sought? That's the second
question.
And then lastly, Glaxo recently released some very strong topline results from their zoster vaccine. Two questions. If
the results hold up when the full data is released, what will be your commercial response? And it would seem logical to
me that Merck would do a study of ZOSTAVAX given in a two-dose regimen. Are you contemplating that study?
Thank you.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: So, Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah, so, Steve, with respect to PD-L1 in lung, we actually, we have a very large data
set. We've described through our presentations, and also on clinicaltrials.gov, more than – nearly 600 patients with
non-small cell lung cancer. Included in that are a lot of individuals who have low PD-L1 expression, but let me point
out that it is a continuum of PD-L1 expression.
So the issue really is when you're looking at it with our immune-histochemistry test, what is the cut point that you use?
And there are patients who are absolutely completely negative. We can't find a single cell seemingly that's PD-L1
expressing. Of course, that's based on a very small biopsy sample. You don't know what would happen if you looked at
another sample. There could be populations of cells that are expressing there. And then there are others in which
seemingly every cell is expressing, and then the vast bulk of individuals who are somewhere in the middle, and so the
question is what is a PD-L1 positive patient? We obviously have an approach to that that we've developed through a
series of statistical analyses, but that's something that clearly will have to be reviewed with the agency as we go
forward.
With respect to REVEAL, I am very confident for the reasons that I mentioned that there will be a favorable effect of
anacetrapib in terms of cardiovascular risk. It has very impressive effects on LDL cholesterol, and that should be
associated with a lowering of risk. But that isn't the question, really, that's addressed in the trial. The trial is trying to
address the question of whether HDL elevation, known for decades as associated with improved cardiovascular
outcomes, has a meaningful effect. And for this reason, the trial is structured in such a way that, as is typical for such
trials, that it's unlikely that the DSMB is going to call the study unless there's just an extraordinary favorable result. So
that's my expectation.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: And Adam?
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yes. Steve, with regard to ZOSTAVAX, so first, when you think about the GSK product,
there's still a lot more we need to learn beyond the limited Phase III efficacy data that was available in the press release.
So we're looking forward to the data being published and available so we can learn a lot more about that vaccine.
But if you look at ZOSTAVAX specifically, there are a lot of attributes that customers really value. First of all, it's a
single-dose vaccine that has an established track record of safety and efficacy in both clinical trials but also in

real-world evidence settings. And we've already distributed over 20 million doses across 25 markets. There's still a lot
of unvaccinated patients in the U.S. alone that could benefit from it, and as you can see in the marketplace, we've
increased our direct-to-consumer advertising, we are doing a lot to try to treat as many patients as possible in the short
term.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: To be blunt, we are trying to get patients to originate to get a single-dose vaccine, and we
think that that is something that we can continue to do. Getting people to originate twice to get a double shot is
probably a little bit more challenging.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Thanks, Steve, and, Christie, next caller?
Operator
Your next question comes from Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - Charles Anthony Butler>: Yes. Good morning. Thanks very much. I'll be brief, and it's really around OpEx.
Adam, you made some comments around the reduction in SG&A and some modest increase in R&D, but with
SIVEXTRO launching in Europe, ZERBAXA in U.S. and some others, the question is are you really providing
sufficient support to those new launches?
Second, likewise from an R&D perspective, with TECOS rolling off, the question is I might've thought, much like
2014, R&D expenses would be flat to down, yet they're up. Is that more related to increased dollars spent for
KEYTRUDA or what?
And then, third, again on CETP, anacetrapib, Roger, forgive me if you've actually stated this, but is it your intention to
put out a press release or will it be at the end of a quarter or part of a quarter call where you will state the trial has
continued, the DSMB has met, et cetera, et cetera? Thank you.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay, Adam?
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: So, Tony, I'll start with regard to operational excellence. It first starts off with focus, and
what you've seen is we've really put our resources behind the four focused areas that I've talked about before, and
although total SG&A had come down last year, what you saw is we increased our spend in diabetes, and we built an
oncology business unit to lunch KEYTRUDA, and we fully allocated resources for there. We look at every launch as a
very important opportunity, and we intend to fund those launches to be successful. And we'll cut in other areas, but
we're not going to cut in areas that are key priority growth areas for us, in particular when you think about Diabetes,
Hospital Acute Care, Vaccines, and Oncology. But also other launches that are even outside of those areas, we're going
to fund those and we're going to resource those for success. So it really does come down to, where else will we reduce
expenses, and it's going to be outside of those key growth areas.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: So, Roger, do you want to cover R&D in a broad...
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Broadly speaking, for R&D, recognize the magnitude of the clinical trial costs associated
with moving forward with the totality of the KEYTRUDA program and all of the other programs that we're pursuing.
That said, I believe firmly that you have to live within your means, and we will do everything that we can to prioritize
those investments. This is something that Adam and I do together in thinking about how to develop our portfolios, and
we're quite disciplined about that. We do expect that, because of the profound opportunities of KEYTRUDA, there will
be an increase in expenses, but we're going to manage that very carefully.
And with respect to anacetrapib, the trial will continue. There will not be a reason to announce that the trial is
continuing. If something happens, of course, we will let you know about it. But, in general, I think you should expect
that you'll hear about the trial when we – when you obtain the results.
<A - Robert M. Davis>: Yeah, and then, Tony, this is Rob. I just might add that I do think and agree with Adam, we
are adequately investing where we need to invest for new products. I think the fact that we're growing the R&D spend

is more a statement of the success of our programs and our excitement on our pipeline because to Roger's point, we're
very disciplined. And I think that shows in the fact that overall, we are still expecting to lower OpEx in 2015 versus
2014 versus focus. So it is a, I think, a good story of focus and discipline.
<Q - Charles Anthony Butler>: Thank you both.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Thank you, Tony. And, Christie, I think we have time for two more callers.
Operator
Sure. Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. First, Roger, on anacetrapib, can you tell us how specifically the study leaders and
yourselves would attribute benefit to LDL lowering versus HDL raising at the end of the study?
Secondly for Adam, do you have any recent market share data on how KEYTRUDA is faring versus Opdivo in the
labeled indication, and perhaps how you're trying to differentiate your molecule and how you might try to differentiate
in lung?
And lastly, post-IMPROVE-IT, are there any updated plans for the LIPTRUZET product, and are you thinking OTC on
ZETIA at all? Thanks.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Okay. On anacetrapib, Gregg, there is no way to assign benefit to any particular
mechanism, except to say that there's an awfully good nomogram that correlates LDL cholesterol lowering with the
degree of reduction in major cardiovascular events, and that nomogram is supported by a whole set of studies with
different agents now, particularly in light of IMPROVE-IT. So you have a general feel for the magnitude that you're
expecting. The question is, do you see something that's above and beyond that? I think that what's critical in the study
of anacetrapib is to get a very, very hard number and to be really comfortable with the magnitude of the treatment
effect, and we'll see that when the study completes.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: And, Gregg, with regard to KEYTRUDA, there's really no market share data at this point
in time, it's still very early, but a couple of things to think about. First of all, we noted that in December we have about
2,000 patients, and most of those are – the vast majority of those are on the approved indications. So you know the
math, you know how many patients are out there. We think we've done a very good job in terms of the labeled
indication getting a lot of patients already on KEYTRUDA.
But I think the key thing is that this marketplace has room for multiple competitors and it's going to play out over
years; it's not going to play out over days or weeks or months. And as I think about it, I think about this marketplace
almost like the anti-TNFs where you have multiple players, some are strong in one therapy – in one indication, and then
another could be stronger in a different indication. We're going to have to see how combination plays out over years.
But what we're doing is we're building our Oncology business unit to really maximize the potential of KEYTRUDA
over the long term. And Roger in the past has talked about the numerous studies that we have underway as
monotherapy, the number of cancer types that we're studying, and we believe that the totality of the data will allow us
to really be able to be successful with KEYTRUDA over time.
With regard to LIPTRUZET, I'll broaden it to, how do we think about VYTORIN, ZETIA, and the overall ZETIA
franchise. We have to wait for the information to be in the label in the U.S. before our representatives can begin to
promote the product, and that hasn't occurred yet but once it does occur, we'll actively promote the data into label.
We're getting very good comments from cardiologists and physicians about the trial, but we're going to wait before we
can promote it to a label in the U.S. The good news is outside the U.S., the patent in Europe goes past 2016, and in
Japan it goes into 2019. So in other markets around the world, we have a longer time in order for us to actually be
successful introducing IMPROVE-IT data to physicians in those countries.

Sure. Your final question comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Thomas Schott>: Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple of quick ones here. First coming back to
HCV, I guess just elaborating a little bit more, do you see access as a challenge in 2016 given some of the exclusive
contracts that are currently being signed by some of your competitors? And should we think about another step down in
price for the category as you enter the market?
Second one was on KEYTRUDA. Beyond the lung filing, what's the next tumor type we should be watching in terms
of a potential filing?
And then finally, as we just think about the broader I/O portfolio at Merck, when could we see additional Merck
developed I/O agents enter the clinic, and what mechanisms are you most excited about as you think about your
pre-clinical portfolio? Thanks so much.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Adam?
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: First with regard to HCV, first of all we don't know the exact language in the contracts that
our competitors have signed so I'll put that aside not knowing their exact wording in the contracts. But in general we've
had very, very good success with managed care access across multiple different therapeutic areas, multiple different
specialty classes where there's entrenched competitors and we believe that we'll be able to get good access once we
launch the product. I don't want to discuss our contracting or our pricing strategy, but we're going to make sure that we
are competitive in the marketplace in order to get access.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: And, Chris, with regard to KEYTRUDA filings, as we've discussed before, beyond
melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, last year we had the opportunity to present data from five additional tumor
types in which response rates really suggest that registration enabling studies should proceed and we're pursuing all
those. So that includes of course, head and neck cancer, it includes gastric cancer, it includes bladder cancer, triple
negative breast cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma data. And we have quite strong, quite provocative data in all those
areas that we've had a chance to share with you. We've initiated studies in many of those cases, and depending upon
what those results look like, that would provide the basis potentially for filings going forward.
We'll have a lot more to say about that but those are the areas which are most advanced right now, and a look at
clinicaltrials.gov will reveal that in particular for the head and neck cancer and uroepithelial cancers.
And then with respect to other immuno-oncology assets, of course we have the GITR asset we've already talked about,
we've discussed LAG-3, which will be coming forward. We're very interested in the set of cell surface molecules that
are both stimulatory and antagonistic with respect to immune regulation and we have developed internally derived
antibodies against a whole cluster of those, and you're going to have a chance to see a number of them coming forward
in this calendar year.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Thanks, Roger. Ken?
Kenneth C. Frazier
Okay. Let me just summarize. I think we had a solid 2014 with growth all of our core areas, EPS at the high end of the
range. Importantly, six new product approvals in the United States and that innovation momentum continues into 2015.
We will be filing for lung in mid-2015, our HCV filings in the first half of 2015, we're making steady progress in a
number of areas within MRL, and we're going to continue through business development to develop the best external
collaborations we can.
As it relates to the 2015 underlying business, our core business again will be growing, and again, I stress that ex-ForEx,
we are going EPS mid-single digits in 2015. So the underlying portfolio is performing well and the Merck Research
Lab is performing well.
