As a reminder when we discuss revenues during today's call we're talking about revenues before reimbursement or net
revenues.
Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call are forward looking, including business outlook. You should keep in mind
that these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements and that such statements are not a
guarantee of our future performance. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general economic
conditions and those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed under the risk factors section of our annual
report on form 10-K and quarterly reports on form 10-Q and other SEC filings.
During our call today we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliations of those measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news
release or on the Investor Relations section of our website at Accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no
obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.
Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, KC and thanks everyone for joining us today. Overall our third quarter results were solid although revenues
came below expectations driven by consulting. We again delivered solid bookings, very good profitability, and we
generated very strong free cash flow. Here is some detail on the quarter.
Revenues were $7.2 billion, up 3% in local currency. While outsourcing growth was 7%, consulting growth was flat,
resulting in total revenues slightly below our guided range. We delivered solid new bookings of $8.3 billion, bringing
us to nearly $25 billion for the first three quarters of the year.
Earnings per share were $1.21, including a benefit of $0.07 from a reduction in reorganization liabilities. Excluding this
benefit, earnings per share were $1.14, an increase of 11%. Excluding the reorganization benefit, we delivered record
income and operating margin with operating margin expansion of approximately 40 basis points.
We generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow and continued to have a very strong balance sheet ending the quarter with a
cash balance of $5.9 billion. And we returned approximately $1.2 billion in cash to shareholders through share
repurchases and the payment of our semiannual cash dividend. We have updated our business outlook for the full fiscal
year and David will cover it later in the call.
Now, let me hand over to Pam who will read you the numbers for Q3 in greater detail. Pam, over to you.
Pamela J. Craig
Thank you, Pierre and thanks to all of you for listening today. As Pierre mentioned, our results in the third quarter of
fiscal 2013 were solid overall. Although revenue growth of 3% was slightly below our March outlook range and we
now expect this trend of slower revenue growth to continue as we finish out our fiscal year. Bookings continued to
reflect strength in demand for future transformational services, particularly in outsourcing and bookings were lighter
overall than we expected in consulting. Our commitment to managing our business with rigor and discipline was
reflected in our strong operating profitability, earnings per share and cash flow this quarter.
Now let's go through the numbers. Unless I state otherwise, all figures are US GAAP, except the items that are not part
of the financial statements or that are calculations.
New bookings for the quarter were $8.3 billion, above our expectations overall and they included a foreign exchange
headwind of negative 3% compared with new bookings in the third quarter last year. Consulting bookings were $3.9
billion with a book to bill level of 1.0, which was lower than the 1.1 we were targeting. Outsourcing bookings were
$4.4 billion at a book to bill level of 1.3.

So let me give you some bookings details starting with consulting where we were about 10% below our expectations in
each of the three categories. In management consulting the macro environment continues to be challenging and volatile.
Our clients held back on spending more than we expected, particularly in Europe and Brazil and the environment is
more competitive. Our bookings continue to reflect projects that are larger and longer in duration and we booked fewer
short-term projects. Although our pipeline is down slightly, we do see growth in demand for transformational projects
in operations, CRM and risk management.
Technology consulting bookings reflected demand for infrastructure consulting projects that span data centers,
networks and workplaces as well as IT strategy projects. As mentioned on our last call, we are strengthening our
leadership focus on the technology transformation agendas of our clients.
System integration bookings on the one hand reflected rising demand for industry specific software solutions where
emerging technologies such as mobility, analytics and cloud are part of the mix. On the other hand the bookings also
reflected lower demand and a more competitive environment for ERP systems work. The decrease in ERP work was
most pronounced in some European countries as clients are slowing down their investments in add on work to existing
solutions and generally starting fewer large programs right now.
Turning to outsourcing; new bookings were well above our expectations. Technology outsourcing bookings were
strong as our clients continue to seek solutions for driving operational efficiencies and flexible cost effective sourcing.
Our Global Delivery Network continues to be well positioned to meet the increased demand for such solutions. The
bookings also reflected moderating demand for add-on system enhancements consistent with the pattern just mentioned
in systems integration.
BPO bookings in Q3 were very strong driven both by our cross industry offerings, especially finance and accounting
and by our industry-specific solutions, particularly in financial services and health. Demand for BPO services was
strong for both the Americas and EMEA and also increased in APAC as we have now seen a sustained increase in our
global market share. Notably we had bookings of over $100 million at 12 clients with all five operating groups
represented and several of these were in EMEA.
Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the third quarter were $7.20 billion, an increase of 1% in US dollars and 3%
in local currency over the same period last year. Q3 revenues were below our guided range of $7.25 billion to $7.5
billion by about $50 million. They reflected a foreign exchange impact of negative 2.5% compared with the third
quarter last year, which was consistent with the assumption we had provided in March.
Consulting revenues were $3.87 billion, down 2% in US dollars and flat in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were
$3.33 billion, an increase of 4% in US dollars and 7% in local currency. Our revenue growth in consulting was not at
the level we expected this quarter. First, consulting bookings were almost $400 million lower than we expected in
March, including a decline in smaller contracts that convert to revenue more quickly. This was the primary factor that
negatively impacted our revenue growth this quarter.
A second factor relates to the continuing trend of how our bookings are converting to revenue. Our outlook for Q3
assumed a continuation of the slower conversion we have discussed in recent previous quarters. However, we saw an
unexpected uptick in the average duration of our new bookings.
In addition, more than we expected, our clients are slowing the pace and level of spending per the arrangements they
have with us. The lower consulting revenue reflected the most pronounced differences versus expectations in resources
and products, in Brazil and some European countries and in systems integration and management consulting. Although
our outsourcing revenues and bookings were higher than we expected this quarter, we do see fewer short-term contracts
and some clients slowing their spending on existing applications.
Now let me give you some details about revenue by operating group. Health & Public Service revenues increased 11%
in local currency, reflecting significant growth in health again this quarter with strength in both consulting and
outsourcing and across the three geographic regions. Our health administration and connected health offerings
continued to be the primary drivers of growth. We also continued to see growth in public service in both consulting and

outsourcing in the Americas and Asia-Pacific and at the same time we continue to reposition the public service business
in EMEA.
Financial services revenues increased 8% in local currency with double digit growth in insurance and capital markets.
Outsourcing revenues reflected very strong growth overall as our industry business services offerings are putting us
more and more at the core of our clients' businesses. Consulting revenues continued their pattern of slight growth,
reflecting less demand for smaller projects. While Financial Services is well positioned going forward, particularly in
outsourcing, we expect more moderate growth in Q4 compared to the unusually strong growth we had in Q4 of fiscal
2012.
The products operating group had local currency revenue growth of 4%. It was higher than that in the Americas and
EMEA, partially offset by a decline in APAC. Outsourcing growth was strong across the globe and the different
dimensions of products. Despite solid growth in life sciences, consulting revenues decreased overall and were lower
than we expected. A number of our larger ERP programs are now substantially complete right now and we are stepping
up to the growing demand for services that enable our clients to transform into more digital companies including
multichannel customer solutions, product lifecycle management, and operations.
Communications, media and technology revenues decreased 3% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected a
modest decrease, with the expected ramp down from one contract in EMEA, partially offset by very strong growth in
the Americas across all industries.
Consulting revenues declined slightly overall, but I'm pleased to point out that the communications industry in EMEA
and high tech in the Americas had strong double digit growth. While the communications industry remains dynamic,
we believe our offerings around transformation are resonating with our clients. Overall, in CMT we expect
year-over-year revenue performance to improve going forward.
Resources net revenues decreased 3% in local currency due primarily to a decline in natural resources. Outsourcing
revenues were flat overall, as growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific was offset by declines in the Americas.
Consulting revenues declined and continued to be impacted by the completion of several large ERP programs and
clients taking a more phased approach to consulting projects. These trends had a higher than expected drag on
resources revenues during the third quarter. Overall, we expect resources revenues to continue to decline in the near
term.
Let me comment briefly on our geographies. In the Americas, we continue to be pleased with the strong growth in the
United States. EMEA declined very slightly again this quarter, as local currency growth is mixed with positive growth
in several countries offset by declines in a few others. Growth was impacted by the expected ramp down of one
contract in CMT and without the impact of that contract, EMEA overall grew slightly.
Asia Pacific was flat in Q3, as we expected growth there to moderate. Growth in China and India was offset by
expected declines in Japan and also in Australia, where we had experienced recent periods of very strong growth. We
expect APAC revenues to decline slightly next quarter.
So to summarize on revenues, we had anticipated a better overall macro environment in the second half of our fiscal
year which has not come to pass and we have experienced some changes in demand patterns as we've gone through the
first three quarters. While we now do not see the pickup, the result is that revenue growth has been relatively
consistent. It is 4% year-to-date and we are navigating well in this dynamic environment.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin was 33.9% compared with 33.1% for the same period last year, up
approximately 80 basis points. This result did reflect improved outsourcing contract profitability.
Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was $887 million or 12.3% of net revenues, compared with 11.9% of net
revenue for the third quarter last year, reflecting higher costs this year to build our pipeline and pursue acquisitions.
General and administrative expense was $459 million, or 6.4% of net revenues, flat compared with the third quarter last
year.

Finally, like in Q2, we had another reorganization reserve release this quarter. This $50 million benefit represented a
further reduction in the reorganization liabilities established when we transitioned to a corporate structure in 2001.
Similar to last quarter, this is a non-cash item and at this point the reorganization liabilities established 12 years ago are
all but behind us.
GAAP operating income was $1.14 billion in the third quarter. Excluding the reorganization item I just mentioned,
operating income for the third quarter was $1.09 billion or 15.2% of net revenue, up approximately 40 basis points
compared with Q3 last year. This record result reflects our commitment to driving operating profitability expansion in
our business.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.8% compared with 28.5% for the third quarter last year. Excluding the
benefit of the reorganization item, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 was 24.8%. Net income was
$874 million for the third quarter and it was $763 million for the same quarter last year. Excluding the benefit of the
reorg item, net income for the third quarter was $824 million, an increase of 8%.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.21 compared with $1.03 in the third quarter last year. Excluding the benefit of the
reorganization item, EPS for the third quarter were $1.14. Let me walk down the components of the $0.18
year-over-year increase in EPS.
So first, without the reorganization item, the increase is made up of $0.03 from higher revenue and operating results,
$0.02 from a lower share count and $0.06 from a lower effective tax rate. These add to an $0.11 EPS increase and we
had an additional $0.07 from the reduction in reorg liabilities which add to a total year-over-year increase in EPS of
$0.18 in the quarter.
Turning to DSOs, our day services outstanding continue to be industry leading. They were 30 days, down slightly from
31 days last quarter and in line with Q3 last fiscal year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.4 billion, resulting from
cash generated by operating activities of $1.5 billion net of property and equipment additions of $91 million.
Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at May 31st was $5.9 billion compared with $6.6 billion at August 31st
last year which reflects the cash returned to shareholders so far through share repurchases and dividends, the US
pension contribution we funded in Q1, and some acquisitions we have made. We have done very well in allocating a
more significant level of capital for strategic and focused new acquisitions this fiscal year, which will contribute growth
and revenue synergies to our business going forward.
Moving to some other key operational metrics, we ended the quarter with a global head count of about 266,000 people
and we now have approximately 174,000 people in our Global Delivery Network. In Q3, our utilization was 88%
consistent with Q2. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 12% compared to 11% in Q2 and 13% in
Q3 last fiscal year. Lastly, we expect that more than 50,000 people will join our company this fiscal year.
Let me wrap up by commenting on our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and
dividends. In the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed approximately 7.8 million shares for $618 million at an
average price of $79.55 per share. Year-to-date, we've purchased 19.8 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion at
an average price of $72.94 per share. At May 31st we had approximately $3 billion of share repurchase authority
remaining.
On May 15th, 2013 we made our second semiannual dividend payment for fiscal 2013 in the amount of $0.81 per
share, bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to $1.1 billion.
So, that's it from me. Thanks again for listening these past seven years. I would also like to thank all Accenture people,
past, present and future, for driving our company to greatness.
Back to Pierre now to give you an update on some exciting things going on in our business and then over to David for
business outlook as he is ready to take over as Accenture's CFO.

Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, Pam. Our Q3 results demonstrate that we continue to operate in an environment that remains uncertain and
volatile. Against that backdrop we continue to focus on driving profitable growth by increasing operational efficiency
to deliver margin expansion and enhancing our competitiveness to gain market share.
At the same time, we are investing in our business to develop unique services that sharpen our differentiation and
enable us to provide end-to-end services that deliver tangible business outcomes for clients. As the market continues to
evolve rapidly we clearly see the opportunity to position Accenture for future growth.
As I meet with CEOs around the world, it's striking to see how digital is now part of every conversation. Digital is
fundamentally disrupting business models and requiring companies to rethink how they operate from how they interact
with customers and employees to how they manage their supply chains and collaborate with business partners. I believe
that Accenture is very well positioned to help clients assume their businesses to compete in this new digital world.
Marketing is one of the key functions that digital is having a huge impact on. Chief Marketing Officers are increasingly
looking for integrated solutions that bring together strategy, technology and analytics at scale to get more value out of
their investments. To better serve them, we continue to make strategic investments to enhance Accenture Interactive,
our digital marketing services group.
These include: the acquisition of Acquity Group, the second largest independent digital marketing company in the US;
Fjord, a global design firm; and earlier this year, avVenta, a digital production company. Together, these acquisitions
expand our capabilities and position us as a leader in this fast-growing segment of the market.
Accenture Interactive was key to a recent win at BMW, which selected us to manage the rollouts of its new web
platform to 100 markets around the world. We will also manage its online marketing campaigns including content
customization and social media in local markets, helping BMW deliver the right experiences to the right consumers at
the right times.
We continue to see strong demand for our digital capabilities in many other areas including analytics and mobility. In
analytics, we are helping a major airline improve and personalize its customer experience. We are integrating customer
data from different touch points including mobile devices, tablets, phones and PCs to give the airline a single
comprehensive view of customer preferences. And we recently formed a global strategic alliance with GE, to leverage
our combined capabilities in cloud, analytics, big data and mobility as well as Accenture's industry expertise to deliver
on the vision of the industrial internet.
In the aviation industry, Taleris, our joint venture with GE, is already providing intelligent operations services to
airlines to help them predict potential aircraft maintenance faults and recommend preventive action. We are
continuously innovating to differentiate our capabilities, to increase our competitiveness. We continue to make good
progress with our end-to-end business services which combine management consulting technology and business
process outsourcing.
Through Accenture Finance and Risk Services we are helping Santander Group transform its corporate credit risk
function. Their new platform is expected to enable all twelve of Santander's country business units to improve
operational efficiency, better manage risk and support Basel 3 regulatory compliance. And at the same time, we
continue to support our clients with their large scale transformation initiatives.
We are working with a large international insurance organization to transform its global financial reporting functions
using an SAP-based solution. The new system allows the client to accelerate a financial close time and more efficiently
generate financial statements across operations in 130 countries.
Turning to our geographic performance, despite the challenges Pam mentioned in Brazil, our priority emerging markets
as a whole continued to grow at a faster rate than Accenture in the quarter. We delivered very strong double digit
growth in China, India, South Africa and the Middle East, reflecting the continued improvements in our market
position in these important markets for the future. And once again, I would like to recognize the performance of our

business in the United States, our largest single market, which posted double digit growth again this quarter. We
continue to see a very good return on the investments we have made in banking, insurance, health and life sciences.
In summary, in this fast changing yet volatile environment, we are focused on executing our growth strategy. With the
right intervention in our existing business and targeted investments in new areas for growth, we believe that our
innovation agenda, our diverse portfolio of business and our relentless focus on operational excellence will continue to
drive top and bottom line results.
As you know, this is Pam's last earnings call and we want to thank her again for her many contributions over the years
and wish her the very best. David Rowland will become our CFO on Monday and I'm going to turn the call over to him
now to provide our business outlook for the 4th quarter and the full fiscal year.
David P. Rowland
Thanks, Pierre. Before I comment on our guidance, on a personal note, I'd like to thank Pam for her tremendous
contribution to both Accenture, and our finance function. She has certainly set a high bar for the CFO role, and I'll
work hard to continue in that tradition.
Now turning to guidance, for the fourth quarter fiscal 2013, we expect revenues to be in the range of $6.7 billion to $7
billion. This assumes an FX impact of approximately negative 1% compared to the fourth quarter in fiscal 2012. We
expect slight moderation in our outsourcing revenue growth with consulting revenues ranging from a modest decline to
a slight increase.
For the full fiscal year 2013, based upon how rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the
impact of FX to be negative 1.7% compared to fiscal 2012, a change from the negative 1% we provided last quarter.
We now expect our fiscal 2013 revenue to be in the range of 3% to 4% growth in local currency.
On new bookings we continue to expect to be in the range of $31 billion to $34 billion for the full fiscal year 2013 and
anticipate that they will be in the upper half of that range. We expect quarter four will reflect continued strong
outsourcing bookings and consulting bookings similar to Q3.
GAAP operating margin is now expected to in the range of 15.2% to 15.3% for fiscal 2013. Excluding the impact of the
reorganization benefit year-to-date, we now expect the adjusted range to be 14.2% to 14.3%, a 30 to 40 basis point
expansion over fiscal 2012.
We now expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 18.5% to 19.5% or 25.5% to 26.5% on an adjusted
basis. We now expect GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.90 to $4.94, or $4.18 to $4.22 on an adjusted
basis. This adjusted EPS range reflects 9% to 10% growth for fiscal year 2013 and includes a $0.03 reduction due to
the updated FX assumption of negative 1.7%.
For the full fiscal year we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, property and
equipment additions to continue to be approximately $400 million and free cash flow to now be in the range of $2.7
billion to $2.9 billion.
Finally, we remain committed to return a substantial portion of the cash we generate to shareholders. In fiscal 2013 we
continue to expect to return at least $3.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases and to reduce the weighted
average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2%.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2014, we're now in the middle of our business planning and as part of that planning we're
analyzing how the different elements of our business are evolving. As we have in the past, we'll provide you with our
fiscal 2014 outlook at the Q4 earnings call in September.
In closing, it's clear we are now in the midst of a changing demand pattern, particularly as it relates to our consulting
business. Having said that, I'm pleased with our positive growth in fiscal 2013, which we believe is ahead of market
growth and reflects our strong positioning with our clients in the broader market.

cash to our shareholders.
With that, we're ready to take your questions, KC?
K. C. McClure
Thanks, David. I would ask that you each take one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible
to ask a question., Joshua, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] The first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan, please go ahead.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Hi, great, thank you. I guess I'll ask about the consulting side, the small deal activity. I know,
Pierre, you mentioned last quarter that there were some early signs that it might be getting a little bit better, which it
looks like didn't materialize. I'm just trying to reconcile that to the shortfall in consulting this quarter. Did demand
deteriorate or did it just not improve as much as you thought?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, indeed, it definitely didn't improve the way we expected and we will see more softness
in that part of the business in consulting smaller deals. So, we expected some improvement and that indeed didn't
materialize the way we expected.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Got it. So can we say that demand, for the most part, is still generally stable then? It just didn't
improve in the quarter, just to clarify?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I would probably say didn't improve and in that particular segment of the business, it has
been probably softening a bit.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Okay, so a little bit of softening. Fair enough. Curious – my follow-up, any – what are you
hearing from your clients as it relates to immigration reform? I guess it just passed in the Senate just a few minutes ago.
What are you hearing from clients with respect to that? Is it impacting demand at all and just generally what are the
implications for Accenture?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hey Tien-tsin, this is David. How are you doing?
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Hey, David.
<A - David P. Rowland>: I'm going to give you the answer that you're probably expecting, but we really can't
comment on pending legislation. What I can say is, as you know, is that we have a global workforce. Most of the
people who work for us in the United States are U.S. citizens and where we use the visa program, we use it where we
have to get specialized skills not otherwise available and then also leverage our Global Delivery Network. And so,
really, that's our position on this and we really just can't speculate or comment any further on what may or may not
happen with legislation.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Got it. Fair enough I appreciate that. Thanks again to Pam.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thanks, Tien-tsin.

Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Okay, great, and Pam, best wishes to you as well. Guys, so your report emphasizes the
weakness in consulting demand, but I want to focus a bit here on the outsourcing demand environment. The
outsourcing revenue growth was also light versus expectations. So I guess I'm wondering, did outsourcing add on
revenue's struggle or did you see new deal ramps struggle or some combination of the two?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Hey, Rod, it's Pam. We did see a combination. First of all, I mean, versus our expectations,
outsourcing revenues came in well and we did, as I mentioned, see – we do see some of the sort of smaller add-on
application – work to existing applications that is slowing a bit, but at the same time we have this real strength in BPO.
So, it's a real mix of things and some of these bigger deals, as we mentioned with the durations, those are continuing to
ramp up slower.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Okay, and so given the ongoing strength in outsourcing bookings, should outsourcing
revenue growth reaccelerate sometime soon? I know you're expecting some moderation in growth in Q4, but the
bookings would imply that you at least have ingredients in place for that revenue growth to potentially accelerate. So
can you give us some insight on how you're expecting the revenue growth progression in the outsourcing segment after
Q4?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hey, Rod, this is David and I'm not going to comment in specific terms as we're really in the
middle of planning FY2014 and we'll come back in September and give you more specific insight on your question.
What I can tell you is that we feel very good about our outsourcing pipeline. We feel very good about the bookings that
we've generated, not only this quarter but for the last two or three quarters. We've had a large number, if you reflect on
what Pam said about the number of deals we had over $100 million this quarter as well as what we've said the last two
quarters, we've had a lot of large, very good contracts that we've closed so far and we feel very good about the larger
contracts that we have in our pipeline. And so on the back of that, we are building a very good base of contracted
revenue and that ultimately gives us confidence going forward in the strength of our outsourcing business.
In terms of specifics, relative to growth beyond quarter four, we're just not in a position to comment on that
specifically.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: All right. Just a little bit of pushback on that. I understand you don't want to get into the
next fiscal year, but with the outsourcing booking strength and the deceleration that's happening in outsourcing, is there
something happening where duration has ramped up in such a significant way that it's making the bookings look
stronger than the amount of revenue that can be supported by those bookings? Or are you actually maybe seeing some
things that are getting booked and then they actually fall out of the business and so you're seeing some fallout in work
that you've previously booked? I mean, is there something happening along those lines?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, just a couple of thoughts to your question. First of all, and I'll just work backwards,
we have not seen any change in cancellations. Cancellations are not evident in anything we've seen to date. There's not
any abnormal pattern in that regard. So we really don't have a situation where we're contracting work and then it is
being canceled.
The other thing I would say is that nothing's changed in our business in terms of our criteria for reporting bookings. It's
based on having a signed, legally binding agreement with our clients that stipulates our services and what the services
and the fees will be that we'll earn over that contract, and so our contracted revenue is as solid as it's been as well.
Now, we have had some – over the last two or three quarters at different periods our new bookings have had the
characteristic of longer duration, and that is impacting the conversion of outsourcing bookings to revenue, similar to
what we have seen in consulting. But yet the contracted revenue that we have resulting from the bookings that we've
had, we feel very good about.

<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Rod, this is Pam. I'll just add one comment and that is for smaller outsourcing bookings,
there's a certain amount of that that ends up getting filled in in the quarter. They're not these bigger transformational
kinds of deals but more smaller, sometimes add-on kinds of things and that's the bucket of things that we've seen be a
little softer.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Makes sense. All right, thank you, guys.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Thank you, Rod.

Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank, please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi. I just wanted to ask also and follow up on the outsourcing side. I guess our surprise was
that it had been almost ten quarters, I think, of double digit growth in outsourcing and yet coming in at 7% constant
currency, you guys seem to be happy with that or at least better than expectations. So maybe our expectations are off on
what the long-term outlook should be in outsourcing and maybe the double digit growth that we've had in the past was
never going to be sustainable. So maybe you can just talk about that.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Well, part of it is we have mentioned for several quarters now that we had a large contract
in Europe and that contract, throughout this year, has impacted our revenue growth in total, but also in outsourcing and
the peak level of impact, if you will, was in the third quarter. So that is reflected in the growth percentage that we're
reporting, and, of course, it will continue to have an impact in the fourth quarter as well to a lesser extent but then over
time that will drop out of our compare and we'll have more of an apples-to-apples comparison.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Even when we planned the year, Bryan, we were expecting this moderation in outsourcing.
What didn't materialize as we expected was the pickup in consulting in the latter part of the second half of the year.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay, and also there might have been a few acquisitions that rolled off on the outsourcing
side, just clarification on that. And then renewals, is renewals also in the bookings so that could be inflating the
bookings number and why it's not translating into revenue?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Renewals are reflected in our bookings, but again, there's not anything abnormal about the
renewals that we've had in our portfolio relative to outsourcing new bookings we've reported in the past.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay, and then just finally for me. Contracted revenue over the next four quarters, I know it
was 8% in the first quarter; I don't think we got it in the second quarter and then it would be great to have it this quarter
as well. Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. That question was not asked last quarter, so your memory is very good, but the
contracted revenues that we have and we give you this number as over the next four quarters, but we have about 10%
growth or 10% more contracted revenues over the next four quarters.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: And for what it's worth, it was 8% last quarter.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Thanks so much.

<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Hey, guys. Maybe just coming back to the other points that you guys made on the rate of
competition changing, can you just go back through that in terms of where the competitive dynamics are changing? Is
this a function that's translating into pricing pressure for you guys? Maybe if you guys could just elaborate on the
competitive dynamics that would be helpful.

<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, I will take that one. Thank you, Julio. The competition I would characterize as pretty
stable across the patch. As you know we're competing against the same range of competitors. Now it is true that in
some part of the world, and I'm thinking about again, consulting Europe, Brazil, as it has been mentioned before,
resources and more natural resources. When the market is softening a bit, then the level of competition is naturally
increasing and putting more pressure on pricing and on competition there. But I would characterize that this is quite
concentrated on a few areas of the business, the one I just mentioned before, particularly those three. For the rest of the
business I believe that the competition is pretty stable. I would not notice anything specific in that quarter.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Okay, great. And just as a follow-up, what were the fiscal fourth quarter consulting local
currency growth expectations in outsourcing again?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: He's got it.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, we just said – my comment was that it would moderate a little from the 7% that we
just reported in the third quarter.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: For outsourcing?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, for outsourcing.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: What about consulting.

<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: So some hope for growth. Okay, thank you.

Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Please go ahead
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Thank you, guys. Maybe I just want to start with a question for David. As you prepare
three months from now to give us your initial fiscal 2014 guidance, are you rethinking any of the internal budgeting or
forecasting processes, just given what seems to be a little bit of loss of visibility reflected over the last few quarters? It
was more exacerbated this quarter I would say relative to expectations. I'm just building on the comment you guys had
made that the consulting bookings, I think you said were about $400 million light in the month of March but I know
you guys had spoken to us at the very end of March and things actually sounded pretty good then. Just wanted to get
your take on the overall internal budgeting and forecasting processes and systems and if you think any adjustments are
needed there.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. Jason, that is a very fair question to ask, and I'll start off by telling you that we're not
in the business of missing guidance and we don't find that to be acceptable, so that would not be our expectation going
forward.
Having said that, we do have a very robust planning, forecasting function in Accenture, and I think that, as much as
anything else, we have found ourselves in this period of change and evolution, in particular in the consulting business,
we've had some areas of our business where the activity is much different than we would have expected, some of which
would have been tough to predict like the depth of the economic challenges in Brazil, some of the growth challenges in
Japan, and frankly for anyone I think it's tough to predict even today what's happening in Europe with the macro
environment and so we have a large, complex business and a large, complex world and even the best forecasting
processes, when you're going through a period of change, you can have, in our case a quarter, where the lens was not as
clear as we would have hoped it would have been and so we are always trying to get better in everything we do,
forecasting included.
We've certainly learned a lot over the last two or three quarters and we're putting those insights that we've learned, this
quarter in particular, to good use in terms of being better predictors of our business going forward.

<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Just as a follow-up can you talk about. You mentioned clients are holding back on
spending, and you were pretty clear that you're not seeing cancellations, so obviously that's good news. But maybe if
we can just parse this a little bit more. Is this clients holding back on decisions regarding new bookings or is it more
that they're slowing down the ramp of existing projects or is it really just kind of an even mix of both of those?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I would probably take a little bit of both. Definitely the overall environment has not been
progressing probably the way we all expected, including our clients when you look at our Q3. The situation in Europe
is not even slightly better. It's probably slightly worse, even if we do not have a Greece event, if you will, the
environment is moving from an economic standpoint to a recession and so the mood with our clients over there is still
to be thoughtful and be very mindful about the way they invest, and when clients are thoughtful and mindful they tend
to wait a little bit more and to think further on when and how much they're going to invest.
It's particularly true when it's about smaller projects, as we mentioned, but indeed this is what I would characterize as
the softness, particularly true in Europe and in Europe, in South Europe to be even more specific, and it's definitely true
and to be honest, not something we anticipated at that level.
In Brazil, the situation has changed recently and clearly we have good discussions with clients over there but we see
more discussion and the clients postponing or delaying their decisions. That's the kind of environment, again I would
characterize especially in Brazil, Southern Europe and natural resources, given the cyclical nature of that business,
especially the mining business.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Okay. Thanks for all the thoughts.
<A - K. C. McClure>: Thanks Jason.
Operator
Keith Bachman from the Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, thank you very much. I had two also. And the first one is, what are the conditions to
enable the consulting business to grow? When the start of the year there was expectations, particularly exiting the year
that would be mid to high single digits, and now you're tracking at 0% growth. Is it purely economic or are there other
practice areas or competitive landscape as you think about FY14, but more broadly, what are the conditions that would
enable consulting to grow?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I think first, and thanks a lot for the question, Keith. I think consulting it's all about launching
projects – programs, if you will. So it's slightly different from the mindset on outsourcing, which most of the time is
more driven through cost optimization. Consulting is more about building for the future, if you will, for clients and
building for the future is requiring confidence. Confidence in the economy, confidence in the business, and again there
are parts of the world where that confidence is not at the level we expected. And so what we can guess is indeed the
economic condition in Europe would progress. If the situation in Brazil as well is moving to a more positive outcome,
then confidence will be rebuilt with our clients and investors and we might see more consulting pickup, but that is
probably what that is. The level of confidence is not at the level we expected and there are eroding economic conditions
in some parts of the world.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, but presumably within the that context you feel like you have the risk of the
downside appropriately captured at this point at least for the next quarter or so on consulting?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, we think we do. We feel like we've got a reasonable range reflected in our guidance.
Again, it reflects the learnings from the third quarter.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, let me ask my follow-up then. You highlighted during the call the importance of
acquisitions, and I certainly think that's a sound strategy, a great strategy. Is there a way that you could highlight, (A),
what was the level of acquisition-driven revenue this quarter? Did it contribute any amount of points to growth, one

point or so, and then (B) how do you think about it going forward? Is there a way that you could provide some
dimension as we think longer term of either percent of cash flow or percent of revenue growth that you're targeting as
you think more broadly about acquisitions? And that's it for me, thank you.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Keith, I'll quickly give you the answer on the quarter, which was it was less than 1%.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: And let me turn it over to Pierre to give the future look here.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, in the current context, it's not new, that's a strategy we discussed with all of you during
the IR days and recently, we will use acquisition as a way for us to invest in fast-growing areas and to execute our
growth strategy and this is exactly what we do. Indeed we set as an objective to deploy something like 15% of our free
cash flow in acquisition, and this is what we are doing.
I think we are doing that this year in a very efficient way. Around our clear strategic initiatives, clear priorities in terms
of industry, clear priorities in terms of technologies. I mentioned the digital marketing as a fast-growing area as where
we've been deploying our capital into acquisitions and we will continue to do so to make sure that through acquisition
we are capturing new waves of growth and we're pleased with – and I'm particularly pleased with what we've been
doing this year in that front and this is what we see. You remember the acquisition we made I think a year ago or 18
months ago to build Accenture mortgage services on the back of the acquisition of Zenta and we're very pleased, for
instance, with the return we're getting from that acquisition, but it's true across the board.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: And just another little data point for you, Keith, that we do expect it will be higher than the
15% of operating cash flow this year.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, fair enough. Thanks, Pam. Good luck.

Sara Gubins of Bank of America of please go ahead.
<Q - Sara Rebecca Gubins>: Hi. Thank you. You haven't made any change to your head count plans in spite of the
weaker trends, so I'm wondering if there's any shift in the capabilities that you've been adding or you will be adding, or
if it suggests that head count should ramp – the additions should ramp down into the next year?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, I think on the head count, the first thing I would say, Sara, is that our head count in
the third quarter was very, you know, well-utilized. Our utilization rates were very high, as Pam indicated, and if you
think about the upper end of our range in the fourth quarter it was – it's right at about what we just did in the third
quarter and so underneath our head count you can see a little more increase in GDN, I think in the quarter we just
completed as opposed to our onshore resources but we are very, very good and I think that's one of our – one of the
areas that operationally we've really proven over the quarters and years to be very strong is managing our supply and
demand. So we'll continue to move our head count, both the mix by location, total head count as our revenue forecast
evolves.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: We were up 5,000 and 4,000 in the GDN.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, it was all GDN, almost all GDN.
<Q - Sara Rebecca Gubins>: Okay. Thank you. And as a follow-up, given the slower demand environment, I'm
wondering if you're seeing any pressure in pricing either from a competitive dynamic or from your clients as you
renegotiate?

Edward Caso from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: Hi, great. You mentioned Business Processing Outsourcing, BPO, several times in a positive
way and I was curious, maybe if you could flesh it out a little bit more, particularly along the lines of, say, strength in
generic F&A work versus more industry-specific and what Accenture is doing to win and sustain and expand work?
Thank you.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Thank you, Ed, for the question, and indeed very pleased you're asking the question. I'm big
fan of our BPO business and very pleased with our results. That's an area where we've been very specific about the
industry – about the strategy we want to execute, which is all around being extraordinarily focused and you mentioned
finance and accounting as one of these areas. I could mention as well procurement as an illustration, where we are
taking some leading position and we are shooting for scale with good results. I mentioned one in my presentation
today.
We are as well investing in more [indiscernible] (58:09). I mentioned Accenture Credit Services where we are
providing mortgage processing capabilities, regulatory disclosure with life sciences, and indeed, again, in addition to
the at-scale [indiscernible] (58:25) we've developed, we're executing exactly the same strategy in some priority
industries with verticals: insurance, banking, life sciences. I could mention as well health and no surprise that you've
seen that these four industries posting good growths.
And finally, BPO is a business where we always aim at differentiating ourself, adding more capabilities and more
insights in what we do, especially around bringing analytics across the board to make our BPO more relevant and
cutting edge.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: My other question is sort of on the contract terms. We've talked about pricing a little bit, but
are you seeing tightening up on the contract terms, maybe where the risk profile of the contract may be getting a little
higher now in the current environment?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I don't think there's anything major to speak of there, but certainly on the margin here and
there we do have those challenges.

<A - Pamela J. Craig>: It's the former, I think. There's just a little less of the add-on work going on right now. There's
fewer of the big ERP things starting. You know, I used to do this work myself. These things just go through those kinds
of periods, and it will certainly pick up again, but we do see that trend right now.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Okay. And then you mentioned analytics and so forth, as you know, some people talk
about the new technologies as SMAC or whatever acronym you want to use, is there any aggregation that you can
provide in terms of how much of that kind of business you do, how fast it's growing?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: We're very pleased with where we are and indeed it's an area of high growth for us. So, what
we would put in this SMAC for us, that would be digital marketing, analytics, mobility, cloud clearly are areas where
we have something I would characterize as very strong growth.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Very strong growth, yep.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Is that pretty much across the board or is it in particular industries?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: It's pretty much across the board. You have some industries which are more early adopters
and especially the consumer-based industries are more analytics, mobile, SMAC driven, if you will. So communication,
banking, insurance, consumer package goods, retail, this is where they're investing in the SMAC world.

Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Yeah, curious, understanding there are several areas of weakness in international markets.
Curious if you're seeing a positive inflection in customer mentality in the U.S.? We're beginning to hear that customers
here are shifting from cost-cutting to more of a revenue growth focus.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I love the U.S. I love that market and I love the U.S. for Accenture for many reasons. First,
it's a very large market for Accenture, as you know. Second, it's a market where we again posted double digit growth
this quarter and for some very good reasons. First, the overall economic environment in the U.S. is better than in the
rest of the world. That's a fact.
Second is U.S. companies are, more than any other companies in the world, early adopters of new technologies. So
when you look at this famous SMAC, the early adopters – the creators of the SMAC are in the U.S. and the early
adopters of these new technologies are more in the U.S. So, this is what is making the U.S. today a more vibrant
practice for Accenture.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Okay and then just as a follow-up, going back to the discussion of head count, given the
weakness in a number of countries, why remain committed to the more than 50,000 adds this year given the mantra of
profitable growth and revenues coming in below planned as you exit the year?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Part of our model is – well, first of all, part of that 50,000 is bringing in skills in targeted
areas, SMAC as an example, where we're bringing in skills in high-growth areas.
The other thing about our business is that we always have – true of our business, you always have some churn of
resources and that's healthy for our business. And so we're always going to have hiring, even if our head count is
relatively stable, we're always going to bring in people both for skill reasons and also just part of our ongoing pyramid
refresh, which, by the way, is part of our profitability agenda as well. How we manage that head count in the pyramids.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Okay, got it, thank you.

In closing let me share with you a couple of thoughts. Needless to say, we are operating in a fast-changing environment
where disruptive technologies and new business models are accelerating the need for clients to transform their
businesses and this is driving demand for our services.
Yes, we've been challenged in a few concentrated areas such as consulting in Europe, Brazil and resources, but we are
running Accenture as a portfolio of business, and as I look at the year-to-date, there are many key areas where we are
performing extremely well with double digit growth including BPO, the United States, China, mobility, cloud,
analytics, insurance, capital markets, health and life sciences.
This is giving me the confidence that we are executing the right strategy, building off a very strong platform including
our Diamond Client relationships, our brands, our industry expertise and our global delivery capability as well as our
unique position in the technology ecosystem.
The Accenture team supported by our 266,000 people, remains fully committed to driving profitable growth and
delivering value to our clients and shareholders. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. In the
meantime if you have any questions please feel free to call KC. All the best.
