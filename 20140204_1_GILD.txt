Before we begin our formal remarks, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements
including plans and expectations with respect to our product candidates, financial projections, all of which involve
certain assumptions risk and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ
materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents in
recent press releases.
In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement made during this call.
We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The
GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our website.

Thanks, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us today.
2013 was a very productive year on multiple fronts. Aided by strong scientific data and excellent commercial support
our marketed products achieved record product sales of $10.8 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year and Kevin
will further elaborate on our commercial performance.
The research and development organization was also extremely productive, executing on a record number of clinical
studies across all therapeutic areas as well as submitting marketing authorization applications in both hepatitis C and
oncology.
The special fourth quarter highlight was the U.S. FDA approval of Sovaldi, a once-daily oral nucleotide analog for the
treatment of chronic hepatitis C as a component of a combination antiviral regimen. This was followed in January by
European Commission approval and Sovaldi has been launched in the U.K., Germany and France.
In December, topline data from three Phase 3 studies on the ledipasvir sofosbuvir fixed-dose combination were
released. These studies, ION-1, ION-2 and ION-3, evaluated the fixed-dose tablet in Genotype 1 infected cirrhotic and
non-cirrhotic, treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients both with and without ribavirin for a duration of 8,
12 or 24 weeks.
The response rates in the 8 and 12 week arms evaluate the once daily combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir without
ribavirin, range from 93.6% to 97.7%. Based on these exciting data, the NDA and the European Marketing
Authorization applications will be filed this quarter. The FDA previously assigned breakthrough designation to this
combination, and the European Medicines Agency, EMA, has accepted Gilead's request for accelerated assessment, a
designation that is granted to new therapies and medicines of major public health interest. Accelerated assessment
could shorten the EMA's review time of ledipasvir sofosbuvir by two months.
Turning now to HIV, we received European Commission approvals for Stribild; Tybost, a pharmacokinetic enhancer
that boosts blood levels of certain HIV medicines; and Vitekta, an integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV-1
infection in adults.
Last quarter enrollment was completed in two Phase 3 studies for the single-tablet regimen of elvitegravir, cobicistat,
emtricitabine and TAF, abbreviated ECF TAF in treatment-naïve patients. These studies will read out in the fourth
quarter of 2014. In addition, this tablet is being evaluated in a number of other studies including treatment-experienced
patients, patients switched to ECF TAF, patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, as well as adolescents. We
currently anticipate filing this broad package for U.S. and European approval of the ECF TAF in the first quarter of
2015 for naïve, experienced and switching indications.
In September an NDA was submitted for idelalisib, a targeted oral inhibitor of PI3K delta for the treatment of relapsed
refractory INHL. This application was assigned a standard review with a PDUFA date of September 11.

This was followed in December by the filing of a second NDA with the FDA for CLL. The FDA branded idelalisib, a
breakthrough therapy designation for relapsed CLL patients. This designation was based on data from a pre-specified
interim analysis performed by an external data monitoring committee showing a highly statistically significant effect on
the primary endpoint of progression free survival.
Just yesterday we were informed that FDA has granted this application priority review with a PDUFA date of August 6,
2014. European MAA filings for idelalisib in iNHL and CLL were submitted in October.
Overall, 2013 was a very exciting year with significant milestones achieved across the entire organization, for which I'd
like to thank all our employees for their dedication and hard work. As we look ahead, 2014 will also be a busy year
with numerous upcoming milestones.
In liver disease we expect to file our first ever regulatory submissions in Japan for sofosbuvir plus ribavirin in genotype
2 infected patients and ledipasvir sofosbuvir fixed dose combination in genotype 1 infected patients. We anticipate
having numerous presentations on liver disease programs at EASL in April in London including data on the ledipasvir
sofosbuvir Phase 3 studies.
We also anticipate the first product approval and launch in oncology for idelalisib in iNHL and CLL. In addition we
have a record number of clinical studies ongoing and planned across all therapeutic areas as our pipeline continues to
expand.
As you know, Kevin Young has announced his plans to retire and transition to a senior adviser role. For the past nine
years, Kevin has successfully led our global commercial organization during a time of significant change, complexity
and extraordinary growth. Those who had the opportunity to work with Kevin have seen firsthand his passion and
commitment to Gilead and to our employees and the value he places on doing what's right and in the best interest of
patients. His leadership and drive will be missed. Please join me in thanking Kevin for his many contributions and wish
him well for the next chapter of his life.
As always we look forward to sharing our progress with you as the year progresses.
I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Young.
Kevin Young
Thank you, John. Good afternoon, everyone.
2013 was an outstanding year for Gilead Sciences. Total worldwide net product revenues closed in on the $11 billion
mark. Antiviral sales exceeded $9 billion, notably for the first time Complera, Stribild and Letairis achieved sales of
over $0.5 billion and our cardiopulmonary franchise topped $1 billion in 2013.
Looking into more detail around fourth quarter results, I would first like to concentrate on the U.S. Total U.S. sales for
the quarter were a record $1.94 billion, a growth of 29% over the fourth quarter of 2012. Antiviral and
cardiopulmonary franchises posted very impressive year-over-year growth of 31% and 23%, respectively.
Excluding Sovaldi sales, the antiviral franchise grew 20% year-on-year. In HIV, underlying demand in the quarter was
very healthy thanks to the growth of our newest single tablet regimens, Stribild and Complera. Over and above this
reassuring picture revenue did exceed demand by about $130 million to $150 million due to an increase in year-end
inventory levels.
I'd like to break down the inventory increase into its component parts. First, we had a repeat of what we saw a year ago
in Q4 2012 where there was a significant amount of strategic purchasing by small wholesalers and large retail chains in
advance of January price increases. Second, inventory at the big three wholesalers finished above established ranges
due to the timing of year-end. Normalization of inventory will likely take place during Q1 2014. And thus could have
some impact on quarterly results.

As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong uptake of Stribild and Complera. Seven of ten naïve HIV patients
start on [indiscernible] (10:28) of STR [Single Tablet Regimen]. And as of the third quarter 2013, Stribild was the
largest STR with three of ten starts. Stribild is also the number one HIV therapy in HIV patients who switch regimens.
And as you know, Stribild is now a DHHS preferred regimen, an important endorsement that strengthens its profile still
further.
The performance of Complera was almost as impressive as Stribild. Sales in the U.S. alone exceeded $0.5 billion for
the year. It remains the Number 2 regimen in naïve HIV patients and Number 2 regimen in patients who are switched
and the number two in all HIV-treated patients. One important change to the Complera label came in December with a
broadening beyond the naïve setting to include patients who are virologically suppressed on stable PI-containing
regimens.
Turning to Europe, we are very pleased with the fourth quarter year-over-year sales growth of 9%, excluding foreign
exchange. Eviplera has, for the first time, become the most prescribed regimen for naïve HIV patients and continues to
extend its lead over Atripla as the most switched to regimen in the big five E.U. markets. Eviplera is now a preferred
regimen in the EHCS guidelines and all five major E.U. national guidelines. Furthermore, in December, European
regulatory authorities extended the Eviplera label, removing the limitation of use in treatment naïve patients.
We are also very excited about the early uptake of Stribild where we have launched in 14 countries across Europe.
Performance in the U.K. and Germany is roughly double that of Eviplera at the same time point. A recent change in the
British HIV guidelines designated Stribild as a preferred regimen. This coincided with full NHS England
reimbursement. We now have over 60 centers in the U.K. ordering Stribild including all major London HIV clinics.
And just a month ago, Stribild was launched in Spain, the second-largest European HIV market. We hope to have
reimbursement in France by the end of the first quarter and Italy by mid-year.
Turning to hepatitis C, as John alluded to earlier, this is a transformational moment for HCV patients who have lived
with this disease for many years and have so few options for a cure. Even though it is early days, we are extremely
pleased with the U.S. launch of Sovaldi. Sales in December totaled $136 million. A little over half of these are
attributable to the initial opening inventory supplied to the big three wholesalers, which approached nearly $70 million.
We also received a one-off order for $15 million for a clinical trial. The balance of the revenue, approximately $50
million, was driven by patient demand.
Sovaldi prescribing has been broad-based, both across physician groups and patient genotypes. Hepatologists,
gastroenterologists, IM's and infectious disease specialists have all begun using Sovaldi. Our U.S. field forces,
therapeutic specialists, medical scientists and national account managers were sized, resourced and trained to attain
broad market coverage. And as we sensed from pre-launch research, physicians who have stopped using the protease
inhibitors plus pegylated interferon reengaged in HCV treatment using Sovaldi.
Our first qualitative snapshot survey fielded at the beginning of the year has given us a feel for the type of patient
receiving Sovaldi. The genotype distribution is very much in line with the U.S. HCV population with approximately
70% usage in Genotype 1. By far, the most popular treatment regimen for the Genotype 1 patient is, as you would
expect, the NEUTRINO approach of Sovaldi in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 12 weeks.
We also see that some GT-1 patients have been given a combination of Sovaldi plus simeprevir. On the payer front, it
typically takes between three and six months for a full formulary listing. However, almost without exception,
prescriptions are being approved by commercial plans. The typical tiering of an innovative new specialist drug is being
applied to Sovaldi. Namely, Tier 3 with a prior authorization.
We expect the same type of timelines for coverage across the various federal payer segments and, encouragingly, we
have already seen some uptake by state Medicaid plans, as well as DOD TRICARE.
Our U.S. patient assistance program for Sovaldi, Support Path, has been very active since launch. This program helps
patients navigate benefits coverage, as well as provide assistance where allowed with co-pays and foundation grants.
We anticipate that 30% to 50% of commercial patients will utilize our co-pay assistance program.

Outside the U.S., we were very pleased with the European Commission approval of Sovaldi on Friday, January 17.
Bottles of Sovaldi began shipping immediately on Monday morning, and we have so far fulfilled orders in the U.K.,
Germany, France, Austria, Sweden and Finland. Full pricing will not be complete in some countries for up to a year.
Health economic dossiers have now been filed with all major reimbursement agencies and we are very hopeful that
Sovaldi will be given high ratings to support rapid public coverage.
On an interim basis, we are exploring special national mechanisms, which allow purchase and prescribing in defined
high need populations. As a reminder, we began selling in France in October under an approved temporary
authorization for use, or ATU, program in patients pre and post liver transplant and patients with advanced liver disease
who have failed other HCV treatments. Sales under this program, for 2013, were $3 million.
Finally, I'd like to briefly mention our oncology activities. We have begun to build out our sales and marketing
organizations for idelalisib in-line with projected regulatory timelines. In the U.S., we have hired all of our regional
managers and will have the therapeutic specialist team in place and trained by the middle of the year. All individuals
have strong backgrounds in oncology and hematology. A very similar process will be followed in Europe, with
particular emphasis on Germany, France and the U.K.
In closing, I have never seen Gilead so strong and so ready to face the challenges and capture the opportunities of a
new year.
I will now turn the call over to Robin.
Robin L. Washington
Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone.
Earlier today, we were pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full-year 2013 results that were in-line with our
revised guidance. Our strong commercial execution across all therapeutic areas resulted in fourth quarter total revenues
of over $3 billion, up 21% year-over-year and 12% sequentially.
As previously mentioned, strong wholesaler and sub wholesaler purchases, in anticipation of January 1 price increases,
may result in an inventory draw down by wholesalers and sub wholesalers in the first quarter of 2014; similar to the
first quarter of 2013.
Fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.55 per share compared to $0.50 per share the same period last year.
Turning to the balance sheet, during 2013, we achieved our target net debt to EBITDA of 1.5 times and resumed
repurchases under our share purchase program, which were $582 million for the full year. Focused efforts on
collections and increased government funding to hospitals in Southern Europe allowed us to reduce our European DSO
to levels not seen in over 10 years.
Finally, I would like to cover our full year 2014 non-GAAP financial guidance, summarized on slide 45 in the earnings
presentation available on our corporate website. We expect product sales from our core business, excluding Sovaldi, to
be in the range of $11.3 billion to $11.5 billion, an increase of 6% to 8% over 2013. This range assumes anticipated
price decreases in certain European territories and the impact of generic efavirenz, now available in Canada and
Europe.
Our non-GAAP product gross margin is expected to be in the range of 75% to 77%. We expect our non-GAAP R&D
expenses to be in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion as we continue to invest in our product pipeline and we expect
our non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion, which assumes the continued build
out and expansion of our commercial infrastructure in Europe and Asia to support Sovaldi and increased marketing and
sales efforts related to the launch of our first oncology product, idelalisib, in the U.S. and Europe.
For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 28% to 29%. As Congress has not
extended the Federal R&D Tax Credit for 2014, we have excluded the credit from our guidance. Please note that last

year's effective tax rate included an R&D tax credit for 2013 and the retroactive impact for 2012 in the first quarter.
We are anticipating the full-year diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related restructuring and stock-based compensation
expenses to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.66 per share. This range includes the full-year effect of the amortization of
in-process R&D related to Sovaldi.
At this point, full-year sales of Sovaldi are difficult to estimate and are not included in net product sales guidance. With
that said, we are conscious of the potential magnitude of Sovaldi's impact on certain areas of our guidance and wanted
to provide you with the following metrics. In 2014 only, we estimate that our non-GAAP product gross margin will
increase by approximately 0.75% to 1% for every $1 billion of Sovaldi sales and our non-GAAP effective tax rate will
decrease by approximately 0.75% to 1% for every $1 billion in Sovaldi sales.
In closing, we are pleased with our 2013 accomplishments across the organization. Based on the groundwork we have
laid, we believe 2014 will be another outstanding year for Gilead and look forward to sharing updates on our progress
and future successes with you.
We would now like to open the call for questions. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Please proceed, sir.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Good afternoon, guys, and congrats on a really strong quarter. Kevin, I want to get your
early market experience with Sovaldi in the U.S. beyond your earlier comments, just with respect to treatment
experienced versus naïve and then Genotype 3 use and if you've heard of any secondary warehousing occurring in the
U.S.? And maybe the sum total of this, if you can contrast that with what you've seen in France, just given your longer
experience there too? Thanks.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey, Geoff, good afternoon. So in terms of the U.S., I referred to some market research that we
did in January. Going back to the launch, we did expect that people might hold off in the Genotype 1 because of the
Christmas period.
In this research, it does seem now that the use of Sovaldi is very much reflecting the spectrum of patients that you have
in the U.S., so about 70% in Genotype 1. We are seeing some use in Genotype 2 and Genotype 3. Genotype 3 was
about 12% in that very small survey. Genotype 2 was about 17%. Again, I must stress, this is very low numbers. It was
a survey done in people who were beginning to use Sovaldi. So it's very representative and I think that's very reassuring
that we're seeing that.
Our sense is that physicians are calling in their advanced patients because, of course, they need to be treated. So our
sense is that they're sort of clearing patients that they may have had waiting and that may well continue during the first
quarter.
In terms of France, our prescribing, right now, is according to the definition of the temporary authorization for use, the
ATU, because what happened in January is that the French government has said that the ATU parameters must now
still apply until there is full reimbursement of the product in France.
So we've had extremely good response. As soon as we switched to the use of our public Sovaldi, we had an immediate
order from the public hospitals around Paris. 19 of our top centers, of our top 20 centers, in France have prescribed
Sovaldi. But the majority of the patients treated have been the F3s and the F4s, and that's not surprising because
patients with advanced disease with no alternative are as per the ATU guidance. So that's probably not surprising. And
I'll just throw in this one, Geoff, that in Germany kind of like the U.S. our sense is that it's sort of prescribing according
to the distribution of genotypes.

Oh, yeah. Sorry, Geoff. John Milligan just reminded me of your other part. We're not aware at all of any sort of form of
secondary warehousing of patients. Right now, I think physicians, whether for the U.S. or Europe, are totally energized
about the availability of Sovaldi, so no sense whatsoever that they may be holding back patients for oral.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please proceed, sir.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Hey, John. I was just wondering how you're preparing for the 2029 Sovaldi patent cliff?
Just kidding. Hey...
<A - John C. Martin>: Thanks, Mark.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Sure. No, congratulations. Can I just extend that last question? I know you're not giving
Sovaldi guidance this year. Obviously, I respect that and get why because of all the unknowns. But it was interesting in
your response to Geoff's question that you haven't seen any secondary warehousing. Is your current expectation that
we're not likely to see a decline in U.S. demand for Sovaldi any time before the combination pill G1 launch,
presumably in the 4Q, if you're willing?
And then just a clarification on the tax rate: that's $1 billion of sales no matter where they occur geographically,
correct? That would have the impact on tax rate gross margin? Thank you.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey, Mark. It's Kevin. Mark, it really is still incredibly early days. We've only just got through
our first full month and what we call the first brave month of launch, clearly, without the holiday period. So I think it's
so difficult to say what's going to happen in the transition period between Sovaldi and Sovaldi ledipasvir. Plus, we don't
know what ultimately the timelines are going to be for launch of our new single tablets. So I just don't think we know
and I think we need to get through the first quarter into the second quarter, and of course know what might be the
timelines for launch before we can have any feel for that, Mark.
So I really don't have any other color. I would just reemphasize that the energy is extremely high and that's not just in
the major liver disease centers. We're getting good response from the gastroenterologists who have been prescribing,
from internal medicine physicians and we're seeing a little prescribing from the infectious disease physicians.
<A - Robin L. Washington>: And, Mark, this is Robin, for the second part of your question, which I believe was just
the guidance we provided around the impact on our tax rate applied to global Sovaldi sales. The answer is, it does. And
please remember that as we guided, that only relates to 2014.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed, sir.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Sure, thanks. Congratulations on a good quarter. My question is on your end user customers.
What percent do you think you are seeing are private pay versus Medicaid versus other buckets? And a follow-on to
that is when does the VA come on and prisons? What kind of customers are you seeing now and going through the first
half of the year, et cetera?
<A - Kevin Young>: Hi, Michael, Kevin. Thanks for the question. The majority, by far the vast majority is the private
pay right now. We are actually having some initial formulary listing from state Medicaids like New Jersey, New York,
which is quite encouraging. We shouldn't forget that all Medicaids have often some form of interim coverage just like
the private plans. And so we're going to be exploring all of those across the country. We've had a couple of ADAPs,
cover and list Sovaldi. That's not with any additional discounts. That's purely at the Medicaid pricing. But, I have to say
that the majority of patients right now are coming from the private managed care sector.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. I was wondering if
you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing into the first quarter and obviously the prescription data clearly
showing an uptick. You've talked about early January being sort of the real launch where you can detail more
aggressively and engage with payers. So, sort of wondering what kind of files are you seeing and also what the impact
of the recent AASLD guidelines might be on treatment patterns – treatment practice and uptake patterns? Thanks.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hi, Brian. It's so hard, Brian. It's so early. It is obvious that the major liver centers are treating the
sicker patients. That's not only intuitive, but it's common sense that you'd want to be trying to cure patients who are
really, really advanced and the hepatologists knew about this drug and the hepatology centers take the sicker patients.
So they have patients lined up. We even know of some centers that were even checking on the insurance qualifications
of those patients so they could very quickly receive drug.
I think it's important, though, to say that we've got a lot of people to talk to about Sovaldi, particularly in the GI
community that really weren't that familiar with the protease inhibitors and weren't warehousing patients and we're
introducing, I think, a very novel therapy and they're very interested in this. And as I mentioned, I think we're getting
people to reengage and think about treating HCV whereas in past years they were certainly asking for the patient –
asking for the patient to wait.
The AASLD guidelines are very, very positive. I couldn't tell you that I've seen an actual specific impact, but as an
umbrella endorsement of Sovaldi, and indeed, to stop using the prior therapies is very strong. I'd also like to mention,
Brian, that we have seen, after only 10 days after approval, a very similar change in Germany and we do know that the
opinion leaders in the U.K. are considering some form of consensus guidelines with the introduction of Sovaldi, so very
positive.

Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Sanford Bernstein, please proceed.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much, and congratulations again to Kevin on all that he has accomplished.
Unfortunately my question is about the SG&A guidance, which is a significant step up, I think, from certainly what we
were expecting but also a big step up from 2013. I was just wondering if you could talk a little more about that
guidance. Specifically, does it fully account for the expense for the launch of idelalisib, doing fixed dose combination
and whatever else you might incur and is there any contingency in the SG&A that would go up if you saw more
Sovaldi over the year and equally, looking ahead, is this the big step up year in SG&A given the late-stage pipeline or
should we anticipate similar increases in the next couple of years? Thanks.
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Geoff, it is Robin. I'm going to go in a little different order. Relative to the contingency,
I think we really stepped back and looked at SG&A to be all encompassing. So irrespective of the size of sales I think
you've got that all included relative to the guidance that we've given you.
In terms of the overall components, it does include all the sales and marketing expenses for Sovaldi launch in the U.S.,
Europe, Canada and Australia. Keep in mind this isn't only for the ramp, it continues in some of those countries but it's
the full year effect of the ramp that we had in 2013.
It does also include the build out, as Kevin talked about in his script, for a launch of idelalisib in both the U.S. and the
EU and it also includes a ramp for new markets, most specifically, Japan but there's also a small amount of money in
there for some other emerging markets that we are considering in 2014. That's the biggest component over 50% of the
increase.

If you think about just our traditional SG&A ex our legal is increasing significantly as we have to continue to defend
our patents. The excise tax and again the excise tax is retroactive, so it does not include Sovaldi sales because it's based
on 2013 revenue but there is a significant step up in that and you saw on our slide deck where our guidance of about
$150 million to $170 million for that as well. And I think just given the overall growth of the company, we've increased
employees a thousand-fold this past year, so there are some overall increases relative to our infrastructure and SG&A
that we have to consider given our growth.
<A - Kevin Young>: Just to add to that from Robin, Geoff, as a reminder, in Japan we are going to launch as Gilead,
so were going to be staffing a full specialist field force and that will take place in the second half of the year, ready for
a first half 2015 launch, so that is a new component for us at Gilead.

Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Just to follow up on the HCV co-pay and taxes, I guess I'm a little bit confused if 30% to
50% of your Sovaldi patients are going to be utilizing the co-pay assistance program, how does that not impact SG&A
or how are you thinking about that?
And then, Robin, I was intrigued by your comment about the tax improvement only applying to 2014, so can you give
us a better sense of what are the dynamics in 2015 and beyond that would make that number higher or lower as we
think about our outer year models? Thanks.
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Rachel, relative to the co-pay, as I said, to the extent that co-pay program or the support
launch, as Kevin described, it is inclusive of those co-pays in SG&A guidance. So it's sales, it's marketing and it's any
type of programs that we would put in place.
There are also specific foundation grants that we've given to help with patients getting the access to Sovaldi. You saw it
increase in Q4 and some of that continued into 2014.
Relative to the tax rate, I've said all along that commercialization of Sovaldi worldwide would lower our tax rate and
that's based on where the patient population of Sovaldi, as more ex-U.S. sales will, overall, allow us to continue to
reduce that rate and we also did some supply chain restructuring that allowed us to take advantage of that tax rate
reduction even sooner.
We don't give long-term tax rate guidance, but I'd expect the tax rate overall continue to decline as the level of Sovaldi
revenue continues to increase.

<Q - Matthew Roden>: Great. Thanks very much for taking my question, and congrats to Kevin on a great

First of all, in terms of demand in the fourth quarter, can you tell me if I'm doing the math right that if you had $136
million on the quarter, $15 million was a one timer, $70 million was inventories. So does that mean demand is roughly
$50 million? Is that the right way to think about it?
And then related, I get a lot of questions on the sustainability of the hep C market, I was just wondering if you could
talk about, to the extent that you can, how you model hep C over the longer term? You said you see this as a relatively
long-lived opportunity. And that's a point of view that we've seen shared by other management teams as well. I just

wanted to get your sense for the key swing factors in your model that are most impactful to sustain demand, whether
it's diagnosis and linkage to care, capacity to treat, need to treat, geographic expansion, et cetera?
And then lastly, and related, how you see aggregate market-wide pricing over the long-term in the market? Thanks.
<A - Kevin Young>: Okay, Matt. Let me try to take all of those questions. Yes, your math is about right. Bear in mind
that the $70 million we put out there we felt was appropriate for the December period and the type of usage. I think it's
important to point out that as we go into January, February and the first quarter, that actual purchase will be for
demand, but will be for keeping up inventory levels as major wholesalers start to adjust their inventory levels according
to demand. So we will see as we go into the second, first, second quarter that you know the actual purchase will be
reflective of both dynamics, but your $50 million number, we think, is about right.
In terms of sustainability, we've said, I think, on a number of occasions at Gilead that we see this as a long-term
opportunity for the company and for our products in hepatitis C. Yes, people are clearly waiting for Sovaldi. There will
be undoubtedly physicians and hospitals excited about having an all oral. But we're going to be doing a lot as we come
out of 2014 into 2015 around patient education, particularly for the patients who are currently diagnosed but are really
not doing anything about the disease. I think you're going to see, as we move through 2014, some very innovative
advertising from Gilead that will start to raise awareness that there are good alternatives now for hepatitis C and you
should be seeking a conversation with your physician.
And then you mentioned the geographic rollout, we think there are great opportunities in Europe. Undoubtedly that's
led by France. But we've seen initial excitement and a quite significant early uptake in Germany. And then we'll have
some of the European markets come on later. We do think this drug is really appropriate for the elderly
treatment-experienced and treatment intolerant Japanese patients. And then, we've got a great team here who have got a
lot of experience in other countries like Latin America, Brazil, where actually we're putting some of our own people in
there for the first time and we think that's going to be helpful for the more difficult and challenging sort of pricing and
reimbursement prescriptions you have in these countries.
So I think on all of those levels, we have a longer life cycle for our hepatitis C products then perhaps people are giving
credit for.
<Q - Matthew Roden>: Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question. So, I just have Robin, I have a quick question
for you and then a question for Kevin. So Robin for you, you mentioned, or I think Kevin mentioned that prior
authorizations are one of the tier 3 requirements. But this is essentially a first line product recommended to be a first
line product. So I'm just confused a little bit about the requirement for prior authorizations. What can they possibly
require?
And then secondly just for Kevin, help us think how do we think about that €56,000 price under ATU? Historically
that's been a good benchmark about how to think about the European pricing. Is that how we should think about it, now
that it's approved? Thank you.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey, Yaron. I probably should take the first question, as well. Right now, because managed care
are using kind of an interim coverage, you get this Tier 3 plus a prior authorization. When they go for full formulary
listing, it could well move to Tier 2, but there will always be a prior authorization. Every hepatitis C drug has had a PA
and I think we absolutely believe that whether it's Sovaldi or Sovaldi ledipasvir or any other product for that matter, a
PA will always be there and it's really just a checkpoint that the drug is being used according to the label. It is no
further restriction than that. So it's just that the right type of patient, the right genotype according to the label is being
prescribed by the physician.

Let me transition to European pricing. So you mentioned the French ATU price. So you are correct. That's €56,000 or,
by today's FX, about $76,000. And I said before, that that's really a very individual price point because it's a very
restricted use in patients that really have no alternatives, whether they are HCV or HCV with a liver transplant.
I would like to talk a little bit about the rest of the pricing for Europe. We have now listed our price in the U.K. Our
price in the U.K. is almost £35,000. So that's about $57,000, and I think, as a benchmark for the majority of Europe,
that would be a good price point for you going forward. So I will say that again, about £35,000 is the 12-week course of
treatment, or about $57,000. And I also mentioned the German pricing, the German pricing is almost €49,000, or
$66,000. So Germany typically is a little bit higher.
And my final comment on European pricing is just to say that these are significant differences to the telaprevir pricing
and the uplift that we've taken for Sovaldi, we believe, is very justified according to cost effectiveness data. And the
premium is very comparable to the premium that we took on Sovaldi versus the original price of telaprevir in the
United States.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.
<Q - Brian P. Skorney>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys, and congrats on a great launch so far. I guess, I know we've
talked a little bit about the potential competition we're going to see in hep C and we've seen the full AbbVie Phase III
results right now. And I just wondered if we could kind of get some top-level thoughts on how you see competition
emerging between you guys? Do you think that – would you favor a position where AbbVie can have some reasonable
market share without getting into a price competition? Or do you think given the benefits of sofosbuvir and your
regimen that it's a moot point and that at any price you think the regimen is just so much better that it'll stand on its
own?
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey, Brian. It's Kevin. I will answer and then maybe Norbert has one or two on the scientific
front. I think what you are referring to is, my apologies, somewhat artificial. I don't think Gilead thinks that way. I don't
think really any pharmaceutical company, in terms of somehow being super clever about segmentation and one
company gets one part and one company gets another.
We present the profile of Sovaldi, we obviously present according to the label and all of the data within the label and I
think, ultimately, the physician and the payer make the choice. We believe that the Sovaldi data and the Sovaldi
ledipasvir data is very, very strong and our profile will give it a preeminent position not only in the minds of the
physician but in the minds of the payer. So, I think the market ultimately makes decisions and ultimately prescribes and
uptakes the product according to the scientific profile and we certainly, as you heard from John Martin, without
ribavirin for a combination have a very, very strong profile in Genotype 1.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yeah, Brian, just to add to that, if you compare – if you do comparisons within a
study, you will come to the conclusion that ribavirin really doesn't make any difference anywhere in any of our arms, in
any of our sub-populations. So our recommendation and, of course, this has to be reviewed by and agreed by
regulators, would be that anybody who is treatment naïve and non-cirrhotic will get eight weeks of the fixed dose
combination without ribavirin, just a single pill, and everybody else would get 12 weeks. It's a very simple algorithm
and there's nothing else required, no [indiscernible] (50:57) therapy, et cetera.

Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities. Please proceed.
<Q - Mayur I. Somaiya>: Thanks for taking my question. Just one for Robin, as it relates to your gross margin
guidance if you think about this maybe a couple years down the road, just let me know if this is an appropriate way to
think about gross margins as Sustiva goes generic in 2017, should the corporate gross margins go back to a level prior
to the Atripla launch or right around the mid-80s? And then we layer on top of that roughly a 100 basis point
improvement in margins for every $1 billion in HCV sales? Is that a good way to think about it?
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Go ahead.
<Q - Mayur I. Somaiya>: And just a slightly different question maybe for Norbert, is there any more clinical work
you think that needs to be done to differentiate your hepatitis C combination versus not versus AbbVie where we're
thinking of the comparisons that are so obvious, but versus some of the newer competitors, maybe Merck, as an
example?
<A - Robin L. Washington>: So Ian, to answer the first part of your question, you are speaking about it directionally
the right way, but recall that our arrangement with BMS says that once efavirenz goes generic that there is a step down
royalty that we'll need to pay to BMS. So it won't happen immediately upon going generic.
Also keep in mind as you think about our core business, excluding Sovaldi, as we continue to have more usage of
Stribild and Complera, Eviplera; that will also have overall product gross margin impact. As you saw even in our
guidance for 2014 you saw some of that shift start to occur. On top of that is the incremental product gross margin
impact related to Sovaldi that we would expect to see as that product becomes a larger component of our revenue
stream.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Ian, thanks for asking an R&D question. I thought I was going to escape this call
without having been asked one single question. So thank you very much. Ian, as you know, we have now succeeded
with our ledipasvir sofosbuvir fixed dose combination to actually incredibly shorten treatment duration to eight weeks
and 12 weeks in cirrhotic, treatment-experienced with response rates that go up to 95% or higher. But we're not
stopping there. This is, of course, for Genotype 1.
We have another fixed dose combination in development 5816 combined with sofosbuvir. You will see some of those
early data at EASL and we're still waiting for the treatment experienced cirrhotic Genotype 3 cohort to make a
decision, but we feel really comfortable going into Phase III.
And then finally, as you know we have efforts underway to shorten the treatment duration even further to six weeks by
adding a third drug. So all of those things are ongoing and I think we will be competitive with our – you can't really do
much more than having one single pill once daily, very safe, very well tolerated tablet given for eight weeks and with
treatment response rates of 95%.

<Q - Phil M. Nadeau>: Good afternoon. Kevin, let me add my congratulations to you on your career at Gilead and
maybe if I can direct one last question to you. On payers more broadly than just what you're seeing today, there's been a
lot of news in the press recently about payers restricting access either openly pressuring price through formulary
placement or exclusion or maybe putting up some sort of barriers for before patients given [indiscernible] (55:29) or
something like that. Can you discuss your discussions with payers? Do you think at some point they'll push back on
Sovaldi if sales get too big and do you think they even have a general appreciation of how big Sovaldi sales could be
this year or next year in order to prepare?

<A - Kevin Young>: Thank you for your comments, Phil. So I think this creates awareness. I think we always knew
that. When we did our research even a year ago with payers, hepatitis C was very high on the radar as it is with
oncology products and RA products and some others. I think if you present value to them and we shouldn't forget we
are presenting a cure, it's very compelling. We're curing somebody in 12 weeks, as Norbert said, in eight weeks in the
future and I think that's a very compelling proposition. Already, since the launch of Sovaldi, we've had some plans
come to us who are traditionally quite difficult to get listings, in fact, we've had one of them place orders outside their
formulary.
So I come back to the – and I always come back to the area which is it's the profile of the product. The need in the
patient is very clear and we've got a well-tolerated highly effective cure that physicians and patients want. The payer
will always look at this and will have discussions with the payer, but I think this is transformational medicine and, you
know, the payer will have a role but, you know, I think the adoption of HC products HCV products is here for a long
time to come.

Your next question comes from the line of John Sonnier with William Blair. Please proceed.
<Q - John S. Sonnier>: Thanks for taking the question, and Kevin, my congratulations as well for all of this success
over the years.
You spoke a bit to the broad market access approach of HCV commercial organization. As the launch gains steam I
suspect that becomes increasingly relevant but I'm curious in the early stages, to get your perspective on what attitudes
are toward screening among the different specialties? As screening starts I think we'll get a better picture of true
prevalence and I guess a parallel question is how confident are you that the current U.S epidemiology is actually
correct? Thank you.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey, John. I don't think the managed-care and the payer are thinking too much about the
movements in U.S. guidelines on the baby boomers and to be honest with you, John, right now our concentration of
effort at Gilead is very much presenting the product. But as we get into 2014 and I did refer earlier to some new
educational campaigns that we want to have by the middle of the year, we're certainly going to be addressing the
diagnosed population, that 1.7 million. That's the first area that could be mobilized and then move into the larger 4
million population. We have seen some state activities, there has been a law change in New York that HCV test must
be offered to a baby boomer when they present in a clinical setting. We are aware that has been discussed also in
Florida and we will certainly be using our government affairs organization to continue that around the country.
I think it's always the case around screening that you need the products to treat the disease once it's been identified and
now we have that with Sovaldi and it will prove even stronger with our combination and that encourages people. So I
think we're going to see more and more of that. I think ourselves and competitors will be raising the awareness more
and more. I do think there is a great deal of potential in this market.

since we seem to be in uncharted territory for the launch were seeing with Sovaldi, are there any theoretical caps or

which various payer systems strain under the pressure of the added costs and if so, where might those limits or caps be?

<A - Kevin Young>: Wow, that is an incredible question, Josh. I think you're right. We just don't quite know yet. I
think those caps and possibly sort of bumpers might be more prevalent in Europe, just take European government more
time to expand budgets so it may well be more prevalent there but we have seen increases even as a result of the
protease inhibitors in some markets like Spain and Italy. But I think because it's national health funding across Europe,
that might be more of – brought into more question. I think we just don't know. And, you know, this drug use is really
very special and very transformative. So this is not extending life by a few months. This is probably one of the greatest
breakthroughs to cure people and get rid of a very serious virus. So I think time will tell, Josh.

Mr. O'Brien, we have time for one final question. It comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please
proceed.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Thanks for taking the question. Two quick ones from me: the first is I noticed you had some
new data in your slides on the number of patients in the U.S. and Europe under care. I was wondering specifically in
the U.S. number if that includes or excludes the patients in the VA, so about the 200,000?
And then on the capital allocation side, Robin, maybe you could just provide us with your perspective on share
repurchases in 2014 and anything beyond that? Thank you.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey, Terence, it's Kevin. Yes, it does include the VA population so again, I just want to say,
Terence, that these are estimates. We are using the company Ipsos. That's the company that we've used for long-term
HIV but the sampling is much smaller than we currently have in HIV. In HIV it took us about 10 years to get the type
of sophistication from the Ipsos data. It's going to take us a few years to get more accuracy with hepatitis C, so I would
just put a caveat and perhaps a health warning around this data but it's the best we've got and I think it's representative
of where the U.S. today and you'll see that we've also included that number for the European big five markets as well.
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Terrence this is Robin, relative to capital allocation, in the earnings deck on slide 51, we
outlined our share repurchase by quarter for 2013 and in Q4 we kind of resumed back to our goal of offsetting dilution
and you can expect that to continue in 2014.
Relative to long-term capital structure I'd say that we remain fairly consistent in investing in our pipeline, looking at
various assets that may make sense and then returning cash to shareholders. Right now via share repurchases, but as
we've said, we may consider other vehicles over time. But, other than that, I'd say it's business as usual as to how we
are thinking about utilization of cash is divided.
