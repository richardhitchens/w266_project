Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include
forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2012 annual report on Form
10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.
The discussions during this call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-F dated today, October 29,
2013.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?
Ian C. Read
Thank you, Chuck. I'll begin with some comments on the quarter.
Overall we delivered good operational performance, generated solid financial results, and continue to see steady
progress with many of our in-line products and pipeline assets. Operationally, revenues for the Oncology business grew
26% due to the continued strong performance of new products, primarily Inlyta and Xalkori. We also had another
strong quarter operationally from Lyrica which grew 11%, and from Celebrex which grew 13%.
Despite macroeconomic and other factors, the emerging markets business grew 5% operationally, primarily due to
volume growth for key products in the Primary Care area such as Lipitor, Norvasc, Lyrica and Celebrex, especially in
China. We still anticipate achieving mid-single digit growth in emerging markets for the year.
Turning to an update on our recently launched and approved products and pipeline assets, earlier this month we
received FDA approval of Duavee, our novel combination therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor
symptoms associated with menopause and the prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis, and we anticipate launching
this product in the U.S. during the first quarter of next year.
We and our partner, Bristol-Myers Squibb, continue to focus on improving the performance and physician uptake for
Eliquis. In the U.S., we have seen positive momentum in the week-over-week growth in total prescriptions and in late
September we launched our direct-to-consumer television advertising campaign.
Eliquis also has been launched for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation in several additional markets including
Australia, Spain and Canada, where reimbursement has been established. We also see potential expansion opportunities
for Eliquis with additional indications. With Bristol-Myers, we submitted an sNDA in the U.S. for VTE prevention in
patients undergoing orthopedic surgery.
Turning to Xeljanz, we are pleased with the progress of the launch in the U.S. and various other markets which
continues to be in line with our expectations, particularly in the context of being part of a large but slow-growth
segment within the anti-TNF market. We're seeing a steady increase in prescriptions. Comparing the third quarter with
the second quarter of this year, we saw a 53% sequential growth in total prescription volume in the U.S.
Overall, the physicians' feedback on Xeljanz has been very positive. Satisfaction amongst users is high. In fact, nearly
3,000 healthcare providers have prescribed Xeljanz, and over 75% have been repeat prescribers. We know that before
prescribing, rheumatologists want to have a deep knowledge and confidence in Xeljanz's safety profile and clinical
experience, particularly given it is a first-in-class product. To date, the vast majority of physicians have reacted
favorably to Xeljanz's clinical profile, and we are focusing our efforts on continuing to educate physicians on Xeljanz's
clinical data.
We also have several Phase 3 programs underway for Xeljanz. The Phase 3 program in psoriasis is progressing and is
one of the largest global clinical trial programs in moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis to date. There are five
studies in the program. Earlier this month, we announced the top-line results from the first two studies, which provided
information consistent with our expectations based on the Phase II data in psoriasis.

The other three studies in the Phase 3 psoriasis program include two pivotal studies and a long-term extension study.
We anticipate top-line results for the pivotal trials in the second quarter of 2014 and will issue a top-line data release
after we've received and reviewed the results.
We have initiated a Phase 3 program to evaluate Xeljanz for the treatment of patients with active psoriatic arthritis
which includes two pivotal trials that evaluate the safety and efficacy of Xeljanz and one long-term extension study.
The first data from these trials is anticipated in 2015. And we continue to study Xeljanz for other important
inflammatory diseases with several Phase 2 and Phase 3 programs ongoing. This includes the Phase 3 program in
ulcerative colitis and a Phase 2 program in Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis and a topical formulation for
psoriasis. We are also moving forward with a once a day modified release program for Xeljanz in RA. The FDA
recently agreed that a Phase 3 study is not necessary for the once a day dose and we plan to file a New Drug
Application with the FDA in 2015.
Beyond the Xeljanz and Eliquis Phase 3 programs we have or will be initiating several Phase 3 studies and we will be
reporting on clinical trial data results from our primary care vaccines and oncology portfolios. I continue to be pleased
with the steps we've taken and the progress we are making towards improving our R&D performance.
Looking at the primary care pipeline there are several promising candidates. This month we're initiating a Phase 3
program for bococizumab, the proposed generic name for RN316, our PCSK9 monoclonal antibody to lower
LDL-cholesterol. This is a global program that includes multiple lipid lowering studies as well as two cardiovascular
outcome studies in more than 22,000 patients. Compared to the PCSK9 inhibitor Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome trials
being conducted by our competitors, only our bococizumab Phase 3 program includes a dedicated cardiovascular
outcome study in patients who cannot achieve LDL levels lower than 100 MG per DL despite the use of statins. This is
a very high risk patient population with significant unmet need who represent a tremendous cost to our healthcare
system.
Our second Phase 3 outcomes trial will address whether driving LDL-cholesterol levels well below current guideline
recommended targets will lead to a further reduction in cardiovascular events. Importantly, compared to other
programs, our Phase 3 program includes the broadest range of high risk patients in need of improved cholesterol
management. We are currently competing in the final analysis of the data sets of our completed Phase 2b study and
plan to submit the results for presentation at the American College of Cardiology meeting in March 2014.
We are planning to continue development of tanezumab for the treatment of osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain and
cancer pain. We have just entered into a collaboration agreement with Eli Lilly and Company to jointly develop and
globally commercialize tanezumab, which provides that in addition to certain potential milestone payments to Pfizer,
Pfizer and Lilly will equally share product development expenses and potential revenues and certain product related
costs. The tanezumab program is currently subject to a partial clinical hold by the FDA pending submission of
non-clinical data to the FDA which we anticipate submitting in the first half of 2014.
In addition, we're initiating a Phase 3 program with our partner, Merck, for ertugliflozin, our SGL2 inhibitor for the
treatment of Type 2 diabetes.
Turning to vaccines, we expect to have data readouts in three disease areas: pneumococcal pneumonia in adults,
meningitis B and staph aureus.
For pneumococcal pneumonia, the case accrual in the CAPiTA trial involving Prevnar 13 adult has been completed.
The processing of the cases will take several months to complete and we have not yet seen the data. We expect a
read-out of the top-line results early in 2014.
For meningitis B, we anticipate sharing results of the Phase 2 study data in adolescents and young adults who are the
major carriers of this disease, at a key medical congress in the first half of 2014. Of note, our vaccine contains two
protein components which elicit a broad immune response against the majority of meningitis B vaccine strains in these
immunized individuals.

We are encouraged by the efficacy and tolerability data we have seen to date and have already initiated a pivotal Phase
3 clinical development program that includes Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials that will include more than 20,000 participants.
If trial enrollment and recruiting goes as planned, data from this program are expected in the next several years. Excuse
me.
For staph aureus, we recently concluded a Phase 2a study which showed encouraging signals that our vaccine elicits
positive immune response. The next step is to move into a Phase 2b study in surgical patients. We anticipate sharing
results from the Phase 2a study in the first half of 2014 at a key medical congress.
In Oncology, we also anticipate several readouts in 2014. In breast cancer, we expect the final efficacy and safety data
from the Phase 2 palbociclib study to read out in early 2014 to be presented ASCO in June 2014 or at another congress
next year.
We have initiated two Phase 3 studies of palbociclib. One study mimics the trial design of the Phase 2 study in patients
with post-menopausal ER-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, which has a planned enrollment of 450
patients. The other study is in patients with hormone receptor positive, HR positive, and HER2-negative advanced
recurrent breast cancer. It compares fulvestrant plus palbociclib to fulvestrant plus placebo. In addition, we expect to
start a Phase 3 study for palbociclib in the next few months in early breast cancer for high-risk patients with
neoadjuvant treatment.
For non-small cell lung cancer, we're expecting top line results from two Phase 3 studies for dacomitinib in the early
part of next year.
We have five programs in various stages to develop biosimilars of innovative products. Our development program
includes biosimilars for Herceptin, which is scheduled to start Phase 3 over the next few months. In addition, we have a
biosimilar development program for Rituxan and Remicade and Humira that are scheduled for Phase 3 starts next year,
and our biosimilar for Avastin will begin Phase I next year.
The ongoing R&D investment level to support our late-stage pipeline opportunities is warranted by the significant
revenue potential associated with these programs and we expect that as these programs further progress, some
incremental R&D investment will be necessary. That said, we will balance this need with overall shareholder return,
and we will continue to be opportunistic regarding additional internal and externally-sourced compounds that can
further enhance our research pipeline.
I'll close with a few words about the new commercial structure we announced last quarter. We have been aligning
talent, assets, and individual reporting systems to support our new operating structure. We remain on track for
commencing operations in the new structure at the start of 2014 and for providing a 2014 baseline management view of
profit and loss for each business, starting with our financial results for the first quarter of 2014.
In summary, I believe we are making steady progress across the business by enhancing the quality of the pipeline,
demonstrating fiscal discipline in how we deploy our capital and executing on our business plans in order to drive
greater value for our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it over to Frank to take you through the details of the quarter.
Frank A. D'Amelio
Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone.
I want to remind everybody that as a result of the full disposition of Zoetis on June 24th of this year, the financial
results of the Animal Health business are reported as a discontinued operation in the condensed consolidated statements
of income for year-to-date 2013 and third quarter and year-to-date 2012. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are
included in our webcast. Now let's move on to the financials.

Third quarter 2013 reported revenues of approximately $12.6 billion, decreased 2% year-over-year, reflecting a 2%
negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, revenues decreased operationally
by $38 million or less than 1%, primarily due to the negative impact of the continued erosion of branded Lipitor in the
U.S., developed Europe and certain other markets; the ongoing expiration of the Spiriva collaboration in certain
countries; a decrease in government purchases of Prevnar and Enbrel in certain emerging markets; and the loss of
exclusivity of certain other products including Lyrica in Canada February 2013 and Viagra in most major markets in
Europe in June of 2013. These are partially offset by the growth of certain in-line products including Lyrica, Enbrel,
Inlyta and Xalkori globally and Celebrex and Xeljanz in the U.S.
I want to point out that reported revenues also included $67 million from transitional manufacturing and supply
agreements with Zoetis, which are expected to continue for approximately two years.
Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.58 increased 16% primarily due to the aggregate decrease in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted
SI&A and adjusted R&D expenses of $341 million or 5%. Due to the benefit of our ongoing cost reduction and
productivity initiatives the non-recurrence of the $250 million payment in the year ago quarter for the acquisition of the
exclusive over-the-counter rights to Nexium which was included in R&D expenses as well as the favorable impact of
foreign exchange on these items of $166 million or 2%. These were partially offset by higher SI&A spending to
support new product launches.
In addition, there were fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding due to our ongoing share repurchase program
and the first full quarter impact of the Zoetis exchange offer which also favorably impacted adjusted diluted EPS.
Reported diluted EPS was $0.39 versus $0.43 in the year ago quarter and favorably impacted primarily by lower legal
charges, lower acquisition related and other costs and fewer shares outstanding which were more than offset by the loss
of exclusivity of certain products, lower income from discontinued operations and a higher effective tax rate.
During the third quarter, biopharmaceutical revenues in the BRIC-MT markets increased 2% operationally driven
primarily by strong volume growth in China especially for Lipitor. In these BRIC-MT markets volume growth of 3%
was partially offset by price reductions of 1%. Revenue from all emerging markets increased 5% operationally in the
third quarter.
If you exclude the portfolio of products whose rights were transferred to our joint venture in China with Hisun in the
third quarter we would have had operational revenue growth compared to the third quarter of 2012 of 6% in our
emerging markets business, 4% in the BRIC-MT markets and 16% in China.
Foreign-exchange negatively impacted third quarter adjusted revenues by 2% or $271 million and had a positive impact
of 2% or $166 million on the aggregate of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses.
As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 compared
to year ago quarter.
Now moving onto or 2013 financial guidance, based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of
the year we are narrowing the ranges for certain components of our full-year 2013 financial guidance. We are
narrowing the reported revenue range to $50.8 billion to $51.8 billion from $50.8 billion to $52.8 billion. I want to
remind everyone that beginning on November 1, 2013, we enter into the 36 month sunset period in the collaboration
agreement with Amgen for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada. During this period, we expect that our share of the Enbrel
collaboration, which is high-margin because there is no associated cost of goods sold, will decline significantly.
In addition, going forward the recognition of profits from the Enbrel collaboration will shift from alliance revenue to
other income as we move to a royalty structure. Furthermore, these royalty payments will be much less than our current
level of Enbrel profits. Outside of the U.S. and Canada however our exclusive rights to Enbrel will continue in
perpetuity.
I also want to point out that our Spiriva collaboration, which is also recorded in alliance revenue, will continue to wind
down during the fourth quarter 2013 and 2014 most notably in the U.S. and Canada. Currently, the majority of alliance
revenue is composed of Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada as well as Spiriva.

Moving onto adjusted cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues, we are narrowing this range to 18% to 18.5%.
We are narrowing our adjusting SI&A expense range to $14.2 billion $14.7 billion while continuing to absorb launch
costs in support of new products. We are narrowing our R&D guidance range to $6.32 billion to $6.6 billion which will
support our high potential late stage pipeline opportunities. We now expect other deductions to be approximately $400
million and continue to expect the effective tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 28%. We are narrowing
and lowering the reported diluted EPS range to $3.05 to $3.15 and we are narrowing our adjusted diluted EPS range to
$2.15 to $2.20 from $2.10 to $2.20.
Now moving on to key takeaways. Third quarter results continue to reflect the loss of exclusivity of certain products in
various geographies as well as the ongoing volatility in emerging markets. We continue to expect full year operational
revenue growth in our emerging markets business to be in the mid-single digit percentage range. In addition, we
continue to mitigate the earnings impact of product LOEs with both expense discipline and share repurchases.
We narrowed the ranges for certain components of our adjusted financial guidance. Our recently launched products are
progressing at a measured and steady pace. We're advancing initiatives internally so that we will implement our new
commercial structure at the start of 2014. We remain excited about our high potential late stage pipeline assets and
expect to allocate R&D investments to support their advancement beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013 or early
2014.
Finally, we continue to create shareholder value through the prudent allocation of our capital. To date in 2013 we have
repurchased approximately $13.1 billion or approximately 462.1 million shares. We continue to expect to repurchase in
the mid-teens of billions of dollars of our common stock this year. As result, we expect to return more than $20 billion
to our shareholders this year between buybacks and dividends. In addition, we expect the first quarter 2014 dividend
level to be set by our Board of Directors during our December board meeting. And finally, we remain committed to
delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2013 and beyond.
Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.
Charles E. Triano
Thank you, Frank. And, operator, please if we could now poll for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Bank of America.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks a lot. To the extent that – excuse me – to the extent that there are couple of other
PCSK9s out there, can you talk about you needed to see in Phase 2 to make this large investment and potentially how
your product is differentiated beyond the clinical trial differences you highlighted?
And secondly, Ian, curious how you think the collaboration in Japan is going with Mylan and whether you think that
could be a good model in other places or more broadly? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Gregg. Well, clearly, we've seen in the Phase 2 data sufficient quality of data to
encourage us to enter into Phase 3 and believe we have a highly competitive product. So I'd ask John Young to give
more details on that and also discuss the Mylan collaboration.
<A - John D. Young>: Okay. Thanks, Gregg. So let me take PCSK9. Our focus is on that and to say first of all we
think we actually have a great antibody which came out of our Rinat labs in San Francisco. And I think in addition to
having excellent substrate to take into clinical development we also believe that we've been able to put together a
differentiated or potentially differentiated clinical program. So our program will be the only program investigating both

high-risk primary and secondary prevention populations.
When we begin to look at the program in more detail it includes a dedicated CD outcome study in patients who can't
achieve LDL levels lower than 100 mg/dL despite use of statins. That's a very high-risk patient population with a lot of
unmet clinical need. And those patients, as you heard from Ian, really do represent a tremendous cost to the healthcare
system. So a positive outcome in that population, we believe, will be very significant.
And we also combined in our program a second Phase 3 outcomes trial that will address whether driving LDL levels to
well below current guideline recommended targets will lead to further reduction in cardiovascular events.
And I think lastly, the point to make is that importantly compared to other programs our Phase 3 program includes the
broadest range of high-risk patients in need of improved cholesterol management and, as I said, uniquely includes both
high-risk primary and secondary intervention patients. So overall, we believe that the combination of good basic
substrate in the antibody combined with a clinical program that we believe has the potential to demonstrate real
differentiation across patient populations with significant unmet need will enable us to bring a very competitive profile
into what is clearly potentially a very attractive and promising marketplace.
In terms of Mylan, we continue to make positive progress with Mylan in Japan. The collaboration is on track. Currently
we're selling around about 250 products from the combined companies' generic portfolios. The transition and
integration of all 200 Mylan secondees to the Pfizer organization has been completed, and we've completed the launch
of the collaboration's first generic pipeline products in June. Based on the initial performance, all nine products are
forecasted to meet or exceed their full-year plans, so I think – let me just finish on Mylan and say that we're extremely
pleased with progress that we've made and we're going to look to maintain that momentum into 2014.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, John. I would add that we're also very comfortable and pleased with the quality of the
partnership with Mylan, so...
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Great, thank you. Next question, please, operator.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. This is either for Ian or John. I'm just wondering if you could talk about how you plan
to monetize the value business? Just how do you see this business growing, what are the opportunities on the table that
will help to unlock value, and are one of those opportunities to sell the business? And if so, is there a time limit? Do
you have to wait a certain amount of time? I know that you've talked about the other businesses, if you were to spin
them off or spin then out, you have to wait three years, but is there a similar limit if you were going to sell this
business? Would you sell part of it? And also, if you were to sell it, would you be willing to accept someone else's
stock in exchange for it?
And then just a follow-up question on PCSK9, your competitors are not planning on getting – I mean, I don't believe
they need outcomes trials to gain FDA approval. Do you feel that you need these outcomes trials for approval or is this
just to broaden your label and for further differentiation? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Well, Jami, thank you for those questions. On PCSK9, I'll ask John to comment on that first, but I
think the issue is in this marketplace, we – our trials are constructed so as to be able to demonstrate value to society and
payers. John, do you want to add anything more to that?
<A - John D. Young>: Yeah, I mean, I think in terms of the program, as I've already said, we believe we've put
together a really robust and potentially differentiated program. Clearly, we know the LDLC is a very well-established
surrogate for cardiovascular risk, but certainly we know from dialogue and discussion we've had with the FDA that it is
conceivable that regulators may require demonstration of a beneficial effect on CV events before approving a new class
of agents such as PCSK9 inhibitors. At a minimum, robust LDLC lowering along with a comprehensive long-term
safety database will likely be required for bococizumab and potentially other medicines in the class as well, and the

bococizumab Phase 3 program is designed to address the potential for regulatory authorities to require, in addition to
LDLC-lowering, a robust long-term clinical safety database and cardiovascular outcomes data for approval.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Mikael, do you want to add anything vis-à-vis the development of PCSK9 from the technical point
of view?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yeah, we have put in a lot of technical capabilities, how to develop antibodies with the most
potent and biopharmaceutically appropriate characteristics. And when you look at the class, I think you can see
emerging data suggesting some of the antibodies being very potent and some being intermediate. And as Ian alluded to,
we were very encouraged by the potent effect of our antibody in Phase 2, and it's really the robust LDL-lowering,
tolerability and low frequency of anti-drug antibody.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. And, Jami, on your questions on the value, or we call it established products business
unit, now right now we're focused on setting up the new organizational model where we have two innovative
businesses and one established business. You know we're doing that because we firmly believe those businesses have
different characteristics, and we want management uniquely focused on maximizing the growth opportunities of those
businesses.
So, John, who is running that part of the business, will clearly be looking at how to maximize the growth in emerging
markets, how to maximize our supply chain advantages in the developed markets, what growth opportunities there are
in sterile injectables either organically or inorganically, are there other BD activities that can be undertaken in that
business, such as 505(b) filings, and frankly, it's simply too early to speculate on the future developments of those
businesses. Right now as an organization, we're focused on getting them up and running, the management up and
running, in place, looking at all the different growth opportunities I just discussed, looking at supply chain. And once
those businesses are up and running and once there is transparency, then we'll see how the market evaluates the sum of
the parts of those businesses.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Great. Thank you, Ian. Operator, please, next question?

Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JP Morgan.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much. Just following up on that, Ian, how long are you going to want to see
those three business units running separately before you'll be comfortable and in a position to evaluate and make that
decision on the next steps for Pfizer with regards to the strategic alternatives to your portfolio of businesses? Is that
something that's going to take a year? Is that something longer? I guess I'm kind of thinking about next year as setting
them up, as you go to 2015, is that a timeframe where it's reasonable to think about a decision on some of these?
And the second question I had, similarly, following up on Jami's question, if you were to decide that the value core was
something that made sense to separate from Pfizer, are there structures that would allow you to do that prior to 2017 if
that's the right decision? Or is that something that's unreasonable to think about from a timing perspective? Just trying
to get some clarity on the timing if, in fact, you went that direction with the business. Thanks very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Chris. I don't have a fixed timeline in my mind. Right now, we're really focused on the
operational aspect. The value of these businesses will come from their exquisite execution and management making
them valuable by focusing on growth and as that occurs, we'll evaluate our options in a timely manner. And I'll ask
Frank to comment on the actual mechanics of any type of transaction we'd do.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Sure. So, Chris, the way to think about this is, I'll call it public transactions versus private
transactions. In a public transaction, three years of audited financials are required. So think about three years
prospectively of audited financials.
In a private transaction, the sale of a partial business, of an entire business, of some sort of a joint venture, anything like
that, it depends on a significance test and there's three elements to the significance test. There's an asset test, an income

test, and an investment test. And what really drives the requirement there for audited financials is based on the size of
the acquirer and then the income, the assets and the investment of what's being acquired compared to the acquirer's
income, investments and assets. And that can range anywhere from zero, in terms of audited financials, up to three
years.
So that's really what will drive the audited financial requirements. But once again, to punctuate what Ian said, what
we're all about doing is getting these businesses to operationally hum and execute with excellence.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Frank. Next question, please?
Operator
Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you. Two questions, please. If I could just go back to the split up, can you better
characterize the possibility that Pfizer does not split itself up in the complete sense of the word? You previously alluded
to the idea that if the market appropriately re-values Pfizer, once they better appreciate the financials for those different
divisions that perhaps a full split up would not be necessary. My question is, is it reasonably possible that you don't
fully split up?
And then on palbociclib, when might we start to see data in non-breast cancers? It seems like you should either have
data in hand already, or you should very closely have it in hand on tumor types in the blood cancer area, in colorectal
and in lung. And can you say so far that you haven't had any failures in any of these other tumor types?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Tim. Well, this issue of split is totally dictated by what our view will be on how to
maximize shareholder value at the appropriate time. So when these businesses are operating, when there's transparency
for analyst, when they've had time to establish a track record, then we will look at that and we will make decisions
based on how best to maximize the value of shareholders irrespective of size or composition or structure of residual
companies because this management team is focused on producing shareholder value and that's how we'll take the
decision. And I don't really think I can add anything more than that other than to say that our guiding star is how to
create shareholder value.
Geno, would you like to talk about palbo?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Sure. So, Tim, let me just comment that our highest priority is to efficiently advance our
breast cancer program right now with palbociclib. As Ian mentioned, we've initiated two of the Phase 3 trials. We'll
initiate another Phase 3 trial in breast cancer this year. And frankly, we're looking at other breast cancer populations to
explore further as well. We're firmly in the lead here and we're really excited by the data and this is our highest priority.
And notwithstanding that statement we are exploring the use of palbo in a number of other tumor types, as you said,
including melanoma and lung cancer, et cetera. These are primarily Phase 1 level studies and we're not reporting any
data at this point.

Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI group.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey. Thank you very much for taking my question. If I could turn back to the PCSK9s

opportunities in those trials for early stoppage based on interim results?

And then could you also tell us what the dosing is that's being used in the trial? Is it once a month, twice a month, et
cetera?
And then on CAPiTA if I might, can you just walk us through the steps that need to occur after you see the CAPiTA
data to ensure that sales pick up? I know you have to wait for certain recommendations of certain bodies. I wonder if
you could just walk us through that? And is there a scenario where that trial misses statistical significance on its
primary end point, Mikael, but the trends are robust enough that you could still see a recommendation come out of the
relevant bodies? Or do you really think you need to show statistical significance? Sorry for my long winded question.
Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: So, John, if you could talk a little bit about PCSK9 again...
<A - John D. Young>: Okay.
<A - Ian C. Read>: ...bococizumab. And then we'll hand it over to, I think, Geno for the commentary on the CAPiTA.
<A - John D. Young>: Okay. Thanks, Mark. So obviously it's fair to say that all the PCSK9 programs are in relatively
early stages of their clinical development. And as I mentioned in answer to an earlier question, one of the things that all
the programs, including ours, will have to be determined is the data sets as they emerge and what will be required for
approval. And that's something that we will continue to have dialogue with the agency about. So I think it's really
premature to determine if there is any interim readout of data that would lead to an earlier approval, either a LDL
lowering indication or the outcome indication. Mark, can you remind me of the second part of your question?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Dosing.
<A - John D. Young>: In terms of dosing. Okay. So the dosing schedule that we're taking into our clinical program is
a twice a month dosing schedule. So as you heard already from Mikael we will be presenting the results of our Phase
2b study early next year. And from the analysis that we've done of that data so far, although it's incomplete at this point,
but certainly we believe that twice a month dosing schedule actually provides really the optimal consistent
cholesterol-lowering right across the dosage interval in order to maintain the optimal clinical effect and ideally the
optimal clinical outcomes. So we feel really positive about the twice a month dosing schedule being the optimal dosing
schedule for bococizumab.
<A - Ian C. Read>: That being said, Mikael, do you want to add-on something about technology that we're excited
about there?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes. Just to build on the excellent way in which John described our PCSK9 clinical strategy it's
a really well-behaving antibody and this twice monthly administration schedule is the logical next step, as John
described. However, we think that as part of a potential lifecycle management strategy there are opportunities to also
explore once-monthly schedule. That may include the use of technology such as the Halozyme technology, for which
we have exclusive license, within the PCSK9 class and we're now performing early tests on the suitability of that
technology to extend half-life and also lower the volume that you need to inject. The antibody itself at the high dose has
the potential for once a month but we would rather see a technology like this to give a really convenient opportunity. So
as you can see, as we go forward with twice monthly we have a lifecycle management potential to offer additional
regimens.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Mikael. And, Geno, on CAPiTA?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Sure. So with regard to the steps for CAPiTA, as we've indicated, we've completed
accumulation of the required number of events. We're in the process now of finalizing the analysis of those events and
completing the data management associated with creating our top-line results. And we are, at the same time, in
discussions with the CDC and now the ACIP and the pneumococcal working group to ensure their understanding of the
protocol and the potential outcomes so that when we have the data they can move on the data rapidly.
So we're in ongoing discussions with them and this is obviously in the United States. So when the data's available, the
working group exposed to the data and will do their grading process and prepare for bringing those data and their

assessment to the formal ACIP committee. The ACIP committee meets three times a year in February, in June and in
October. It's unlikely that we'll have data available for the February meeting but we are targeting the June meeting. It
could occur in June or it could occur in October.
So that's the U.S. situation. Ex-U.S. in most cases we don't have the pneumonia indication in most ex-U.S. markets
therefore the CAPiTA trial results will form the basis for the pneumonia indication. And we will file those applications
and depending upon the review times we would expect to see the pneumonia indication appear in the 12 to 14-month
timeframe beyond those filings. So hopefully that gives you some sense of the steps and the timing associated with
CAPiTA.
With regard to the outcomes, there are multiple endpoints including vaccine type non-bacteremic type pneumonia,
vaccine type all cause pneumonia or vaccine type pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease. So there are a
number of different scenarios that could play out depending upon the outcomes. Obviously, we're targeting the most
favorable outcome which would be demonstration of positive effect on prevention of vaccine type non-bacteremic
pneumonia.

Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes. A couple things. First, could you help us quantify the impact of these government
purchases of Prevnar and Enbrel and the lumpiness there and how that's going to impact the next quarter?
Second, in China, it looks like the growth continues very strongly there. Why are you not having the problems that
some of the other players are having there? Can you just talk about the dynamics or maybe it is impacting you and the
growth would've been even better?
And then, Geno, maybe if you could just talk about some of the dynamics of the new oncology drugs that have
launched and what's happening there and how those ramps are going? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: So thank you, Marc. If I understood the question, you would like to understand some of the
seasonality or lumpiness in government purchases of Enbrel and Prevnar. So perhaps if John can talk about that in the
emerging markets and then deal with China. And then, Geno, if you'll talk to Prevnar and the...
<A - Geno J. Germano>: The oncology products...
<A - Ian C. Read>: ...and the oncology products...
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Inlyta, Xalkori.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. All right.
<A - John D. Young>: Thanks, Marc. So clearly there is some volatility. I think you've heard that the emerging
markets, while they clearly represent overall significant continued opportunities for growth, but we do see quarter on
quarter volatility, as you know. And particularly that is the case in the area of government tenders. So without going
into all the details but to give you a sense of some of the moving pieces with Prevnar NIP shipments in Turkey this
year, for example, we certainly have seen a fall in sales in Turkey this year. We had an NIP sale last year. We haven't
seen those year-to-date.
In Brazil, we've seen decreased institutional purchases for Enbrel and also for Prevnar in the AFME or Africa Middle
East region. Enbrel Brazil shows around about a 2% decline this quarter and a 12% decline year to date, just to give
you a sense of the rhythm of the business in Brazil. And I think overall, obviously, the emerging markets represent a
tapestry of markets around the world. But I think the high level of the message is we, as we have always seen, will see
some quarter-on-quarter volatility particularly in the area of institutional purchases. But overall the performance, the

underlying performance of the business in the emerging markets for both Enbrel and Prevnar 13 remains very positive,
but we have seen in those markets, I'm calling out Brazil and Turkey particularly, some volatility over the third quarter.
In China, we continue to operate as we've always operated. We're, globally we operate with a heightened sense in the
strict sense of compliance obligations. I don't believe our business in China has been particularly affected by anything
other than just the macroeconomic situations that are occurring across the emerging markets. The growth rate has
slowed up somewhat in China compared to the previous year, but continues to be robust. And we continue to expect
our Chinese business to perform well.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yeah, just, Marc, a couple of comments on Inlyta and Xalkori, which we're really pleased
with the progress that's being made there. For the quarter, for Inlyta, we did $83 million, which is about 200% above
what we did last year same quarter and double-digit increase over our prior quarter. About half of that's in the U.S.,
where we grew by about 50% relative to last year. So we're seeing nice, continued, fairly robust uptake of Inlyta.
Physicians are really pleased with this product. Patients are responding well. We have about a 30% share of second line
in the U.S. and about a 35% share of second line in Japan.
So we're doing well. We think in many cases the future growth has come from expansion of use beyond academic
medical centers and with oncologists who are very familiar with the drug. And we think there's good opportunity for
further growth there.
Xalkori also is becoming a great product, $73 million for the quarter, up about 25% from last year and about 10% from
the previous quarter. The trick there, it's the same story. We need to get the diagnostic in full use. We're at about 66%
in the U.S. and a little bit less in Europe and Japan. So we'll continue to work on that and continue to identify the
appropriate patients and grow that business.

Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink Swann.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Seamus, we can't hear you.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Sorry. Can you hear me?
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Yes. We can hear you fine.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Okay, great. So just first off on the potential moves between now and 2017 how should
we be thinking about the prospects? I know that there is a group at Pfizer that's, I believe, constantly looking at
opportunities to do incremental separations. Do you see that as a possibility? Is that something that Pfizer is
consistently looking at between now and 2016? And do you see opportunities for value creation there? I guess that's
more a question for Ian.
And then separately, on tanezumab, can you just update us again on where we stand with the anti-NGFs scientifically
the move forward in osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain and cancer pain? And again how we should think about the
potential changes in the development path as you partner with Eli Lilly? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Seamus. So we've set up the organizational construct because we believe it is the best
way to focus and maximize the different parts of our business with, as each segment represents, in my opinion,
different models. It also gives us a lot of optionality going forward as we look at ways of creating shareholder value.
So, going back to your question, we're always looking at ways of maximizing shareholder value, and I think this
construct gives us the maximum optionality and ability to look at different ways of creating that value. And we'll take
those decisions at the appropriate time as the opportunities mature.
So with that, I'll ask John to talk about tanezumab.

<A - John D. Young>: Okay. Thanks, Seamus. So, just to give you an update. I think, as you know, in December of
2012, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the development of NGF inhibitors including tanezumab and that partial
clinical hold was unrelated to the prior hold that related to bone and joint related safety. And that was based – the latest
clinical hold was based on peripheral nervous system effects observed in animal studies conducted with NGF inhibitors
by other manufacturers.
In April of this year we reached an agreement with the FDA on the path for removal of that partial clinical hold and to
answer the questions which led to the partial clinical hold, dosing was initiated to demonstrate sympathetic nervous
system safety in the requisite non-clinical study in July of this year and that study's progressing on schedule.
So we intend to submit the results from that study in the first half of 2014 and assuming a positive review of the
non-clinical data by the FDA and removal of the clinical hold, we are preparing to resume the Phase 3 studies for
tanezumab early in 2014. So we're very excited about the deal that we've announced today with Eli Lilly and we
believe that represents a very positive opportunity for us to collaborate to take tanezumab into Phase 3 clinical
development and ultimately we believe into the marketplace, which clearly has significant need and opportunity for
new pain treatment options. And so we're very excited about the potential for tanezumab assuming that we are able to
deliver positive data from that – those non-clinical studies. I hope that helps, Seamus.

Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions. First question for Frank, when you take a look at the alliance
revenue – at least consensus estimates for alliance revenue for 2014, 2015 I think they're around $1.7 billion, $1.8
billion, are you comfortable with those numbers being where they're at in light of the expiration of the majority of your
agreements? And then when you look at the consensus revenue estimate of $50.5 billion for 2014, can you just maybe
walk us through some of the pushes, pulls or influencers on losses of exclusivity that influence that number and are you
comfortable with it?
Secondly, on the Mylan Pfizer agreement that you have in Japan, can you help us understand some of the accounting
around that and also the level of penetration that you've got into the generic market in Japan? A very attractive
opportunity there, especially in light of what the Japanese government's trying to push there.
And then lastly, just a pipeline question on the SGLT2. Can you help us understand what the points of differentiation
are, especially in light of there being three other entrants potentially in that market before you enter and then any
thoughts around a combination strategy that you might have with JANUVIA? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, John. So, Frank, do you want to...
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Yeah.
<A - Ian C. Read>: ...address some of the projections he requested?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So I think the way I'll do this for 2014 in total is maybe some of the headwinds and then
some of the tailwinds. So in terms of headwinds, and no surprises, we continue to have some losses of exclusivity that
will affect us in 2014. Enbrel entering the 36 month sunset period is one of them. Spiriva in Japan is another. So there'll
be some LOEs that will experience that will impact 2014. We've said previously $3 billion to $4 billion in LOE impacts
for the next couple years. That's clearly what we're expecting for 2014.
If you look at some of the tailwinds, we continue to expect growth in emerging markets, some of our new products.
We've had some nice growth in Xalkori, Inlyta, Xeljanz. We expect to see new product growth continue in a steady and
measured way and we've had some nice performance in some of our in-line products: Lyrica this quarter, Celebrex this

quarter – 11%, 13% globally.
So lots of opportunities there and in terms of addressing headwinds in addition to the opportunity areas on the top line
we'll continue to manage our [indiscernible] (54:58) structure, we'll continue to use our balance sheet and our capital
structure to help us manage the LOE and revenue headwinds like we've been doing over the last couple of years.
In terms of alliance revenue, let me just run the numbers and then I'll answer the question. If you look at the alliance
revenues this quarter, $700 million, down from $900 million in the year ago quarter, down 22%. Year-to-date down
15%, $2.6 billion to $2.2 billion. The majority of the alliance revenues to date are really from Enbrel and Spiriva. And
going forward the alliance revenues are going to come from Rebif, which is in the numbers today, and then obviously
Eliquis growing. So that'll be the rhythm of the numbers relative to the alliance revenues. But clearly on a going
forward basis the alliance revenues will be declining and they'll be declining significantly.
In terms of Mylan accounting, I think the simple answer is we record the revenues from the products that are coming
out of the collaboration.
<A - Ian C. Read>: John, do you want to make any comment on the penetration in the market or is it too early?
<A - John D. Young>: Yeah, I think it's really too early, John, to talk about penetration and market share specifically,
other than to say we're on track. We have seen, we've met all of our milestones in terms of the transfer of Mylan
colleagues into the Pfizer organization. We are currently selling around about 250 products from the combined
companies' generic portfolios in the marketplace, and the project plan is in place to transition all Mylan inventory to
Pfizer distribution, which is a real strength of our organization in Japan and processes and work in place to address any
quality supply risks.
In terms of manufacturing and development, initiatives have kicked off to build manufacturing capacity for
collaboration volumes, and I think the overall message in Mylan is the joint venture is certainly progressing very much
according to our plans.
In terms of ertugliflozin, we, as you know, entered into a worldwide collaboration, except Japan, with Merck to
develop and commercialize ertugliflozin and ertugliflozin containing fixed dose combinations with metformin and
JANUVIA tablets. It's our innovative proprietary SGLT2 inhibitor for treatment of type two diabetes, and we are
initiating Phase 3 clinical trials with our partner, Merck.
I certainly don't want to comment in detail about competitors in this class other than to say that our two lead
competitors have had probably a troubled regulatory pathway in the U.S. and Europe, and we believe that the dialogue
that we've been able to have with the FDA, as well as the strength of the molecule, certainly has enabled us to put
together a development program combined with the strength of our partnership with Merck that gives us a very good
runway into the marketplace.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, John. Mikael, do you want to comment on the technical aspects of our products and
differentiation?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yeah, let me build on the excellent discussion that John has on ertugliflozin. So it's a highly
selective molecule for the SGLT2 transporter and that you will learn when you explore that class there is difference in
the selectivity among the molecules. It's highly potent. It's a very low dose, which is really a key characteristic when
you aim to combine with other drugs such as a market leading JANUVIA and metformin. It performed very well in the
Phase 2 studies with robust lowering of HbA1c and also stable effect on blood pressure. So we think, really, these
unique characteristics of a best in class molecule combined with the long experience with JANUVIA allows for a very
favorable long term opportunity here.

<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. Two, if I may. Ian, I wanted to get your
latest thoughts about entering the cancer immunotherapy market, perhaps partnering palbociclib in breast cancer with
one of the leading PD-1s. Seems like that could be a pretty promising combination.
And the follow up, we recently heard some negative comments from your peers about entering the biosimilar market,
including commercial risk. So I'm just wondering what is it that's made you confident to proceed with a fairly
aggressive biosimilar strategy? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: So on the biosimilar market, each company takes its own view of the commercial opportunities.
We feel that we have the technology and the ability to bring biosimilars to the market that will be very
well-characterized. We believe that in that marketplace, we don't see it reacting like the small molecule generic market.
We believe it'll probably act more like the sterile injectable market. We bring to that commercialization the credibility
and the quality of Pfizer's manufacturing and research, and we think it is a reasonably low cost development
opportunity for products that have a high commercial opportunity. So we think it's a good, appropriate allocation of
resources for the potential payoff.
Geno, would you like to talk about the immunotherapy? And if you want, pass it off to Mikael as well between the two
of you.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Okay. So I mean, Alex, obviously it's a really pretty active, exciting time with all this
happening with the checkpoint modulators and using monotherapy in various combinations across many different
tumor types. We see this as an emerging field with a lot of experimentation going on to identify appropriate patients
and appropriate combinations and we're actively exploring a number of mechanisms ourselves internally with our
4-1BB monoclonal antibody and some of the vaccine approaches that we have access to as well as looking at potential
partnerships.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Mikael, do you want to?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yeah, I think Geno described it very well. We have, of course, invested heavily in our signal
transduction inhibitors and, as you mentioned, palbociclib is one of the real example of potential breakthrough drugs
here. But the ability to combine small molecule, large molecule with cancer immunotherapy and it's going to have a
very interesting potential. And we have, as Geno alluded to, a number of internal activities but are also open for
partnership, which in general we have shown is a great way to grow value in this industry.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Mikael. Moving on to the next question, please?

Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.
<Q - Tony Butler>: Thanks very much. Ian back to biosimilars. You alluded to the notion that there would be some
incremental R&D costs. Could you provide some color around that please?
And then secondly, if I may, one pipeline question on mening B. The 20,000 patient study, could you provide some
timing for total enrollment and when that might read out and moreover, Mikael, do you need high titers to both proteins
in order to provide appropriate killing of the bacteria? Thanks very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Tony, I wasn't quite sure of your question on the biosimilars. The incremental R&D expenditure
isn't, per se, because of biosimilars. It's because of what I think I described as a very, very strong cohort of Phase 3

products coming in development in the near future and one that we are also, where appropriate, partnering to ensure
that we maximize shareholder return.
So, Mikael, do you want to talk about the titer issue and...
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yeah, so thank you for your interest in mening B and we do think it's a very important vaccine.
It's the missing component in staph area of meningococcal strains to mening B. So we have three trials that are well
underway: efficacy, safety, and load consistency trials and we believe that you should aspire to raise the relevant titers
to both proteins. Together these two proteins that were carefully selected during our development process, they will
cover the great majority of meningococcal strain which is a unique feature of our vaccine. And we noticed in our Phase
2 trial, robust titers and good tolerability. As you know we are focusing on adolescent population which is the main
carrier of the disease.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. And, Tony, just to expand the biosimilar spend is – we have been spending and it's in
our baseline spend of our development programs. So I didn't particularly see that as a driver of R&D spend.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: And, Geno, just on the timing of enrollment or anything, do we have comments there for
mening B?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: We are enrolling now and I think we anticipate completing enrollment in the 2015
timeframe.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thank you. Our next question, please.

Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.
<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: Morning. A couple questions, please. First, Ian and Frank, back to portfolio management,
could you give us some guide to the total cost and the phasing of those costs for the operational separation of the
established products business just in helping us understand how optionality pans out?
And then second for Mikael. Could you give us an update on the Phase 1 anti-4-1BB CD137 trial? It's been running for
two and a half years in a very refractory patient population. What's the chances we could get data prior to 2015? Thank
you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Andrew. Frank, if you could take us through the implications of the structuring and the
costs and the timing of that et cetera? And then Mikael can answer the second question.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Yeah, so I think in terms of implementation costs, there are not material implementation
cost. In fact, as we look at the new structure, there's some opportunities for synergies to the tune of a couple of hundred
million dollars. A minimal amount in 2014 as we're basically getting the structure in place, then we see an opportunity
in 2015, 2016 to capitalize on the new structure and generate a couple of hundred million in operational synergies. So
that's how I think about the puts and the takes on that.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: For 4-1BB the mechanism seems to activate the immune cells in particular [ph] T cell
[indiscernible] (1:06:13) and you're right, we have been exploring it for quite some time to fully understands its
property. And we have studies ongoing, dose escalation studies both as monotherapy and in combination with
rituximab in hematological patients. We're also looking at combination of 4-1BB with other immunotherapies as part of
our plans and we will share data as this protocol wraps up at relevant conferences.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please?

Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. A couple of follow-ups. With respect to the headwinds from the wind-down in the
Enbrel North America and Spiriva collaborations, would an estimate of a billion-dollar reduction in net income for
these collaborations be a reasonable guess for all of 2014? That's the first question.
Second is, how do you assess the Herceptin biosimilar opportunity given that the standard of care in HER2 positive
breast cancer is evolving so quickly and that evolution may limit Herceptin's role over time. Meanwhile, Roche says it
will compete aggressively and there may be other biosimilar competitors as well? So is a shrinking market with
unknown number of competitors attractive?
And then lastly on the staph vaccine you said data in 2014. On the second quarter call you had said data later this year,
so any reason for that slight delay? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Frank, if you could comment on the alliance revenue and then John on Herceptin and the nature of
that marketplace and the pressures from managed care and then I think Mikael on the timing.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So on the alliance revenue, I ran the numbers before on alliance revenue. We'll provide an
update on the 2014 revenue number and the guidance for 2014 on our next earnings call. We'll incorporate into that
number obviously the impact of the alliance revenue decline on a year-over-year basis. So on the next earnings call
we'll provide the details on 2014.
<A - John D. Young>: Okay. And in terms of the question on biosimilars, almost by definition biosimilars don't lead
clinical practice, they follow it. And so clearly today we know that overall the biosimilars marketplace – the
biotherapeutics marketplace is around about a $100 billion marketplace globally for all biotherapeutics and that
marketplace is expected to grow to around $300 billion by 2019. So I guess so the first point to make in terms of our
presence in the biosimilar marketplaces is biotherapeutics overall is a very significant opportunity. And the biosimilars
segment of that is expected to grow from its current value around about $1.4 billion to potentially around about $22
billion by 2020. So the key point to make there is it is a big opportunity.
In terms of Herceptin, clearly I don't want to comment on our competitors and any additional therapeutic research that
they are doing other than to say that today Herceptin remains a standard of care for that particular patient population.
And so at the point that we have a biosimilar available to enter into the marketplace, then we believe that that would be
a potentially good option for physicians and healthcare systems to use in patients for whom Herceptin or that molecule,
trastuzumab, is an appropriate clinical choice.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. Mikael, on timing?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yeah, so we have completed successfully a Phase 1/2 trial and our Herceptin is a very good
biosimilar version of the originator and we are now in the plans of starting a Phase 3 that will be initiating dosing
within the next couple of months. And just to add to what John said, clearly as you discussed there, will be always an
evolving marketplace in many of these indications which are driven by a continuous flow of product. We do see still
that many of these new regimens include a combination with Herceptin, biologicals on top of Herceptin instead of
traditional chemotherapeutics. And we anticipate that our molecule could offer a quality alternative.
<A - Ian C. Read>: And on the staph aureus, I haven't looked at the transcript. Perhaps we misspoke. I think perhaps
we said we had data or had internal data on staph aureus in that time period that we intend to take it to a congress next
year. So probably that was a confusion we created, and if we did, we apologize for that.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: I think that's right, Ian. It was a presentation of the data. Next question, please.

<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes. Thanks very much. I just have two questions. First, with respect to the CAPiTA
outcomes trial, could you just talk about the reason for the delay in the results? Just sort of recap why it's been delayed
so long? I'm guessing you're going to say it's simply event accrual, but is there any way to read anything positive or
negative into the delays relative to the expected timing when CAPiTA was started many, many years ago?
And then separately, with respect to biosimilar Herceptin, do you have agreement with the FDA on how that trial will
be run in the U.S.? And also, when do you plan to file biosimilar Herceptin in the U.S. and ex-U.S.? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Geno, would you like to talk about CAPiTA?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yeah, I think on CAPiTA, David, you're right. I probably will say that it's event driven, and
when we have the sum of events, we have the number of events. But just to comment on a couple of factors. The
incidence of infection often coincides with the severity of flu season, for example, so if flu seasons have been milder,
then you may not have as many events, and that could be a factor contributing to accumulation of events.
And then there's overall efficacy or effectiveness of the vaccine. Obviously, if the vaccine is extraordinarily effective,
then the only events that you're going to accumulate are the ones in the placebo group. You won't accumulate any or
very few in the vaccine group. That would be a good problem to have, and we'll know soon what the real answer is.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Geno. John, could you talk about Herceptin?
<A - John D. Young>: Yeah, so I don't want to talk in detail about filing timelines, but in terms of your question about
the regulatory pathway, certainly the E.U. and the U.S. have increasingly provided more guidance on the pathways for
regulatory approval, which include extensive analytical and pre-clinical data, robust comparative clinical and
immunogenicity data as well. And that guidance is consistent with our development strategy for our portfolio of
biosimilars including trastuzumab. So we anticipate a Phase 3 start for that program by the end of the year, and we'll be
progressing that program in line with that guidance as expeditiously as possible.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, John.
Charles E. Triano
Thanks, John. And I think with that, we will complete our call. Thank you very much, everyone, for your attention this
morning.
