Quarterly Corporate Performance Fourth Quarter 2014 which is located in the Investor Presentation section in the lower
right-hand corner of this page.
Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements and
that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could
cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2013 annual report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms
10-Q and 8-K.
Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today, January 27,
2015.
We'll now make prepared remarks and then we will move to the question-and-answer session.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?
Ian C. Read
Think you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone.
We finished 2014 with another quarter of good performance and met or exceeded every element of our financial
guidance for the year. Frank will take you through the numbers, but before he does, I want to reemphasize how our four
key imperatives have guided the actions we have taken and the decisions we have made and will continue to guide us
going forward. These imperatives are about the steps we are taking to create a sustainable high value pipeline,
secondly, in a disciplined way, deploy our capital in ways to create shareholder value, create a culture where colleagues
take appropriate risks and accept accountability for their actions and earn the respect of society. My remarks today will
primarily focus on two of these imperatives, the evolution of our pipeline and how we are creating shareholder value.
When we started this journey at the start of 2011, we said improving the performance of our innovative core would be a
multi-year endeavor. Over this time, we have significantly changed the composition of our pipeline to have a clearer
focus on the therapeutic areas that have strong commercial and scientific potential. We have improved productivity in
the pipeline. Since undertaking this effort, we have received 16 approvals as of the end of last year, ten of which were
new molecular entities.
Today we have a total of 86 programs in clinical development with 29 programs in late stage development or
registration. We continue to grow in key areas, most notably in some of our recently launched new products.
Eliquis is winning share amongst cardiologists and moving towards the leading position in the new to brand share in
several markets including the U.S. and Japan. We grew our Xeljanz market share so that it now ranks number three in
new to brand prescription share with rheumatologists and we're seeing good uptake of our Prevnar 13 adult vaccine
following the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation.
This is good progress and over the course of the next four years we expect to have more than 20 Phase II and III
registration starts and hope to have more than 15 potential approvals, many of them new molecular entities. These
numbers do not include study starts and approvals as a result of our Merck KGaA partnership in immuno-oncology.
Many of the new molecular entities have the potential to be first in class assets that give us growth platforms. These
include the CDK 4/6 platform in oncology with Ibrance or generic name, palbociclib, and its potential for indications
being studied in the broad spectrum of breast cancer as well as lung, prostate, head and neck, melanoma, ovarian, renal
and brain tumors in young children. We expect to have a competitive immuno-oncology program. We believe we have
a comprehensive program with all the elements to be an industry leader.

Through our partnership with Merck KGaA and their anti-PD-L1, avelumab, we are able to accelerate our participation
in the immuno-oncology space, enabling both companies to participate in the first wave of potential single agent
monotherapy treatment regimens of several tumor types, some of which we expect to be first or second to market.
Additionally, through this partnership we are positioned to be a potential leader in the next wave of I-O combination
therapies. We expect to be amongst the first three companies in certain cancer indications with monotherapy and a
leader with combinations of PD-L1 avelumab with targeted agents, for example, Inlyta, Xalkori and second-generation
ALK or dual I-O combinations example, 4-1BB, OX40, ADCs, et cetera and in various cancer indications.
This year we will be collaborating on up to 20 studies with Merck KGaA with registrational intent on up to six of these
studies. In addition, through the collaboration, we expect to have five different I-O drugs in the clinic this year and up
to ten by 2016. This strategy includes checkpoint inhibitor mAbs, small molecule immuno modulators, cancer vaccines,
biofunctional antibodies, CAR T-cell based therapy and anti-body drug conjugates. Our partner expects to present data
from their PD-L1 study at ASCO in June. To the best of our knowledge it is one of the most comprehensive I-O
platforms in development in the pharma industry today.
We also have leading research on [ph] death biology (6:57) with potential new indications for Xeljanz in psoriasis and
psoriatic arthritis with our oral products, atopic dermatitis with a topical formulation, new GI indications in ulcerative
colitis and Crohn's disease and ankylosing spondylitis.
We have what we believe is a differentiated approach within the PCSK9 area for hyperlipidemia. Our lead asset,
bococizumab, has a differentiated clinical trial design which includes high risk patients and also assesses primary
prevention for patients. In addition to this large molecule approach we have both a small molecule and a vaccine in
development nearing first in human. We've made progress with tanezumab and plan to submit pre-clinical data to the
FDA this quarter and a complete response to potentially lift the clinical hold on that program.
In the rare disease area we're seeing good progress with enrollment in cardiomyopathy Phase III programs for tafamidis
and are advancing towards Phase III for rivipansel, pending our discussion with the FDA on the final optimization of
the formulation.
We have just announced a collaboration with OPKO for a long-acting growth hormone product that we believe could
also be first in class and further expand that market. We have a broad biosimilars portfolio of complex monoclonals,
with a current pipeline of five assets. Three are ongoing or enrolling Phase III trials and include potential biosimilars to
Herceptin, Rituxan, and Remicade.
We have completed a Phase I trial for Avastin and expect to initiate our Phase III study later this year and we have an
ongoing Phase I proof of concept for Humira. We believe we can become one of the world's pre-eminent biosimilar
companies.
There are also several potential acceleration opportunities in the pipeline that include a next generation ALK ROS1
inhibitor that holds the potential to significantly extend the lives of patients who no longer respond to Xalkori. We
expect to start a pivotal study this year.
As you know, our Staph Aureus vaccine is currently in Phase II clinical trials and was granted Fast-Track designation
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February 2014. A Phase-IIb study that could be registrational is
scheduled to start around the middle of this year.
I am pleased with the progress we've made in a relatively short period of time in terms of the quality of the assets in our
pipeline and the potential for delivering breakthrough products starting in late 2017 and 2018.
Turning next to how the prudent deployment of capital has yielded significant returns to our shareholders: over the last
four years we have maintained our operating margins, and have taken approximately $5.5 billion out of our operating
expenses during a period where we lost significant revenue to LOEs and co-promote expiries from several high-margin
products like Lipitor, Enbrel in Canada and U.S. and the loss of Spiriva.

This year and for the next couple of years ongoing expense reductions will result from continuous improvement efforts.
However, given that the largest opportunities have already been realized, the amount of potential reductions is more
limited. Also, there are certain areas where we will continue to invest in, such as R&D and new product launches.
Further, we have returned just over $64 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends over the last
four years and as we have worked to transform Pfizer, business development has remained an important enabler of our
strategy. We went into a series of partnerships, in-license agreements and made some acquisitions that have bolstered
our vaccines portfolio, enhanced our established products portfolio, strengthened our oncology pipeline, expanded our
consumer portfolio and fortified the set of assets we have across our key therapeutic areas. Given the strength of our
late and mid-stage pipeline, we will evaluate business development opportunities biased towards deals with the
potential for creating value in the near-term.
Beyond business development, here's what you can expect to see from us in terms of additional actions we plan to take
in 2015 to create shareholder value. We will continue to invest in the launch of new products. We're excited about the
potential revenue and continued growth prospects, primarily for Eliquis, Xeljanz, Prevnar 13 adult, Trumenba, Inlyta,
Xalkori and Nexium 24-hour. We expect these products, along with a few others: Vyndaqel, Bosulif, Duavee and
vaccines acquired from Baxter, including Ibrance's pending approval, will generate nearly $2 billion in incremental
operational revenue growth this year compared to last.
So while we expect product launch costs will increase approximately 25% year-over-year, we're seeing good leverage
from the investments we're making in these products. In addition to new launch products, the Innovative business will
be focused on growing market share in our major in-line brands like Lyrica, Enbrel outside the U.S., Viagra within the
U.S., Chantix and the Prevnar franchise.
In our Consumer business what we're focused on growing is core brands Advil and Centrum, growing Nexium OTC
market share and continuing to pursue Rx to OTC switch opportunities.
For our Established business, we will build on our success in 2014 in providing high value, high-quality, low-cost
treatments in emerging markets. We expect to see operational revenue growth of mid to high single digits in the
emerging markets this year by focusing on opportunities in key growth markets such as China, Brazil, India, Russia,
and Turkey.
In 2015, we will continue our efforts to finish the ground work required to be in a position to operationalize a potential
split of the company and we have made good progress on this work. For 2015, we anticipate the effort that will be
required for this work will result in approximately $400 million in one-time costs on a pre-tax basis.
Let me remind you, at this point in time we have not yet made a decision to split the company. We have said the final
decision will depend upon how our businesses perform in their markets, having a high degree of confidence that the
businesses will be successful as stand-alone entities and how our shareholders value these businesses, if the sum of the
parts is greater than the whole.
And in 2015, we will again be in a position to reduce our adjusted effective tax rate. We expect it will decrease from
26.5% in 2014 to approximately 25% this year. We will continue to manage our tax line as we do any other expense
line and look to be as efficient as possible. I would note that foreign exchange is one of those items that can either work
for us or against us. Most importantly, it is not indicative of how the business is performing in a fundamental manner.
As always, all of our decisions will be rooted in how best to strike the right balance in terms of capital deployment,
dividends, buybacks and business development. One of the reasons I'm confident that we can accomplish all of this is
because we have an employee body that is motivated and engaged in the successful execution of the initiatives we have
undertaken to drive results. Over the past four years we have created a culture ingrained in a strong ownership
environment.
In summary, we will build on our performance over the past four years to create sustainable high-value pipeline, to
have market-leading strong commercial businesses, to manage our cost structure and continue to be disciplined in how
we deploy our capital. Collectively, these elements of our strategy that will allow us to generate results and continue to

create value, shareholder value and that will enable us to bring patients innovative medicines that best meet their needs.
Now, I'll turn it over to Frank for additional details on the quarter, the year and our financial guidance for 2015. Thank
you.
Frank A. D'Amelio
Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone.
As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. I'd like to remind everybody that as a result of
the full disposition of Zoetis on June 24, 2013, our financial results in the Animal Health business and the gain
associated with its full disposition are reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of income for
the 12 months ended December 31, 2013.
Fourth quarter 2014 reported revenues of approximately $13.1 billion which reflects a slight operational increase of $9
million year-over-year, was mainly driven by the strong performance of Lyrica, Prevnar, and Eliquis in developed
markets and Xeljanz which grew primarily in the U.S. and 7% operational growth in emerging markets driven by
Lipitor mainly in China as well as Prevenar and Enbrel, which were offset mainly by the unfavorable impact of foreign
exchange of approximately $449 million or 3%, the loss of exclusivity for Celebrex in the U.S., the expiration of the
co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada, the termination of the Spiriva
collaboration in certain countries and other product losses of exclusivity in certain markets.
Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.54 versus $0.56 in the year ago quarter. The decrease is primarily due to a $0.01 negative
impact due to foreign exchange, a 4% aggregate operational increase of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses
and adjusted R&D expenses driven by an unfavorable change in product mix and increased R&D expenses due to
incremental expenses for the ongoing Phase III program for bococizumab, palbociclib, ertugliflozin and certain other
new drug candidates as well as potential new indications for previously approved products, especially for Xeljanz.
Adjusted SI&A expenses, however, decreased by 2% operationally because of continued benefits from cost reduction
and productivity initiatives partially offset by investment to support several recent product launches and other in-line
brands. Adjusted diluted EPS was favorably impacted by a lower effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average
shares outstanding which declined by 159 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to ongoing share repurchases.
Reported diluted EPS was $0.19 compared with $0.39 in the year-ago quarter due to previously mentioned factors and
the unfavorable impact of the charge for the $850 million up-front payment associated with the global strategic alliance
formed with Merck KGaA in November of 2014, and an additional amount of approximately $300 million reflecting
the fair value of certain co-promotional rights for Xalkori granted to Merck KGaA, higher charges related to certain
legal matters as well as the higher effective tax rate, all of which were partially offset by lower restructuring charges
and purchase accounting adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2014, versus the prior-year quarter.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted revenues by $453 million or 3% and positively impacted
adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $351 million or 4%.
As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01
compared with the year-ago quarter.
Now moving on to the financial highlights of our business segments, in the fourth quarter Global Innovative
Pharmaceutical revenues increased 6% operationally year-over-year due to the strong operational growth from Lyrica
primarily in the U.S. and Japan, and the performance from recently launched products including Eliquis globally and
Xeljanz primarily in the U.S., all of which were somewhat offset by the previously mentioned expiration of the
co-promotion term for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada. Income before taxes declined 5% operationally due to a 5%
operational increase in cost of sales, a 25% operational increase in SI&A expenses due to increased investment in new
products such as Eliquis and Xeljanz and certain in-line brands, and a 25% operational increase in R&D expenses due
to incremental investment in late-stage pipeline products, namely bococizumab, ertugliflozin and additional Xeljanz
indications.

Fourth quarter VOC revenues increased 14% operationally, due primarily to strong performance of Prevnar 13 Adult in
the U.S. and XALKORI globally, Inlyta in most markets and Sutent in emerging markets, as well as Nexium 24-Hour
in the U.S. Income before taxes increased 13% operationally, mainly due to increased revenues, which were partially
offset by a 12% operational increase in cost of sales driven by increased sales volumes. As a percentage of revenue,
cost of sales decreased by 30 basis points due to a favorable change in product mix.
A 13% operational increase in SI&A expenses due to investment in Prevnar Adult as well as launch and pre-launch
expenses for Trumenba and Ibrance, and a 17% operational increase in R&D expenses, due to increased investment in
the Ibrance and Trumenba development programs and the global alliance with Merck KGaA.
In the fourth quarter, Global Established Pharmaceutical revenues decreased 7% operationally year-over-year due to a
loss of exclusivity of Celebrex in the U.S., Detrol LA in U.S. and Aricept in Canada, as well as the termination of the
co-promotion agreements of Spiriva in most countries including the U.S. All of these were partially offset by 7%
operational growth in emerging markets and strong performance of Lyrica in Europe. Income before taxes declined
operationally 9% due to the decrease in revenues, a 5% operational increase or a 2.3% increase as a percentage of
revenues in cost of sales, due to LOEs and unfavorable changes in product mix, and a 5% operational increase in R&D
expenses, primarily due to our biosimilars development program, partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses, all of
which were partially offset by a 17% operational decrease in SI&A expenses driven by cost reduction and productivity
initiatives.
As you can see, in 2014 we met or exceeded all components of our annual financial guidance.
Now I'd like to walk you through the 2015 guidance ranges for reported revenues, reported diluted EPS, and adjusted
diluted EPS relative to our 2014 actual results. First, it's important to note that the 2015 reported revenues incorporate
an anticipated $3.5 billion negative impact due to continuing product losses of exclusivity, and declining alliance
revenues, which will be partially offset by expected operational growth of certain other products.
In addition, we expect foreign exchange to have an additional $2.8 billion negative impact on reported revenues.
Consequently, we expect 2015 reported revenues to be in the range of $44.5 billion to $46.5 billion. Before moving on,
I want to point out that the actual mid-January 2015 rates used to determine our 2015 guidance do not include the
impact of a potential devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar or any other currency.
The fully diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS also includes the negative impact from product losses of exclusivity, a
$0.17 negative impact from foreign exchange rates and a negative $0.03 impact from the pending transaction with
OPKO. As a result, we expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.37 to $1.52 and adjusted diluted EPS to be
in the range of $2.00 to $2.10.
In addition, I want to remind everyone that guidance ranges for both reported and adjusted diluted EPS incorporate $6
billion of anticipated share repurchases in 2015 including $715 million of our shares repurchased to date. These
repurchases will more than offset the potential dilution related to employee compensation programs.
In summary, if you exclude the anticipated FX impacts and the impact of the pending OPKO transaction, our fiscal
year 2015 adjusted diluted EPS guidance midpoint is in line with full year 2014 actual results despite the $3.5 billion
negative impact from expected product LOEs and declining alliance revenues.
Now I'll review the remaining elements of our 2015 financial guidance. We expect cost of sales as a percentage of
revenue to be in the range of 18.5% to 19.5%. We expect adjusted SI&A expenses to be in the range of $12.8 billion to
$13.8 billion. We expect adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $6.9 billion to $7.4 billion which includes a
planned upfront payment of $295 million to OPKO expected in the first quarter of 2015 upon completion of the
transaction announced of December 2014. We also expect adjusted other income to be approximately $500 million and
we expect our tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 25%.
Moving on to key takeaways, we achieved or exceeded all elements of our full year 2014 financial guidance in an
environment that continues to be challenging. We advanced our strategy through pipeline advancement and business

development. The FDA approved Trumenba, our meningitis B vaccine and we announced that we are in labeling
discussions with the FDA for Ibrance and we entered into a collaboration with Merck KGaA which positions us well to
potentially compete in the first wave of immuno-oncology therapies and be a leader in second wave with combination
therapies.
Our full year 2015 reported revenue guidance range includes the anticipated negative impact of $3.5 billion due to
product losses of exclusivity and $2.8 billion due to adverse changes in foreign exchange, partially offset by nearly $2
billion of anticipated operational revenue growth in certain products. And the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range
includes a $0.17 negative impact from foreign exchange and a $0.03 negative impact from the planned upfront payment
to OPKO.
We continue to create shareholders value through prudent capital allocation. Overall in 2014, we returned nearly $12
billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. From 2011 through 2014 we returned more than $64
billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, in 2015 we anticipate returning
approximately $13 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to
delivering attractive shareholders returns in 2015 and beyond.
Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.
Charles Triano
Thank you, Frank, and, operator, can we please poll for questions? Thanks.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you very much. Ian, just a question for you sort of high-level. Based on all the press reports
that we're all reading every day, it sounds like you're intensely focused on landing a large target and these articles are
all saying most companies are rebuffing you. I think this is a great opportunity for you to sort of remind us, what are
your strategic objectives? Do you have to make a large transaction? And if so, is it – I mean it would seem to me that
it's the GEP business that would need the biggest growth drivers, or is it the other areas of the business? If you could
just sort of prioritize for us which of the areas of the business make most sense for you for a large transaction, if indeed
that's what you believe you need?
And then just a second question maybe. This is for Frank. On the GEP business, is it permissible for you guys to buy a
foreign company and use it as a new address when you potentially go to spin out, if you decide to do so, your GEP
business? Is that actually an option? Thanks very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Jami, for the question. Rumors are rumors. We don't comment on rumors or
speculation or what they write in the press.
I would go back to my comment that BD is an enabler of strategies. Our strategy is to deploy our capital in a way that is
shareholder-friendly. We've been doing that through dividends and buybacks and we have been doing BD. I would look
at BD as a potential to accelerate always to accelerate incremental value to shareholders. That's the purpose of
deploying that capital, strengthening our businesses and we look at all opportunities to do that, but we do that in a
disciplined manner.
We did not push beyond what we thought was reasonable to do the AZ deal. I don't feel that we need to do a large deal.
I do believe though, that we can deploy capital in a way that it can improve return to shareholders.

<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: And then, Jami, on the second question when you were specific to the GEP business and I
think the question was buying a foreign company and potentially changing the address. Now, my answer is it's kind of
one of those things that's almost impossible to speculate upon. It's very situational. It depends on lots of things:
valuations, markets and the like, and tax reform is an ongoing area where I think that is still subject to change, so I
don't want to speculate on what may or may not happen as a result of some hypothetical acquisition.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Frank. Operator, can we move to the next question, please?

Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Thomas Schott>: Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions here, first for Ian. I believe
you mentioned that your business development is now focused on creating value in the near-term given the late stage
pipeline. I guess firstly, is there a shift from prior focus on what you were thinking about in 2014?
And then, the second question on business development, when you look at valuations resetting kind of across the
biopharma space, is that reducing the opportunity set as you look at these targets, given the valuation discipline you've
highlighted for Pfizer?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Well, I think if we seem a little bit concerned about the state of our research and if we hadn't
strengthened our research, which we did with the deal with Merck on the immuno-oncology asset, then we may have
felt we needed to do more business development and acquiring assets in our research but I feel our research pipeline,
middle-stage, late-stage is strong and I would rather take our capital right now and direct it to opportunities to
accelerate EPS growth as I think we've got the right balance of capital allocation in the medium to long-term and on the
Innovative side.
So it's just really a balance of where you're deploying your capital and where you think you have areas you want to
strengthen. That being said, if there was a piece of intellectual property that added huge value and we thought we could
develop it, we would not be shy in acquiring that intellectual property.
I do think that the values are high in the moment in many sectors and we are disciplined, but when we find an
appropriate deal that will meet our strategies of strengthening our businesses and accelerating shareholder value, we
feel very comfortable that we have the ability to do those deals.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Ian. Operator, next question, please.

Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Thank you very much for taking the question. First, congrats to Frank – great P&L
management this quarter and also for the guidance. If I may ask some R&D questions, on the PCSK9 program, could
you just update us, if you would be willing to do so, on the timelines and the enrollment status for the outcomes trials
on the PCSK9 program?
Number two, I was intrigued by your comments during the prepared remarks looking in on immuno-oncology where
you, I think you mentioned that you thought you'd be among the first three companies to launch in several or a few
tumor types. I'm wondering if you'd be willing to tell us what tumor types you think that could be?
And then finally on palbo, and I suppose this is more of a commercial question, but just as we all contemplate a
near-term launch as a clear possibility, can you help us frame the initial market opportunity? Do you expect this to be a
very rapid cancer launch or something that's a little bit more tempered since these women have a standard of care
today? Thank you.

<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Mark. Good questions. Perhaps Geno can address the PCSK9 status and then I'd ask
and then we'll then move to answer your questions on palbo and which products we think we could be first or second in
from Albert. Geno?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Sure. Thanks, Mark. Regarding the PCSK9 program, our outcomes trials, we're in the
process of ramping up site initiation, enrollment. This is something we monitor, frankly, on a daily and weekly basis so
we're making good progress there. We expect to be competitive with the other programs from Amgen and Sanofi in
terms of timing for a completion of those outcomes trials, which we currently see occurring in the late 2017, early 2018
timeframe.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Geno. Albert?
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes. On the question on the initial Ibrance launch update, we are very excited about this initial
launch for two main reasons. First, we have not seen an approval of a new therapy in first line advanced cancer in more
than ten years, so there is a great unmet need. And secondly, Ibrance has demonstrated not only a statistical significant
improvement but more importantly a clinically meaningful benefit to patients. It was double PFS and added 10 months
to standard of care. As a result, we expect the uptake to be robust.
Having said that, as with all launches, there will be some oncologists that will be early adopters while others will wait
for additional data or more experience in the field but for this group we already have four Phase II trials ongoing, two
of which are expected to complete this year.
When you say that we are working to build a broad franchise around breast cancer, we are starting with first line
metastatic breast cancer but when you are moving fast to recurrent breast cancer and then to every breast cancer and I'd
like to remind everyone that we are currently running Phase III pivotal registration enabling studies for all of these
indications.
Now, to your question on immuno-oncology, as Ian said, this deal is transformational for our immuno-oncology
program for two reasons and the first is that it will enable us to quickly move into the first wave of potential
monotherapy treatments.
You asked for some examples of that. Examples could be ovarian or gastric, for example, and this is where we are
going to seek to put our emphasis rather than on indications that are more crowded as melanoma, for example. But
don't forget the second also benefit, which is it enables us to accelerate our combinations program by more than two
and half years. This acceleration in conjunction with our broad range of combination [indiscernible] (35:00): Xalkori,
Inlyta, Ibrance, ALK ROS inhibitor, OX40, 4-1BB, will enable us to be the leading player in the second wave where
we see also a much greater [indiscernible] (35:13).

Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. Good morning. A couple of unrelated question. First, Ian, to slice the M&A question a
different way, it's clear you have a sense of urgency to find deals that could be – if they're shareholder enhancing.
Would you care to comment on the sense of urgency to supplement the Innovative versus the Established Products?
You've made it clear that you'd rather have near-term sort of accretion or value accretion versus long-term but I want to
make sure we understand that you're still committed to both or is one taking precedent?
Secondly, can you comment on Lyrica CR, obviously a large product that gets almost no focus? Are you planning to
attempt a filing there to protect at least some of that franchise longer-term?

And lastly, Albert, can you comment on the Prevnar adult versus pediatric and progress there and maybe share some
color around the split between those two important buckets? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. Geno, do you want to talk about Lyrica first and then Albert can talk about the vaccine and
I'll come back on our BD preferences or priorities?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yes. So, Gregg, on the Lyrica program we continue to advance the CR program for Lyrica.
We have completed several trials, and seen positive outcomes. So we're continuing to move towards a registration and
we expect to see registration potentially ahead of the expiration of the exclusivity in the United States.
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes. And, Gregg, on the adult, although early, we are very pleased with the launch and we
believe it is potentially a very large and durable opportunity given current demographics and the aging trends. The
adult sales in the U.S. were around $250 million which was driven by higher penetration during the high flu season and
also some inventory stocking with new customers. Our markets share jumped almost four times to 45% from 12%
originally.
Growth moving forward, we still expect to be strong throughout the year. Of course, keep in mind that this quarter was
influenced by seasonality and some inventory build, and that can vary quarter by quarter.
On the pediatric, which you asked, pediatric, in fact, was down this quarter due to the timing of the CDC purchase,
which last year occurred in fourth quarter and this year in third.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. On the urgency to do business development, let me stress, the urgency I have is to
create shareholder value. And if business development can do that, then we will move on business development with
urgency.
I don't really have a preference between strengthening either of the businesses. I think we can use business
development to improve and strengthen both of them, and we will look at deals and if the deals make sense, we will
work then to execute them. Thanks for the question.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thank you. Operator, next question, please.

The next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein.
<Q - Timothy Minton Anderson>: Good. Hi. I'm sorry, it's the same line of questioning. But on inversion, so is that,
in your view, pretty much off the table at this point for Pfizer?
Is that still something that you think you can pursue? And then also on inversion, any visibility on when or whether
Treasury might come out with a second round of regulations?
And then on the pipeline, apart from palbo, if you had to pick two compounds that excite you the most, what would
those be?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. So on the inversion, Tim, inversions have not been stopped. What the potential rules of the
government have done is delayed the value, or potentially delayed the value realization of the inversion. So inversions,
I think, are being tempered by the ability to pay the target's price, given the slower realization of the inversion values.
I think it's an area that will remain fertile while there's no change in the U.S. tax laws. I think it's – we're in a very
uncompetitive situation with our tax code, and inversions will continue to be important as an instrument of increasing
shareholder value, just depending on the price you need to pay to affect the inversion. And the exact conditions of the
inversion, which are very technical depending on how you can manage your subsequent cash flows. So it's a very – it's
not an easy general answer to what type of inversion you would want to do.

On – apart from palbo, I think we have a lot of exciting products. I would probably talk about the ability to bring the
Staph Aureus vaccine to market as quickly as possible. I think bococizumab clearly has a huge potential. I think we're
well-placed with the clinical trial design. Ertugliflozin is a well-positioned adult vaccine which we've just launched, has
a huge potential. So I find it difficult to really pick just two assets, I think we have a lot of assets that we can create
value from and especially the total lifecycle of palbociclib.
So on new Treasury regulations, I don't know. I mean, I'm not in Washington and I can't comment. They have
published a rule, they haven't finalized the rule. And clearly there's an intent to do that, there's an intent to make it
somewhat more problematical for people to plan inversions, and we'll just have to work around that. Thank you.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Ian. Operator, moving on, please.

Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. So I have two. One I guess, first one's more for Ian.
Obviously a lot of discussion around M&A and what you guys are looking to do. I guess just strategically, some
comments earlier about valuations and given your approach and maybe not wanting to go ahead with a deal. Thinking
strategically, isn't it tougher for you to consummate a deal when you're being so public, talking about the need to do
something and the near-term focus that you're mentioning now, doesn't that make it tougher to get a deal done? And
doesn't it just raise the prices higher?
And then second one is more on the pipeline, if you can talk about I-O. I appreciate the comments you gave earlier, and
thanks for all that. Can you talk a little bit about on the biomarker side if there's anything you can share about how
you're planning to incorporate biomarkers at least into the first wave of studies that you have outlined here for this
year? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Yes, Vamil. I'm sort of intrigued by your comments. I don't think I've ever said we have to do a
deal. I think you're reading the press rather than what I've been saying. If I felt there was a pressure to do a deal, we
would have done the deal we were trying to do last year. We are very disciplined. We don't feel we need to do a big
deal. I do feel we have the ability and we have the balance sheet that we can use if a business development can further
our basic strategies, which is to strengthen either one of our businesses or to acquire in an area like immuno-oncology,
which we did to strengthen where we see we can create synergy and value.
So I'm a little mystified about this, your comment about that Pfizer sort of needs to do a deal. I think there's a lot of
rumors running around. We, like any management team, look at opportunities. We have the capital and the wherewithal
to do the deal should we so decide. I don't think it's a matter of is there a value and if there's value, we can get the deal
done. So I'm a little – you know, I hope that puts in perspective for all of you where we sit on business development
deals. Good to do if they create shareholder value. Disciplined if they don't, we're not doing them.
Biomarkers.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yeah, so that's a great question on how you bring immuno-oncology to the next level. And
first, as you know, we have considerable experience in selecting and developing biomarkers from Xalkori, where we've
obviously linked that to the drug's efficacy. And we have also learned how to drive uptake of that diagnostic to very
high rates in the marketplace.
Specifically for immuno-oncology so in our partnership on avelumab, we certainly are looking at PD-L1 high versus
low tumors. And the data we see really correlates as expected with high response in the PD-L1 high, but we also see
responses in the PD-L low.
We have a second wave, as you heard from Albert, on the 4-1BB and OX40 for combination. We think that the 4-1BB
is unique in amplifying cytotoxic cells, CD8 cells. So we certainly will look for expression of those cells in the tumor.
Similarly for OX40, we think it's more on the CD4 side. That will be another molecule to monitor. But also we have

programs coming on board for key regulatory cells that may limit overall immuno-oncology response and tumor
suppressing macrophages. And we have assets coming within the next year so on each of those particular subset of
immuno-oncology. And of course, our ADC portfolio is very much supported by diagnostic. We have now two ADC in
Phase I that show interesting responses, and we start to enrich by diagnostic for those.
So I hope you get the sense that we go from standard diagnostic to more next generation diagnostic, and we'll also do
the kind of future diagnostic looking at circulating tumor cells to make it even more easy to integrate in medical
practice. So we really see us being a driver of this change and a pioneer in this area. Thank you.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks for the background, Mikael. Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions. First question, just going back to business development as an
enabling strategy, Ian, I think you had indicated that one of the primary reasons for the AstraZeneca transaction was the
tax considerations, obviously, around the inversion and being able to unleash the value of the cash that you have
trapped offshore. If you go back and look at the Wyeth transaction, your tax rate around that time was around 22%. It's
gone as high as 27%, not enabling you to bring that cash back. How much consideration is there that when you do a
transaction, how much impact on the tax rate are you willing to absorb if it is a U.S. asset that you're looking to
acquire?
Second question for Frank. You've disclosed what the impact of foreign exchange is. Can you articulate or quantify
what the impact is on volume and price on growth in 2014?
And then last question, on R&D and Xeljanz in the EU, any update on your ability to file Xeljanz in Europe, and the
implications for the Enbrel field force over there, especially in light of Samsung filing their SB4 and anticipating to be
commercializing – at least Biogen Idec commercializing Enbrel in the back half and how are you going to be adjusting
for that resource if you don't have Xeljanz there? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: John, thank you. As always, good questions. Why don't you, Geno, deal with the whole issue of
Xeljanz in Europe and Frank can look at the volume question and I'll come back to your rather complicated question on
inversions and tax rates and perhaps Frank will also help me out there.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yes. So, John, regarding Xeljanz and the Enbrel inflammation business in Europe, we
remain committed to resubmitting for approval in RA for Xeljanz in Europe. We've had had recent interactions with
regulators there, and a discussion on our plans for resubmission. We were encouraged by those discussions. We
continue to collect additional clinical data to support that resubmission, and our expectations are that we will resubmit
by the end of the year in 2015.
Regarding Enbrel and potential competition, we see the introduction of biosimilars into the marketplace in Europe as
something that's more evolutionary than transitionary, and we expect to continue to support Enbrel through the
near-term, and realize continued support from that franchise. So I don't see disruption at this point with the timing that
we're anticipating and the impact that we see projected for biosimilars.
<A - Ian C. Read>: And of course, that market in Europe is very under, under, under-penetrated given their reluctance,
so there's a lot of volume there that can be accessed via biosimilars as well as the original. Frank?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So, John, for the quarter this is company-wide, so price was plus 1% volume was minus
1%, foreign exchange was minus 3%, FX drove the minus 3% for the quarter and as I mentioned in my comments we're
actually up operationally by $9 million excluding foreign exchange for the quarter. For the full-year, price was plus
2%, volume was minus 4%, FX was minus 2%, you put that together, you get the minus 4% that we reported for the
year.

<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. On the BD, I think my comments on AZ have always been that we looked at three
components of value. One was their pipeline, two was the amount of operational synergies that could be achieved, and
third was the financial synergies and you know we were disciplined in our approach because the financial synergies
were the most risky part of the equation and in fact, were made, eventually, more difficult to achieve by the proposed
rules.
I think the net-net answer to your question about tax rates is, it all goes into the value. What is the value of the
acquisition we're trying to achieve? What's the value we create for shareholders? And the tax rate, just like the
synergies, just like expenses, just like everything else, is part of that value equation. If it works, the value works, and
we'll do the deal. If the value doesn't work, we won't do the deal but of course undeniably the foreign companies, as
you've seen, for most of the acquisitions that have occurred in the last year, foreign companies do have an advantage
given their tax rate and this is something that should be of concern to the U.S. economy.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: I think the only thing I'd add, Ian, is, John in your question you mentioned before we
announced Wyeth it was 22% and we took it up to 27%, we actually took it up to 30%, and we announced why we took
the tax rate from 22% to 30%. We've been, I think, in an effective way of being able to step it down through a
combination of changes in jurisdictional mix and tax planning. We've gone from 30% to 29% to 28% – this past year
we had said approximately 27%, we printed 26.5% on adjusted results and now we've guided for 2015 to
approximately 25%.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thank you all. Next question, please, operator.

The next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes. Thanks very much. I have two questions. Frank, in the context of potential a split-up in
the future, you've obviously set up the financials, but could you please discuss the dis-synergies and the risk of pro
forma total costs being higher due to step-up costs if a separation were pursued in the future?
And then second, for Mikael, could you please discuss the top three or four pipeline readouts to watch in 2015? So
specifically, what clinical trial readouts are most important to focus on. Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Please, Frank.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So, Dave, the way I think about the split question you asked me is, in my mind there'll be
basically three key determinants to obviously whether or not we would separate the company: one is the performance
of the businesses; the second one would be our confidence level in those businesses continuing to perform successfully
on a stand-alone basis; and then three would be how the market values those businesses, and quite frankly is there an
opportunity to create in a tax efficient way incremental value? Is the sum of the parts greater than the whole, your
ability to unlock that value? That value part of the answer in my mind would factor in the items you raised about
dis-synergies. That's all part of the value equation that we'd have to factor in to get to a net-net positive along with
performance and standalone performance.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Let me yet mention a couple of readouts. So obviously, from palbociclib or Ibrance, we are
excited to also get the readouts from our recurrent study combining with fulvestrant that Albert spoke about.
Avelumab, our partnership with Merck Serona, around ASCO will be the first time we start to share updated data sets
and I think there will be opportunity also later to hear about how combinations are progressing and possibly late in the
year that we will also share some data on 4-1BB our own trial that we're running in lymphoma.
We also have readouts in ulcerative colitis, middle of the year or so. We have top line results from induction study with
Xeljanz and please remember in Phase II, Xeljanz had very strong induction data, among the best that has been really
presented in this field and at the JPMorgan I also shared very robust and really interesting data from our MAdCAM

antibody in UC, so you could really look upon UC as a space where we have multiple interesting data sets.
More near-term you also have an opportunity to look at inotuzumab in ALL, which will have an analysis for complete
response or complete response with incomplete hematological recovery.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please, operator.
Operator
Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Thanks very much for the questions. First off maybe, Frank, can you just walk us
through, we have an increased spending coming in – maybe not increased spending but good cost controls overall, but
is there more to achieve or be taken out of the business from here where you can be opportunistic as we head towards
the potential loss of Lyrica and some incremental pressures or are we off an overall growth trajectory on the business
including the expense base as we think about 2015 plus?
And then separately, as we think about the PCSK9 opportunity, I think there's been a real emphasis on the outcomes
from Pfizer. But Pfizer's also demonstrated an ability to succeed in the statin space without outcomes. Just wondering,
despite being third to market, how you would anticipate competing before perhaps outcomes are available and could
you be as a third to market product, how would you expect to compete without outcomes versus other competitors who
likely won't have outcomes data either? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. Frank, on spending?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: On spending, Seamus, I've said this before. Clearly, we're in the late innings in terms of
cost reduction. There's still opportunities. I think there's always opportunities. I think there continues to be
opportunities in G&A, for example. There continues to be opportunities with our portfolio, as the portfolio ebbs and
flows, so there's clearly opportunities related to the portfolio. And that said, it's hard. Ian mentioned in his comments
that we've taken out $5.5 billion in expenses and operating expenses over the last four years. There's not another $5.5
billion, for example, to take, so it's getting harder.
And then if you look at our results for 2014, I'll give you the full year numbers operationally. COGS was up 2%, SI&A
was down 2%, R&D was up 9%. Clearly, that upward pressure in R&D, we printed $7.2 billion in 2014 as an actual
number, we guided to $6.9 billion, to $7.4 billion for 2015. That includes the $300 million up front for OPKO. But I
think R&D, OPKO aside, is going to be in the low sevens, kind of going forward.
So that's good upward pressure in my mind in terms of the late-stage portfolio progressing in a good way. So I think,
and probably more than you need, but I think the short answer is, there's always opportunities, but we don't have the
same opportunities we had several years ago from the base. We've done a much better job, I think, in managing the
base.
<A - Ian C. Read>: I'd just add to Frank's comments that what we're looking at is, as sort of a transition from dealing
with some $26 billion of LOEs from 2010 through 2015, and the need to rationalize our cost base, to one of being
investing in future growth which I think is basically the most desirable state to be in, to have top line growth, and we're
investing in our Phase III pipeline and in our Innovative products. But this management team is very good at managing
our P&L and our investment and where we invest, and are prepared to do what's necessary if business circumstances
change on our expense base.
With that, the other question was for Geno on PCSK9?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yeah, PCSK9. So, Seamus, just to respond, clearly we – Pfizer has a long history and
heritage in the cardiovascular space, and I think that we can leverage that knowledge and obviously the data from our
clinical trial to determine the best approach to the marketplace. Frankly, we really expect the PCSK9 market to emerge
as a large and attractive market with the occurrence of the outcomes data, and we're kind of most focused on that.

We've obviously put our best thinking forward in our protocol designs, and should we have stronger data than the other
companies in the cholesterol management arm, then we'll leverage that. But at this point, we'll have to wait and see how
the data turns out, and again our focus is mainly on the outcomes trials.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Geno. Next question, please.

Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. I have two questions. First for Frank, is the $400 million in spend for a potential
company split in non-GAAP guidance, and what happens to this number in 2016? Is it the same, is it higher, or is it
lower?
And then the second question is on palbociclib. Has the FDA taken a look or do you expect it to take a look prior to
April 13th, at the Phase III trial which is underway? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Frank, you want to talk about that? Yeah.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Sure. Yeah, so on the $400 million, Steve, it's in GAAP, it's not an adjustment. We actually
called that out in the release, it's in the bridge we give you all. That bridge is from adjusted EPS to GAAP EPS. I think
the bridge shows – starts at the top, it shows $2.00 to $2.10, and then we have three takeaways from that. There's
purchase accounting adjustments of $0.41, there's restructuring and implementation cost that has a range of $0.13 to
$0.18, and there's business and legal entity alignment cost which is the $400 million you allude to, which is $0.04, and
that's the bridge from $2.10 to $2.20, to $1.37 to $1.52. So in GAAP, not an adjustment, and we give you a bridge that
breaks out how we get from point A to point B.
In terms of 2016, quite frankly, as we get towards the end of the year or early next year, we'll call that number out to
you, because a lot of that depends on how we do progress through the year, how the businesses perform. And so, that's
something that we'll call out obviously later in this year or early in 2016.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Albert, on palbociclib?
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Ibrance?
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes. For Ibrance, I don't want to speculate what the FDA would like to do. But from a timing
perspective, we don't expect to have the results of the – even an interim review of Phase III, before the PDUFA date.
And as you know, we are already in the late stage discussions for the label.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Albert. Next question, please, operator.

Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. First one is for Ian, which is just really, what do
you think about business development that – where you use OUS cash on OUS targets as non-inversion, just straight
M&A-type deals as a potential pragmatic way to deal with the tax situation on those overseas cash assets? Do you see
potential opportunities to do that?
And then just a few financial questions. As you want to be able to allow investors to see the value in the two separate
pieces, what do you think about giving midterm guidance on the two potential separate pieces for investors to help

them reach that decision and how you reached that decision?
Do you think it's reasonable to assume that this is now the floor 2015 number, floor in Pfizer revenues and EPS going
forward?
And then lastly, are you happy that we just extrapolate this year's tax rate going forward? Or are there any other factors
that we should consider? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. I'll let Frank answer your modeling questions.
On the BD and using offshore cash for offshore deals, once again it comes down to value, it comes down to – the
offshore deals often price in the fact that it's offshore cash. So you have to look at the price tag on the deals and see if
they make sense, but certainly conceptually you have a point that it just comes down to the quality of the asset and the
deals you're trying to do.
Frank, on the other question?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Yeah, so let me hit the – Jeff, let me hit the extrapolation of the tax rate first. I think the
way I'll answer your question is we stepped it down this year to approximately 25%, that's down from 26.5% in 2014 so
a nice decrease. And please note, that when we reduce the rate like we are doing for 2015, our intent is that that rate is
sustainable for the foreseeable future. So that's how I'd answer your question. In terms of trying to provide guidance
beyond 2015 for tax rates, given all the uncertainty in the tax environment, I think that just wouldn't be a prudent thing
to do.
In terms of your question on BUs and providing midterm type of guidance, we continue – I think we're getting more
and more transparent, I think, relative to our business units. This year we started providing very detailed income
statement information. Come 2015 we're going to start to provide our, you know, so then we'll start to provide some
balance sheet information, so we're providing more and more information that I think it enables a lot of good
extrapolation work.
In terms of taking our guidance and peeling it down to another level, I think it's hard enough to provide annual
guidance, total company. To then start taking it, and slicing it by sub-branch of detail I think just creates a level of
complexity that I don't think we're inclined to do.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thank you, Frank. Next question, please, operator.

Next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes. Good morning. First of all, can you give us an update on China how did that perform in
the quarter and how you're expecting it to perform in 2015 given the trends there?
Second, just update on us on palbo overseas and what the timing is there?
And then on the MAdCAM you did provide some data and I was curious if you could comment on the dose response
and on why it will take so long to move into Phase III. I think you said you're going to move to Phase III in 2016 and I
think the Phase IIs were done. I was curious about that.
And then lastly, just on Lipitor over-the-counter, I know there was one study that remains before you can go back and
talk to FDA and I was curious where we stand on that. And when you think you'll be talking to FDA again? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. Let's try and put it together. So if Albert can answer the palbo and the Lipitor question?
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes. We have had discussions with European regulatory health authorities on the clinical data,
and it is our intention to file in the EU this year. The anticipated filing package will be built off of what was submitted
to the FDA but it's too early to provide more details on that.

Coming to Lipitor, you're right, the actual use trial was completed in December of 2014 and the results are expected in
second quarter. So once we see the results then we will define our next steps in our efforts to bring an [ph] OTC
inhibitor (1:06:32).
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. John, China.
<A - John Young>: So thanks for the question, Marc. So we continue to perform strongly in China. I'll comment on
the GEP segment, which is the largest segment of our business in China. Overall for the quarter, we've had growth of
13% overall. For the year we saw growth of around about 18%. We continue to see as well within emerging markets
quarter-to-quarter fluctuation but we continue to be very satisfied by our performance in China.
Segments that are strong for us are particularly our cardiovascular franchise with Lipitor and Norvasc performing
strongly and also very strong performance from anti-infective business.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. MAdCAM?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yeah, so thank you for noticing the very interesting dose response that we shared with you. We
do think it represents possibly a true human biology that at the mid-doses, 22 to 75 milligrams, in that range we
possibly inhibit the autoimmune cells causing disease, while at the higher doses, you may also start to interfere with
regulatory or T cells that have a protective effect.
So it is very important to have done a very thorough dose response that can allow you to select the optimal dose and we
think this may distinguish our opportunity in MAdCAM versus other endocrine antibodies that may not have been able
to do such a thorough dose response and pick the sweet spot and that, actually if you look at our remission data, they
really perform well versus other published comparisons although it's historical comparisons.
Concerning the timelines, so we'll certainly see if we can accelerate it, but that relates to production of clinical trial
manufacturing for potential registration study and also to really understand how to define a study where you could test,
develop a drug that has this really unique solubility profile both for induction and maintenance therapy and how it
could play as an anchor drug across many IBD-like conditions. That's why we gave a little bit of an extended time
period and we may be able to shorten that as we go forward.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thank you, Mikael. And, operator, if we could take our last question, please?
Operator
Your final question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO capital.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning, and I apologize if I ask redundant questions. I got disconnected briefly. Ian, from
your perspective, could you comment on the M&A landscape in general? Based on your conversation with
management teams are you finding willing sellers out there and is it just a matter of price?
The follow-up for Frank and just following up on your earlier comments, how should we think about your margins for
the next couple of years? You're losing some high-margin products. You said most of the cost-cutting is done and
you're investing in launches. So is it fair to expect somewhat stable or perhaps slightly declining margins going
forward? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Yeah, so Alex on the price, willing sellers – price always determines whether you have a willing
seller or not normally; it's just a matter of what value you want to transfer. What I would say is I think the starting point
of the prices are somewhat – buoyant, shall we say, given where the marketplace is, so that does give you some concern
when you look at paying the type of prices or premiums you need off what we see as high valuations to begin with. So
we are being disciplined in how we look at that.
And then would you like to answer the margin question?

<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So, Alex, I think very good point good question in terms of, I'll call it the rhythm of the
margins. There is some – I'll call it some downward pressure on our operating margins. We've got $3.5 billion in LOEs
next year and some high-margin products clearly putting some downward pressure on the operating margins. We've
given guidance where you can obviously go through the line items and compute the numbers. That said, all of that's
factored into our EPS guidance. And I want to reiterate what I said before, if you exclude foreign exchange and the
OPKO transaction, the midpoint of our guidance for next year is roughly what we printed in 2014 despite that $3.5
billion in LOEs.
So we'll continue to manage our cost structure. Obviously the opportunities aren't what they used to be. But there is
some slight downward pressure on operating margins. That is what it is.
