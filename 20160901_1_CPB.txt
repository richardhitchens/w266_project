MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Campbell Soup Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. At this time,
all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will
follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to your host, Ken Gosnell. Please go ahead.
Kenneth Gosnell
Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the fourth quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's
fiscal 2016. With me on the call are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; and Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO. As usual,
we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this
morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media who participate in listen-only mode.
Today, we will make forward-looking statements which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on
assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to slide two or our SEC
filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in
forward-looking statements. Now, I'd like to remind you about items impacting comparability. As we said in this
morning's news release, the current quarter results reflect a non-cash impairment charge, pension and postretirement
mark-to-market losses, and charges related to cost savings initiatives.
The prior year quarter included pension and postretirement mark-to-market losses, and charges related to the
implementation of the new organizational structure and cost savings initiatives. The adjusted results exclude the impact
of these items impacting comparability, and our comparisons of the full year 2016 with 2015 will exclude these and
previously announced items. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these

Denise M. Morrison
Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today, I'll offer my
perspective on our performance with a focus on how each of our divisions are performing against their portfolio roles.
We finished the year in line with our guidance and with strong profit performance. However, our results this quarter
certainly did not meet my expectations. I am particularly unhappy with the short-term executional issues that have led
to the poor performance in Campbell Fresh, both for the quarter and for the year. I'll spend the majority of my time this
morning addressing this topic. While sales for the year including Garden Fresh Gourmet were up 5%, organic sales
declined 4% in C-Fresh. In the fourth quarter, organic sales were down 12%, driven by declines in both CPG and
Farms.
This performance is unacceptable. I expect far more from the Campbell Fresh business. It's clear that we have several
immediate challenges in Campbell Fresh, and we are addressing them. I'll get to that in a moment, but first, I want to
step back and look at the big picture. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 is the first year of operation of Campbell Fresh. This
division, which accounts for approximately $1 billion in revenue, or about 13% of our total sales, combines Bolthouse
Farms, the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, and our refrigerated soup business.
Strategically, C-Fresh positions Campbell to benefit from the growing health and wellbeing trend, as well as the
growing demand for better-for-you foods in the packaged fresh category. Its portfolio role is to deliver full force
growth, driven by the CPG business and to contribute to the acceleration of Campbell's overall sales trajectory. While
disappointed in our execution, I remain confident in our C-Fresh strategy. We have strong, popular brands that are
on-trend with the changing nature of consumers' eating habits. We're well positioned in the produce and deli section of
stores, with an eye on expansion into other categories such as dairy. We have a robust innovation pipeline, and we're
enhancing our approach to long-term innovation. Strategy was not the issue. Our problem was execution.
I'm going to spend some time on what didn't work and importantly, the actions we're taking to ensure the business
performs to its potential. So what went wrong? There were two issues that were the primary drivers of the C-Fresh
results in the quarter, the Bolthouse Farms Protein Plus recall and the poor performance of our Carrot business.
Let's start with CPG business and Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outage. As previously announced on
June 22, we voluntarily recalled 3.8 million bottles of Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS beverages due to possible
spoilage. The Protein PLUS line-up accounts for approximately 15% of the Bolthouse Farms beverage business. In
addition, the same manufacturing lines are used to produce our cafe drinks, which account for another 10% of the
beverage business. Our examination into the recall identified our manufacturing equipment and process as the primary
cause of the spoilage.
We have corrected these problems, rigorously tested the product, and started shipping again. However, production has
not returned to the pre-recall levels due to new operating procedures that we've put in place, including an enhanced test
and release protocol to ensure the product meets our high quality standards. Prior to the recall, a typical production run
for these products would have been 72 hours. Today, a production run is 24 hours. Unfortunately, the shorter runs
significantly reduce our capacity. We are examining various ways to increase capacity, including commissioning other
production lines, but we currently anticipate these will take time to implement and expect that supply will be impacted
through the end of the calendar year 2016.
Now turning to Farms. Let's take a look at our second issue, our Carrot business. In July at our Investor Day, we
discussed some weather-related problems and a customer issue in our Carrot business. As we reviewed these issues

further, we learned the problems were rooted in several decisions that had compounded one on another, and therefore
were broader than we understood at the time. Specifically, there were some planting, harvesting, and commercial
decisions made earlier in the calendar year that exacerbated the weather problems. This led our Farms operation to
harvest carrots prematurely in an attempt to meet customer demand. Ultimately, this resulted in a spring crop that
yielded smaller carrots, which led to customer dissatisfaction and an additional loss of business.
The size of the carrots we're harvesting now is vastly improved and we're actively addressing service issues with
customers; however, it will take us time to regain the lost business. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2017 carrot sales
to be comparable to fiscal 2016, rather than benefiting from a recovery from last year's issues. A final point of context.
Carrots are a relatively low margin business. However, it serves as the chassis for our higher margin value added CPG
business. Carrots provide the scale for the refrigerated logistics system that we leverage for distribution and
merchandising.
So, what actions have we taken so far to correct these issues? Over the last several weeks, we made major organization
changes under Jeff Dunn, the President of Campbell Fresh. Several senior managers are no longer with the company,
including the President of Bolthouse Farms. Additionally, we created a new structure to foster more agility and
collaboration across the division. Previously we had two operating units. Bolthouse Farms functioned as a distinct unit
and Garden Fresh Gourmet was combined with fresh soup. Now we have three operating units reporting directly to
Jeff.
CPG, which integrates Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings with Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and
chips, along with fresh soups. Farms, which consists of carrots and carrot ingredients, and the long-term innovation unit
we discussed at Investor Day in July. In addition to the three operating units, we have created a more integrated
structure, both at the divisional level and with Campbell. In particular, we have strengthened the integration and
oversight of the Campbell Fresh supply chain.
We have also bolstered the Campbell Fresh leadership team by adding more senior finance, human resources, and sales
executives. This new team is a combination of seasoned and accomplished Campbell and Bolthouse Farms leaders and
experienced executives recruited from food startups and major industry players. I believe that this newly structured
team will lead this business back to the growth profile mandated by its portfolio role.
In the first half of fiscal 2017, the new management team will take steps to stabilize the business. First, we expect to
improve our execution. Second, we plan to continue to increase capacity as we rebound from the Protein PLUS recall
and related production outage. And third, we'll stabilize the Carrot business to improve quality and customer service.
Our plans call for C-Fresh sales to be down slightly in the first half and return to growth consistent with its portfolio
role in the second half. Putting it all together, we expect sales growth to be in the low single-digits for fiscal 2017 and
we will keep you updated on developments as we go. While disappointed in the near term performance of C-Fresh, I
remain confident in the strategy we are pursuing, the package fresh platform we're building, and the growth potential of
this business.
Now, let me shift gears to the progress we've made in other areas during fiscal 2016. As I said earlier, when I look at
the year as a whole for the company, our profit performance was strong. This was driven by our America Simple Meals
and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks divisions. We delivered double-digit adjusted earnings growth with
solid operating performance including expanded gross margin, significantly improved supply chain performance, and
better than expected cost savings. We also advanced our real food and transparency agenda, establishing Campbell as a
leader in this area. However, we continue to face challenges on the top line. We recognize that we need to grow sales,
and it remains a top priority.
Our America Simple Meals and Beverages and Global Biscuits and Snacks divisions have performed largely in line
with their portfolio roles. First, America Simple Meals and Beverages. Things are moving in the right direction here
and I feel good about what we've achieved this year. We made important strides in fiscal 2016. The team drove
significant gross margin expansion through a combination of net price realization and major improvements in our
supply chain. This resulted in a 13% increase in operating profit.

Our Simple Meals brands delivered sales growth behind Prego and Pace and Plum delivered double-digit sales gains
through increased distribution and innovation. And we advanced our real food agenda, changing many of our recipes
including clean-labeled products and embracing transparency. While we've accomplished much in the Americas
division, sales remain inconsistent. Organic sales declined 1% for the year. Many of our brands are performing in line
with the categories in which we compete; however, portions of the portfolio are underperforming their categories, in
particular, beverages and ready-to-serve soup. We're taking steps to address this and expect improved performance in
these areas and modest growth in the division in fiscal 2017.
Looking ahead, the America's division will continue to concentrate on getting more from our core brands with a focus
on driving sales through investments in fewer bigger innovations and improved marketing while increasing margins.
We have plans in place to drive continued margin expansion through supply chain efficiencies. In fiscal 2017, we
expect our Soup business to grow behind continued growth of broth and better performance from our ready-to-serve
soup portfolio.
As we outlined at Investor Day, our plans called for improved execution around the Chunky brand, and the mid-year
launch of the new Well Yes clean label soup line. We also anticipate better performance from V8 beverages, driven by
the continued success of Veggie Blends and V8 + ENERGY as well as a renewed focus on tried and tested marketing
that re-engages our loyal V8 Red consumers. To connect with our consumers, build brand relevance, and drive demand,
we're investing in four integrated marketing campaigns in the Americas, including a new NFL themed Chunky
campaign featuring six popular players.
For the year, our Global Biscuits and Snacks division made progress in performing against its portfolio role. Organic
sales increased 1%, and operating earnings were up 10%. Pepperidge Farm delivered strong performance, and our
Asia-Pacific team drove solid sales results in a highly competitive and concentrated trading environment. The emphasis
on growing our icon brands, Goldfish, Tim Tam and Milano as well as revenue management initiatives and improved
supply chain performance drove our results.
Looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering the division's role of expanding in both developed and developing
markets while improving margins. In the United States, we have higher levels of investment to drive sustained Goldfish
growth, continued momentum for Milano, expanded Tim Tam distribution, and increased innovation in our Fresh
Bakery business. In Australia, we're focused on strengthening our Arnott's brand through integrated marketing and
relevant consumer-driven innovation. In developing markets, we expect continued growth in Malaysia and improved
performance in China and Indonesia.
Looking forward to 2017, I have a pragmatic outlook. Our plan calls for modest growth, driven by reinvesting some of
our cost savings back into the business. We're confident in the C-Fresh platform, and we're acting with urgency to
address our execution to get the Beverage and Carrot business back on track, while continuing to drive sales on salad
dressing, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus, and fresh soup. We expect America Simple Meals and Beverages and
Global Biscuits and Snacks to continue to live into their portfolio roles.
We remain focused on delivering our three-year cost-savings target, and we are looking for more opportunities to drive
effectiveness and efficiency. We'll be re-investing a portion of our cost savings in focused innovation and improved
marketing on our core business. And we're creating an ownership mindset across the organization through our
zero-based budgeting efforts. These are reflected in our annual guidance, which Anthony will take you through in a few
minutes.
Clearly, we have some challenges ahead of us, but we know what's working and what's not. And we're taking action to
improve our sales performance in every division. I remain confident in the strategic imperatives that we're pursuing,
and that they provide a compelling path to increase shareholder value. Reflecting confidence in our growth prospects
and the strong profit performance this year, our board of directors declared a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend.
Thank you. I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes. Now, let me turn the call over to our Chief
Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro.

Anthony P. DiSilvestro
Thanks, Denise and good morning. Before getting into the details, I want to provide my perspective on our results and
guidance. As Denise stated, we are disappointed with the performance of our C-Fresh division in the fourth quarter,
which was the key driver of a 1% decline in organic sales for the company, reflecting the recall of Bolthouse Farms
protein drinks and declines in carrots.
At the EBIT line, the negative impact of the C-Fresh performance was offset by lower incentive compensation accruals,
relative to our expectations. In the fourth quarter, our adjusted tax rate was negatively impacted by a $13 million
correction for deferred taxes. The correction had a negative impact on EPS of $0.04 per share, and as a result, our
full-year tax rate finished above our previous expectations.
Moving on to the full year, while adjusted EPS of $2.94 was within our guidance range, we finished at the lower end
due to the tax correction. We are pleased with our gross margin performance, which, on an adjusted basis, increased
170 basis points, in line with expectations, driven by significantly improved supply chain performance, cost savings,
and net price realizations. We continue to make very good progress against our three-year cost savings target of $300
million, delivering about $130 million of incremental savings in fiscal 2016, bringing the program to-date total to $215
million.
As part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $0.41 per share in our
GAAP results on our Bolthouse Farms Carrot and Carrot Ingredient business, reflecting reduced expectations for future
cash flows. I'm very pleased with our strong cash flow performance, as cash from operations exceeded $1.4 billion and
our board has approved a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend. Looking ahead to fiscal to 2017, although below our
long term target, we plan to improve our sales performance compared to 2016 and make investments in the business to
support key brands, launch new products, drive long-term innovation, and build capabilities in areas like digital and
e-Commerce.
Now, I'll review our results in more detail. For the fourth quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis of $1,687,000 were
comparable to the prior year. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation and the favorable impact of the
Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales declined 1%, driven by declines in Campbell Fresh, partly offset
by gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks. The negative impact from the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production
outage was approximately 1 percentage point on total company sales.
Adjusted EBIT declined 2% to $253 million as higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses and a lower gross
margin percentage were partly offset by lower administrative expenses, reflecting lower incentive compensation
accruals. Adjusted EPS decreased 6%, or $0.03 to $0.46. This EPS decline includes a $0.03 per share negative impact
on the Bolthouse Farms recall and related production outage, consistent with our expectations, as well as the $0.04 per
share negative impact from the tax correction.
For the full year, as reported and organic net sales both decreased 1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT of
$1,467,000, and adjusted EPS of $2.94, both increased by 11%. Earnings growth is being driven by our improved gross
margin performance and the benefits from our cost savings initiatives. Breaking down our sales performance for the
quarter, net sales was comparable to prior year. Organic sales declined 1% as a two point negative impact from higher
promotional spending was partly offset by a one point gain from volume and mix. Gains in volume were driven by
growth in Arnott's biscuits, Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers, and Prego pasta sauces, which benefited from the
launch of the new Prego Farmers' Market product line, partly offset by declines in C-Fresh, due to the Bolthouse Farms
protein drinks recall and volume decline in carrots.
Increased promotional spending across our three segments includes higher spending in Arnott's, as we're lapping in an
unusually low quarter, which was impacted by product availability, higher spending in Bolthouse Farms to remain
competitive and support the launch of 1915, and higher spending on Prego and Pace. With the exception of C-Fresh,
increased promotional spending drove gains in volume. Completing the bridge, a 1 point negative impact from currency
translation was offset by the 1 point benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet.

Our gross margin declined 90 basis points in the quarter to 36.1%. Looking at the drivers of the decline, cost inflation
and other factors had a negative impact of 270 basis points, driven primarily by cost inflation, which on a rate basis
increased by about 1.5%, the recall and related production outages of Bolthouse Farms protein drinks, and higher carrot
costs from unfavorable crop yields. Reflecting the increased promotional spending on the businesses I mentioned in the
sales discussion, the higher promotional rate had a negative impact of 110 basis points on gross margin.
This was partly offset by list pricing gains of 20 basis points from previous pricing actions in Global Biscuits and
Snacks. Mix was slightly favorable, also adding 20 basis points. Lastly, our supply chain productivity programs, which
are incremental to our three-year cost savings program, contributed 250 basis points of margin improvement in the
quarter. Looking at this another way, not on the chart, the weak performance of the Campbell Fresh segment accounted
for 70 basis points of the total decline of 90 basis points, including the protein drink recall, which accounted for 50
basis points.
Adjusted marketing and selling expenses decreased 14% in the quarter, primarily due to higher advertising expenses in
Pepperidge Farm, to support Goldfish crackers and the Fresh Bakery business, and increase support of Prego pasta
sauces. Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 19%, primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs, which
accounts for about two-thirds of the decline as well as the benefit from our cost savings initiatives. For additional
perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below
the line items. Adjusted EPS decreased $0.03 from $0.49 in the prior year to $0.46 per share in the current quarter. On
a currency neutral basis, declines on adjusted EBIT had a negative impact on EPS of $0.01.
Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter increased by 2.3 points to 36.4%. The increase in the tax rate reduced EPS by
$0.02, as the impact of the deferred tax correction was partly offset by the benefit of geographic mix. The impact from
share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our share count slightly, but due to rounding
shows no benefit on EPS in the quarter. Interest was fairly comparable to prior year, up $1 million with no impact on
EPS as the impact of higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio was mostly offset by lower debt level. Currency
translation also had no impact, completing the bridge to $0.46 per share.
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales were comparable to prior
year at $842 million, driven by double-digit gains in Prego pasta sauces, including the benefit of the launch of Prego
Farmers Market. And also by double-digit gains in Plum products, offset by declines in V8 beverages and
ready-to-serve soup. Operating earnings increased 4%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage driven by
productivity improvement, partly offset by increased marketing expenses as we've increased support behind Prego and
V8 Beverages.
Within U.S. soup, which declined 2% in aggregate, condensed declined 1%, and RTS declined 6%. These declines
were partly offset by a 7% gain in Swanson broth. Estimated changes in retailer inventory levels did not meaningfully
impact soup sales in the quarter. As we previously stated, while we will discuss the key drivers of soup performance as
we do with our other businesses, this is the last quarter we will provide detailed sub category sales performance. Here's
a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending
July 31, 2016, the category as a whole declined by 2.7%.
Our sales in measured channels declined 3.8%, primarily driven by weakness in ready-to-serve, partly offset by
strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share for the 52-week period, declining 70 basis points. Private label
grew share by 10 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 29%, up 60 basis
points, reflecting share gains by smaller brands. In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2%, with
double-digit gains in Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers, supported by increased advertising and growth in Arnott's
biscuits in Australia and New Zealand, driven by increased promotional activity. Operating earnings increased 5% to
$81 million, as lower administrative costs were partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage.
Within gross margin, the impact of cost inflation and increased promotional spending was partly offset by productivity
improvement. In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales decreased 12%, reflecting declines in Bolthouse Farms
premium refrigerated beverages due to the recall of protein drinks. Sales of the CPG Beverages and Salad Dressings
business declined 10% in the quarter. Sales of carrots also declined as we experienced quality issues in the fourth

quarter, which led to customer dissatisfaction and the loss of business. These declines were partly offset by gains in
fresh soup.
Operating earnings declined by $13 million, or 62% to $8 million primarily driven by the adverse impact of the
voluntary recall on Bolthouse Farms protein drinks and related production outages, as well as higher carrot costs and
lower sales of carrots and carrot ingredients, partly offset by lower administrative expenses. Just a reminder, that
Garden Fresh Gourmet was acquired on June 29, 2015 and we have now wrapped the acquisition date. As a result,
there is one month of operating results from Garden Fresh Gourmet now included in organic sales.
We had very strong cash flow performance in fiscal 2016. Cash from operations increased by $281 million to a record
$1,463 million, driven by significantly higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements, reflecting
reductions in inventory level. Capital expenditures declined $39 million to $341 million. We paid dividend totaling
$390 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. And as announced this morning, we
will be increasing our quarterly dividend by 12% to $0.35 per share. In aggregate, we repurchased $143 million of
shares in fiscal 2016, $100 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the
repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt declined by $592 million, as cash
from operations was well in excess of capital expenditures, dividend, and share repurchases.
Now, I'll review our 2017 outlook. The company expects sales to grow by 0% to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 1% to
4% and adjusted EPS to grow by 2% to 5% or $3 per share to $3.09 per share. This guidance assumes, based on current
exchange rates, that the impact from currency translation will be nominal. While not to the level of our long-term sales
growth target of 1% to 3%, sales performance is expected to improve relative to 2016 as we address those businesses,
which have underperformed. While we expect to achieve further EBIT margin expansion in 2017, growth in adjusted
EBIT is slightly below our long-term target, as we will be making investments in our business to support key brands, in
new product launches, in long term innovation, and to build capabilities in areas like digital and e-commerce.
These investments are designed to improve our growth profile over the long term. Our range for growth and adjusted
EPS is ahead of EBIT as we plan to increase share repurchases, and benefit from a slightly lower tax rate, partly offset
by slightly higher interest expense, given our expectation of rising short-term interest rates. While we don't give
quarterly guidance, I will say that we expect a majority of our top- and bottom-line growth to come in the second half,
as we work through the issues we're currently experiencing in C-Fresh, and as we wrap lower levels of marketing
support in the first half of fiscal 2016.
Turning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance. While inflation on core ingredients and packaging
has moderated, we expect inflation and cost of products sold of approximately 2% including higher wage, and ongoing
benefit cost and the lagging negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input cost of our international businesses,
given the timing of our foreign currency hedges. As we've successfully delivered in the past, we expect ongoing supply
chain productivity gains, excluding our ZBB initiative of approximately 3% of cost of products sold. We expect our
gross margin percentage to improve slightly, with productivity gains exceeding inflation.
The effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 32%, slightly below the 2016 adjusted rate of 32.6%. While we
are not prepared to provide a specific amount, we currently plan to significantly increase share repurchases, unless
needed for other uses including M&A. Our EPS guidance reflects the favorable impact of these anticipated repurchases
over the course of the year on our average shares outstanding. We are forecasting capital expenditures of approximately
$350 million, comparable to fiscal 2016 levels and in line with our historical spending levels. And under our cost
savings program, we expect to deliver incremental savings of $50 million in fiscal 2017 and are on track to achieve our
$300 million goal by 2018.
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A.

Thanks, Anthony. We will now start our Q&A session. Since we have limited time, out of fairness to the other callers,
please ask only one question at a time. Okay, Stephanie.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.
Your line is open.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Hey, guys. I wanted to get a bit of a better understanding of the Carrots business longer
term from here. I do understand, Denise, that there were some execution issues. I think that indicates that perhaps a lot
of the problem is fixable. You also talked about carrot yields, which suggest that's fixable, too. On the other hand, you
just took a big write-down and I would look at that as maybe an indication that the business is never going to be as
strong as it once was, or at least in management's mind. So I really just wanted to get a better sense of maybe how to
balance those two data points, I guess, as we think about not just 2017, but beyond for the carrot business?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah. I think that, as we indicated, the Carrot business is right now going through a
short-term issue, and fortunately, it is a short-term crop. And the crop we're harvesting now is much better. So we
believe we will be back in business at pretty normal levels by about the second half of the year. We've got a lot to do
there. I mean, we've got customer issues to address, and we are actively doing that. Going forward, I think as we looked
at the business, based on the growth rates in sales and earnings that we saw when we bought the business, we believe
that the growth rates are going to be about flat to up slightly. And that is a little bit more conservative than when we
first bought the business.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yeah, if I could just add to that. As part of our annual testing of intangible assets,
which we perform in the fourth quarter, we do a detailed discounted cash flow analysis. And as we performed that on
the carrot and carrot ingredient reporting unit, we certainly reflected the current year performance and our expectations
for future cash flows. And while we expect the performance to improve over time, it's not to the levels previously
anticipated, and consequently, it's led to the impairment charge.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Okay. That makes sense. Can I ask one quick follow-up? Denise, you mentioned, and
maybe I heard you wrong, that you wanted to get C-Fresh into other areas. And I think you mentioned dairy. I had
always thought the goal was maybe to get into dairy alternatives, not necessarily dairy itself. And I'm just curious if
there's a change at all in your thinking there.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah, Ken, that actually is related to what we talked about at Investor Day in our long
term innovation group working on the new pea protein beverage. So its plant based beverages, but they would be
situated in the dairy part of the perimeter of the store.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Okay. Thanks for the clarification.

<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Just a follow-up on Campbell Fresh. I guess as we look at Bolthouse going into 2017, just
two points, I guess, I'd like to get some clarification on. First, in terms of the profitability there for this year, I guess it
sounds like it'll be somewhat impaired or below what a normal run rate would be as you sort of rebuild your production
capacity and you get – rebuild the customer base in carrots. So I just want to make sure that that's one of the things that
will hold it back this year maybe relative to what we should expect in 2018 and 2019 is just simply there's a little
rebuilding that has to go on?
And then as a follow-up to that, just – does the sort of adjustments you're making in production runs and run times,
sounds like maybe even considering new production lines, does that at all slow the pace of new product innovations
like the pea protein drinks? Just trying to understand if whether there's sort of a step back before you can step forward
as you get the supply chain straightened out? Thank you.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Bryan, on the first part of that question, Denise mentioned two factors that will impact
at least our first half performance in 2017. One is the supply constraints on protein drinks, given the production – the
run times, 24 hours versus 72 hours. And the other thing is, given some loss of customers on carrots, it will take us a
little bit of time to reacquire that business. And so as we look at C-Fresh for the full year, we expect top line growth
low single-digits. Typically we would look for high single-digits, so obviously that's impacting our 2017 outlook. And
as far as innovation, I don't think the issue on this particular line has an impact on our innovation agenda.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: It does not. I would say, though, in the first half, the team will be very focused on the
fundamentals. So the new product innovations will most likely go to market in the second half.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you, our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Great. Thank you and good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, David.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hi, David.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: I wanted to ask a little bit about the cost savings and the reinvestment strategy. So
kind of back at the beginning, I think, Denise, the plan was to take about half of the big cost savings that were coming
in and reinvest it back in the business. But then you had this kind of like wonderful event of the cost savings tumbled in
faster and larger, all these good things that happened in the year. But it brought up the question as to when would all
this reinvestment occur. So, if we're still looking for something like $150 million of reinvestment, will most of that
occur in fiscal 2017? Or can you give us some guidance on how the reinvestment plan lays out?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yeah, I'll take a try at that. So, when we first announced a cost savings program, we
were targeting $200 million of savings, and we talked about half of that going back for reinvestment. I think as the
savings level went up, we kind of held the reinvestment amount. So I don't think we would estimate that – I think I
would estimate that less than half is now going back in the business. We're not going to give a specific dollar amount in
terms of reinvestment in 2017, but it is significant and it is in a number of areas. We're going to support new product
launches, things like Prego's Farmers Market, Well Yes soup, Plum infant formula, the Bolthouse Spring innovations,
Tim Tam's expansion in the U.S., Goldfish made with organic wheat. So we have a number of product launches going
on.
We're also going to invest in new capabilities around things like digital and e-commerce. We're going to make
investments in our real food initiatives, so these are things like improving our can liners, continuing the removal of
BPA, improving the product and more clean label, those types of ingredients which tend to be a little more expensive.
We're going to invest in longer term innovations, things like our Acre investment fund. And also as Denise mentioned,
long-term innovation in package fresh. We're also going to invest and add resources to expand our sales and

distribution in China through our Kelsen business. So we have quite a list of areas we're looking to reinvest and in the
P&L we have a significant allocation of funds.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah. And David, our profit is strong, our challenge is top-line growth. So these
investments are really vital to the long-term health of the sales line of the company.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: So, it sounds like it's fair to say that a big portion of the investment is happening
now but will also happen in F 2018 and beyond? I think that's what you're trying to tell me. Is that right, guys?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Well certainly F 2017. I'm not commenting on F 2018 at this point, but...
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: All right. One clarification, and apologies for this, but I've got to ask this. The
pacing of the quarterly earnings. There was amazing growth in Q1 and Q2. You didn't really say this in your prepared
comments, Anthony, but will you actually be at or above the year ago 1Q and 2Q numbers? Is there any chance that
these are below those year-ago numbers just because of how tremendous Q1 and Q2 were last year?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: We did say a majority of growth will come in the second half. And as you point out,
there's two reasons for that. We're lapping a relatively low marketing Q1, Q2 and we have these lingering issues on
C-Fresh. So that will tend to suppress our first half performance. But we'll see it come back in the second half.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We have a much stronger marketing investment in the first half, particularly in the
America Simple Meals and Beverage with four really big campaigns.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Thank you so much. I'll pass it along.

Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi Jason.
<Q - Jason English>: Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you for the question. I've got two quick questions. First, I'm
not really sure what you meant when you answered Dave Driscoll's question in terms of cadence, so I'll ask it a little
more directly. Do you expect earnings to be down year-on-year in the first half of the year?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: We're not going to give specific guidance, but I would say we expect relatively weaker
performance in the first half and stronger performance in the second half.
<Q - Jason English>: Okay. I had to try. My second question relates to promotional spend. Early last year you guys
kind of went into the year, you talked about some opportunities to rationalize some spend. There were glimmers of
hope to the first half of the year as that promotional line in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages decision actually
went positive, we've given that back in the back half of the year. So can you kind of update us on how you're thinking
about your promotional posture, your promotional spend and what caused the set back as you progressed through the
year?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: I guess we look at it a little bit different than that. We are very focused on improving
our gross margin performance and expanding margin. Within that, we look to net price realization, productivity
improvements to exceed inflation. On the net price realization, we feel really good about what we've been able to
accomplish in 2016. In fact, 40 basis points of our 170 basis point gross margin improvement is driven by net price
realization. And within that, and it gets a little distorted on the sales variance, but we made meaningful reductions in
trade spend in soup, given the promotional pricing we've taken on RTS. And although it's impacted volumes, it had
contributed significantly to margin expansion.
Now we were up a little bit in the fourth quarter, it's a non-seasonal quarter for us. Most of our dollar increase in trade
in the fourth quarter relates to our Arnott's business in Australia – we're lapping a period of supply constraint. So we
had to pull back on our promotional activities, so we're wrapping that. But as I look at the whole year, we accomplished

what we set out to do in our plan and have made meaningful progress, especially in soup which is very critical – to our
agenda, going forward.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Let me build on that, that we also, as part of the setup of our integrated global services,
have made investments in our revenue management and advanced analytics. And we're continuing to look for ways to
manage the depth and frequency of our trade programs to maximize profitable volume. We have to take into
consideration competitive activity and customer programs and consumer response, but this is definitely a point of focus
for us.
<Q - Jason English>: Very good. Thank you so much for the time. I'll pass it on.

Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Rob.
<Q - Robert Connor>: Hi. This is actually Robert Connor on for Rob Moskow.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Okay.
<Q - Robert Connor>: So we just had a question. So it looks like some of these smaller organic brands are more
vulnerable to weather disruptions and kind of like the stability of the product on the shelf is shorter. It seemed like
WhiteWave with their Earthbound Farms brand they had supply chain issues, and obviously you guys are having issues
with the Bolthouse brand supply chain. So, does it raise any concerns in your mind about kind of putting most of your
growth in the Fresh part, which has kind of more volatile supply chain and lower margins?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: It all starts with the consumer, and the consumer trends are very strong in terms of health
and well-being, and particularly in fresh food. Some of these issues are part and parcel to running a fresh food business.
But in our case, these were execution issues and we can do better there. So we're really confident in the strategy to
pursue fresh food in addition to the strong core brands that we have.
<Q - Robert Connor>: Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. Good morning everyone. Thanks.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Matt.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. Anthony, I just wanted to ask a little more about the inflation outlook. And
apologies if I missed this earlier, but did you mention what inflation was here in the fourth quarter? The gross margin
headwind seemed to step up quite a bit versus what we'd seen year-to-date, so I'm not sure how material the other
portion of that was related to Bolthouse issues. And if you could give us any color on kind of the shape of the inflation
curve as we kind of move forward sequentially.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Sure. I think the best way to explain our gross margin performance, which was down
90 basis points in the fourth quarter, is to parse out the impact of the C-Fresh division. So the C-Fresh division in
aggregate had a 70 basis point impact out of the 90 basis points. So basically all – most of our gross margin decline is
attributable to the two issues inside of C-Fresh. The recall, which was 50 basis points, and the decline on carrots, which
has an impact on the margin as well. And looking at the rest of it, inflation was not that great in the fourth quarter as we

talked in the bridge. The higher promotional expense was the key swing relative to prior quarters. But most of the
decline, as we said, attributable to the C-Fresh performance.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. That helps. Thanks. And just one other quick clarification from a guidance
standpoint. Incentive, obviously you delivered 11% underlying EPS growth this year, but there was, I guess perhaps an
accrual correction on incentive comp here in the fourth quarter, which resulted in a year-on-year decline there. As we
think ahead to 2017, does incentive comp end up being a headwind or a tailwind, or are you kind of essentially at a
normal run rate at this point?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yeah. So we had some ups and downs obviously in 2016. We ended up with a $0.02
headwind in 2016 versus 2015. And looking forward our short-term incentives are close to target. The long-term
incentive will go up a little bit. All in, we had about a $0.02 negative impact in 2017.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay, great. Thanks Anthony.

Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - John Joseph Baumgartner>: Good morning, thanks for the question. Denise, I'd like to ask about M&A. In
addition to the chassis you feel that you have with the Carrot business, it also seems that you have a fairly nice chassis
with your distribution model at Pepperidge. So how do you assess the ability for M&A to maybe accelerate growth
more broadly in U.S. snacking? Maybe even outside of C-Fresh, and how much more could you be doing at Pepperidge
to leverage your out-to-market there?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah. I wanted to clarify that we look at – we do look at M&A more broadly than just
Campbell Fresh. And each one of our divisions has mapped out specific targets that they're interested in that are a good
strategic fit for their businesses. And so, we are highly interested in other consumer behaviors like health and
well-being, like snacking, like simple meals that we can pursue, not only from an organic growth standpoint, but also
from an M&A standpoint.
<Q - John Joseph Baumgartner>: And you feel that your route to market with the DSD at Pepperidge allows you to
kind of go and do that and accelerate growth with kind of a bolt-on?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I'm sorry. I didn't understand the question.
<Q - John Joseph Baumgartner>: You feel as though your route to market at Pepperidge through kind of the DSD
network would allow you to kind of buy a smaller artisanal brand as they are more in health and wellness based and
really kind of accelerate?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Absolutely. I mean, Plum organics is a great example of a smaller brand that we bought.
We were able to integrate that into the Americas Simple Meals and Beverage business and capitalize on things like
their sales force and supply chain.
<Q - John Joseph Baumgartner>: Good. Thank you.

<Q - David Palmer>: A question on a couple of areas that I know that you'd like to improve, and that was
ready-to-serve soup and Chunky, in particular, and then also V8. Your new marketing campaign for Chunky, it looked
promising and your comparisons will be on your side. Realistically speaking, do you think that that's the business that
has the best chance for improvement among the areas that you cited that you think will improve in fiscal 2017? And
then perhaps you can dimensionalize what you think would be a successful step in the right direction. Could you get
back to flat for that business in ready-to-serve, for instance?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah. We definitely have some bright spots in soups this year. We basically stabilized
condensed and broth is up for the year. But, the issue we've had has been RTS soup. And, as you indicate, with brand
Chunky we have the price realization behind us. We have improved Chunky marketing going into 2017. We had a label
execution issue in the first and second quarter last year that we are cycling, and then, we can't control the weather, but
that was definitely an impact in 2016.
So we believe that the Chunky brand will have improved performance in 2017. In addition, we are launching Well Yes
mid-year, which is a great tasting, clean label, ready-to-serve soup that we believe will have disruption in the soup aisle
and capture the hearts and minds of consumers. The other thing we have going for us in soup is Slow Kettle and
Organic Soups continue to do very well. And we just came out with new stackable cans in our RTS soup, which has
been received really, really well from the retailers for merchandising purposes. So we've got a lot more going for us
this year than last year, and we expect soup to grow modestly.
<Q - David Palmer>: Great. Thank you.

Our final question comes from Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Mario Contreras>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hello, Mario.
<Q - Mario Contreras>: So actually just following up on the previous question. I think there was also a question on
V8. So I just wanted to add on to that. So that's been an area of investment, you mentioned some further investment in
terms of marketing and advertising, but sales continues to be a headwind there. So can you just talk about the results
that you're seeing from some of those investments? Are we at an inflection point where that's starting to improve?
Thanks.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes. Thanks for that reminder. We continue to be challenged in our shelf-stable
beverages, particularly on our products that contain sugar. So V8, V-Fusion, for example. And this year we actually did
have some declines on our V8 Red. Our new veggie blends, which we supported with some good marketing support,
continue to grow and our V8 + ENERGY is growing really nicely. What we have done is we've developed a brand new
campaign, but also we've increased our support around our V8 Red juice. So instead of just promoting the new parts of
the business, we're going back to better balancing of our marketing against the core V8 Red as well as the new veggie
blends and the V8 + ENERGY. And we believe that that is a much better formula for success. We don't expect
beverages to grow next year, but we do expect improved performance.
<Q - Mario Contreras>: Okay. And just a clarification. I think going back to your Analyst Day, you mentioned
something about shifting some consumers from V-Fusion to veggie blends. Should we read into that that you're looking
for V-Fusion to eventually maybe not be eliminated, but just become much less significant? Or, I guess, what did you
mean by that specifically? Thanks.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We do have top selling varieties in the V-Fusion line such as strawberry-banana or
pomegranate-blueberry and some others. And we'll continue to include them in the V8 line. But the consumer will take
us to the flavors that they like, and will repeat. So that's basically how we're playing it.
<Q - Mario Contreras>: Okay. Thank you very much.
