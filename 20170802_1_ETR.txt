Leo P. Denault
Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. We had another productive quarter executing on our strategy to
deliver steady predictable growth and earnings at our core Utility business, which supports our long-term dividend
growth aspiration.
2017 is on pace to be another year with significant accomplishments on multiple fronts that continue to position us to
deliver on our outlooks. Specifically, Louisiana Commission approved the Lake Charles Power Station project. The
Texas Commission approved the Montgomery County Power Station project. Entergy Louisiana filed for approval of
the Washington Parish Energy Center.
The Mississippi and Louisiana Commissions were the first of our jurisdictions to approve deployment of advanced
metering infrastructure. The State of Texas passed legislation that clarifies the applicability of existing advanced meter
regulation to Entergy Texas. And we now have made our formal AMI filing.
Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana filed their annual formula rate plans. The Mississippi Commission approved
Entergy Mississippi's 2017 test year FRP. And finally, Entergy Texas filed a settlement to increase its distribution cost
recovery rider.
In many instances, these results are the product of the strong collaborative efforts between our teams and our regulators
and their staffs for the benefit of our customers. And with these projects, decisions and approvals, more than 85% of
our cumulative capital plan through 2019 is ready for execution from a regulatory approval standpoint.
And more importantly, we continue to manage the effects of our investments and rate actions on our customers. In fact,
in a recent report from S&P Global Market Intelligence, based on data from the Energy Information Administration,
indicates that in 2016 Entergy provided power to its retail customers at the lowest average retail price in the United
States.
Today, we're reporting the Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings per share contributed $1.12 to our consolidated
results for the quarter. These results are in line with our financial plan and they keep us solidly within our full-year
adjusted EPS guidance range for our core Utility, Parent & Other business. At the same time, we are shifting our
Entergy consolidated operational earnings guidance to reflect an income tax item at EWC, which Drew will discuss
further in his remarks.
During the quarter, we continued to demonstrate significant progress to modernize the Utility infrastructure and
enhance its efficiency and reliability for the benefit of our customers. Starting with generation. In June, we received
final approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission to move forward with the construction of the Lake
Charles Power Station in Westlake, Louisiana. This approximately 990-megawatt CCGT is expected to be placed into
service in 2020.
In July, we received final approval from the Public Utility Commission of Texas to build the Montgomery County
Power Station. This too will be an approximately 990-megawatt CCGT, with the same technology as the Lake Charles
Power Station. The plan is expected to be placed into service in 2021.
These projects will contribute to our portfolio transformation efforts to replace older, less efficient plants with new
generation. These new units will use state-of-the-art emission control technology and are highly efficient by capturing
and using waste heat for part of their generation. They are an important part of our strategy to meet our voluntary
commitment to develop an electric system that is well-positioned to operate in a carbon-constrained economy.

Beyond environmental benefits, these projects are also the result of our collaborative work with our stakeholders to
advance economic development in our region. Combined, the Lake Charles and Montgomery County projects are
expected to produce at least $3 billion in net benefits to our customers in Louisiana and Texas through lower
production costs. They're also expected to provide thousands of jobs during construction, and generate over $2 billion
of economic activity for their local communities.
In July, we also filed a supplemental and amending application for the New Orleans Power Station. The application
renewed our request for approval of the originally proposed 226-megawatt combustion turbine, and also presented an
alternative proposal to construct a 128-megawatt unit composed of seven natural gas-fired reciprocating engines. Both
projects offer significant benefits to our customers and provide modern, efficient, [ph] faster (6:23) technology that will
enhance reliability and operational flexibility.
Either resource will aid in restoration efforts following major weather events, which is particularly critical for the City
of New Orleans. In addition, either project would facilitate the adoption of renewables into Entergy New Orleans
portfolio by providing a resource capable of cycling around the intermittency of renewables. Our application also
reaffirms our commitment to pursue up to 100 megawatts of renewables resources.
Finally, in May, we filled for the approval and cost recovery of the Washington Parish Energy Center with the
Louisiana Public Service Commission. This project will benefit customers by adding much needed long-term peaking
and reserve capacity at a cost below that of the comparable new facility. In addition, the project is expected to generate
millions of dollars in economic development, tax revenue and construction jobs for Bogalusa and the surrounding area.
We also invested over $220 million this quarter in our transmission group. These investments, which have now
exceeded $425 million through the first half of the year, are necessary to improve the reliability of our system, reduce
transmission congestion and enable the delivery of additional cost-effective energy, maintain compliance with NERC
standards, and support economic development in our region.
We continue to work with MISO on future transmission projects. The 2017 MTEP planning process is on course and
the MISO board is evaluating our nearly $1 billion plan over the next five years and will make its selection and give
final approval to projects in December. In addition, in September, we will be submitting MTEP 2018 projects for
approval next year.
Turning now to the distribution side of our business. As you know, we made our filings in our jurisdictions, seeking
approval for the deployment of advanced meters and the back-office systems supporting those meters. We continue to
get positive feedback from our stakeholders, and I'm pleased to announce that we've reached significant milestones.
The Mississippi and Louisiana Public Service Commissions were the first of our jurisdictions to approve the
implementation of AMI.
In Texas, legislation was passed that clarifies the applicability of existing advanced meter regulation's utilities outside
of ERCOT. This cleared the path for Entergy Texas to file its AMI deployment plan with the PUCT, which we did in
July. Procedural schedules have been modified in New Orleans and Arkansas to allow additional time for settlement
discussions among the parties, before the next rounds of testimony are filed. And finally, we are moving ahead with the
construction of our back-office systems and testing of the infrastructure ahead of a 2019 start for meter deployment.
We are very pleased with these important developments, particularly in light of the benefits that advanced meters will
provide to our customers. And the follow-on technologies and services they enable will provide new opportunities to
reduce costs and provide our customers greater control and options over their energy usage, in addition to a better
customer experience. We will continue to provide updates on these efforts, which will serve as the foundation for an
integrated energy network and represent a key milestone for the future of our company and our industry.
On the regulatory front, we've carried out our rhythm of formula rate plans and other filings across our jurisdictions. In
Mississippi, the Public Service Commission approved EMI's 2017 FRP filing, with an earned ROE of 9.79%, within
the allowed range, with no change to base rates.

In May, Entergy Louisiana filed its 2016 test year FRP. The earned ROE of 9.84% was within the approved band,
indicating no change to base rates. As a reminder, this marks the last filing under the current three-year formula rate
plan, and we will be working with our commissioners and stakeholders to seek to renew the FRP mechanism with some
adjustment.
Entergy Arkansas filed its 2018 test year FRP in July. The filing indicated an earned ROE of 6.23%, with a projected
deficiency of approximately $130 million. However, our rate adjustment is capped at 4% of total revenue, or around
$70 million. We expect a decision from the commission in the fourth quarter of this year.
In April, we requested that the commission review, in conjunction with this year's FRP filing, the costs from last year's
filing that remain subject to refi. The commission approved our request, and our filing includes further information
supporting the prudence of those costs.
In addition, in Texas, the Governor signed a bill that removed the distribution cost recovery factor's 2019 termination
provision, thereby formally recognizing the DCRF as a permanent ratemaking construct available to Entergy Texas. In
July, Entergy Texas filed a settlement agreement to increase its rider recovery by approximately $10 million. The
DCRF, along with the transmission cost recovery factor, provides greater financial flexibility to support the needs of
our customers in Texas.
From an operational perspective, I would like to highlight that our nuclear organization completed seven refueling
outages this year, which was a significant undertaking. In addition to the actual refueling, we invested over $230
million to complete multiple planned capital projects across the fleet. These were driven by the need to replace
equipment that has reached the end of its useful life, or to proactively replace equipment before it becomes an
operational challenge.
All of these are consistent with the types of project performed at other nuclear fleets, and supports sustained operational
excellence through improved equipment reliability, efficiency, and capacity factors, all to the benefit of our customers
as we work to keep these important resources online for the long-term.
For example, at River Bend, we replaced the analog turbine control system with a modern digital control system. With
analog spare parts no longer available, many of our peers have converted to digital controls or are currently working on
similar conversion projects. This modification has already prevented an automatic shutdown.
We replaced heat exchangers at two units to correct marginal heat removal capability. We replaced turbine blading at
two units to maintain optimum performance, and we made large motor replacements across the fleet. These are just a
few examples of the many projects we are conducting at our plants on an ongoing basis. Some are substantial, while
others are smaller in scope, but all are important to support operational excellence.
As reflected in our accomplishments over the quarter, our execution at the Utility was once again on the mark. Each of
the projects, each of the approvals, each of the decisions, contributes to reduce the risk of our capital plan and
strengthen our ability to deliver our near-term and long-term outlooks.
With critical decisions behind us, our strategy to execute a planned, orderly exit of our merchant business remains on
track. Our employees' dedication to the safe operations of our plants through this transition exemplifies the essence of
our merchant team's determination to finish strong.
Pilgrim successfully completed its final refueling outage. And at Palisades, the commission is scheduled to make its
decision on early termination of the existing PPA at the end of September. As we move towards the complete
wind-down of our merchant operations, we will continue to look for opportunities to divest our nuclear assets post
shutdown for the purposes of decommissioning.
However, if those efforts do not materialize into firm transactions, we are prepared and able to successfully manage the
process from shutdown into dormancy, also known as safe-store, and then to eventual decommissioning decades from
now.

At Entergy, we play a vital role as a corporate citizen in every region where we operate, and our core values are
reflected in our support of our communities. We work hard every day to earn the trust of our customers we serve.
Nowhere are these values more apparent than when our employees go above and beyond to serve our customers during
their most difficult times.
Though our system withstood Tropical Storm Cindy well, our employees remained diligent, and we safely repaired
damaged infrastructure and restored power for those affected. Storm restoration is just one of the many ways our
engaged workforce powers life for all Entergy stakeholders.
We recently received recognition for our civic-minded approach to doing business and our commitment to diversity in
the workplace and organizational health. For the second consecutive year, Entergy Corporation was named to The
Civic 50, a Points of Light initiative honoring the 50 most community-minded companies in the nation.
The Women's Business Enterprise National Council presented Entergy with the America's Top Corporations for
Women's Business Enterprises award. Recipients of the award were celebrated for collectively spending more than $35
billion with companies owned by women. Entergy was recognized as one of the 2017 top workplaces in New Orleans
region, in recognition of Entergy's organizational health.
Furthermore, we remain dedicated to the economic development of our region through our $5 million five-year
workforce development initiative. So far, we've awarded $2.5 million in grants to 25 grantees in Arkansas, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Texas. We will continue to work with state agencies and local communities to promote growth across
our service areas. Our success is dependent on ensuring that the communities we serve and live in are flourished.
In conclusion, our results year-to-date keep us solidly within our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range for our core
Utility, Parent & Other business. 2017 has already been a year of significant accomplishments that position us to
deliver on our outlooks. A large majority of our capital plan through 2019 is ready for execution from a regulatory
approval standpoint and is supported by progressive regulatory mechanisms.
We are making progress toward the improvement of our nuclear operations. And with AMI, we are taking an important
foundational step toward investing in integrated energy network of the future. Technology investments beyond AMI
represent the future of our company and our industry, and will deliver benefits to our customers, and will
fundamentally alter their energy consumption habits.
In the second half of the year, we look forward to continued execution on our strategy to invest in our core Utility
business for the benefit of customers and reduced risk, including the orderly wind-down of our merchant power
business. And we will continue to manage our business to preserve our competitive rates for the benefit of our
customers.
And now, I will turn the call over to Drew.
Andrew S. Marsh
Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start the quarterly financial review with the key takeaways on
slide 4. Starting with our core business on the upper right, Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings were $1.12 per
share, normalizing the effects of weather and income taxes. This result keeps us in the middle of our UPO guidance
range for the year.
Turning to top-left quarter, our consolidated earnings were $3.11 per share on an operational view, flat to a year ago.
Entergy's as-reported earnings per share were $2.27, including special items related to decision to sell or close EWC's
nuclear plants. This quarter special items reduced earnings by $0.84 and included $0.48 for fueling outage and fuel
impairments, $0.22 for capital that was immediately expensed, and $0.14 for severance and retention costs.
Similar to last year, our operational earnings for the quarter reflected tax items, as we previously noted, the potential for
a tax item this year that was not included in our guidance. Therefore, as we communicated last quarter, we are now
shifting our 2017 consolidated operational earnings guidance upward by $2.05 per share to reflect the magnitude of the

tax item, as you can see in the bottom-right corner.
Utility, Parent & Other results are summarized on slide 5. Operational earnings were $1.03 and adjusted earnings were
$1.12. Weather is estimated to have reduced operational earnings by $0.09 in the quarter. On an adjusted view,
earnings were $0.06 lower than second quarter 2016, as higher expenses for nuclear operations, consistent with our
plan, were partly offset by higher net revenue. Net revenue increased from new base rates and riders to recover
productive investments to benefit customers.
Billed retail sales increased on a weather-adjusted basis with growth across all customer classes. In the industrial group,
growth form sales to new and expansion customers came from primary metals, chlor-alkali and industrial gases. The
chlor-alkali segment also contributed to the increase in sales to existing customers. Although billed sales growth for the
quarter was strong, the net revenue effect was more than offset by a decline in unbilled revenue.
Turning to EWC's results on slide 6. Operational earnings were $2.08 in the current period, compared to $1.34 in the
second quarter last year. Both periods include income tax items from elections that, for tax purposes, resulted in
recognition of deductions for decommissioning liability today. These deductions created permanent differences.
Excluding the tax items, EWC's operational earnings would have been $0.01 in each of the periods. Other variances
which offset each other were higher earnings on decommissioning trusts and higher decommissioning expense. EWC
specials are largely on track for the original full-year expectation, with the exception of the income tax benefit in the
first quarter and the [ph] result is (21:18) from the FitzPatrick sale. Our current estimate for special items is $2.05 for
the year.
On slide 7, operating cash flow in the second quarter was $290 million, approximately $430 million lower than a year
ago. While this was unusual, there are a few understandable explanations for the decline. First, as Leo noted, we had a
large number of nuclear refueling outages this quarter at both EWC and Utility plant. Including the cost of the outages
as well as lost revenue at EWC, it's accounted for about 50% of the total decline. We expect to recover these costs
through revenues at EWC and rates at the Utility.
EWC severance and retention payments were approximately $100 million in the quarter, as compared to minimal
payments last year. It's important to note that severance and retention expense is accrued ratably over time, but paid out
at specific milestones such as the completion of refueling outages. These have been considered in our EWC cash flow
outlook.
And most of the remaining change to operating cash flow was in the Utility, which saw a decrease in cash flow due to
the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power cost. We expect these costs to be fully recovered over time. For the
second half of the year, we expect operating cash flow to be higher than last year, making up for a portion of the
current quarter decline.
Now turning to slide 8, we are affirming our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS guidance. While full-year non-fuel
O&M is expected to be favorable to plan, top-line growth is expected to be lower. We now see full-year sales growth a
little higher than 1%, with residential and commercial sales lower at around negative 0.5%, mostly offset by industrial
sales above our original plan.
EWC is expected to come in close to midpoint assumption plus this quarter's income tax item. As I mentioned earlier,
due to the tax item, we shifted the consolidated operational guidance range upward by $2.05 to a midpoint of $7.10.
This means that we are in the same position within our guidance range where we would have been. Driven by negative
$0.25 of weather and year-to-date results, we currently see year-end consolidated operational earnings in the lower end
of the range.
Looking ahead to the second half of the year on slide 9, there are a few key drivers for the next two quarters that I'd like
to highlight in order to bring your expectations in line with ours. For the first half of the year, UPO adjusted earnings
were $0.18 lower than a year ago. Aligning with expectations around the midpoint of our guidance range for the full
year, the second half of this year is anticipated to be about $0.20 higher than last year.

There are non-recurring items in 2016 that will drive a $0.05 decline in third quarter earnings and a $0.10 increase in
the fourth quarter. These include DOE awards and regulatory charges, which we highlighted on our quarterly
consideration slide on the fourth quarter call.
Looking at the business, we expect continued top-line growth, primarily from rate actions, about $0.30 over the
remainder of the year. We will continue to see higher nuclear spending to increase staffing levels to be consistent with
industry norm and execute on projects that will improve reliability. This will decrease earnings about $0.20 in the
second half of the year, with about two-thirds of that coming in the third quarter.
Excluding those items, other non-fuel O&Ms is expected to drive a $0.10 decline in third quarter earnings and a $0.20
increase in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter variance is primarily project-driven, including four planned outages at
natural gas and coal plants in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to only one this year. Bottom line, we expect third
quarter to be below last year and fourth quarter to be above last year.
Moving to the longer-term view on slide 10. Our adjusted UPO outlook remains unchanged. Our expectations,
especially for 2019 and beyond, are firming up with execution on key deliverables such as regulatory approvals for the
Lake Charles Power Station and the Montgomery County Power Station, as well as AMI in Mississippi and Louisiana.
As always, we are working to mitigate near-term risks in sales growth and the pension discount rate, now assumed at
4.5% for 2018 and 2019.
We're also updating our EWC EBITDA outlook on slide 11. Our five-year EBITDA view has come down since last
quarter, due mostly to lower power price curves. The spring outages were also longer than planned, which reduced
EBITDA.
Nonetheless, from an overall cash flow perspective, given changes to EBITDA, capital, working capital, and other
categories, we now see an improvement in EWC's free cash flow through 2021 to slightly positive from about
break-even, excluding any potential contributions to the decommissioning trusts. However, it is still our goal to achieve
a cash-neutral position through the end of operations, including the decommissioning trusts, and that goal remains
achievable.
Our cash and credit metrics are shown on slide 12. We remain committed to solid investment-grade credit ratings. Over
the past few years, and especially in the last 12 months, we've made a significant improvement in our credit risk profile
as we transition to a pure play utility from a hybrid with ongoing merchant risk.
Our parent debt to total debt ratio is currently 20.5%, down from 21.1% a quarter ago. And we remain focused on
optimizing the timing and size of Utility debt issuances to maintain the appropriate equity ratios and the right levels of
cash at each of our businesses.
Our FFO to debt metric has been affected by the operating cash flow drivers previously discussed, and we expect to
finish the year stronger within the targeted range. Our results this quarter keeps on track to achieve our full-year
commitments. We continue to execute on a strategy, focuses on our four key stakeholders and strengthens the
foundation to achieve our steady and predictable growth outlook.
At the same time, we will continue to manage risk throughout the company, including the orderly wind-down of our
merchant business.
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions.

<Q - Praful Mehta>: Thanks very much. Hi, guys.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Hey, Praful.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Morning. So, quickly on nuclear O&M, saw the nuclear O&M was higher the Utility side as
well. Just wanted to understand, is that related with the improvement in nuclear operations? And also wanted to
understand, for Entergy Arkansas, what's the process in terms of recovery of that, or getting that as a part of the regular
proceeding on the regulatory side?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: This is Drew, Praful. And I'll take the first part, and turn it over to Rod for the second part.
So, yes, it is related to the ongoing improvement efforts that we are making within the nuclear organization, and they
are the same dollars that we highlighted last fall at EEI, when we talked about the expectations for spending within the
nuclear business going forward. So they are the same thing.
<A - Roderick K. West>: Hey. Good morning, Praf, it's Rod. And on the process of an NSP recovery and the
Arkansas FRP, the ex parte rules are in effect, that FRP process is undergoing, with an expectation that a December
decision is part of the procedural schedule, discovery is underway. And both the NSP and other costs associated with
Arkansas that drive our point of view on revenue requirements are well-supported by the record.
And so we expect to get resolution, on your question, with NSP by year-end, alongside the rest of Arkansas' operating
costs.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Got you. Thanks. And then, secondly, on the tax part, there was a meaningful, I guess, benefit,
tax deductions on decommissioning liabilities, Drew, that you talked about. Could you just give a little bit more color
of what that is and how – again, I guess, what's the way that you get that benefit?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Well, Praful, essentially, it's an acceleration of the decommissioning liability to become a
deduction today. And the way it happens, it's very similar to the same transaction that we had last year, only a little
larger, because the decommissioning liabilities are larger this year.
There's a lot that goes on in that transaction in addition to the deduction. There are offsetting gains, there are basis
step-ups, there are reserves, but it doesn't all net back to zero, and that's where the earnings comes in.
So we have certainly worked with the IRS. We've worked through external counsel to make sure that we have the
interpretation of the Code correct. And we're comfortable where we are. And I think those are sort of the main drivers.
Just that decommissioning liability recognition is the main driver of the deduction today.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Understood. Thanks, guys.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Turnure of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Christopher James Turnure>: Good morning. Just a follow-up on the last question on the Arkansas FRP. You
said kind of by year-end, you would expect a final decision there. Have you had any conversations with intervenors or
other parties to get an indication as to whether the nuclear cost issue would be settled or agreed upon in this exact
schedule, or if that would get deferred again? And kind of what are you thinking there?
<A - Roderick K. West>: I think one of the reasons I think I stated ex parte rules are in effect is that we're not allowed
to engage at least on the commission staff side of the equation. And so it's early. And I would expect, looking at the
procedural schedule, that we get some indication sometime in the October timeframe as we begin to get our responses
to the positions we've taken from some of the stakeholders.

But everything right now is happening on paper, with RFIs consistent with the procedural schedule, RFIs being request
for information amongst the parties.
<Q - Christopher James Turnure>: Okay. And then transitioning to EWC, you mentioned, Drew, I think that the
multi-year cash flow outlook was slightly positive now versus roughly neutral before, excluding any kind of
decommissioning activity or funding needs. What has really driven that change and kind of has anything changed on
the O&M expense front there specifically?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: A little bit, but that hasn't been the primary driver. Yeah, and we've also been able to reduce
our capital expectations and reduce some of our fuel cost expectations. Those have been probably much bigger drivers
than the O&M side. But those have been offset a little bit by the fall in market prices. So we didn't make as much
progress as we hoped, but it was still enough to say that we are a bit ahead of neutral at this point.
<Q - Christopher James Turnure>: Okay. Great. That's all I had. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about a couple of the regulated
subsidiaries. First of all, in Arkansas, if I understand correctly, you're asking for almost – you're showing that your
revenue requirement request is almost $130 million, but due to the caps you can't actually get that much in the way of
new revenue increases?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yes. Yes.
<A - Roderick K. West>: Yes. That's correct, Michael. Yeah. You have it exactly correct.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: So we should assume that, at least for 2018, there's probably a little bit of under-earning in
Arkansas just due to the ballpark $16 million spread between the two, unless you are somehow able to manage O&M
down or you get above average demand growth?
<A - Roderick K. West>: Michael, it's Rod. I think, directionally, you're right. We expect to get substantially close to
the allowed ROEs by 2019 and beyond, as we work through both the 4% cap and the true-up mechanisms that will take
us through that 2017 and 2018 timeframe. But keep in mind that we affirmed our outlooks. And in doing so, we
contemplated the allowed ROEs and the earnings for Arkansas during that period. So it's consistent.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. And then, in both Louisiana and Mississippi on the electric side, in the formula rate
plan process, you're not asking for revenue increases. Do either of those subsidiaries see the impact of some of the
higher nuclear costs? And if so, why wouldn't those costs kind of flow through and, therefore, you deem recovery of
those expenses?
<A - Roderick K. West>: In Louisiana, we are filing to renew the FRP process that expires with the 2016 test year.
And we're not seeking specific recovery of the nuclear costs outside of the normal ratemaking process. And so, it is
with Mississippi, where Mississippi – despite the fact that we have Grand Gulf sitting in the State of Mississippi, Grand
Gulf is a FERC-regulated facility that's not a part of Mississippi's rate base recovery mechanism. So, Mississippi
recovers their Grand Gulf associated costs through recovery rider.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. And I guess, last thing, you mentioned the Grand Gulf and kind of the FERC oversight
of Grand Gulf. Just curious, what's embedded in guidance for the ongoing rate case or rate complaint that's underway
there?

<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: This is Drew. We have contemplated something different than our expectations or I guess
the current ROE. But we haven't published what that is because we have that ongoing proceeding. But it is baked into
our outlook.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Are you actually currently baking in your earnings numbers? We've seen this in some of the
transmission cases where companies went ahead and started booking for earnings purposes a lower ROE. Are you
actually still booking the original ROE for SERI or are you booking something lower than that due to the complaint?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: We're booking something lower, Michael. We're not booking the full amount at this point.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Okay, guys. Thank you. Much appreciated.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Morning, Shar.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Morning.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: So let me just ask on the decommissioning activities in the sale process. It's been going on
for some time. Can you just maybe elaborate on sort of the interest level there and what the process looks like? Are you
still looking at Pilgrim, Palisades and potentially Indian Point? Or is this just as simple as saying NorthStar hasn't made
an announcement and that you expect it to make something where you're at. Just a little bit of color on that process
would be good.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Sure, Shar. We're continuing to work down the path on that front. So, that is still a key
objective for us. But as we talked about on the call last quarter, it's a pretty involved process. And as we've gone along
in Vermont, Vermont has been very engaged on the discovery process. It's been more than probably we were all
anticipating in terms of the volume of information, but we continue to believe that we are making good progress on
that.
But because of the engagement level and the processes likely going to be a little bit slower than what we anticipated,
we don't think it'll change our expectations on a close day because we weren't planning to close until the end of 2018
anyway. But it's slowing down the regulatory process. And in turn, that's slowing down our expectations for where we
might go with Pilgrim and Palisades, and ultimately Indian Point.
So we are thinking about that and we're working down those paths, but these are first-of-a-kind transactions and they're
probably taking us a little longer than anticipated, but they're still an objective for us.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the same topic. It's good to see that you're
modestly cash flow-positive here, despite the dollar moving on the power curves. But do you expect that if there is a
sale process with the remaining three assets from the decommissioning activities that it would have a material impact to
the cash flow trajectory of that business?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: We are assuming some cash in our current outlooks to be used for that purpose. And so I
don't know that it should have a material change in our outlook. But that process remains to be seen. What we have out
there is based on our expectations for the decommissioning costs, not necessarily a third-party. So there could be a little
bit difference.

And we are aiming through these processes to try and bring our expectation down a little bit. So we do have something
built into our outlooks already, particularly it's going to be reflected mostly in that parent debt to total debt number. But
I don't know that we have an expectation at this point to be too materially different than that.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering. Your line is open.
<Q - Neel Mitra>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Morning, Neel.
<Q - Neel Mitra>: Just had a quick question on scheduling with the Arkansas FRP. I believe the procedural schedule
had a final decision sometime in January and, I guess, you guys are assuming that you're going to get something in
December. Just wanted to understand the discrepancy and when you think that could ultimately play out and if it
actually matters if it's in January versus December?
<A - Roderick K. West>: This is Rod. We had the procedural schedule with a hearing and the decision in December
that where the rate adjustment would take place in January.
<Q - Neel Mitra>: Oh, okay. So the final decision would come in December and then the actual range change...
<A - Roderick K. West>: The actual rate impact or adjustment would be made at the beginning of the year.
<Q - Neel Mitra>: Okay. Great. And then could you kind of remind me on a rough percentage level the nuclear
sustainability plan? In each jurisdiction, how involved it is, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, et cetera?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: This is Drew. I think the easiest way to think about it, and I don't know we have any updated
disclosures around it, but it's almost by site. You have two units in Arkansas. You have two units in Louisiana. And
then you have Grand Gulf, which is in SERI and then sort of allocated amongst a few of utilities. So I think that's
probably the easiest way to think about it, Neel.
<Q - Neel Mitra>: Now are there some sites that are going to require more capital spending and O&M than others or,
for our purposes, should we kind of just weight it equally?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: I think it's weighted more or less equally. There aren't any – and we have sort of like digital
controls and condenser-type projects in most of them. And so there's not a project or a plan in particular that has a very
large capital expectation.
And then the O&M, it's pretty much the same increase. It's pretty much the same across each unit.
<Q - Neel Mitra>: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Thank you.

<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: I'm just curious, I mean, one of your fellow utilities that I think overlaps with you in
several states, just announced a major rate base wind project. I'm curious whether you think that's something that might
be an opportunity for Entergy, or something along those lines?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Jonathan, obviously, like everyone else, we're watching what's happening with the price points
in renewables, storage, new technologies. We've deployed renewables from a solar standpoint, which is more
applicable in our service territory, if it's going to be sourced in our service territory, without a lot of transmission
infrastructure to come in. And as I mentioned, as part of our New Orleans filing, we have also made a commitment for
100 megawatts renewables there.
We see them playing a bigger role in our strategy going forward. The majority of what we add in the future will be
natural gas and then transitioning into renewables, and then other technologies as they become cost-competitive. Big
wind farms like that, for us, we haven't found any that make a lot of sense. Wouldn't rule it out but right now, our focus
is probably on smaller, more targeted projects within the footprint of our service territory itself.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. And then, separate topic. I think, Leo, you mentioned MISO in the planning
process in your prepared remarks. And I'm not sure, did you indicate that you thought there might be some incremental
opportunities coming out of that, or should we think about that as being within the context of the current plan?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: It's most likely in the context of the current plan.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you, Jonathan.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Yeah. Hi. Good morning.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Morning, Steve.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Just a quick question on the quarter. I think there were a lot of nuclear outage days in the
quarter. Should we view that as primarily being doing the work on the nuclear sustainability plan or operational issues?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yeah. I'll let Chris give some color, but I will say, it's probably a little bit of both. The
biggest outage I think we had at EWC was related to the [indiscernible] (46:22) but then there was a lot of work that
went on with the nuclear strategic plan in the Utility.
<A - A. Christopher Bakken>: Yes. Steve, I'd characterize it the same way. This is Chris. The seven outages were
planned normal refueling outages and in those outages, we do take some extra time to improve the safety and the
reliability of the plant. So it's a combination of the two.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. And then, Drew, at the end of your comments, you mentioned that, and please
re-characterize this. I think you said you kind of better firmed up with these plan approvals to 2019 and beyond outlook
for Utility, Parent & Other, but then noted some pressures, I thought on 2018, from sales and pension.
Could you just give a little more color there, and what should we expect at EEI this year? You're going to give some of
the drivers like you normally do?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Sure. We'll probably come out with the same type of drivers that we typically do, Steve. The
2019 and beyond comment was, I think, analogous to what Leo was talking about with continued execution on the
major capital projects that are going to lead us into the future, in terms of rate base growth. And so our earnings growth
should follow that rate base growth over time.

But any given period, what I wanted to say was, we always have risks around, both positive and negative, for sales
growth and pension. The pension risk I highlighted at 4.5%, we might be 25 basis points below that right now, so $0.05
to $0.10 of risk for 2018 sitting there, and then, kind of using the rule of the thumb, probably the same kind of risk or
opportunity on sales right now.
So, I just want to make sure that everybody is aware that those risks on a near-term basis are always out there. But, over
a couple of cycles and the regulatory process, those should smooth out, and the main driver is, over the long-term,
going to be the capital growth in our rate base.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. And pardon me if I missed this, but I know
that you continue to say, as you did in the first quarter, that you're doing better on O&M relative to the baseline
expectation and guidance. Can you refresh our memories, specifically, what areas you're doing better than budget?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: This Drew, Greg. So the main areas where we have been doing better are in Utility-related.
I'm talking about year-to-date. There a little bit difference on second half of the year, because some of it's
project-driven.
But the main things year-to-date have been expectations around, primarily our power generation business, it was
primarily our fossil generation. We have been able to operate at lower costs year-to-date there and capture some of that.
And we've also seen some lower insurance costs. We were anticipating lower insurance costs this year, but some of the
premiums have come in even better than what we were anticipating. So, that's been helping out. And those are things
that we would continue to expect to see through the balance of the year.
Some of the other pieces are timing-related costs that we thought we were going to spend, like, the second quarter, but
they are now in the third quarter, that kind of thing. And those we are anticipating in the second half of the year, as part
of what I laid out. But the main things have been in our power generation business, not including nuclear, and in some
of our traditional sort of overhead costs.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Thank you.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thanks, Greg.

Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Your line is open.
<Q - Charles Fishman>: Thank you. Leo, I believe you said that industrial sales are ahead of plan year-to-date. Can
you give a little more color as far as long-term? I mean, are you still pretty bullish on industrial sales and what growth
rate are you continuing to look at? I know you talked a lot about that in the past.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yeah. Actually Drew said it. So I'll let him start.

<Q - Charles Fishman>: Works for me.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: And it works for me too because Drew is a smarter guy than I am. So I appreciate the
compliment.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: So, Charles, the industrial growth expectation is that we'll continue on for the next few
years, although in 2018 we are anticipating a slight slowdown to the industrial growth. And that's because one of the –
or actually a couple of the main drivers for 2018 growth, those projects have been delayed and are now expected to
come online in 2019. And they were pretty large customers.
So, while we still are expecting large growth over the next few years comparable to what we are expecting this year, on
average it's going to be a little off-centered, a little less than 2018, probably a little bit more in 2019.
<Q - Charles Fishman>: So, going forward, lumpy. But you're still seeing that same growth trajectory in the
Mississippi Delta, correct?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: That's correct. For the next couple of years, next few years.
<Q - Charles Fishman>: Okay.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Once you get out beyond like 2021, it's a little murkier because when you're talking about
these large industrial customers, you can usually see them coming a couple of years out. And so we're basing our
industrial growth based on those large customers being added to the system. And beyond that, it's harder to see because
they're not yet reaching their financial decision points in order to make decision to go forward.
<Q - Charles Fishman>: Okay. That was all I had. Thank you.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thanks, Charles.
