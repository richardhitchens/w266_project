Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings
per share from continuing operations excluding charges and credits, was $1.35. This represents an increase of $0.06
sequentially, and is $0.31 higher when compared to same quarter last year. During the quarter, we recorded a $0.09
charge relating to a provision of accounts receivable, in connection with a client in Brazil who filed for bankruptcy in
the quarter.
Fourth quarter revenue of $11.9 billion increased 2.6% sequentially. Of this $298 million sequential increase, the vast
majority came from the year-end surge in software, product, and multi-client sales that we typically experience in a Q4.
Oilfield services pre-tax income of $2.6 billion increased 4.3% sequentially. Pre-tax operating margin increased by 37
basis points, to 21.9%, largely due to the positive effects of the previously mentioned seasonal year-end sales.
Sequential revenue and pre-tax margin highlights by quarter two were as follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir
Characterization group revenue of $3.2 billion increased 1%, while margin improved 132 basis points to 31.7%. These
increases were driven by traditionally strong end of year software and multi-client sales, offset in part, by the seasonal
decline in WesternGeco marine activity and inclusion of several higher margin exploration projects. Drilling group
fourth quarter revenue of $4.5 billion increased 1.9%, while margin declined by 69 basis points to 19.6%. The revenue
increase was largely attributable to robust M-I SWACO and IPM activity in the Middle East and Asia area, while the
margin decline was finally due to an over less favorable revenue mix.
Fourth quarter Production group revenue of $4.2 billion increased 4.8% as a result of robust Completion and Artificial
Lift product sales, and pre-tax margin declined by 27 basis points to 17.3%. As the impact of strong results from our
Schlumberger production management projects and end-of-year product sale was more than offset by continued pricing
pressure in U.S. land.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 22.3% in the fourth
quarter, compared to 22.7% in the previous quarter. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $4.4 billion, representing an
improvement of $1.2 billion, as compared to end of Q3. Most notably, we spent almost $1.1 billion on our stock
buyback program during the quarter.
We repurchased 11.9 million shares, at an average price of $89.67 during the quarter. In addition, during the quarter,
we took advantage of the low interest rate environment by issuing $1.5 billion of 3.65% 10-year notes, and €500
million 1.5% 5-year notes.
Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.2 billion of CapEx, and an improvement in working
capital of approximately $1.2 billion. We were quite pleased with our working capital performance during the quarter.
From a cash flow perspective, we generated approximately $10 billion of cash flow from operation during all of 2013.
This strong cash generation has allowed us to continue to invest in growth opportunities, which we did it by completing
various acquisitions and investments in other companies, most significantly our investment in OneSubsea, and
investing $4.3 billion in CapEx from multi-client, while at the same time, returning $3.2 billion of cash to our
shareholders in the form of dividends and the stock repurchases during the year.
During the full year 2013, we repurchased 31.3 million shares at an average price of $82.82, for a total of $2.6 billion,
while paying out $1.6 billion in dividend.
As it relates to 2014, CapEx is expected to be approximately $3.8 billion in 2014, as compared to the $3.9 billion we
spent in 2013. We expect the EPR for the full year 2014 to be in the low to mid-20s. However, this can vary on a
quarterly basis depending on the geographical mix of earnings.
Yesterday, our board of directors approved a 28% increase in our annual dividend to $1.60 per share. This follows last
year's 13.6% increase, and increases of 10% in 2012, and 19% in 2011. This new level of dividend reflects our
confidence in our ability to deliver this growth and, at the same time, generate superior cash flows and return excess
cash to our shareholders. And now, I turn the conference over to Paal.

Paal Kibsgaard
Thank you, Simon. Our fourth quarter results, which ended a very successful year for Schlumberger, were driven by
continued growth in the underwriting activity, as well as strong year-end product sales, partly offset by the temporary
shutdown of operations in South Iraq in November, and the expected seasonal slowdown in our businesses in North
America, Russia, and China.
Fourth quarter multi-client seismic sales were slow in the first few months of the quarter, but we saw very strong sales
in December driven by high demand for the latest surveys in our library, which are based on our unique acquisition and
processing technologies. Sequentially, overall revenue was up 3%, with top line growth posted in all four operating
areas, while pre-tax operating margins expanded by 37 basis points to reach 21.9%. Compared to the same quarter last
year, pre-tax operating income was up 23%.
New technology sales remained strong in all three product groups, and this, together with further market share gains, as
well as focused execution and cost control, contributed positively to the quarter's results.
For the third quarter in a row, we also posted commendable sequential incremental margins, this time at 36%, while we
generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow, boosted by our ongoing efforts to improve asset utilization and reduce
consumption of working capital.
Our international business progressed well in the fourth quarter, with revenues tapping an all time high, exceeding $8
billion, and representing a year-over-year growth of 8%. At the same time, year-over-year margins expanded by 349
basis points, to reach 23.5%, which is only around 350 basis points below the previous [ph] hype (09:42) of peak
recorded in Q3 of 2008.
Sequentially, international revenue was up 3% and margins expanded by 23 basis points. In terms of pricing, the
international market continues to be highly competitive and we are not seeing any signs of a general pricing inflection.
Still the current market conditions suit us well, as we are able to drive our effective pricing upwards through strong
new technology sales by commanding a premium on our execution capabilities as well as from the growing demand for
integrated services. These factors are also reflected in our revenue per rig pricing indicator which in 2013 grew by 5%
over the previous year.
In Latin America, revenue was up 3% sequentially while margins expanded by 59 basis points to reach 21.2%.
Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue was down 3% while pre-tax operating income was up 13%, driven by
excellent margin improvement in the region in spite of the market headwinds faced in several key countries. The
sequential results were driven by strong performances in Ecuador where the Shushufindi SPM project continues to
exceed expectations, by Argentina where we are active in the shale related work in Vaca Muerta, and by Mexico where
we saw strong activity on land.
In Mexico, the energy reform was signed in December and we expect the first license round to be held late 2014, with
the earliest impact on our activity in 2015. The early indication from the PEMEX [ph] mega standard (11:27) which
were submitted and opened earlier this week are very positive for us, suggesting a solid gain in market share.
In Venezuela, activity was flattish in the fourth quarter after solid growth in Q3. Our working relationship with
Televisa is excellent and we continue to receive payments in line with the agreement we signed in May last year, so we
plan to further ramp up activity in the country in 2014.
In Brazil, the business environment remains difficult with lower activity in the fourth quarter for Petrobras as well as
the local independents and the international oil companies. We have adjusted our cost base in the country and are
prepared to manage what appears to be a challenging 2014 before activity growth likely resumes in 2015.
In the Middle East and Asia, revenue grew 5% sequentially while margins were flat at 26.1%. On a year over year basis
revenues increased 18% while margins were up by 404 basis points. In the Middle East sequential growth was driven
by Saudi Arabia, where we continue to move in resources to keep pace with the additional work we are taking on, and

by the United Arab Emirates where activity is at a record high following our recent contract. In Iraq our activity is back
to normal following the shutdown in November linked to the security incident in our Rumaila base. We received
excellent support from the local and central authorities during and after the incident, and in 2014 we see strong growth
in North Iraq while activity in the South will likely remain flattish in the first half of the year.
Asia also posted strong sequential results driven by seismic activity in Malaysia and land and offshore activity in
Australia. In China, we signed a strategic cooperation agreement with CNPC during the fourth quarter and we continue
to ramp up activity on our tight gas SPM project with Yanchang Petroleum in the Ordos basin.
In Europe, CIS, and Africa revenue was up 1% sequentially while margins were essentially flat. On a year-over-year
basis revenues grew 9% and margins were up 298 basis points. Russia and Central Asia was again a major contributor
to the results, posting a strong quarter both in terms of revenue and operating margins in spite of the seasonal
headwinds on land. Going into 2014, we are continuing to invest actively in the region and we see strong growth
potential going forward.
In the fourth quarter we also saw solid growth in Angola driven by both deepwater exploration and development work,
while activity in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa was down sequentially due to reschedules and operational delays as
well as lower exploration activity in some of the frontier countries.
In the North Sea, we see expected seasonal impact on activity driven by winter weather and the end of the [ph] seismic
(14:37) season, while in North Africa business continues to be challenging due to rig and operational delays as well as
ongoing security challenges.
Looking at the 2014 outlook for the Europe and Africa region, we still expect growth to be driven by sub-Saharan
Africa and to a certain extent the North Sea while we expect the ongoing challenges in North Africa and Continental
Europe to continue in the coming year.
In North America, we posted a solid quarter with revenue up 1% sequentially while margins were down 67 basis points
to 19.6% driven by the expected seasonal impact. On a year-over-year basis revenues grew 7% and margins were up 46
basis points. In the Gulf of Mexico, deepwater activity remained high in the fourth quarter and the offshore rig count is
expected to show strong growth also in 2014. In the land market activity was solid with a fourth quarter U.S. rig count
remained flat sequentially while the seasonal activity recovered in Canada stayed in line with 2012 levels.
The main challenge in the North American land market is still in pricing, and we saw further downwards pricing
pressure in most product lines in the fourth quarter partly amplified by the renegotiation and rollover on several key
contracts. In hydraulic fracturing, we continue to gain share in the fourth quarter driven by new technology sales and
operational efficiency and we took the opportunity to add another frac fleet to our operations in addition to the 4 fleets
we added in Q3.
During the quarter, we progressed further on the Sea testing of our new fracturing diversion technology and we have
now tested the technology in both new and existing wells with very promising production results. The result from these
field tests together with the series of other fleet experiments we have conducted over the past 12 months have led us to
two clear conclusions. First that high precision fracturing, where we ensure that each perforation cluster is properly
addressed holds clear upside production potential for the industry as a meaningful percentage of the preparation clusters
today are not effectively fractured. And second the fracking fluids, which enables the control of solid settling within the
fracture can allow more of the fracture to be effectively propped and thereby further enhance the production from the
well. To address these opportunities we will introduce in the coming quarters the broadband family of fracturing
services which would include new engineered tube systems and corresponding hardware completion solutions. We are
very excited by the production enhancement potential of these technologies and will share more information as we
complete the remaining field tests and commercialization milestones.
Another market we are focusing on in North America land due to a significant growth potential is the Artificial Lift
market. In line with what we have in the past quarters we have acquired a number of [indiscernible ] (17:44) companies
covering the key liquid producing shale basins in the U.S. and Canada. We will now combine the offering from these
strong basins specific companies with our existing Artificial Lift business in North America land to provide a life of

well lift solution to our customers using our production engineering expertise and extensive monitoring and data
integration capabilities.
Let's now take a few minutes to summarize our full year 2013 results and achievements before we turn to the 2014
outlook. In terms of financial performance, 2013 was a very strong year for us where we continue to outperform our
competitors in terms of top line growth, margin expansion, earnings per share growth and free cash flow generation.
The results were driven by strong new technology sales and a relentless focus on flawless execution and constant
resource management throughout our organization. Building on this, we also laid out a multi-year plan detailing how
we will further control the quality and efficiency of our global operations and how to best leverage the significant
advantage of our size.
And finally we made a number of strategic moves to strengthen our business portfolio including the OneSubsea JV
with Cameron, the [indiscernible] (19:01) acquisitions in North America land and investments in new SPM projects
covering both North America shale liquids and China price gaps. While these achievements are now clearly in the past,
they serve as a demonstration of our ability to formulate and execute plans that drive our company forward and should
also include confidence in our ability to continue the current trend of financial outperformance.
Let's now turn to the outlook for 2014 where we expect the global economy to continue to improve building on the
positive data points seen in the past quarters and translating into both a higher GDP growth rate and higher growth in
global oil demand compared to 2013. Correspondingly we also expect the global oil market to be well supplied in the
coming year, driven by continued growth in North American liquids production, leaving supply and demand relatively
well balanced with spare capacity excluding Libya in the range of four million barrels per day and with continued
support for crude price around $100 per barrel.
The international gas market is also expected to remain stable supported by a strong demand in Asia and improving
demand in Europe. In the U.S., the Brazilian production levels and strong competition with coal indicate that a
meaningful recovery in dry gas drilling activity continues to be pushed out in time, although recent storage withdrawal
levels have been higher than previous years driven by the cold weather. In terms of total E&P spend, we expect
investment levels to grow around 6% in 2014 with North American growth somewhat below this level and international
growth somewhat above.
We further see well related E&P spend growing at a faster rate than the total E&P spend in the coming year indicating a
shift away from heavy infrastructure projects which we see as a net positive for us. Translating this macro picture into
activity in North America we expect strong growth in the Gulf of Mexico driven by influx of additional deepwater rigs.
And on land in North America we expect solid growth and activity but further pricing pressure will likely have some
impact on how much of this activity growth is translated into revenue and margin progression.
In the international markets, we expect growth in Latin America to be led by Argentina, Ecuador and Venezuela. In
[ph] ETAs (21:31) main growth markets will again be sub-Saharan Africa and Russia, while in [ph] NEA (21:35)
global will be spearheaded by Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and China. Overall, we remain positive and
optimistic with respect to the coming year, as we again aim to post solid double digit growth in earnings per share. Cue
firstly by further market share gains on the back of our new technology. And, secondly, by our ability to generate
superior incremental margins to the cost and resource efficiencies of our execution.
In terms of how 2014 will unfold, we expect the second and third quarters to again show the strongest sequential
growth, while the first quarter, similar to previous years, will see a decline in earnings and margins due to the normal
seasonal slowdown and lower products and multi-client sales. We are all proud of the progress we have made over the
past several months, and our entire organization is ready and motivated to further improving our achievements in the
coming year.
That concludes my remarks, but before we open up for questions, I would like to make a brief announcement. After
more than six years in charge of Investor Relations, Malcolm Theobald will, on February 1, take on a new role in the
company as President of our Drillbit business. I would like to take the opportunity to thank Malcolm for his support

Thank you, Paal. John, we'll now take questions.
Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] and first go to the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Thank you very much, and congrats with the very well executed quarter.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you, Ole.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Thank you, Ole.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: You've made a big push and emphasis on returns on capital and capital efficiency of your
previous two quarterly calls in particular. And we can see the results now, some pretty strong free cash flow, as a
percentage both of sales and EBITDA. But can you talk just a little bit through how much more efficiency is there to
squeeze out of the system now? Because you seem to have come quite a long way already.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, as you see from our numbers, as you pointed out, we have stepped up our focus on cash
generation this year. We have put a lot more emphasis in that throughout the entire management team and it's starting
to pay off. Now in the first three quarters of 2013, we generated around $3 billion of free cash flow, and in Q4 alone,
we generated $2.5 billion on top of that, which is a new quarterly record, right. So the key drivers are simple. It's
management focus on working capital and asset utilization, and we are going to continue to go forward with that into
2014.
We indicated that CapEx for next year is going to be around $3.8 billion, and with continued growth in the top line and
the bottom line, I'm optimistic that we can further step up the generation of free cash flow. In terms of how we manage
that cash flow, Simon, maybe you want to mention a few things on that.
<A - Simon Ayat>: So, Ole, basically, if you look at our cash flow generation, the last couple of years, we suffered a
bit from the increase in working capital, with the increase in working capital, as we mentioned before, was our way of
setting up all the smooth acquisition that we made, in order to distribute the product further worldwide. The current
performance that you've seen is back to normal, and I think we will continue to be performing very well, as far as the
working capital efficiency. And as Paal mentioned, we finally got to a point where our CapEx, as a percentage of
revenue, at the manageable level, and I think the cash flow generation will continue to be strong, as you have seen it in
2013.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: And what is it in your business that gives you confidence that you can take CapEx down while
your revenue is increasing? That's something which sort of no other company has historically been able to do.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: By coming down to some of elements that we have, because around the internal
transformation, there's a lot of focus and a lot of things we are doing to drive asset efficiency or asset utilization that
revolves around better sharing between locations, quicker turnaround in maintenance, and a better transportation
network set-up as well. So yes, we are going to continue to grow in 2014 and we are taking CapEx slightly down, and I
think I'm quite comfortable with the investment laterals we are making. India land growth will be higher than what we
anticipate. We have the option of further increasing CapEx, but as of now, the $3.8 billion number that I'm indicating,
I'm quite comfortable with it.

<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Just a little more clarification, Paal. You didn't sound particularly upbeat about general pricing
trends either in North America or international for commodity and the type services. Yet you highlight that in your
case, if I heard you correctly, you had a 5% positive pricing indicator because of technology and IPM. Could you
elaborate a little bit on exactly what you mean by that?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, the revenue for rate indicator is basically the total revenue we generate per unit rate
activity, and by viewing more revenue per rate, obviously that helps. But also, by substituting existing basic
technologies with new technologies, where we command a pricing premium, that basically helps drive that indicator
up. So on average in 2013, that revenue per unit pricing indicator grew by 5% over 2012, which obviously helps both in
the top line and on the bottom line.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: You also highlighted the higher price contracts rolling off. How do you see 2014 kind of the
headwind there and a tailwind on your technology and ability to push more value through your product offering?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: If you look at 2013, it's one of the highest years we've had in new technology sales, both in
new technologies that were introduced over the past years, which we track very closely, and also the technologies that
were introduced over the past five years, which we also track very closely. So we have a number of new technologies
that came on in 2013, and a similar number is not even higher coming up in 2014. So we will continue to leverage what
we have introduced in the past year, and also augment that with a significant number of new technologies coming out
in 2014. So I'm quite positive and optimistic that through the new technology introductions, we can continue to drive
the effective pricing up. Now big contracts like, for instance, we saw in Mexico recently is going to continue to be bid
quite aggressively and competitively on the basic pricing, but by having a number of new technologies that we're
introducing, we should be able to continue to improve that revenue per unit pricing indicator.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Sounds good, Paal. I'll hand it back. Thank you very much.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you, Ole.
Operator
Our next question's from Michael LaMotte, with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Kirk Lamotte>: Thank you. Good morning. Malcolm, congratulations on the new role. We'll miss you,
but I'm sure this is a good move for you.
<A - Malcolm Theobald>: Thanks, Michael; appreciate it.
<Q - Michael Kirk Lamotte>: Paal, can I follow up on the comment that you made about the new technology on the
fracturing side? You commented that the lesson of two things. One, just fracture stage effectiveness, and two, I guess,
sand propagation, but the technology platform that's looking to be rolled out this year looks to be more than just fluids,
involving hardware, et cetera. Can you expand upon that?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I think we will wait with further commentary on the broadband family until we have
completed the field testing and the commercialization milestones. The two things I mentioned around high precision
fracturing, where we try to address each perforation cluster, as well as having fluids which better controls the solid
coupling. There will be technologies in this family that will address those. There might be some other things as well,
but we'll talk about that when we have firmed up the field testing and we are ready to roll it out.
<Q - Michael Kirk Lamotte>: Okay, but it's fair to assume at this point that it really is sort of an end-to-end solution
as opposed to a single point solution, the way highway was introduced. Is that a fair characterization?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: That is fair to assume, yes.
<Q - Michael Kirk Lamotte>: Okay, great. And Simon, quick one for you. The working capital, frankly, I've never
seen a $45 billion revenue company use almost no working capital over the course of 12 months. First of all,

congratulations on that. Second of all, is that something we can expect to continue in 2014? And what have been the
major levers that have brought that about this year?
<A - Simon Ayat>: So as I mentioned -- thanks, Michael, for the comment, first of all -- But as I mentioned, the last
couple years, we were gearing up the acquisition of Smith in terms of strengthening the level of inventories, et cetera.
So it's consumed more than normal in terms of working capital. The working capital performances here obviously
resulted also from collecting and improving our receivable performance.
Going forward, it should be back to normal. It should be less than the previous two years, but I cannot promise you it
[ph] will beat (32:00) the performance of this year, or [indiscernible] (32:01) that we'll maintain it, but growth always
consume a bit of working capital. So you can assume it will be back to normal. Not the level of the last couple years'
consumption. And it will continue to be efficient because the entire organization is basically focused on sharply to
improve the working capital performance.
<Q - Michael Kirk Lamotte>: Okay. So when you say back to normal, I mean, it's still 1% of revenue plus or minus?
<A - Simon Ayat>: That would be, yes, more or less the case.
<Q - Michael Kirk Lamotte>: Okay, great. Thanks. I'll turn it back.

Next we go to David Anderson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Anderson>: Yeah. Hey, Malcolm, same here. Congratulations on your new role. I can understand why
you're so chipper this morning -- have to deal with us anymore. So best of luck there.
<A - Malcolm Theobald>: Thanks, David.
<Q - David Anderson>: So Paal, you were talking about your expectation for about, I think I believe I heard 6% kind
of overall E&P spend, guidance of earnings up double digits. Can you talk a bit about how much that earnings
improvement in 2014 is going to be related to the internal transformation on the efficiency and the asset turns?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well. If you look at the solid double digit growth in earnings per share, it's going to be a
combination of the two, [ph] Brian (33:17). So we aim to grow our top line faster than the growth in E&P spend. This
is going to be driven by new technology, which we just talked about, but also the quality of our service and our
integration capabilities. But we also aim to continue to expand margins even in a challenging pricing environment,1
[ph] Brian (33:36). That is going to be driven by our execution efficiency and our ongoing transformation program. So
how much is going to come from each, we obviously have a very clear view on. I'm not going to go into details of it,
but I think both of them will be very good contributors
<Q - David Anderson>: In your outlook, I was curious, the market has been focused on some of the IOCs having some
budget cuts out there, I mean Total and Shell. Some of the other IOCs, their cuts have been feeding into really market
concerns about offshore and development spending. Can you help us put this into perspective a bit? I heard you say
about the infrastructure, but can you talk about how that's looking right there in terms of their pure upstream spending?
And maybe kind of collectively, would you think that the offshore spending would be up, at least mid-single digits? It
just seems like we're hearing kind of different stories in different parts of the market.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah. If you look at the comment I made on total E&P spend, this is expected to be around
6%, and that's really based on the third-party service, right, the average of that. They're all coming in around that level.
Within the 6%, as I said, we see international growth somewhat low to the 6% and [ph] NAM (34:41) will somewhat
below.

But now while the industry focus is on the total E&P spend, what is really driving our business is the well-related E&P
spend. So we actually have our own spend model, which is entirely focused on well-related E&P spend. And this is a
global model and it's based on well count, well type, well cost, by customer, by country, where we do a complete
roll-out, as part of our planning process, and this model suggests that the well-related spend will grow faster than the
6%, and that's really what I'm basing my comments on.
Within that outlook, offshore and deepwater continues to look solid. So -- and in this model, the variation in spend
growth from the super majors, to the IOCs, to the independents, and the NOCs is all part of this. So in these comments,
those variations are not captured.
<Q - David Anderson>: Great. Thank you, Paal.

Our next question is from Brad Handler, Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Thanks. Good morning, all.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning, Brad.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Good morning.
<Q - Brad Handler>: If I could I guess follow up on that, but perhaps you can give us some perspective, because part
of what I think has raised concern among the investment community is the lack of contracts recently for deepwater rigs,
for example. Casting somewhat of a shadow on the what have been a fairly obvious trajectory for deepwater activity
growth. Do you have any thoughts on the nature of that? And then presumably, there is a release of a lot of the
contracts that you would envision happening soon?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, the first one, we saw strong growth from deepwater activity in 2013, and we expect to
see also solid growth in 2014. But as you point out, the drilling activity and the reschedules within productivity
impacted by some of these ongoing commercial discussions, there's a number of rig contracts coming up for
renegotiation, as you indicate, and also some of the new arrivals do not yet have contracts. But the recontractors that
we've talked to seem confident that the new rigs will be contracted basically because of the higher operating efficiency
that they have. But the contract discussions could have an impact on the day rates for the older generation rig right
now. We have factored these elements again into our outlook, so we are not overly worried about what that would
mean from an operational perspective for us.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Understand, okay. Maybe it's a related follow-up, maybe it isn't. But the conversation has shifted
to sort of the overall level of spending from what had been a mix conversation a little bit ago, but I wouldn't mind
coming back to the mix of exploration versus development. In your modeling, as you see 2014 playing out, so a
two-part question. First, is there a discernible mix that you look for? And then, in a sense, the second part of the
question is, does it matter? As we look at some of your what I think are some of your higher margin businesses on the
exploration side, if there is to be a move away from that, how much and you mentioned seismic in your or seismic was
mentioned by your colleague earlier, how much does any of that matter, that mix shift, if you see it coming, for 2014?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Basically, we have a very broad and well balanced portfolio. So these shifts, they might have a
small impact, but overall, I'm not overly worried about that going into 2014. With respect to exploration, we still see
growth in exploration in 2014. It's going to be lower than the roughly 10% growth that we saw in 2013, but still decent
growth. Now in terms of the nature of the growth in exploration, we expect this to be more well-related again. So we
are pretty clear that the flattening of the seismic spend is happening. There's been a lot of data acquired in recent years,
so the growth in exploration is going to be more well-related than exploration-related, and what that means is that, it's a
more challenging environment for WesternGeco, it still bodes well for our wireline, well testing, and drilling product
line. So for us, it goes up in the balance.

And next we go to James West with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - James C. West>: Hey, good morning, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - James C. West>: And Malcolm, congratulations from me, as well.
<A - Malcolm Theobald>: Thanks, James.
<Q - James C. West>: So Paal, I think we've kind of beat up the E&P spend numbers globally and it's clear that you
guys intend to grow faster than that 6%. Maybe if I turn to one of the markets that I guess has been more troubling for
the industry, which is North America. We're looking at least at some acceleration or some increase in spend in North
America, pricing obviously still weakish. But do you think with this pickup in activity that's envisioned, you'll be at a
point where these product lines that have been out of balance can start to come back into balance and maybe pricing is
no longer that much of a concern?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, we would like for that to happen. But if you refer to the fracking or hydraulic fracturing,
there's still today significant industry overcapacity of horsepower, so at this stage we do not expect the market to reach
equilibrium in 2014. Now, in terms of activity for North America, we expect solid growth in activity on land in 2014. A
lot of this is still going to be driven by further improvements in drilling and fracking efficiency. And as I mentioned in
my prepared remarks, we do not see any significant comeback in dry gas activity either, so if you look at the trends we
saw in 2013, I think they are continuing into 2014 and in North America land, so it's going to be I think more of the
same.
<Q - James C. West>: Okay, okay. Fair enough. And then maybe, perhaps an unrelated follow-up but talking about
your technology pipeline, it sounds like there's an acceleration in new technology introductions. Are these more
focused on the U.S. land market as you kind of highlighted some of the stuff you're testing right now? Or is this global
and you just chose to highlight the North American technologies?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: It's more the latter, James. I chose to focus on North America because this is where I think
technology will have a significant impact in terms of how the market is going to be shaped going forward. We've talked
about that on previous calls. James, we have a broad I would say portfolio of new technologies coming out also
addressing the international markets with a range of the businesses we operate in, but I chose to highlight North
America land and the fracking on the Gulf.
<Q - James C. West>: Okay, that's what I figured. Thanks, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.

Our next question is from Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I appreciate the comments especially on the near-term outlook
for 1Q and the minus seasonality. I was curious though if we think about adding back the negative impact you saw on
fourth quarter for Iraq. And we thought about first quarter Middle East Asia margins, let's say. Should we assume that
add back of revenue and the attendant profitability at least offsets whatever multi-client, no, excuse me, year-end

product sales that you lose traditionally in the first quarter? So perhaps revenue flattish, margins flattish as opposed to
down in Middle East Asia for 1Q?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, with respect to Q1 I'm not going to give you a specific number or go much more into
detail than what I did. I will just say that the change, the sequential change both in revenues and margins in both
environment, I think is going to be more or less in line in what you've seen as an average of the past couple of years, so
there are a lot of moving parts in our business and the way we see Q1 at this stage is that it's going to be more or less
that normal seasonal growth that we see.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. My follow-up, Simon, will be for you. I guess with the dividend raise now, by looking
at consensus numbers from 2014, the dividends currently about 28% of net income. Is there a target range that you guys
have as a management team or as a board that we should be thinking about longer-term here in terms of where that
dividend potentially can go as a percentage of net income?
<A - Simon Ayat>: You know, if you look back on several years now, we look at our dividend every year in January,
and we decide based on the level of activity, the cash flow, where we're going to be as far as a dividend is concerned.
The 28% it is on the higher side, and reflect the new level of cash flows that we are at and we will continue to be. But
there is no target number for the dividend. We will look at it every year and we will reflect basically on the condition of
the business and the growth in the cash flow. But there is no target number.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. And Simon, should we view the assumption of debt during the quarter specifically just
to fund the share repurchase program? And is that something that we should expect to continue in what is still a low
interest rate environment?
<A - Simon Ayat>: Frankly, we're going to need to borrow to fund the repurchase of – We did the borrowing to take
advantage of the lower interest rate, which as you know kind of climbed during the quarter, so we did it at the right
time and we have some maturing debt that's coming in the first half of 2014, which we will use as excess cash to bring
it down.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. I appreciate the time. I'll turn it back.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Sure. Thank you.

Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons. Please go ahead.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Good morning. With regard to 2014, I'm not sure if you made mention of this or not yet.
But with regard to your international margins in 2013, incrementals were kind of 40% to 45%, in that range, for last
year. Should we expect much the same in 2014 with regard to international incremental margins?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, we're going to try. I can't promise you. But we have a lot of drivers that we are working
on to, which is going to push us to try to repeat that. But now it's going to come down to a number of things, but new
technology introduction and a further improvement in efficiency and quality are going to be key drivers. So I can't
promise you, but we are certainly going to try.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. And secondly, back to the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, if I look back
what you guys have done over the past five-six years, on average earnings per share is down a low double digit
percentage quarter-on-quarter. Is that what we should be expecting on modeling for the first quarter?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: What number did you say?
<Q - William A. Herbert>: A low double digit percentage quarter-on-quarter.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, I would say plus-minus 10% is a good average of the past three-four years, yeah.

necessarily an implausible place to start for Q1.

And next we go to Angie Sedita with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Great. Good morning, guys.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Good morning.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Paal, could you give us a little further color on the North American price weakness. Obviously
we had seasonality in Q4, and what are you seeing in Q1? Is it too early to tell? Or do you think we'll see continued
price weakness into 2014?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, speaking for us, we would have a further impact on pricing in Q1 that's mainly down to
the renegotiation and rollover of the term contracts that we have. So we did a few of them during Q4, with some impact
in Q4. We'll get the full impact of those in Q1. And there will be other contracts as well that will probably impact Q1 to
a certain extent, so that's the basis for the kind of pricing comments that I already made?
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Right. And then on the overcapacity kind of in reference to James' question certainly going to
be over-capacity in 2014. Is your thoughts that we'll certainly see that in 2015 as well based on the market conditions as
we see it today?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I think I'll focus my comments on 2014 for now. Things can move fast in North America land
but we're pretty confident that we will not reach equilibrium in 2014.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Great. And then as a related follow-up on Mexico, congratulations currently on the market
share gains. Some color there on when you expect to mobilize equipment or actually start activity in Mexico. And then
comments on Mexico longer term. Obviously expectations for the region are fairly high. It is still too early to tell how
meaningful Mexico will be? Or are you becoming more confident on Mexico?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: As I said in my prepared remarks, the early indication from these Mexican rigs that we will
have are a pretty solid market share gain. Now these contracts are not finalized yet. They will be finalized during the
first quarter. We expect to mobilize the additional resources that we need to take on the additional work during Q2 and
that we'll get into kind of full operation on these contracts in the second half of the year.
So we still see H1 activity to be somewhat challenging partly due to the Chapultepec slowdown, but I think H2 will be
better for us given these market share gains. Now with respect to the energy reform, obviously, there is net positive for
the industry, for us in Mexico. But the earliest impact on our activity will be 2015.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Right. I'll turn it over. Thank you.

Our next question is from Jim Crandell with Cowen. Please go ahead.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Good morning. Paal, the Chinese companies, CNOOC, Sinopec, PetroChina, seem to be
estimating a lot lower growth in E&P CapEx in 2014. Are you – do you expect that as well? And can you characterize
what you're seeing now in terms of awards in business coming out of the Chinese companies?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, we continue to see strong growth in activity for us in China on land, and this is driven by
both conventional pipe gas and to a certain extent shale gas, right. So part of it is just sort of market penetration for us.
There is a lot [indiscernible] (49:46) demand now for our new technology, for our technical expertise, and also for our
project management capabilities, right, so overall I'm still listing China as one of the fastest growing GeoMarkets for us
in 2014 as it was in 2013, so I have a pretty positive outlook on China for the coming year.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Okay. And then my follow-up is if you could comment on Brazil. You had some cautionary
comments about Brazil. I assume you're forecasting a lower level of business out of Brazil. If that's true, what kind of
drop do you see in business there for -- either drop in the market or drop in business for Schlumberger in 2014?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I'll just say overall rig activity we expect to be flat in 2014, which means it's going to be
another challenging year. Exactly what's going to happen to our business, I'm not going to go into details, though, but it
will be a challenging year, coping with the flat activity, which is obviously lower than what we were expecting going
back 12 to 18 months.

timing of those startups we may see some impact on projects?
<A - Simon Ayat>: I don't have the details of those. They will have to [indiscernible] (51:22), so I can't comment on
those.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: We'll follow up with you, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Okay. And then how should we think about from a top-down standpoint measuring the progress
Schlumberger makes on some of the cost and efficiency initiatives in 2014? Do we just watch that through the margin
line or through incrementals? What's some external measuring sticks we can use to judge you by?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think both the margin side is going to be a good measure of it. I think also it will have
some impact on our ability to generate free cash flow, so I think both of those are good yardsticks to look at.

<A - Simon Ayat>: It's really in line with the rest of the world. I mean, you know, last year, it was lower because
obviously, the pressure pumping is consuming less as we have consumed some of the excess equipment. Exactly, I
don't have it ready for me but we'll follow up with you on this.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: But there's no, thinking of the international side, there's no bigger drop on the international
side versus domestic at this point?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: If you look at 2013, we obviously scaled back significantly in North America due to basically
hardly any CapEx required for pressure pumping, so I think what you see going into 2014 is a more even increase in
North America versus international, and obviously we included in North America the Gulf of Mexico, where we see
quite significant growth, and these services are also quite capital intensive.

And we'll go to Jud Bailey with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to follow up on Latin America. That was a difficult market for
Schlumberger and for the rest of the industry in 2013, although you still were able to grow margins. With the Mexico
work ramping up, with Argentina growing, how much of a pickup in growth can we see in 2014? If you grew low
single digits this year, or last year rather, is that a market that can grow high single digits with Mexico coming back and
Argentina growing? Or is that a stretch?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: We typically don't give comment on details in our growth outlook for -- per region, but I
would say that we are aiming to grow in Latin America in 2014. What level, I can't really comment on.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: Okay; that's fair. And just another question, you were able to as I mentioned grow margins pretty
nicely despite a difficult market in Latin America last year. You mentioned cutting costs in Brazil, getting your cost
structure down. Can you comment maybe on how to think about margins in Latin America for 2014? Do they stay kind
of soft until activity mix starts to pick back up?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I think the first couple of quarters given the challenging activity levels both in Brazil and
Mexico, plus the mobilization that will probably take in Q2 in Mexico, there will be challenges. Now we're going to
work very hard on keeping the margins where they are, but there are some headwinds we're dealing with. Now on the
flip side of that we have very strong businesses in terms of growth perspectives in Argentina, Ecuador, and Venezuela,
so while the headwinds continue in Mexico and Brazil, we're obviously going to do what we can to try to offset those
with strong performances in those three countries.

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah. I think for most of the product lines we are seeing continued pricing challenges. I would
say the only one that has kind of stood out as a positive, and is very much driven by new technology introduction is
actually [indiscernible] (56:12). But the other ones given market conditions are all facing pricing challenges.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Okay. And you highlighted Artificial Lift as an area of focus in the shale plays. Now,
obviously a lot of the in a lot of the shale plays that have lower productivity wells, ESP technology is not generally
employed. So what is Schlumberger's solutions working – what solutions are you working on for lower productivity
wells?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, what we've done over the past couple of quarters which I had in our prepared remarks is
basically that we have both a number of smaller [indiscernible] (56:53) companies for these key liquids shale basins
both in the U.S. and in Canada. So our plan is to combine the offering from these [indiscernible] (57:03) companies
with our existing Artificial Lift business, and then the objective is then to provide a life of well lift solution to the
customer base, so we will do that by looking at what is the ideal mix of ESPs and [indiscernible] (57:18) technologies
to optimize production, and we're going to obviously leverage our production engineering expertise and our ability to
monitor and integrate production data from these wells.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Okay. Right. Appreciate it. Thank you.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.

Our next question is from Edward Muztafago with Société Générale. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward C. Muztafago>: Hi, guys. Thanks for sneaking me in here. I did have one follow-up question on sort of
the incoming rigs specifically as it relates to the Gulf of Mexico. There's been a little bit of chatter recently that while
there's a fairly large influx of rigs coming in, we may see a little bit of exodus out of the Gulf as well. And so I guess
what I'm wondering is, on a net basis does the exodus of sort of lower specification shower water rigs have a material
effect on Schlumberger? Or do you think that because you're a little bit more deepwater-focused that that's less of a
concern?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, when I comment on the Gulf of Mexico and my comments are generally focused on
deepwater rigs, which is a large part of our well operation there, so while there might be some offshore rigs, we are still
quite optimistic in terms of the rigs projections and the results for Gulf of Mexico deepwater in particular for 2014, and
that's what I'm basing the Gulf outlook on.
<Q - Edward C. Muztafago>: Okay, that's kind of what I thought was underlying that. And then this is kind of a
follow-up to the revenue per rig discussions in North America. Obviously, one of the things that we've seen is the well
count go up fairly dramatically in relation to rig and so I haven't run the numbers. I'm hoping maybe you all have. But
if we were to actually look at sort of revenue per well as probably a better metric, do we see the same sort of trend
between Schlumberger's revenue, as you would with rigs, but maybe to a lesser degree? That is the technology upsale
has driven some atypical improvement in that metric?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: So for the revenue per well in North America land, I don't have that data available at this stage.
I would still say that that's probably not up as much as the 5%, in terms of global revenue per rig – sorry. International
revenue per rig that I was referring to. So there is continuous negative price pressure in North America, so I would say
our revenue per well is probably more challenged than that revenue per rig number I quoted.
<Q - Edward C. Muztafago>: Okay, thanks. That's very helpful.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.
