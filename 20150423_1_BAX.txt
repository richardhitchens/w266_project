MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Baxter International's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference
Call.
Your lines will remain in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment of today's call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or
rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.
I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter
International. Ms. Ladone, you may begin.
Mary Kay Ladone
Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Q1 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are
Bob Parkinson, CEO and Chairman of Baxter International; Ludwig Hantson, President-BioScience; and Bob
Hombach, Chief Financial Officer. As previously announced, Bob Hombach will be transitioning into his new role as
Chief Financial and Operations Officer for Baxalta Incorporated, upon completion of the Baxalta spin, and Jay Saccaro
who is also with us today, will be assuming the role of Chief Financial Officer for Baxter International.
On the call this morning we will be discussing Baxter's first quarter financial results and outlook for the second quarter
before taking your questions.
I'd like to take a moment to highlight that we will be hosting separate investor conferences in New York City on the
afternoon of May 18 for Baxter International. In the morning of May 19 for Baxalta Incorporated. At these conferences
we will introduce you to the new senior management teams, and provide investors with more information regarding the

strategies, growth prospects, capital structure and financial outlook for each company, including guidance for the
second half of 2015 and longer-term projection. I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page of the Baxter
website to register for the event.
In addition, we'll also engage in a comprehensive Investor Relations effort including Investor Roadshows for both
companies with the respective senior management team several weeks before the spinoff is completed.
So with that, let me start our prepared remarks this morning by reminding you that this presentation, including
comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments and regulatory matters contain forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. And of course our actual results could differ materially from our current
expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially.
In addition, in today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing
business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable
GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.
Now, I'd like turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.
Robert L. Parkinson
Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning. Thank you all for calling in. As you saw in the press release that was issued this
morning, Baxter reported financial results for the first quarter with adjusted earnings of $1 per diluted share exceeding
guidance of $0.85 to $0.90 per share. Worldwide sales excluding currency increased 4% also exceeding guidance.
We continue to successfully deliver on a wide range of strategic and operational objectives as we're extending our
global reach, launching innovative and differentiated products and therapies, advancing our new product pipeline and
investing to drive future growth and position the two companies for sustained success.
Our new product pipeline is focused on a number of programs that improve the quality of care and address key high
potential areas of unmet medical need. Some recent highlights include a CE marking in Europe for HOMECHOICE
CLARIA, an automated peritoneal dialysis system integrated with the SHARESOURCE web-based connectivity
platform. This system is designed with user-friendly features and secure two-way connectivity so healthcare providers
can monitor their patients' home PD treatments and adjust prescriptions as necessary. We expect to initiate the
commercial launch of the system in select European and Asian countries beginning in the second quarter of this year.
We also received FDA approval and orphan drug designation of PHOXILLUM Renal Replacement Solutions for use in
continuous renal replacement therapy, or CRRT, to correct electrolyte and acid-base imbalances. And we plan to
introduce these solutions in the United States in the coming weeks.
In BioScience we submitted a new drug application to Japan's Ministry of Health for the approval of BAX 855, our
investigational, extended half-life recombinant factor VIII treatment for hemophilia A based on ADVATE. In addition
we've also completed an enrollment in the BAX 855 pediatric study which will support post-approval label expansion
in the U.S. for previously treated pediatric patients and European regulatory submission in 2016.
We announced positive results from the Phase III study of BAX 817 for patients with hemophilia A or B who develop
inhibitors. The trial met its endpoint of successful resolution of acute bleeding episodes with an overall success rate of
92%. No patients developed inhibitors or binding antibodies during the study and none discontinued treatment due to
adverse events. We expect to initiate regulatory submissions in the next several years aligned with the prioritization of
other pipeline assets and manufacturing expansion is currently under way.
Our partner CTI BioPharma announced positive top-line results from PERSIST-1, a randomized, controlled Phase III
registration clinical trial examining pacritinib, a next generation oral JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor for the treatment of patients
with primary or secondary myelofibrosis. The trial met its primary endpoint of reduction of spleen volume and the
safety profile was consistent with previous studies. Data will be highlighted in a latebreaking oral presentation at the

upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting in Chicago, next month.
Under our collaboration with Momenta Pharmaceuticals, we initiated a pharmacokinetic trial in Europe for BAX 923, a
biosimilar version of HUMIRA. As you know, HUMIRA is a therapy for patients with autoimmune and inflammatory
diseases.
And finally, we presented interim data from the Phase I/II study of BAX 335, an investigational factor IX gene therapy
treatment for hemophilia B. The trial is assessing the safety of ascending doses of BAX 335 in up to 16 adult patients to
determine the optimal single dose. At the end of 2014, a total of six patients from three dosing cohorts had been treated,
with evidence of a dose-related response. In the two highest dose cohorts, factor IX activity levels and 10% or above
were observed in two patients with no bleeding episodes. In addition no patients developed factor X inhibitors. We
expect to disclose additional data at the upcoming ISTH Congress in Toronto in June.
In addition to internal innovations, strategic acquisitions and partnerships remain essential for both businesses as we
continue to enhance and bolster our portfolio. During the first quarter, we acquired SuppreMol, a privately-held
biopharmaceutical company based in Germany, developing treatment options for autoimmune and allergic diseases.
The acquisition includes SuppreMol's early-stage development portfolio of novel biologic immuno regulatory
therapeutics for the treatment of autoimmune diseases in IgE-mediated allergic diseases. The technology focuses on the
modulation of Fc receptor signaling pathways, an immune target that could have broad applications in diseases like
lupus, a disorder in which the immune system attacks healthy tissue.
And we signed an exclusive global licensing and distribution agreement with Laboratoire Aguettant SAS for trace
elements, which are essential micronutrients used in parenteral nutrition therapy. This collaboration augments Baxter's
leading parenteral nutrition portfolio and the companies will work together to pursue a broad range of regulatory
approvals including the United States.
In summary, our core portfolio remains strong. We continue to benefit from the focus on lifesaving therapies, and we're
pursuing new avenues to enhance the value of our products for patients and healthcare providers. Innovation is the
lifeblood of Baxter success, and our increased investment and recent achievements point the way to even greater
success in the future.
Before I turn the call over to Bob, I'd highlight as you know that we're quickly nearing a transformational milestone in
Baxter's history with the creation of two leading healthcare companies. One focused on developing and marketing
innovative bio-pharmaceuticals and the other on lifesaving medical products. This will present a remarkable
opportunity for growth and success in two new companies with unique and compelling investment identities, prospects
and strategies while each continues to extend their legacy of pioneering science and enhancing shareholder value.
Our employees around the world have been fully engaged in separation activities since the announcement last March
and we remain on track toward a mid-2015 completion as a result of their dedication and commitment. And while the
separation will usher in a period of transition, our passion for saving and sustaining lives will be enduring. As always,
I'll be happy to take any questions on this or other topics during the Q&A.
And with that, let me now turn the call over to Bob Hombach, for a discussion of our first quarter financial results and
outlook. Bob?
Robert J. Hombach
Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Adjusted earnings in the first quarter of $1 per diluted share exceeded our
previously issued guidance range of $0.85 to $0.90 per share. These results included $74 million of unplanned other
income or $0.11 per diluted share, primarily associated with the impact of foreign currency [indiscernible] (10:32)
conditions. As we mentioned in the press release, GAAP earnings of $0.78 per diluted share included net after-tax
special items totaling $120 million or $0.22 per diluted share, primarily for intangible asset amortization and costs
associated with the company's planned separation and the integration of its Gambro AB acquisition. These charges
were partially offset by a benefit related to the reversal of certain business optimization reserves.

Now, let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to the financial outlook for the second
quarter of 2015. Starting with sales, worldwide sales of approximately $3.8 billion declined 2% on a reported basis. On
a constant currency basis, sales increased 4%, which favorably compares to our guidance for the quarter of 2% to 3%.
Medical product sales were in line with our expectations, while strong growth across the BioScience portfolio
contributed to the over achievement.
Sales in the U.S. increased 4% and international sales on a constant currency basis increased 5%. Emerging markets
continue to be a key growth driver across the Medical Products and BioScience portfolios, as evidenced by mid-teens
growth in the BRIC markets during the first quarter.
In terms of individual business performance, global BioScience sales totaled approximately $1.4 billion in the quarter
and increased 2% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, BioScience sales advanced by more than 8%
comparable to the full-year growth generated last year with continued positive momentum across the portfolio.
Our Hematology business, which includes hemophilia and inhibitor therapies, generated global sales of $807 million,
which declined 2% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, Hematology sales grew 5%. Within the
hematology product categories, hemophilia sales in the first quarter of $641 million declined 5% on a reported basis
and on a constant currency basis global sales increased 2%.
Strong global demand for recombinant therapies including ADVATE and RIXUBIS was offset by the impact related to
a reimbursement assistance program, which was recently implemented for patients in the U.S. and the timing of tender
sales in Eastern Europe. Excluding these impacts, hemophilia sales in the quarter increased 6%. In the U.S., sales in the
hemophilia category were up 5% after adjusting for the impact of new reimbursement program.
We continue to be pleased with the overall growth of recombinant factor VIII therapies, despite the competitive
environment and modest patient losses. We continue to estimate our cumulative recombinant factor VIII share loss at
approximately 2%.
Sales in the inhibitor category, which includes FEIBA and OBIZUR of $166 million, advanced 9% on a reported basis.
On a constant currency basis, inhibitor sales advanced 18%. This was primarily driven by demand in price
improvements for FEIBA as we continue to promote the prophylaxis indication, and a modest contribution from the
recent launch of OBIZUR for patients with acquired hemophilia. You may recall only 15% to 20% of inhibitor patients
globally are treated prophylactically, presenting a significant long-term growth opportunity for our Hematology
business.
Turning to the Immunology business, which includes immunoglobulin therapies such as HYQVIA and
GAMMAGARD LIQUID as well as biotherapeutics, sales totaled $554 million and advanced 10% on a reported basis.
On a constant currency basis, immunology sales grew 14% versus the prior year. Immunoglobulin sales of $420 million
increased 6% on a reported basis or 9% on a constant currency basis. This was a result of robust demand, particularly in
chronic primary immunodeficiency market, strong international growth driven by our improved supply, and the
contribution of HYQVIA.
As you may recall, we launched HYQVIA in the U.S. during the fourth quarter last year. This is a transformational
therapy with an attractive value proposition for patients, physicians and payers. We are very pleased with the update
and continue to experience a favorable reception in the U.S. marketplace based on its differentiation. Of the 15,000
adult PI subcu patients, we now have approximately 1,500 patients on HYQVIA, with the majorities converting from
competitive therapies.
Lastly, in the biotherapeutics category, which primarily includes Albumin and our Alpha-1 therapies, we recorded sales
of $134 million, which increased 29% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 36%, driven by
an easier comparison to last year, favorable pricing and increased demand for Albumin, particularly in China.
In Medical Products, global sales of approximately $2.4 billion declined 5%, and on a constant currency basis sales
increased 2%. Adjusting both periods for the impact of new generic competition in the U.S. for cyclophosphamide,
Medical Product sales rose 4% on a constant currency basis. Within the product categories, renal sales totaled $913

million, reflecting a decline of 8% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis sales increased 1%.
PD growth of mid- to high-single digits, which was driven primarily by solid PD patient gains in Asia, was offset by
the selective loss of certain lower margin HD monitor and dialyzer sales aligned with our objective of optimizing
margins.
Within the fluid systems category, sales of $493 million declined 2% and on a constant currency basis, sales grew 3%.
Performance was driven by favorable pricing and demand for IV therapies and infusion systems in the U.S.
Sales in the integrated pharmacy solutions business totaled $564 million and declined 5%. On a constant currency
basis, sales increased 1% as strong growth of nutritional therapies and compounding services revenues were offset by
lower cyclophosphamide sales in the U.S. Excluding this impact, sales in the category advanced 10%.
A new competitor entered the U.S. market for cyclophosphamide during the fourth quarter last year and we continue to
expect additional competitors. As a reference, full-year 2014 U.S. cyclophosphamide sales totaled approximately $450
million, and sales in the first quarter of 2015 totaled approximately $60 million.
Revenues in surgical care, which includes our inhaled anesthetics and biosurgery products, were $322 million in the
quarter and comparable to last year. Sales rose 5% on a constant currency basis as double-digit growth in anesthesia
reflecting increased global penetration was somewhat offset by lower sales of select biosurgery products.
Finally, sales in the biopharma solutions and other category, which is our pharma partnering business, totaled $111
million, increasing 1% on a reported basis or 6% on a constant currency basis. Performance can be attributed primarily
to increased demand from our contract manufacturing partners.
Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin in the quarter was 49% compared to 50.4% last year. Positive mix, select
pricing improvements and foreign currency hedge gains were more than offset by the expected cyclophosphamide and
manufacturing impacts.
SG&A totaled $887 million and declined 1%. On a constant currency basis, SG&A increased 6%. This growth reflects
bad debt expense driven by adjustments in several emerging markets and BioScience investments to support
international operations and marketing initiatives related to new product launches.
R&D spending in the quarter of $298 million increased 7%, driven primarily by an increase in BioScience, which was
offset by foreign currency. In BioScience, we continue to invest in various programs across the disease areas of
hematology, immunology and oncology, while advancing technology platforms such as gene therapy and biosimilars.
Interest expense was $30 million in the first quarter compared to $43 million last year, as we benefited from recent debt
maturities, higher capitalized interest and income generated from the change in the mix of floating versus fixed interest
rates.
Other income totaled $74 million and including gains related to the impact of foreign currency on balance sheet
positions, driven by the significant decline in the euro during the quarter. The tax rate was 21.8% for the quarter in line
with our expectations and as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $1 per diluted share, exceeded our guidance
range.
Finally, let me conclude by comments this morning by providing an update on our full-year sales guidance and outlook
for the second quarter. Beginning with the new Baxter franchises on a constant currency basis, we continue to expect
sales for the full-year 2015 to be comparable to 2014, primarily due to the impact of generic cyclophosphamide.
Excluding cyclophosphamide in both years, underlying growth would be approximately 3%.
We now expect sales in our renal franchise to grow approximately 3%. This is somewhat lower than our original
expectations as we remain committed to servicing our patients, while also focusing on enhancing profitability. As such,
we've made a proactive decision to forego lower margin sales opportunities.
For fluid systems, we continue to expect sales to grow in the 2% to 3% range. We continue to expect sales of our
surgical care franchise to grow in the 4% to 5% range. We now expect the integrated pharmacy solutions sales to

decline high-single digits. This category includes cyclophosphamide and the impact of generic competition. For 2015,
we estimate cyclophosphamide sales of approximately $150 million and growth for the category after adjusting for its
cycle is expected to be in the mid-single digits. And finally, we expect the other category to decline approximately
15%, which will be impacted by a major customer electing to self-manufacture products, previously manufactured by
Baxter.
For Baxalta, we now project sales growth on a constant currency basis of approximately 4%. Our outlook includes:
growth in the hemophilia franchise of 0% to 2%, which will be fueled by new product launches and strong international
demand, which will be somewhat offset by anticipated high-single digit share loss for recombinant factor VIII therapies
in the U.S. due to competition.
We now expect growth in the inhibitors' category to exceed 8%, driven by strong performance in the first quarter,
further penetration and growth of FEIBA for the treatment of inhibitors, and the launch of OBIZUR for the treatment of
acquired hemophilia patients. For immunoglobulin therapies, we continue to expect growth of 6% to 8%, driven by
strong market demand and the contribution from HYQVIA. And finally for biotherapeutics, which includes
plasma-based therapies like Albumin and treatments for Alpha-1 deficiencies, we continue to expect growth in the 2%
to 4% range.
As we've previously highlighted, given the complexities of a midyear spin, we are not in a position today to provide the
full-year P&L guidance for Baxter and Baxalta. We are, however, providing guidance for the second quarter as Baxter
will be publishing earnings results for the combined business at the end of July. As stated in our press release, for the
combined business, we expect adjusted earnings excluding special items of $0.92 to $0.96 per diluted share. This
guidance does not reflect any material, incremental stand-up cost for the separation, as expenses will begin to be
layered in toward the end of the quarter.
Our outlook by P&L line item. We expect second quarter sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, to
increase approximately 1%. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales to decline 9% to 10%. By
business, on a constant currency basis, we expect Medical Product sales to be comparable to last year and BioScience
sales to grow approximately 4%.
We expect the gross margin for the company to decline by more than 150 basis points versus the second quarter margin
last year of 50.3%. We expect SG&A to decline in high-single digits and R&D to decline in mid-single digits. On a
constant currency basis, SG&A growth is expected to be in low-single digits and R&D growth is expected to be in midto
high-single digits.
And finally, for the second quarter, we expect interest expense to total approximately $35 million and other income of
approximately $15 million. This does not include any impact of foreign currency on balance sheet positions as our
outlook assumes current foreign exchange rates remain constant. We expect a tax rate of approximately 22% and an
average share count of approximately 547 million shares.
I'd like to conclude my prepared remarks this morning by saying that we recognize investors and analysts need more
information to help model both companies separately. So we look forward to providing you with an overview of the
businesses at our upcoming investor conferences on May 18 and May 19 in New York.
At this point, our estimate of initial incremental stand-up cost to create two independent companies remains
approximately 2% of total Baxter sales or slightly more than $300 million. About half of these costs will be reflected in
operating results beginning in the second half of 2015. Going forward, both companies will take steps to reduce a
meaningful portion of these costs over the next several years post-spin.
Finally, as we are finalizing the capital allocation strategies of each business, I'd emphasize that both businesses will
have strong balance sheets, generate significant cash flow and have flexibility to follow a disciplined capital allocation
approach, which balances reinvestment in the business with returning value to shareholders.
This concludes my prepared remarks this morning. We look forward to providing more financial information to you in
May.

Now, let me open up the call for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind
participants that this call is being recorded and additional replay will be available on the Baxter International's website
for 30 days at www.baxter.com. Our first question comes from Josh Jennings of Cowen & Company. Your question,
please.
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, first, just on the renal business, I
was hoping to get a little bit more color on not only the decrease in projection there for that business but also just
specifically on Gambro, the performance in the quarter and the outlook going forward and then update on the cost
synergies?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Sure. Josh, Bob Parkinson. I might ask Jay Saccaro to add his comments as well. Relative
to the renal performance, clearly, the growth in the first quarter was – actually, the business was fairly flat as we
pointed out in the script, largely due to a conscious decision to walk away from a couple of tenders that frankly weren't
generating the kind of returns that we expect. One of the things that we've talked about before and you'll hear more
about when we're in New York a few weeks is our increased focus on portfolio and particularly in areas that the returns
in certain businesses in certain countries are not generating acceptable – an acceptable kind of returns. And so that was
really what contributed mostly the softness in the first part of the overall renal business.
Going forward, we're looking at mid-single digit growth for the remainder of the year that's really led by faster growth
in the acute area, but overall, we're projecting about mid-single digit growth as I said for the last nine months of the
year. So in some ways the first quarter was a bit of an anomaly.
Relative to your question, more specifically about Gambro, the decisions we made to walk away from tenders and so
on, were in fact in the chronic space, the hemodialysis space that would be associated with the Gambro business. The
PD business continues to – underlying demand continues to be strong globally.
I would say that we continue to work through the integration issues with Gambro as we phase that in. On a global basis,
again, the numbers right now are tracking a little bit behind the model that we pulled together when we did the
acquisition, but we continue to be very positive about the decision to make the acquisition and the prospects of the
business going forward.
Jay, you want to talk about maybe the second part of the question?
<A - James K. Saccaro>: Yeah.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Josh's question.
<A - James K. Saccaro>: Yeah, in relation...
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Go ahead.
<A - James K. Saccaro>: Yeah, I believe the second part was in relation to overall cost synergies and how that's
tracking. As we think about that component, we've previously commented $300 million in annual savings achieved by
2017. As we sit here today, we're confident that we're very much on track in terms of achieving the milestones
necessary to achieve that level of cost savings by 2017.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Josh, one thing I would add coming back to my comments, the specific focus on Gambro.
Obviously, one of the rationales behind the deal was be able to bring forward a broad-based product offering and in
addition to the cost synergies that Jay just commented on, is the opportunity for commercial synergies that we're
already starting to realize. So as we move forward, really the way to value this business or evaluate the business is to

look at it in total. While the chronic business was softer in the first quarter for the reasons that I mentioned, we're
seeing synergies already in terms of increased demand in the PD segment as a result of being able to bring a broad
product offering to the marketplace, particularly participating in certain tenders and so on where we have a, as I say, a
complete product offering.
So I think going forward, the way to look at this business is really in aggregate, because you're going to see the various
components certainly in the chronic space, whether it's traditional in-center or PD-in-the-home begin to melt together
somewhat.
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: Great. Thanks for that. And just a quick follow-up. I know you're going to give more details
at the Investor Days, but you have called out that the new Baxter is going to hold a 20% stake in Baxalta. Can you just
give us some details around the rationale behind that strategy? Any timelines in terms of the ultimate sale of that stake
and deployment of those – of that capital? Thanks a lot.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Yeah, again, we'll be more specific on that in a couple of weeks but Bob, you might just
want to make a couple of comments about that, if you would.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Well, certainly. Yeah, Josh, I think first and foremost, this is a clear indication of
confidence in the future prospects of Baxalta. And I think it provides a significant amount of flexibility in terms of
capital structure really for both businesses as we approach this significant separation and try to set up the two entities
for a sustainable success going forward. Again, very confident in the ability to generate significant cash for both, and
want to ensure we position both that in a very competitive environment to be ready and able to continue to pursue their
strategies, which include re-investing in the business and potentially bolt-on acquisitions as well.
And as Bob mentioned, I think we'll get into much more detail on that as we get into the investor conference in May.

Thank you. David Roman of Goldman Sachs is on the line with a question. Your question, please?
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Hey, Bob. I wanted just to start with hemophilia. I think in your prepared remarks,
you referenced 2% cumulative share loss. We're now three quarters into the Biogen launch. I mean, are we at a point
now where you feel confident in sort of your original assumptions about the pace of share loss? And if that is the case,
why not a more optimistic outlook than the 0% to 2% guidance that you're providing for the balance of 2015?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: All right. I'll turn this over to the expert. Ludwig?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Thanks for the question, David. So as you said, we continue to see growth in our
recombinant factor VIII demand in the U.S. And in addition to that, as you saw, we have very strong FEIBA growth. I
can tell you we have a very strong team and ADVATE has a very strong brand equity. And the bar is high. And the bar
is high on efficacy and tolerability.
So with respect to the guidance that we gave you, already last year, high-single digit market share loss between the
launch – in the launch of ELOCTATE and the launch of the BAX 855, we still stick with that guidance for now. The
2% market share, we're doing better, as expected. We're going to see what we're going to do in the next couple of
quarters. You should also note that we will get additional competition within the factor VIII space in the U.S. So we
will keep you posted on how we're doing and we will adjust our sales guidance accordingly.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: And if I could just clarify, something you just said before I go to my second question
is, you said the high-single digit share loss between ELOCTATE and BAX 855, so as you think about the total Baxter
franchise, ADVATE plus BAX 855, the share loss will be lower than that high-single digits?

<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Well, yeah, I think it's – the expectation is we would get approval very late in 2015 and
then launch BAX 855. So from mid-year last year launch of ELOCTATE 'til that point at the end of this year before we
launch BAX 855, that's the single-digit share loss that we were referring to.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Okay.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: So we think it's about an 18 months period.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Got it. Okay. And then secondly just on margins, Bob, and your comments around
renal, you made the point that you did walk away from some lower margin business and I think one of the potential
opportunities around the Medical Products business is the relative profitability compared to peers. Can you just maybe
give us some sense on the dis-synergies? How easy it is to – is it just to cut out those incremental $300 million? I mean,
it sounds like you're adding the costs, but in terms of pulling it back out, you have a commitment to ratchet that down.
But how long does something like that take and what are the steps needed to get there?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah. Well, first of all, the entire $300 million isn't new BAX, that's partly absorbed by
Baxalta as well. But nonetheless it's a meaningful number. I would say our intent would be to offset the negative
impact of dis-synergies and stranded cost if you will, probably within a two-year timeframe. But frankly, that's just part
of a broader initiative to evaluate opportunity to pull out structural costs, which is a significant opportunity going
forward.
I mean, this is the story that you're going to hear in a few weeks in New York is, our belief, strong belief, that there is
an opportunity to meaningfully improve margins over time, whether it's the Gambro synergies that we continue to track
well on; as Jay commented earlier, focus on structural cost, improvement in manufacturing efficiencies, and cost going
forward, because we have absorbed some incremental cost as you know in our facilities particularly in manufacturing
IV solutions and PD solutions as a result of looking for ways to enhance our operational and quality performance in
those businesses; the relaunch of SIGMA Spectrum, portfolio as I talked about in terms of a more proactive
management of that. And then increased focus on higher-margin, higher-growth products.
So in aggregate, this provides us a very exciting opportunity to meaningfully increase margins over time. But you're
right, back to your question David, as you benchmark versus peers and so on, you'll see we're at the lower end.
Now, part of that, frankly, to some degree is the nature of the businesses that we're in. Not only IV solutions but PD
solutions. We incur significant distribution cost as associated with being in those businesses that typically are unique to
those kinds of businesses compared to other companies you might want to benchmark against. So in some ways the real
litmus test here is in those businesses are we generating returns that are sufficiently in excess of our cost of capital, in
many ways this gets back to the whole notion of focusing on portfolio.
So again, I'll stop there. Jay and I can talk a lot about this, but you'll hear more on this in a few weeks, David.

Thank you. David Lewis of Morgan Stanley is on the line with a question. Please state your question.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Good morning.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Hey, David.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Just a couple of quick ones here. Just for Bob Hombach. Into the second quarter, Bob, the
earnings number was a little lower than we were expecting, but some of the factors you discussed weren't materially
different than we were expecting. So does that simply reflect conservatism or simply incremental cyclo pressure with a
little bit of currency? So what is specifically driving some of the pressure sequentially?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Well, yeah. First and foremost, I would say the second quarter very much aligns with our
outlook up to the full year. So there is a calendarization impact at work here as well just in terms of timing of tenders

and so on. But clearly, the cycle impact will accelerate in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, fairly
meaningfully as that first competitor is much more entrenched in the marketplace.
And FX will continue to be a headwind as we've talked about that the rates at which we've been able to hedge, key
currencies like the euro are much higher in the first half of the year than they are in the back half of the year. So that's
certainly a contributor to the near-term. But again, I would emphasize, this is all very much in line with our
expectations as we looked at 2015 initially.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Very, very clear. And then moving just to the commentary, I think, actually that Bob had
made, but on inhibitors, the volume growth is actually very impressive. The other comment that was interesting though,
I think there was a comment about stronger pricing in the inhibitor segment. I'm trying to figure out where exactly that
stronger pricing is coming from? Is this simply mix or are you, just given the strength of the portfolio using this is an
opportunity to take up price in either OBIZUR – OBIZUR obviously is new or FEIBA prophy?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Well, FEIBA is the number one driver within that segment so we're just launching
OBIZUR and the patient response is very positive on OBIZUR, so we're still building that business. On FEIBA, we see
different dimensions here. The first one continued growth, demand growth because of a very strong rollout of the
prophy indication and in addition to that, we've been able to take a little bit of price on the FEIBA.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Okay. And then, maybe just one quick one, I'll jump back in queue, for Bob Parkinson. Bob
you talked about renal cost-cutting and then sort of renal growth being a little slower. In terms of capacity that was a
big driver of the Gambro transaction to begin to ramp capacity at certain plants. Is there any concern that if growth is
lower on renal that's going to put some pressure on some of the gross margin objectives or are you still comfortable
with those gross margin objectives? Or simply feel that there are more SG&A cost opportunities at Gambro that make
you very confident that you still get to those cost targets even with a little lower growth rate? Thank you.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Yeah. Well, the synergies that Jay commented on earlier largely associated with
structural cost and global manufacturing footprint and things of that nature, very operational in nature. In terms of our
gross margins, we're confident that we're on track with what we model in that regard. I think clearly the – and we
model this in. I think the traditional in-center chemo market will always be very, very price competitive and so I think
we've been very realistic in how we forecast it. Pricing and margins going forward in that business. I think the acute
segment and frankly the PD segment in certain markets around the world can be more blend in terms of pricing and so
on, but net-net for the broad renal business, including the Gambro component, I think our outlook in terms of pricing
market dynamics and how that manifests itself in gross margins is pretty realistic.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah. And maybe just adding one comment back to the second quarter and our outlook, I
would also emphasize we have given a somewhat wider range for two reasons, one is the volatility in FX but the
second one is, during the course of the second quarter, likely we will execute a financing to establish the capital
structure for Baxalta and have to adjust the existing debt portfolio potentially for Baxter. And as a result, there is some
uncertainty around both timing and impact on interest expense, so we have built some conservatism into the outlook to
account for that eventuality.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Your question, please?
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Question, and I guess this will be our last call together as all Baxter. So I had a couple of
questions, I'll just throw them out there. On the – I guess, you were commenting hemophilia side, you had mentioned
new patient reimbursement programs, I was wondering if you could just comment on that. Is that part of a strategy to
kind of keep people locked in with ADVATE? I just wanted to get an update on the Georgia plant, how things are
going? Whether or not that is tracking on schedule from a completion perspective and Sanguine? And then lastly, just
gross margins, you had guided to being down 250 basis points to 300 basis points, it came in a little better than that. I'm
just curious on what drove the favorability? Thanks.

<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Yes, this is Ludwig. Kristen, thanks for your question. With respect to hemophilia, these
new patient reimbursement programs, we do this for access reasons, want to make sure that people have access to our
products.
With respect to the Georgia plant, it is on schedule. As far as supply is concerned, we will grow faster than the market
including the Sanguine opportunity you mentioned. Sanguine is still on track to have the first product by the end of this
year and we will be focused on the European product.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah. And, Kristen, as it relates to gross margin, yes, the gross margin did come in from a
percentage basis a bit better than we expected in the quarter that certainly is driven by mix. You saw BioScience grew
very strongly, some modest price contribution as well a bit better than we expected. But also on a reported basis, we did
have hedge gains, as I mentioned and so those hedge gains, while they do impact the gross margin, they are simply
offsetting the underlying weakness in the currency that's driving down the natural sales in gross margin that would
otherwise be reported by the business.
So the mechanics here with the lower reported sales but the gross profit dollars being preserved by the hedges result in
a higher reported gross margin. And that contributed somewhere between 60 basis points and 70 basis points to the
reported gross margin percentage benefit in the quarter.
Just maybe a moment more on those hedges. Again, I would emphasize that these hedges preserve value, they do not in
and of themselves create incremental value. They're there to hedge underlying exposures. By definition, if the
currencies are weakening those underlying exposures are worsening, and the hedges again preserve value back to our
original expectation.
But as it relates to year-over-year comparisons, as we think to the back half of 2015 and then into 2016, the hedge rates
we have in place in the first half of 2015 are very attractive, particularly for the euro, north of $1.30 per euro, which
clearly we put in place a long time ago. But the hedge rates we have in place for the back half of 2015 are less than that
and certainly for 2016 are nowhere near that.
So while they do not create incremental value necessarily in 2015 for Baxter, in 2016, if rates stay where they're at,
sales will continue to be depressed, but our hedge rate will imply a gross margin percentage and value that will be less
than what we're seeing now. We estimate at current rates that that would be $70 million to $80 million of incremental
headwind, if you will, in 2016 for the combined company, which equates to about $0.10 to $0.12.
So at current rates we would see that in 2016, but again I just want to emphasize the hedge gains improved reported
gross margin percentage but in and of themselves are not necessarily additive to the bottom-line, because they're there
to under – to hedge underlying exposure.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: And can you update just for 2015 where we stand now with the total Baxter impact from a
foreign exchange perspective?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, it's still very much where we expected excluding this anomaly in other income here
in the quarter. Operationally in margins and op margin, it's still very much where we had previously projected, with
again most of the negative impact, somewhere in the order of two-thirds of the negative impact, of the approximately
$0.40 that we projected for the year, we're going to experience in the back half of 2015.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: So $0.40 in the back half of 2015 in total? So $0.40...
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: No. Our $0.40 is our full-year expectation, so excluding the anomaly of the other income
in Q1, we're very much in that range for – still for 2015, but about two-thirds of that will impact us in the back half of
the year for the reasons I mentioned, the hedge rates are at less attractive levels for us and frankly the euro has
deteriorated from when we initially gave guidance as well.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Got you. Okay. Thank you very much, guys.

Bruce Nudell of Credit Suisse is on the line with a question. Please state your question.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple for Ludwig. Ludwig, most of these med-tech
spins work pretty well, and the stock appears to have been handcuffed prior to the spin largely due to kind of perceived
existential threats [ph] to hemophilia (47:11), specifically factor VIII and FEIBA. There's subcu approaches that are out
there in the development stage that are potentially once a month, they work in the presence of inhibitors, potentially
BAX 826 may be better than once per week dosing but it's not in humans yet. Just schematically, what's the company's
view broadly speaking as to whether or not we should view factor VIII and FEIBA as a kind of midterm grower or a
decliner? And if it's a decliner, are there enough offsets so that it really shouldn't matter for the new Baxalta?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Well, this is a great question and you're going to see all the details on May 19, so I hope
you will be able to join us. But overall, we believe that this business will continue to be a growth driver for us in all the
different segments, inhibitors as well as hemophilia. What we're doing is we're building both breadth and depth in our
portfolio. The depth, as you mentioned with BAX 855, hopefully launch by the end of this year, BAX 826, and then
moving to gene therapy; everything is related to factor replacement, which is an advantage because the clinical, the
regulatory piece, the manufacturing piece is very well understood. So that's the path that we're on. The breadth is that
we're going outside of hemophilia and you know that we have different opportunities in development. So overall, this
will continue to be a growth driver for us but we're going to give you much more details on May 19.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Thanks so much for that. And just your commentary on HYQVIA was very interesting. I
think you said 1,500 of the 15,000 patient equivalents in the U.S. PID or subcu PID are now captured. So like what's
the ceiling for that? And what are the plans for extending that to non-PID applications?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Well, we're very pleased and we're pleased in the first place, because the feedback from
the patients is very strong. That also gives a value to the payer as well. Overall, we believe that's a decrease in total cost
of therapy even though we were able to take a price premium because of the bioequivalence or the bioavailability of
HYQVIA, so I believe it's a winner. It's – we're in a position over the long-term to make this a leading product within
PI. The opportunities that we have on the development side is to go outside of PI. You know that PI is about 20% to
25% of the total business. So we're starting Phase III program in CIDP as well as we continue to look at expanding the
label within PI. At this moment, we are restricted to adults, so we're very, very pleased with the uptake six months in
and we have 1,500 patients out of 15,000.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Thanks so much.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Hey, Stephanie, we have time for two more questions.

Thank you. Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan is on the line with a question. Please state your question.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Thanks. So I just want to clarify as a starting point just the FX impact commentary in the
second quarter. So the $0.11, Bob, that you called out for this quarter, that would be offsetting the $0.40, so the actual
on a reported basis I guess the FX impact for the year is more like $0.30 this year and then another $0.20 to $0.22 next
year. Is that how we should think about it?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, I would definitely separate the anomalous situation that occurred here in Q1 in other
income from the operational FX we expect to incur, which again we continue to think is approximately $0.40 at the op
income line. As it relates to 2016, my comments were specifically about the year-over-year potential for
headwind-related FX gains. The overall FX picture is clearly going to be defined by how currency rates move between

now and the end of 2015, which they have been fairly volatile; and plus they will have different impacts by business as
well.
So I don't want to get too far ahead of myself here as it relates to overall expectations on FX impact in 2016 other than
to say these hedge gains here are clearly going to be an issue at the current level of exchange rates and the current level
of hedge rates we've been able to achieve thus far in 2016. And again, I peg that at about $0.10 to $0.12 on the
year-over-year basis.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. And then just to think about the $0.92 to $0.96 for the second quarter, so if we're
annualizing that, which I realize there's a problem in doing that, but it's all we've got to go with right now, the
incremental impact from there is the $0.40 plus of dis-synergies from the split and then that incremental FX impact as
well as the – whatever remaining erosion there is in cyclophosphamide. Is that fair?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Well, just to be clear, when you say $0.40 of dis-synergies, that's an annual number.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Right.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: That's not what we're going to incur in the back half of 2015, but that's our current
estimate of the annual impact. Initial dis-synergies from a run rate perspective, I would tell you we'll get into this more
in May, but both businesses are going to begin to do what we can to mitigate some of those dis-synergies, even starting
in 2016. So that will be part of what we get into at the investor meeting here in a few weeks. But from a run rate
perspective in the back half of 2015, the $0.40 roughly are – well, it's as I said, approximately $300 million or so in
overall dis-synergies, so it's a bit more than $0.40.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Right. Okay. Just a couple of quick product clarifications; you said in the prepared
comments, Bob Parkinson, that I think the BAX 817, that even though everything was going well there you said
regulatory submissions over the next several years, so I was hoping you could just clarify that because I think we were
assuming that you would submit that product later this year? And then, BAX 855, Ludwig, if you could just comment
on the dialogue with the FDA and the confidence in an approval later this year, that would be great. That's all. Thanks.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: BAX 817 recombinant VII, so positive Phase III data. We have to prioritize since we have
a long list of products within hemophilia we have to prioritize from the manufacturing perspective. BAX 817 is lower
in the ranks and that's the reason why we will not be submitting later this year. With respect to BAX 855, the regulatory
review is ongoing, no red flags at this moment. And we believe that we still have the chance to get approval before
year-end.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: And, Stephanie, our last question?
Operator
Our final question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Your question, please?
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Thanks very much for taking the question. So the first question I have is, previously
you guys have suggested that the fully loaded operating margin for Baxter Medical Products at the time of the spin
would be in the low-double digit range. And I was wondering in light of all the comments today about that business, is
that still a good number to think about in terms of the operating margin from the start? Or is that now a little more?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yes, Bob, we haven't been quite that specific. We simply said it would be at the very low
end of the peer set for a number of reasons. And frankly, as we work through all of the details here on the separation,
including things like the pensions that we currently have in the U.S., which generates [ph] hefty (55:05) amount of
expense and how that gets apportioned between the two companies and so on. Again, we'll lay all this out at the
investor meeting, but I just want to clarify we haven't specified a start point, if you will, from an operating income
margin perspective.

<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Well, then maybe another way of asking the question is, in terms of what's happened at
the business since the last call on Q4, I mean, you've talked a lot about currency, I think we've got that straight. The
spin costs sound like they're the same. Renal sounds a little worse. Is there any other major moving parts you're willing
to comment on here? Like is pension different than it was at the beginning of the year in terms of some of the big
buckets we should be thinking about that that might've changed again since the last conference call?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah. The only thing I would say about pension is due to the fact that we are going to
have to split the pension that triggers a GAAP requirement for a re-measurement. This is the process that normally
happens at the end of the year where you rebase where your discount rate is, your asset return assumption et cetera.
Your mortality tables, the whole nine yards. So there is a possibility that pension expense could be different. I think
directionally interest rates are slightly lower now than they were at the end of the year, so there may be some impact. I
don't think it's going to be a super material. Other than that and the factors that you've mentioned, I don't think there's
anything else in the business we've talked about that has changed.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: And then lastly, really quickly, are you guys going to address dividend policy at the
upcoming meetings? Obviously given the decline in earnings there's been a lot of discussion about the dividend. Is that
something you will lay out in detail at this meeting and just wondering how confident you are that you can maintain
kind of the total payout relative to what you're currently paying?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, as we've said all along, we are going to lay out the full financial outlook, the sales,
the operating margins, the cash flow generation capabilities of the two businesses, as well as capital structure in terms
of debt allocation and capital allocation policies including dividend policy. That will all be part of our discussion with
investors on the 18 and 19 of May in New York.
