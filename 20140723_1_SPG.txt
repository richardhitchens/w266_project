are also available on our IR website at investors.simon.com.
Also, due to the completion of the Washington Prime spin-off during the second quarter, we're providing operating
statistics for the prior-year period to show performance on a comparable basis excluding the Washington Prime
properties, which is in our supplemental 8-K.
And now for our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.
David E. Simon
Good morning. It was a very eventful and productive quarter. We completed the spin-off of Washington Prime Group.
We re-launched our brand to create a whole new way to engage with consumers and, most important, we continued to
produce strong operating and financial performance. Results in the quarter were led by FFO of $2.16 per share,
exceeding the first call consensus estimate by $0.03 per share.
Excluding the operating results from the WPG properties and the transaction costs related to that spin, FFO increased
12.8% year-over-year for the second quarter. As a point of interest, if we exclude the transaction costs related to the
spin, our FFO would have been approximately $2.26 for the quarter. And I'd like to take a moment and put that number
into perspective. I'll remind you that our second quarter 2010 FFO was $1.38 per share. So the quarterly profitability of
Simon Property Group has increased by $0.88 per share or $320 million quarter-over-quarter since then.
Overall business conditions remained favorable, driving increases in our key operating metrics and our cash flow. We
continue to see strong demand for space across our portfolio. Occupancy ended up in malls, premium outlets in the
mills. The malls and premium outlets recorded increased leasing spreads to $11.06 per square foot. The mills recorded
leasing spreads of $12.74 per square foot. And for those of you who are interested, comparable property sales were up
90 basis points for the quarter. And the movement from sales per square foot of $6.12 – or, I'm sorry, $612 a year ago
to $608 is solely related to bringing on several new projects totaling 2.16 million square feet.
Comp NOI, of course, which I'm more interested, increased 5.6% in the second quarter and is up 5.5% year-to-date.
And over 95% of our domestic NOI is included in our comp NOI calculation. And as a reminder, our comp NOI in
2013 Q2 was over 5%. So that's 5.6% over 5%. These results are a testament to the strength of our assets, the
desirability of our locations and our ability to execute.
So let's look a little forward. Charlotte Premium Outlets is opening on July 31 and is fully leased. Twin Cities Premium
Outlets in Minneapolis will open August 14 and is fully leased. Construction continues on new premium outlet
developments in Montréal and Vancouver, both high-quality major markets. And Montréal will open in the fourth
quarter.
Formal groundbreaking at Gloucester Premium Outlets, a new 375,000 square foot center in Southern New Jersey that
serves the greater Philadelphia area scheduled for August 7. Other new outlet projects in our development pipeline are
moving forward, but we are being very selective and focused on major markets and where there is clear demand from
the retailers and manufacturers that matter.
Now, in the quarter, just turning to redevelopment and expansion, we did open successfully 147,000 square foot
expansion at Desert Hill Premium Outlets, making it one of the 10 largest outlet centers in the world; Lenox had its
re-grand opening, including the renovation of the exterior and the fashion cafes and the addition of several new

restaurants including True Foods; redevelopment expansions that are ongoing at 32 properties across all of our three
platforms in the U.S., Asia and Mexico, which we'll continue to expand/enhance some of our most productive
properties.
As a reminder, construction is ongoing at some of our most productive properties, including Del Amo, Roosevelt Field,
Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, Houston Galleria, Stanford Shopping Center and St. Johns Town Center. We
also started construction on a significant mall redevelopment at Fashion Center, Pentagon City, which will add 50,000
square feet of small shop space including restaurants. And as you've seen recently, we've started the construction of the
expansion of Chicago Premium Outlets, which will add 260,000 square feet as well as a Shisui Premium Outlet in
Japan that will add 130,000 square feet. So put it altogether, as we said, it's over $1 billion through 2016 and it's
affecting some of the most productive assets not only in this country, but in the world.
Now, capital markets, just briefly, we did amend and extend our $4 billion unsecured multicurrency revolving credit
facility with a June 2019 final maturity at LIBOR plus 80 basis points, which is the tightest spread in our industry. As
planned, we retain $1 billion of cash proceeds from the debt placed on the WP assets prior to the spin.
We also announced a dividend of $1.30 per share for this quarter, which is a 13% year-over-year increase. We will pay
at least at SPG $5.15 per common share at SPG. And we revised our guidance that we issued May 29, 2014, to $9.01 to
$9.11 from a range of $8.96 to $9.06, which raises both the top and bottom range by $0.05.
Just to turn to management, Andy's here, will be our next CFO. Steve Yalof will join as CEO of our Premium Outlet
business. Andy has been instrumental in building the strength of our industry-leading balance sheet. He'll maintain that
focus. And Steve is a well-respected retail real estate executive who enhances our team and brings a unique perspective
with his diverse retail background. I look forward to working closely with both of them.
So sum it up, great first half of the year, and we're absolutely focused on enhancing the value of our real estate, which
is being executed on daily and producing the results that we're hoping for.
Questions?
Elizabeth A. Zale
Operator, we're ready for questions. Thank you.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Christy McElroy representing Citi.
Please proceed.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: Good morning, everyone. You've been increasingly talking about potential densification
of some of your assets and the possibility of adding non-retail components if it makes sense. I think Copley you talked
about, but you also have a 230 unit residential project at Southdale Center ongoing. Copley is sort of fairly intuitive.
But can you talk about your views on why it makes sense to add residential to a center like Southdale? What other
traditional delivering regional malls of yours are you considering adding a residential component?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I mean primarily, because there's demand, and we do like the interplay between
high-quality residential with our high-quality retail offerings. And it's an opportunity to continue to add value to the
company. So Southdale we've had – and we've had very good success in places like Firewheel and Domain. To name a
few, we've got both the hotel and residential going on at Phipps. We're in discussions with a well-known developer in
the Lenox. And then, obviously, the big mama is in Copley, which – our intents and purposes for that is to start
construction within nine months, which will be a landmark for the Back Bay of Boston. We're very comfortable with

demand.
The quality of what we're going to build will have a – we think will be terrific and it's got the right kind of IRR for us to
take that risk. And then we'll think it will add to the value of that retail. So it's not going to overwhelm us, but it's part
of our strategy to continue to make our shopping centers the place to be both from shopping, entertainment, leisure,
eating and then eventually, living and spending time on with respect to the hotel business. So these are great real estate,
why not take advantage of it.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: And then in terms of the larger projects that you have in the mall pipeline with
meaningful small shop expansion. David, you mentioned, Del Amo, Pentagon City, Roosevelt Field, Stanford, Houston
Galleria, as you think about adding additional small shop space to your better malls, what's the composition of new
stores that you're putting in these expansions that you did sort of – didn't previously have room for at the mall where
you're seeing new demand. So how much is restaurants versus fast fashion versus luxury versus traditional mall
retailers?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, the simple answer, it really depends on where we're adding the space, what that center
lacks, what the demand is. But I would simply say, Christy, it's all of the above. In Pentagon, to take a simple example,
in that case, it's really restaurants, because it's out in the exterior of the center. If you've been there, the porte-cochere is
kind of really humpty, dumpty, it's really terrible frankly. And we think given its location and the ability to – if you've
been to Atlanta recently, you've seen what we did with Lenox, just opening up these centers, creating a sense of this is
where you are to enter, it's great for the restaurants. And we've seen a lot of synergy there. So, in that case, it's – and
there'll be a little bit of fast fashion there as well, because of the customer base.
But in Del Amo, it's upgrading the mix and bringing in not the super-luxury, but bringing up kind of the better retailers,
more aspirational brands, because we think that's what's missing. So it depends a little bit on everything. In Galleria, the
demand for luxury is immense. So having the ability to take some of the existing retailers, move them toward the Saks
existing store, which will be the new added small shop space, will allow us to continue to upgrade the true luxury
players in kind of the Neiman Marcus wing. So, again, it's a little bit of everything and it really, really depends on
where and what the demand is.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: Thanks, David.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector, representing Bank of America. Please proceed.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Spector>: Thank you. Now that Washington Prime has been spun out, I guess, David, can you just talk
to us a little bit more about your main goals, what you're going to be focusing on for the next 6 to 18 months? Is it
really the redevs and the branding effort?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we do everything here, Jeff. And that's why our FFO increased. And again, we didn't do
it by smoke and mirrors for high leverage, but our FFO increased from 2010 to 2014 just for the quarter $320 million.
You don't do that by a little bit of this and a little bit of that; you do it by everything. So, I mean, at this point, we're
going to continue to do everything. We're going to redevelop, we're going to re-lease. We don't have industry comp
leading numbers quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year; we don't outperform over the last 12 years, over a decade,
continually beating first call consensus estimates, year after year after year, not several years, but over a decade without
being able to do just about everything. And so we're going to continue to do just about everything. And I don't want to
limit by redev or that. I mean, if you have a good idea, I'll take advantage of it. I mean, tell me what I should do.
But obviously, I mentioned and I want to underline it, what we've got going on at some of our big, big mamas, now I've
used that twice, Liz just frowned on me, but what we got going on at the Field and the Galleria and Del Amo, I mean,
it's pretty big stuff. So that's hugely important. That's why we've added some people to help us manage that, but we'll

continue to do everything we can to drive this business forward.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Spector>: Okay. And then, just one follow-up before Craig has a question. Is it too soon to talk about
any response or feedback on the Simon branding effort?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I can tell you that we've been – the compliments we've received have been fantastic. And
I think from a retail point of view, the retailers that think of themselves as brands, has been very, very positive. And at
the end of the day, if you don't think of your company as a brand going forward, you're going to miss out on
opportunities. But this is a going to be – this is not a – it's an evolution. We'll try to revolutionize parts of it. But it's
going to continue to be something that we'll reinforce with the consumer day in and day out and our people in the field
will reinforce it as well. But we're in early days on it, Jeff. But we're very excited about the prospects of continuing to
upgrade the quality of our presentations and the quality of our service levels to our properties. And that's very
important in today's world.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Spector>: Thank you. I think Craig had one question.
<A - David E. Simon>: Okay.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Yeah, just wondered – hi – if we could get to some comments on your involvement
with digital and then possibly deliv, the extent of your involvement in [ph] holiday 14 (19:58) if you're adding malls or
markets?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we are focused on making strategic DC-like investments in opportunities that we think
will add value to our company, both from helping our retailers, as well as helping our consumers. So, as you know, we
hired somebody, Skyler Fernandes. He's been here for three months, we've made some investments. And deliv, we will
be bringing to Woodfield. And we're part of that group. We're not leading that group, which is fine. We don't have to
lead everything we do, though I like leading everything we do, but sometimes we don't lead. And it's one of many
things that we'll continue to experiment with and we'll see where it goes.
We've got some expertise now. We've looking around corners for opportunities. Skyler's uncovering a lot. We're in the
deal flow. We're doing it smartly though. We don't have 100 people running around doing it. I think the way we're
doing it is smart. And like I said, we've made some small investments and we'll continue to make them and I like the
prospects of what we're trying to accomplish.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim, representing SunTrust. Please proceed.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Thanks. Could you just quickly talk about The Mills lease price? It seems like the $12.74 equals
around 47% of a percent change standpoint. Could you talk about how you're achieving that? And I guess it's not really
driven by sales per square foot changes, so maybe a little more color on that.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, therein lies, again, the – first of all, I noticed in sales don't necessarily – as I mentioned
to you in the past, the fact that sales growth does not necessarily correlate to spread growth. And the fact is you can see
that from the results that our Mills portfolio posted. I don't know how else I can describe that to you, other than
producing the results that we did. So that's how I would answer that question. We've got an under-rented, under-market
portfolio in The Mills. We're upgrading the mix and we're charging more rent; simple as that.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum, representing UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Hey, David. Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Hey.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Can you talk a little about the outlet sector versus the malls, just in terms of how would you
describe the strength of demand you're seeing for outlets today versus the strength of the demand for malls? And maybe
how is that manifesting itself in terms of pricing power for each of those segments?
<A - David E. Simon>: I'll let Rick comment. But I'd say there's no huge or material difference. Like when we were
coming out of the recession, clearly, there was more trepidation with respect to full priced than there was the outlet.
The outlets didn't see the big dip in demand. But I would say today, it's pretty consistent. The only difference is that in
the outlet sector you do have a number of the people that have not participated in it, wanting to. But I would say the
demand is not all that much different at all and the gap between the demand, given that there's been no new supply in
the regional mall businesses basically on top of each other. Rick, I don't know if you want to add anything to it?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I just want to emphasize David's point in the outlet. There just happens to be a number of
the mall tenants that, frankly, back when we got into the sector, we started talking to them about the outlet as a
desirable channel for their business. And now, they're experiencing that and they're experiencing great results. So a
company like Express is now rapidly expanding.
And the only other thing in the outlets is that the center sections, for the most part, are a little smaller and the spaces are
smaller. So, even with the same amount of demand, the supply is more constrained, and that gives you a little bit more
pricing power.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Okay. Second question, David. If we look at Washington Prime, I'm curious. The stock's
around $19, a little under today. Where did you think the stock was going to be when you decided to do the spin?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think the advice that we got was right in that range. And I'm not here to talk
about WP. WP will be providing an update in the next few weeks about what they're doing. But I think it's right on.
This is a – we've been a public company for 20-some-odd years. It takes time for companies to develop what they're
doing. I'm very pleased with WP from a director point of view and as a shareholder. It's very early days. It's been
trading through, what, six weeks, maybe two month – six weeks.
So I think it's right where we think it's going to be, and I think they've got a lot of opportunities, but they are much
better equipped. And frankly, just from a fiduciary point of view, it's better that they do it than I do it. But no great
surprises on that whatsoever.

<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Hey. How are you? David, two questions here. The first, we'll go back to the branding
question. You're definitely a numbers guy, and advertising tends to be sort of a softer metric as far as being able to
gauge. How are you gauging the effectiveness on a dollars and cents basis? And in order to fund this, are you cutting

back other advertising that you used to do, or in total, this represents an entirely new effort as far as – I mean
presumably you were advertising at the local level, so just sort of curious, have you pulled back from that and focused
more nationally or is this incremental to?
<A - David E. Simon>: No, look, I think that the – I mean your comment about numbers it reminds me when a lot of
people say I'm not a real-estate guy yet and I go back to this quarter-over-quarter. Somebody figured out how to grow
the business $320 million, that's not for the year, that's just for the quarter-over-quarter. So look, the fact is we did
reallocate spend, took it away from outdoor, put it more towards digital and TV, less from radio. I mean, we did that
kind of stuff that we tweak every year where we're getting that.
So the answer – and there is a little bit of extra costs associated with the stuff that we've done. But it's going to be a
test-and-measured business. But ultimately, it's going to be managed within our typical budget every year that we do
for marketing spend. But by having branded and consistency across the portfolio, you do get economies of scale. So
we'll be able to take advantage of it.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: So is there a way that you're measuring the spend or it's just something that you
assume as long as you're getting positive feedback from tenants and customers?
<A - David E. Simon>: I think you certainly have that ability. I think the initial phase is more what's the feedback. But
as this progresses, we are going to measure our results.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. And the second question is your releasing spreads have been accelerating. Can
you just give us some color whether, either by mall or outlet, or if this is more new tenants coming in or this is just part
– or if this is more driven by remerchandising tenants, moving guys from the 50 down and moving new guys to the 50
yard line?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I'll let Rick and Steve, if he wants to chime in. I would just point out to you that we are
under-market rented, that's why we're able to grow our comp NOI every quarter. Where our occupancy costs, for better
or worse, if you want to focus on that and you know how I feel on some of these numbers, is low, is very low, look at it
compared to our peer group. So it's low and that allows us to increase our rents, at the same time doing in a way that
our retailers can continue to be profitable in our portfolio, which is important. So that's – but it's continuing to upgrade
and it's marking leases to market and that's what it is. Rick, do you want to add anything?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: The one thing I would again re-emphasize something David has talked about, we keep
talking about our redevelopment program. I don't think people appreciate how much better our properties are getting as
places where retailers want to do business. We've talked in the past how there are a number of new entrants that want
more square footage. It's a supply and demand business and as our properties are getting more desirable, we have more
demand, limited supply; we're able to drive rents.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Alex, this is Steve. I'd just add one comment, because you ask about the difference
between new leases and re-leasing. And interestingly enough, we have the ability to parse the data and look at it and
componentize it. And the spread is pretty much on top of each other, whether it's a new lease or a re-lease. So which I
think echoes David's comment about the portfolio is just under-market. And whether it's the existing tenant and us
reaching an agreement with them to stay in the space, or whether it's remarketing it to another tenant, we're getting
market rent for that space now.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. Listen, thank you.

<A - David E. Simon>: Well, one guy's not here. So until you post, you never know.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: That's true. I'm just curious, to build on an earlier question looking longer than 18 months out.
On top of honing the portfolio and maybe executing on the pipeline, do you think there's a role or a need for something
larger to be done in real estate or perhaps even assisting brands with omni-channel retailing?
<A - David E. Simon>: Maybe I'm dense. I didn't – can you restate your question? I think I missed it. I didn't miss the
– I missed it. Sorry, Jeff, can you...
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: No, no problem at all. Just I was curious if on top of your, I guess, the blocking and tackling
on the portfolio, if you feel that there's a need or a role for Simon to do something larger in real estate or perhaps
assisting brands with omni-channel retailing in the next few years.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think we're always trying to assist the retailers, while, at the same time, grow our
business, so there is this natural tension between the two of us. But yeah, I think we've got it continue to upgrade the
portfolio and drive traffic. If that's your question, yes. So yeah, we certainly have a responsibility to retailers to make
our environment as productive and as exciting as possible; that's the biggest focus we have.
Rick, I think we feel like we have that obligation. We have it to the consumer too. So I mean, that's what – I mean the
amount that we've done within the portfolio just upgrading little stuff from rest rooms to play areas to ceding the areas
to exterior improvements, to doing the – I mean we've done a hell of a lot over the last several years, right. We were
able to shut down when the world was ending and start back up. We were able to shut down better than anybody else.
We were able to start up better than anybody else and all of that's proven because all of that's in our numbers.
So we had – forget the – I hate losing WP, because it's – now I got – I lost $1 FFO. But we would have been at $10
roughly, right. Now, you're going to do the calculation – excuse me if I'm rounding here or there. But so everybody's
going to do the calculation, what does that mean, what does that mean? But we were going to be at $10 per share, $6 in
dividends. Where were we in 2006 and 2007? Where was everybody else? So those are big numbers.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Well, David, that's, I guess, the root of my question, is I think that you've certainly done well
in strengthening the balance sheet and you spun off Washington Prime.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: You have a big pipeline today. And I guess I'm wondering if going forward, you see more of
your capital allocation going to things outside of malls and outlets and maybe into other areas?
<A - David E. Simon>: No, we're going to always stick to retail real estate. And we will densify here and there, but –
yeah, and we think we can do that appropriately, not get over our skis. But no, we're going to always be a retail real
estate company. That won't change.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: And then I guess for Rick, just a few questions. Did you guys see much of a sales impact in
outlets in Japan, just because they did have a big increase in their VAT tax in the second quarter? Did you see anything
there?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, let me – that really should go here as opposed to Rick.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I don't leave the domestic shores.
<A - David E. Simon>: But the fact of the matter is – or actually, I'm glad you brought that up, because the answer is
no, believe it or not. There was a little bit of a spike ahead of that and our Japanese partners are actually coming at, the
weather here is bad, so assume you'll still get here, but they're actually coming here for the next couple of days. But it's
actually surprisingly held its own. I don't have it right in front of me, but the simple answer is no, it's actually done

very, very well even with the increase in VAT.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: And I think this one is for Rick, because he and I were exchanging phone calls, is can you talk
about the replacement you have lined up for the Nordstrom space at Florida Mall, and maybe a little bit why Nordstrom
opted to leave that market and does that sort of foreshadow anything for that property?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, the property is frankly growing extraordinarily well, and in fact, right now, we're in
the process of adding a new flagship Zara, American Girl. We are adding a completely new food hall with the other
restaurants. And I'll let Nordstrom's statement speak for itself, but we are very excited about our replacement strategy
for that box, and in fact, there will probably be announcements forthcoming in the very near future that will show you
what we have in mind there and we believe it's going to be a substantially positive addition to the property.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, it's absolutely, unequivocally not a reflection of the mall at all. So let me make that
clear. The mall does $1,000 a foot and it's grown its NOI every year, and so it's a great mall; no issues.

<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Morning.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: So first, a question on Klépierre. I know that you do not include it in your core same-store
numbers, but we noticed a large drop in your share of NOI from Klépierre NOI, page 21 of the 2Q sup, down to $53
million from looks like $67 million last quarter. Can you perhaps give us a bit of color on what caused such a big drop?
Were there one-timers in either number?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. Q-over-Q there were one-timers last year.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: And then also...
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: I'm speaking to – sorry, sorry, to first sequentially last quarter?

<A - David E. Simon>: As Adam Shandler (sic) [Sandler] (40:38) would say, not too shabby. So no, and they're doing
a good job. And I have yet to learn one word in French, which is quite pleasing to me.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Okay. Thanks for that. One more if I may. Understanding your views, David, on sales per
square foot. I was just curious though on your thoughts on...
<A - David E. Simon>: Let me just stop there. What my – I just don't think it's the – again, I'm not trying to tell you
that it's not unimportant. The question is whether we should obsess over it or not. And what I'm trying to explain to the
market, I obsess over my revenues. I obsess over my comp NOI. I don't obsess over what the retailers do in my
properties unless I'm doing a bad job, then I obsess over it. So what happens in our industry is, retailers they get hot,
they have great sales; they don't, it changes. We've got to develop the right mix. Sometimes that's our fault; sometimes
it's the retailer's fault.
The important thing is where is our leases vis-à-vis market, what's demand and can we increase our cash flow? That's
what I obsess over. So I've never had a headline saying sales are up, when they're my tenant sales because my headline
is what are my sales up, and in fact, I think this quarter, up 9%, right? Roughly? Looking at my team. They're shaking
their head. So that's what I obsess over. That's the difference that I'm trying to communicate. And as you know, other
retail REITs in the universe of 30 of us, more than half of them don't even report what their tenant sales are. So we're
just trying to say, yes, I hear you, it's interesting, but it's not what's going to drive our ability to increase our cash flow
because remember, we can take the space back.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Got you, got you. And I understand. I appreciate your views. I mean, again, we
understand why you think what you think. But I was just curious on your thoughts on potentially creating a new
category of sales productivity reporting to perhaps capture the larger in-line tenants, the H&M, the UNIQLOs, that pay
you rent more like in-line tenants, but whose results are not included in your reported core numbers, especially given
how well they've been faring lately.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, we track total sales, and I think year-to-date, we include everything that – we don't
get – everybody doesn't report, we have the department stores that some don't, some do. Rick, what's the – our total
number's up...
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: It's almost 3.5%.
<A - David E. Simon>: 3.5%. So, you're right. Now, I'm not going to do that on a per-foot basis, because it includes
department stores, but it does show you what's going on with market share of our property. So they're up 3 point. The
total sales that we get reported are up 3.3%. Now, is that a number we should report? I don't know, when the strip
center guys do it, call me and I'll do it, okay?
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Fair enough. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. No worries.

Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya, representing Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just along the lines of just the retailer outlook, I was
wondering if we could just get some sense from you, how you're feeling about things like mall traffic and just a kind of
general sense of what the mall feels like today and also in July?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, the fact is the consumer generally is still very cautious and we see that across the
board. There's no denying that. As you know, a number of retailers, both low end, medium and even high end, are all
seeing somewhat of a cautious consumer. And that certainly is affecting retail sales in our properties. So that continues
to be the case.

We have our work cut out for us with respect to that issue. We think it's – we don't think it's a shift issue going from –
we've done a lot of research here. We don't think it's a shift from the online, to online from physical. It's really more of
an indicator that the consumer right now is pretty cautious. So and I think a lot of that is just all the macro stuff that's
out there. We've seen it before. We certainly have some retailers that have their issues which will put – puts focus on us
to release their space. But again, I mean, those things ebb and flow, but we've got our work cut out for us with regard to
just kind of a consumer that's cautious right now.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: So would you hazard to guess that mall traffic is down slightly or down low-double digit or
anything of that sort?
<A - David E. Simon>: No, it's not down double digits, okay. I don't know where you get that data either. No, it's not. I
would say mall traffic is generally flat. The summer months are not big until late July and August because of back to
school. June is not an important month; early part of July is not. So we'll see what happens.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Right, okay. That's helpful. And then just one more from me on the outlet side of the
business. During ICSC, there was general commentary coming out of the company about some additional
developments that could be done in 2015, 2016. There was like half-a-dozen potential locations that were mentioned.
Just wondering if there was any update on that?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, we do – you mean from our company?
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Yes. Correct.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. Yeah, we do intend to – as you know, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're starting
Gloucester, which is August 7. Okay, that groundbreaking, that'll open basically a year from August. And we do have
one other that we will hope to start this year. And then we still have three or four that are in the pipe for next year. So,
yeah, nothing's really changed on that.
And, again I won't bore the callers on my comments, but we're being very selective in where we want to go and where
demand is. And we are – let's – not that we're always going to bat 1,000, meaning we may pass up an opportunity that
turns out good, or we may build one that's not great, but those are the two options that can happen. But generally I
would say, we're experts in understanding where are the manufacturers and where are the retailers that matter who want
to build the next outlet, okay? Doesn't mean we're going to bat 1,000, but it's going to be pretty damn close.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Sounds good to me. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure, thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Rosivach, representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Andrew L. Rosivach>: Hey, guys. Don't shoot the messenger, but clients just keep asking me about sales, so I
had to shoot a couple in. You mentioned earlier that the redevs were impacting sales, which kind of makes sense
because you're going to have lower sales as you're going on. Do you have any idea of what the quantity of that was?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we go property by property. But the fact of the matter is, look, sales were – I will just
say this; we added more space. So when you look at the $612 to $608, that's the primary issue there. And also, we
added some centers that are not quite up to the core average yet, but that's nothing new and out of the ordinary. It does
take time for centers to develop their trade area and everything else.
So in the movement, because that's why I don't want to call it the decrease, because it really didn't decrease, the
movement from $612 to $608 was really a function of adding additional space. And as I mentioned to you, the comp
sales were actually up 90 basis points, which would ignore that impact. We give you total sales, but the comp sales
were up 90 basis points. And the total sales just volume-wise, not on a per-square foot basis, was up 3.3% and that's as

much as I really want to talk about sales.
<Q - Andrew L. Rosivach>: I know, and by the way, nobody's going to report 5.6% NOI growth amongst your peer
group...
<A - David E. Simon>: Nobody right?
<Q - Andrew L. Rosivach>: But this is what I do for a living. So the 90 was actually trailing 12-month, not just the
second quarter?
<A - David E. Simon>: It was Q-over-Q.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yeah, second quarter.
<A - Elizabeth A. Zale>: Second quarter.
<Q - Andrew L. Rosivach>: Second quarter over second quarter true comp, okay. And then, let me ask you a sales
question that actually does matter.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah.
<Q - Andrew L. Rosivach>: I'm assuming it's part of the Washington Prime spin. You spent some time thinking about
what the growth could be on a multiyear basis, because let's face it, if sales really are flat or they're even negative for
three years or five years, that actually does matter. And maybe if you could share a multiyear view, I think it'd be really
helpful to the market.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I mean, look you see where – I mean I guess the simple way is just look at where our
expiring rents are versus what we're bringing in new rents at today's sales level. And if that's what you're focused on,
you can see that embedded growth is pretty significant.
<Q - Andrew L. Rosivach>: Well, no, that's easy, right? Just even if sales stays flat, you can see where it's going to
go. But do you have any thought of where sales are going to go, any thoughts on looking at the last 12 months, not
being representative of where you really think that the tenants can dive their sales going forward the next two years or
three years?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I'm not going to give you a number if that's what you're after, but I do think that
the consumer has been cautious and for all sorts of reasons. The sense on the macro side is that – and part of that was
moved toward durable stuff. But the fact of the matter is, I do think there's a lull here and I don't view it as a long-term
lull. I do think the economy sounds, feels like it's getting better, and with that, the consumer will move forward.
But as I said to you, the economy – the GDP of last quarter was down 3%. I had nothing to do with that. I did my fair
of share. I built, I redeveloped, I hired people, I gave raises. I did everything I can to juice the economy. So don't look
at me, okay. So we'll see. We feel good about our business.

you're at the frictional maximum? I mean it's a little harder for you guys, because the outlets have always run higher to
comp you against the rest of the peer group. But if you just think of the malls, is this more real in this year? I mean do
you think there's much more upside? Is it good to push for that upside or to leave some kind of frictional wiggle room?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I'm always of the view make the deal, lease the space. But look, I think, Paul, at
the end of the day, there's going to be a little volatility into it. Because there are some bankrupt, we have a little bit
more bankruptcies this year than we did the last couple. So when you get the space back, you don't have it immediately
leased, it takes time. So there's going to be some of that volatility. But I think we'll maintain that kind of level of
occupancy give or take a little bit here and there.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: And the only other point I would make, Paul, is that we spend a great deal of time asset
managing our space to get the highest yield we can out of that space in terms of rent and sales production. So much of
our discussions with our tenants are getting them right-sized, which, in a lot of instances, is decreasing the amount of
space they're in, so we can create additional rooms out of the same square footage, which drives our sales and drives
our rent. So there's a lot of levers still left that we can pull to generate productivity even at these higher occupancy
rates.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Sure, yeah, that makes sense. Okay. So my other question, just on development. You've got
about, what, $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion, your share in your sup listed for activity that's under construction. And so that's
basically over the next two years I guess. And what should we think in terms of annual completions based on kind of
what's in your pipeline for starts over the next twelve months. I mean, is that number going to stay about the same? Do
you have some big projects that are going to come in?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, I mean, I think the best way to do it is we think on average, we're going to, as we said,
spend about a $1 billion-plus a year, so they'll spike up on that, but if you – and that's just more or less domestic. But
we've got – that might spike up when we put Kapolei in and a couple of others. So we're going to – there is lumpiness
to it because some of the stuff that we're finally doing is big stuff. The Fields of the world, the Del Amos, so you're
going to have some spiky, but on average, when you look back on 2016, 2017, it's going to be $1.2 billion or so per
average, more or less.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: And do you think that 8% mall redevelopment yield is going to be consistent, even when you
add some of those kind of bigger projects?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, look, the answer is yes, because we also have new development in there that will be at
higher yields than that. So when you put it altogether, it's a pretty good number that we feel good about.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Okay, Great. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: No worries.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller, representing JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Yeah, hi. Following up on the last question, if you go out past 2016 and think about the
next three years, five years or so, does it seem like you can maintain that roughly $1 billion a year spend based on what
you think's in the shadow pipeline at this point?
<A - David E. Simon>: It's so hard to really tell you one way or another. I don't know. I mean the simple answer is I
don't know. I mean, I think it certainly could extend a couple of years, but we have a very disciplined philosophy about
adding because and over-improving the center, because at the end of the day, you know what drives – if I go back to
this $320 million, you know what drives our earnings, is that we think about return on equity better than a lot of folks,
and that's what drives the business. So, if you over-improve stuff and you don't get the right return on equity, you kind
of get, you're kind of done it and it's great and the architects can slap themselves on the back. But the question is
where's the cash flow? So I don't know.

I mean, I think we're so focused on the handful of big things that we have, that that's the key. But Copley's a four or
five, unfortunately, because I'd rather have it much quicker, but that's a four-year, five-year project. So I think the
simple answer is that, yeah, that $1 billion to $1.2 billion stretches from 2016 goes to 2017 and 2018 and then after
that, it's hard to really tell you one way or another.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: The only thing I would add to that is are we looking for other opportunities within the
portfolio? Absolutely. Do we have a number of things that we hopefully believe we can do to create incremental
opportunities? We do, but it's going to be approached with the same discipline and the same rigor of analysis so we
don't do something that's stupid.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, and we're actually not in the – we're starting to see a little bit of new development, not
outlets that we're thinking about. We're close to one deal, and Liz brought up Oyster Bay, so we've got two deals, thank
you, two deals that are out there to do new development that will not be outlets that aren't in. So economy gets better,
stronger, maybe there's a little bit more new development going on. So it's a tough question to really give you any
comfort in other than the philosophy of return on equity is what's really going to drive us. So we won't waiver from
that.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Roane, representing Hilliard, Lyons. Please proceed.
<Q - Jeremy M. Roane>: Good morning. And thank you for taking our question. We notice that tenant
reimbursements as a percentage of operating expenses were higher than in previous quarters before the spin-off of
Washington Prime. Is the current quarter a good run rate for tenant reimbursements going forward? And also, what led
to the increase in home and regional office costs?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Jeremy, this is Steve Sterrett. Couple of things because the income statement has been
reclassified and the Washington Prime assets are all in discontinued operations, I do think the P&L for the quarter
reflects a good run rate for the existing Simon portfolio. So I would say that's fine.
The one caveat, David mentioned it earlier, is we did spin incremental dollars in the second quarter related to the
rollout of our branding campaign. And that lumpiness won't occur quite the same way in the future.
<Q - Jeremy M. Roane>: And home?
<A - David E. Simon>: Home and – I'll just...
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: I'll do it.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, you want to answer that?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yeah. I'll go ahead. The home office and regional costs, the variance both year-over-year
and sequentially with the first quarter is all one-time stuff. Some of it is related to the Washington Prime transaction
where we vested some equity and recorded the costs for people who are now Washington Prime employees. Some of it
was incentive compensation; some bonuses that were paid for mid-level people here in the organization who worked
very hard on the Washington Prime transaction. And...
<A - David E. Simon>: But no, executive was.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: No. That's why I used the term mid-level. And then some of it is retirement-related costs
relative to the change in leadership at the Premium Outlet Group that David mentioned.

Your next question comes from the line of Ben Yang, representing Evercore. Please proceed.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: Thanks. Sorry, if I missed this, but did you update your same-store NOI guidance excluding
Washington Prime? Just curious if you think growth can accelerate during the second half of the year?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Ben, the one thing that we did back when we announced Washington Prime, we told you
that it would accelerate our same-store NOI by 30 bps, but that's the extent of the update. We have not given a forecast
for comp NOI for the rest of the year.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: But if your prior guidance was 4%, and now it's 4.3%, should we assume that growth will
decelerate during the second half of 2014?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I wouldn't necessarily assume that, no, right, because we are a little bit ahead of our plan
year-to-date.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: Okay, got it. And then maybe switching gears, can you talk about why you guys didn't consolidate
your ownership of St. Johns Town Center when your partner was looking to sell? And if it was price, which I believe
was a 4% cap rate, was there an opportunity or a consideration to maybe selling your stake along with your partner for
that asset?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, the answer is, the reason we didn't buy it was primarily price, just to cut to the chase,
even though we think it's a great asset long term. Why would we sell it? I mean it's a great asset. We built it. We leased
it. We manage it. We're adding Nordstrom. We don't need the capital. That's the business we're in and owning real
estate. So why would I sell a mall that we're the managing partner, we run it day-to-day? We had a partner in it, so it
was no harm, no foul. I didn't see any – we don't need the capital, I don't see any reason to sell it.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: Got it. That makes sense. So if there was a 4% cap rate for what I believe is a 700 per square foot
mall. Given that, is that a good comp for trophy assets or I believe there're some near term lease rolls that could be
potentially pushing that cap rate lower? And if that is a good comp, if you think that have any – I mean, if you have any
thoughts on what that means for the value of your stock?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, let me just put a light in there. I don't want to tell you what – I'm not going to sit here
and say to you that what the cap rate was. We don't do that, that's a private transaction. So it is what it is. Reason we
didn't buy it, we owned it, we controlled it, we didn't see that with all the capital that we're putting back in our portfolio
wasn't really – it wasn't going to – we didn't see that the real need to do it from our standpoint.
From a going forward, I mean, look, if you look at the value in the private markets and what's being paid and look at
where our stock's trading, and I think you could certainly make the argument that the private market is certainly more
expensive than public stocks. And assuming we don't decrete from value, but create value, we ought to get a little,
maybe $0.20 a share for that. So but then, I mean, I would say to you clearly that the private market value clearly is
more expensive than the public market value when you put it altogether. But that ebbs and flows.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore, representing RBC Marketing (sic) RBC Capital Markets
(67:10). Please proceed.
<Q - Rich C. Moore>: Hey, guys. Good morning. On occupancy costs, you guys gave that in the supplemental, 11.6%.
But of course that's a mix of existing leases and new leases. And I'm curious what would that number be, you think, for
new and renewal leases you put in place today?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: It's going to – well, our leasing trend right now is continuing unabated. And David pointed
out, if you look, we're signing new leases at $66, we've got expiring leases at $41. It's going to be around – are you
talking about the spread?
<Q - Rich C. Moore>: Yeah. I'm thinking, Rick, the actual occupancy cost numbers. So that new rent that you're
getting at $60.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Overall, for the...
<Q - Rich C. Moore>: Plus as a percent of sales?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: For the body of work we're doing, that is going to basically be right around the same
number and maybe moving up a touch based on the...
<A - David E. Simon>: I think what Rich is asking is when we look at new deals, what is our occupancy cost. I would
say it's probably in the 14% to 15% range, in that range. But again, it's all over the board. But again, if you look at our
peer group, we've got very low occupancy cost and the ability to drive that will continue to drive our comp NOI in a
stable economy.
<Q - Rich C. Moore>: Right. I got you, David. Yeah. That's a significant number. I appreciate that. Then the other
thing is you didn't spend a lot of time on your European investments on the call here.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. We did that deliberately. Not that we don't love them, okay, and not that they're not
doing well. We're just – we're trying to make our remarks shorter and shorter. So...
<Q - Rich C. Moore>: No, I hear you. I hear you. I'm curious. Yeah, I'm curious, I'm curious how you see that actually
going at this point if there's...
<A - David E. Simon>: Going great.
<Q - Rich C. Moore>: How the relationship I guess is progressing. And then also, I'm a little curious, is there anything
coming back this way? So are you finding new tenants? Are you finding any changes in organizational thoughts,
anything like that that comes the other direction?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I mean, just to name two great retailers that are from Europe coming here are Primark
and Topshop. And just to name – and forget H&M and Zara, who have been here, but those relationships are certainly
enhanced by our presence in internationally, but, Rich, I would say simply this. We are batting 1,000 in Europe and in
international. So everything – and that's – it's – Klépierre, it's great, the McArthurGlen deal is going to be very good.
We think we got in at a very good value, and there's growth opportunities. And the outlets business in Malaysia, Korea,
Japan, Mexico, Canada, thank you, Steve, is good; it's all good.
So we just figured, I mean, we don't – we're trying to shorten the presentation up and Liz wrote it and I took it out.
<Q - Rich C. Moore>: I got you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Don't read anything into it, okay?
<Q - Rich C. Moore>: I got you. Well, on that, on your position, is it sort of steady as we go at this point you think, or
will there be possibly new announcements coming out of the European venture?

<A - David E. Simon>: I'm open to any ideas anybody has. Okay. No, but look, I think McArthurGlen's development
pipeline is very active. But as you know, that takes time and Klépierre, where we give strategic guidance and all that
stuff, but they've got a good pipeline too in terms of extensions and the like, so – and Japan, we've got. Yeah, so we're
going to continue to build on those businesses. Is there going to be anything earth shattering? It depends what you
consider earth shattering.

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim, representing Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q>: Hi, this is [ph] Chris (1:11:53) for Dan. Occupancy in 1Q and 2Q has been among the highest in the last 10 years
for those quarters. And understanding that you've achieved strong rent growth in those quarters, just wondering though
that given those occupancy rates are so much higher than and typical for those quarters, is that a situation where you
may have pushed even harder on those rents? Or do you feel that you struck a pretty good balance between occupancy
and rental rate growth?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think we are – look, it's an art, not a science. I think we're pretty good at it. And I think
historically philosophically, we've always erred on making the deal. So we're not as – I'm sure people complain on the
other side sometimes. But so I think we're always trying to lease our properties up. I do think if you look and
historically, you've probably got a big compositional change in the portfolio, I mean depending on how far out you're
looking that's occurred over the last decade. So that's probably what's maybe causing that to some extent. So I would –
that's probably the biggest issue. And it's interesting, in the Q1, we used to have a lot of fallout every holiday season,
because of let's talk 10 years ago, that is – become less and less of a typical event. So you may be seeing a little bit of
that on the margin.
<Q>: That's really helpful. Yeah, that's true, I went back 10 years just looking at those and I think, yeah, there's
definitely some composition changes?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah.
<Q>: Second, you mentioned before that you'll continue to prune the portfolio as you've always done, even after the
spin-off. But with the free cash flows funding most of the development and the redevelopment pipeline, do you see
much in the way of dispositions in the remainder of 2014? And I guess just generally, do you have the regional mall
portfolio kind of where you want it after the spin-off or is there some still work to do there?
<A - David E. Simon>: I would say there's always going to be assets that we're going to prune and sell. Frankly, it
hasn't been a huge focus given the spin-off. We spent most of our effort of any free time on that. So I think that's
something that we'll think about for 2014, 2015. I'm still depressed that I lost $1 of FFO. So I got to get over that. I hate
losing cash flow like that. So I've got to come to grips with that. But yeah, we'll continue to sell, but probably nothing
the rest of this year of any material nature.
<Q>: Great. Thanks, David.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. No worries.

<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Hey. It's Michael Bilerman. I've got a couple of questions. The first for Sterrett, and I
guess, I don't know if Andy's in the room, but as I think about the balance sheet, which is in unbelievable shape, one
thing that we haven't talked about is that you have about $7.5 billion of debt coming due in the next two-and-half years
at like 5.5%, 30% of your debt, a big chunk of that being the unsecured bonds, bunch of that secured debt on balance
sheet and a bunch in the JVs. I guess how aggressive can you be to pull any of that forward without paying huge
charges or make-wholes to bring that cash flow – because, David, I know you love cash flow, to bring that cash flow
forward?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Did your liability management people prompt you to ask that question? Are you allowed to
talk to them?
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: There's a big Chinese wall.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Okay. Just checking. Well, Michael, I mean it's fair, and I do think if you look at the
expiration, the debt maturity schedule, one of the things you see is that the next couple of years out, we've got the
opportunity to continue to roll down rates. It is something that we look at on a regular basis. But listen, it's essentially
trading dollars, because there are make-wholes or yield maintenance in virtually every debt instrument that we have. So
– but there are other ways that you can potentially hedge your bets a bit, whether it's going out and doing treasury locks
or whatever. So we do look at it, and we're as aggressive as we can be. Andy would tell you that we pay every debt
instrument and it's open to par date, and we're managing that as aggressive as we can.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Understanding that there's a curve aspect to this, but what is your sort of contemplate
as you think about the next two-and-half years and this debt rolling? Where do you sort of want to move that in your
schedule? Because, obviously, I mean it's like 100 basis points is over $0.20 a share, right? And clearly, where you are
on a 10-year basis today, you would be at probably 3.2%, 3.3%. So how should we think about how you want to roll
that debt? Are you going to – what is that average term, five years, seven years, 10 years, 15 years? Just trying to get a
sense.
<A - David E. Simon>: The simple answer, it'll be across the spectrum.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: But I would also say, Michael, one of the things that we focus on a lot is the asset and
liability match, and ours is primarily a 10-year lease business. So 10-year debt is primarily the sweet spot of where
we're going to do most of our financing. But I'd also tell you, go back and look at our weighted average cost of debt
over the last four years, it's come down 15 basis points, 20 basis points a year. That opportunity is certainly still out
there for the next couple of years. The markets are in really good shape right now.
And I would also tell you that one of the reasons that you're hesitant to do a large liability management trade is that the
forward curve tends to overestimate where rates end up about 90% of the time. And David mentioned in his remarks
the fragility of the consumer in the economy. It's hard to envision a scenario in the near term where rates are going to
run crazy, because I don't think the economy would continue to grow in a substantial rising trade environment.
<A - David E. Simon>: And I would – Michael, and I will just say this, one of the things that's interesting. Our floating
rate debt percentage is absolutely well below our peer group. It is 7%, if that, 5%, somewhere in that range.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: I'll tell you.
<A - David E. Simon>: So we're really not juicing our FFO by playing the floating rate, that game.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Well, and your debt also is materially lower as a percentage of your enterprise value.
So it's even of a lower percentage and you're sitting on $2 billion of cash?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yes.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. So what do you want me to do? Tell me, let's go.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: And you got $1 billion of free cash flow a year?

<A - David E. Simon>: I know. That's the...
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: So, what are you going to do?
<A - David E. Simon>: I don't know. I don't know. Come talk to me. I'm lonely.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: We saw that Apple's still got $120 billion of cash, so we've got a ways to go.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: So question, David, on Klépierre. BNP had to pay the U.S. Government, I don't
know, $9 billion fine. They're still sitting with a big stake in Klépierre. And I'm just curious whether you Simon, you as
Klépierre, or you in conjunction with a third-party investor have gone to them and sort of said, hey, look you're sitting
here with $1.5 billion in this company, we can provide you some liquidity to pay your fine.
<A - David E. Simon>: Look they've been a terrific partner with us. We have a very good relationship. They've been
very helpful on our involvement with Klépierre. So beyond that, I can't really say, Michael, anything more than that,
other than they've been a pleasure to work with. And I have absolutely no indication at all that – it's been a good
investment for them. They like the investment. Other than that, I can't really say one thing or another on that front.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Should we expect status quo out of your ownership? I mean how should we – I mean
it was a clearly a good investment. Europe has recovered, you were able to manage through their sales process and
focus them, Simonize them a little bit?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I do want to learn French. So I think so right now, there's status quo, so.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: You got to learn French to go up to Quebec?
<A - David E. Simon>: That's true. That's a different kind of French. Look, I think just from that company, and they
really are better off to speak for themselves. But they have done a great job turning around. They're starting to get the
mojo on the property level. The balance sheet's in good shape. So the focus for them, clearly, will be on external
activity going forward. And I'm there to help them in any way I can, but that's the focus. Things are going well there,
and they've done a good job.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Okay. And just a clarification on the 3.3% total sales number you threw out, that's a
quarter-over-quarter or a trailing 12 number?
<A - David E. Simon>: A trailing 12.
<A - Elizabeth A. Zale>: Yes.
<A - David E. Simon>: Trailing 12.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Do you have that number of what it was quarter-over-quarter by any chance, total
sales?
<A - David E. Simon>: We could, but I don't have it.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Don't have it in front of us.
<A - David E. Simon>: And we have it, but call Liz, she'll give it to you.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: All right. Thanks. Bye.
<A - Elizabeth A. Zale>: Thanks.
