For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.
David E. Simon
Okay. Thanks. Good morning. We had a productive quarter. We opened two new premium outlets in Charlotte and the
Twin Cities in Minnesota nearly 100% leased. They're both off to a great start. We successfully tendered and redeemed
approximately $1.6 billion of notes and currently issued $1.3 billion of new notes, which extended our average duration
and reduced our weighted average interest cost, and we became the first U.S. REIT to establish a global commercial
paper program. We agreed to buy two high-quality assets from the recently announced WP Glimcher deal with great
growth opportunities. And most important, we continue to produce strong and – operating and financial performance
both industry-leading.
Now, let me talk about the results. FFO reported was $1.90 per share. For those of you who updated your estimates to
include the $0.35 per share charge related to our tender offers and redemption, the $1.90 exceeded the consensus by
$0.05 per share. On a comparable basis, excluding the charge related to the debt distinguishment in the third quarter
and the operating results from the WP properties in the prior year period, FFO diluted per share increased 14.2%
year-over-year to $2.25 from $1.97 or $0.28 in total and on the same basis, it's been increased 14.5% year-over-year to
$6.48 from $5.66.
Overall, business conditions remained favorable, driving increases in our key operating metrics and cash flow. We
continue to see strong demand for space across the portfolio. Occupancy increased across the portfolio. Leasing activity
is healthy. The mall and Premium Outlets recorded releasing spreads of $9.67, an increase of 17% comp. NOI
increased 5.3% in the third quarter, 5.4% year-to-date, again industry-leading, and over 95% of our domestic NOI is
included in our comp NOI calculation.
Total sales in our portfolio increased 2.8% in the third quarter compared to last year and increased 2.6% for the trailing
12 months even with major redevelopment occurring at several of our premiere properties. These results are a testament
to the strength of our assets and their locations and the ability to once again continue to execute.
New development, as I mentioned, Charlotte and Twin Cities, both opened in July 31 and August 14, respectively.
Premium outlets, Montreal will open October 30, where we expect that to be another great deal; very similar to what
we've built in Toronto, which is doing well, doing great. Construction continues on new Premium Outlets
developments in Vancouver. And in Southern New Jersey, Gloucester township where the center will serve the greater
Philly area, both high-quality major markets.
In Canada, a year from now, we will have centers in three of the best markets: Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. And
we started construction just recently on two new premium outlets and two great markets, Tucson and Tampa, and both
scheduled to open in October 15, and we'll continue to focus our outlet projects in major and selective markets where
we know there's a clear demand from the retailers that matter and provide solid returns to our shareholders.

Redevelopment, just quickly, we opened a residential complex [indiscernible] (06:34-06:37) We also opened
Nordstrom and the additional square footage at St. Johns Town Center, and a new Bloomingdale's at Stanford Shopping
Center. We also announced plans for the addition of luxury residence and an AC Hotel by Marriott to Phipps Plaza to
open – both open in early 2016 and construction for the residence will commence tomorrow.
[ph] Distance to this (07:01) mixed use will make our great real estate even better and continue to make our centers the
places to be from shopping to dining to living. Redevelopment expansions, projects are ongoing at 31 properties across
all three of our platforms in the U.S., Asia and Mexico, which expand and enhance some of the most productive
properties.
We started construction on two expansions, one at Livermore premium outlets in the Bay Area that will add 185,000
square feet and is expected to open on August 2015. And the expansion of the Colonnade at Sawgrass expected to open
December 2015 that will bring 56,000 of high-end luxury retailers to this productive mill center.
And as a reminder, construction continues on major redevelopment expansion projects at some of our most productive
mall properties including, but not limited to Roosevelt Field, Houston Galleria, Stanford Shopping Center, and our
premium outlets including Woodbury, Las Vegas North and Chicago. When you put it all together, we had a total
committed spend of $2.2 billion over the next 3 years. All committed to and all underway.
Now, turning to acquisitions, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Jersey Gardens and University Park Village,
concurrent with the closing of the Glimcher acquisition by WPG. We're excited to add these two great properties to our
portfolio when the deal closes in early 2015. We're also pleased with our investment in Klépierre. And as their largest
shareholder, we're excited for them and their proposed transaction to acquire Corio. Both of these transactions will be
accretive to SPG's earnings. And again, demonstrate our industry-leading creativity to find unique opportunities.
Capital Markets, again, very busy. I told you about the $1.3 billion notes. And we retired average duration of 1.7 that
were – at interest rates of 5.6%. And we also redeemed another $250 million of notes at 7.875% coupon rate.
Concurrently, we issued $1.3 billion of notes with an average duration of 16 years and an average coupon of 3.64%.
This takes our senior notes from 6.3 duration to 7.6 duration and lowers our average interest rate from 4.64% to 4.4%.
In addition, as I mentioned, we are the first U.S. REIT to establish a global unsecured commercial paper program. We
received an A1/P1 rating from S&P and Moody's, respectively. The program has $500 million. We can issue CP in
dollars and euros. And in fact, we already have. So we placed $100 million of U.S. CP, which we are borrowing at
LIBOR plus 0 basis points to 2 basis points. And our euro LIBOR, we also placed €100 million at a euro LIBOR rate of
0 basis points to 7 basis points. That compares to our revolving credit of 80 basis points above LIBOR.
We announced our dividend of $1.30, an increase of 8%. Including the November dividend, we will pay to Simon's
shareholders $5.15 in 2014, which is an increase of 10.8% compared to 2013 and does not include the dividend that if
you've maintained your WP investment, which is essentially on a share adjusted basis of $0.50 per share. We expect to
raise our dividend again, of course, subject to board approval in the first quarter of 2015.
Guidance, we raised our guidance to a range of $8.84 to $8.88 per share. The midpoint of this range is an increase of
$0.15 from our prior guidance after giving effect of the charge related to the debt extinguishment.
Now, let me take a deep breath because, obviously, there's a lot going on. I wanted to just give you a real brief update
on management team. When we announced Steve Sterrett's retirement early this year, we also said that we would
source both internal and external candidates for the CFO job and that Steve would remain the CFO through 2014. We
then announced a [indiscernible] (12:40-12:43) Treasurer, Andy, would become our new CFO.
Since Andy's announcement, Andy, Steve and the rest of our financial service team who, by the way have on average,
20 years of experience with SPG, have paved a way for a smooth transition. And since that transition is now complete,
effective in December, Andy will become our CFO, and Brian McDade, now our Assistant Treasurer, will become our
Treasurer. Steve will be available to us as needed for specific tasks.
So summing it up. We had a great third quarter where we expect a strong year-end and, of course, we're very focused
on continuing to enhance the value of our properties and that we're open for any questions.

Q&A
Operator
Great. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy from Citi.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Michael is on the line with me as well. David, just to follow
up on your comments around building outlet centers in the major markets. In buying a center like Jersey Gardens, in
what type of markets do you think indoor outlet concept could work? And can you also provide your most recent
thoughts around the growing number of outlet centers and stores opening [indiscernible] (14:19) stores? What that
means for retailers for both the outlets and the Street overall in terms of future [indiscernible] (14:27)?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, Jersey Gardens is – we consider it more of a mills as opposed to an outlet center. It was
essentially modeled after the mills. So it appeals to a broad consumer base, but it's got the entertainment, it's got the big
boxes. It does have a smattering of a pure outlet retailers. But I wouldn't – Christy, I wouldn't consider that an outlet
center, so to speak. Your – unfortunately, we did have not such a good connection on your question. But I think you
mentioned about the potential about outlets coming closer to major metropolitan marketplaces, was that the question?
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: Right. Yeah. And what that means for obsolescence, future obsolescence of existing
outlets?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, outlet business is very competitive. We have a good portfolio. Our results speak
for themselves. So I think we'll continue to be able to grow our comp and align our portfolio. I think in all of retail real
estate, you can never stand still. You've got to invest in the product. You've got to make it better whether it's outlets'
full price, lifestyle, et cetera, that's what we're all about, that what we're grounded in. We focus on lease by lease,
market by market, deal by deal, and we live in a very competitive market. We'll continue to hopefully do well.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Hey, David. It's Michael Bilerman speaking. And there's an echo, I guess, when we're
asking the question. I don't know if that's partially why [indiscernible] (16:44).
<A - David E. Simon>: Sorry about that. I will check in to see if we can change that by the time the call is done.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: No worries. So, I just have one a question on global. You obviously have Klépierre
two-and-a-half years ago that you went into. You're leveraging Klépierre now effectively to buy Corio and consolidate
in Europe, given McArthurGlen that you've made an investment in, you obviously have the outlet business that you've
been growing internationally, all the Australian journalists thinks that they spotted your plane in Australia, which you
denied, but it's out there, and I'm just – I'm curious how much time are you spending the U.S. versus non-U.S.? As you
think about the growth with Simon, how important is that international aspect going to be?
<A - David E. Simon>: You mean me personally?
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Well, probably as strategic growth initiatives. How much time are you spending
outside the U.S. versus inside the U.S.?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, generally, roughly, our outlet business represents 10% of our – from Asia, to
Europe, to McArthurGlen – so, let's say, it's around 10%...
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: International.
<A - David E. Simon>: ... international – I'm sorry, our international business. And honestly, other than where you
have the episodic nature of deals, I would tell you that I work very hard – don't feel sorry for me, okay? But – so, I
would say to you that, generally, other than the episodes of deal-making, I spent around the same amount of time.
But we have a great team in our international. I have added a colleague that you probably haven't met, that's done an
unbelievable job to relieve the [indiscernible] (18:54-18:55), but I wouldn't say it's abnormally different than what the

international business represents in terms of our investment.
At the end of the day, we haven't made a huge – the good news is we're in the money in everything that we've done.
But when you put it in the scheme of our, roughly, $90 billion asset base, we haven't made this huge unbelievable bet,
internationally. And I spent roughly 10% of my time.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Right. And I was thinking more so into the future, whether that's changed at all. And
we see that percentages have moved up to a quarter of the company or 30% or 40% of the company.
<A - David E. Simon>: I think the – given that what we're doing in the U.S., it's not – that's probably not likely in any
short- or medium-term horizon.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
All right. Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Yes. Good morning, everyone.
<A - David E. Simon>: How are you doing?
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Pretty good. Just a quick question on the development and redevelopment. It does seem like
with the supplemental this quarter [indiscernible] (20:14) yield on expected development and redevelopment came
down slightly for the mall redevelopment...
<A - David E. Simon>: I'm glad you are very perceptive. And let me – and I'm glad you asked the question. So, King
of Prussia is now a go-deal. It's a big deal, and it did drop our redevelopment yield a little bit because it's not – I know
you grow a custom designing having 10% returns on every deal we do, sometimes, a little lower. But it's still very
accretive when you look at where that property is valued today. But we don't hand out or give out return. So, that –
with that, it is a major development – redevelopment, I should say, and that did lower the return.
On the outlet side, I'd say two things. We've taken out Charlotte and Minneapolis. We've added Tucson and Tampa.
Charlotte, Minneapolis were very high-double digits. Tucson and Charlotte.
<A>: Tampa.
<A - David E. Simon>: I'm sorry, Tucson and Tampa are, on average, 11. The others were higher than that. So, when
you bring that two together, it dropped it a touch. Now, I will say to this, we're very conservative on our new
development, both Tucson and Tampa are double digits. But the way they're coming in and the other two that are
coming out dropped it oh so small.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Okay. It's really more of a [indiscernible] (21:56).
<A - David E. Simon>: Let me be perfectly clear. We have no execution issue. We have no cost overrun. It's just a mix
changed by the addition of the Plaza, the King of Plaza, and then the two outlets opened and the two new ones coming
in.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Great. That's very helpful. Thanks for the explanation.
<A - David E. Simon>: And you're quite welcome.

All right. Great. Our next question comes from Paul Morgan from MLV.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Hi. Good morning. The releasing spread is also just ticked down a bit and I mean I know
there's some noise, but you kind of been in an upward trend and it is a rolling 12. So, I just want to maybe get any
comments on spreads, your outlook for them, whether the changes – whether the sales volatility has had any impact
than – that's the question.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, it wasn't that long ago, say less than a year ago, that spreads were 14%, 15%. So, I
will just tell you from our standpoint, we're pleased with basically having $9.5-plus spread and 17%. I mean I wouldn't
– we have to look at this a little bit on a longer-term basis. So, I would say we're very pleased with 17%. It's higher than
it was a year ago. Yes, it is a little bit lower than Q1 and Q2.
I certainly wouldn't overreact on that on any basis. The re-leasing spreads are driving our industry-leading 5.4%
year-to-date comp NOI growth. And we are executing this in – clearly, a cautious consumer-oriented environment, and
obviously last year the consumer shut down a little bit because of the weather, this, that and the other thing. So, I'm
pleased, I'm happy and I think we're executing very well.
We're going through – in terms of how we look at that next year, very simple, as you know, we've been doing this 20
years. We have the pleasure of – starting November 10, I believe, going through each and every mall, lease-by-lease,
deal-by-deal, which rolls into our plan, which we'll share with you in early next year.
And so, until that's done, I don't have a prediction about what our spreads will be other than we continue to believe
we're – our rollovers are under market [indiscernible] (25:02-25:04) the future growth of our business. Industry-leading
opportunities, in my opinion, has been reinforced by year-after-year-after-year of continual, unabated outperformance.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: The only thing I would also add is that our occupancy cost remains very moderate, which
shows you that we still have plenty of room to grow those rents.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yes. Paul, this is Steve. I'll just add one thing. If you look at our 8-K over the last 8
quarters, we consistently signed new leases between $63 and $67 a foot. And if you look at our lease expiration
schedule, you can see that they're still in the mid $40s for the next several years. So, still feel very good about marking
the expiring leases to market.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: So, yes, I know you haven't given guidance, but that kind of high-teens number? Is – there's
no reason to think that, that's not sustainable, it's not, maybe, potential upside.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, we – I know you're – Paul, you're smart and you want us to talk about next year.
We have tremendous confidence in our business and our platform. And the thing that I would have you rely on is what
we've done year after year. And as I said to you, we'll share our guidance early next year.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
All right. Great. Our next question comes from Jeff Spector from Bank of America.
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: Good morning. I'm also here with Craig, who will have a question after me. My question was
just focused on Sears' decision to lease space to Primark. Also, Amazon's announcement to open a store in New York
City, we've been getting a lot of incoming calls, questions on those announcements and what that could mean. If you
could just provide some thought on those announcements and maybe where you think things continue with Sears in
their leasing effort.
<A - David E. Simon>: Let me – I'll have – I'll give you two quick top of the head remarks, and then I'll let Rick add
whatever he wants. Look, on Amazon, leasing space, I'm not – all the details aren't out. But there's clearly a benefit for

the overused word, omni-channel, bricks-and-clicks, however, you want to describe it. There's a real benefit.
In fact, it's very interesting. When I see Sears as a online retailer, depending on which study you look at, I mean they're
anywhere from – they're clearly in the top 10. They may be as high as number five, and I would argue it's because of
their physical presence that allows them to be so important in the online presence.
And you've heard it from retailers that the synergy between having the physical and the online presence, and now, the
move toward mobile and how it's all being integrated. So – and clearly, we've seen a number of pure online retailers
going to physical stores. So, it's got to be in the equation for a retailer to have a physical presence. I don't think there's
any question in that. And as our retailers have gotten more sophisticated in the online world, I think that's going to play
to our benefit.
On the Sears' leasing, we have one that we've consented to in King of Prussia. That was part of their agreement to
consent to our ability to expand the two centers. We work very collectively to do that. I think Sears would be the first to
tell you that, in certain markets and certain stores, they don't underperform or, in fact, they have too much space, and
they will look to release some of that space or sell some of the real estate. We still think they have a physical presence
that's going to be important to them. And we'll continue to work with them on a collaborative basis that meets our
needs and our shoppers' needs and theirs, and we expect at the end of the day for both of us to benefit from that.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: What I would add is that focusing on the Primark side, very highly productive iconic
retailer in Europe and the UK. We have been working with them for over six months. We have already visited them at
their headquarters and toured their stores where they operate. And we're very excited about their entry into the U.S. We
anticipate that there will hopefully be several other opportunities both within our portfolio or other Sears stores which
they have already alluded to. And I would also point out that we got involved with the Primark early on as our
Klépierre team already had a pre-existing relationship with them.
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: Thank you. And before I pass on to Craig, he has a quick question, congratulations, Steve, on
your retirement. Craig has one question.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Thank you.
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: Great.
<A - David E. Simon>: We've all concluded that we're all just [indiscernible] (31:05-31:07) so we just want to go on
record for that, all right?
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: Yeah. Us too.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Okay. I was just going to ask what were some of the takeaways from your shopping
block events, and just maybe some general thoughts on the millennials and the malls.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think they're an important customer base. I think they represent a unique
opportunity for us. The millennials represent a bigger population than the baby boomers, so it's very important for us to
connect with them the way they want to be connected. I think they like mall shopping. And we're going to experiment
and do lots of things oriented around them to continue to make them important consumer base in our properties. But
we're not going to ignore the baby boomers either because they have a lot of spend.
So, I think as millennials get older and we can continue to offer them entertainment restaurant and the right retailers in
the properties and connect with them the way they want to be connected. It's a great opportunity for us. Rick, I don't –
Rick, do you want to add anything?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: The only thing I would say to echo David's point, the research that we've done has shown
that the millennials are, in fact, very supportive of the mall channel and are very much focused on going there. So, it's a
natural thing for us to try and exploit and enhance.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: I was also noticing you used two outlets to do the initial rollout with Refinery29. How
did those go?

<A - David E. Simon>: Very well, so that relationship's early but I'd say, generally, we're very pleased. We're creating
buzz in that whole marketplace and our – along those lines, Craig, we're making some initial investments in early-stage
companies really to enhance the environment.
But I think all the good news is that there's a lot that we can do to enhance our environments and we are as committed
as anyone to do that. We've got the balance sheet, the capital, the – hopefully, the creativity and the willingness to take
risk to do that, which all companies, I think need to be in this position to do. It would be easy for us to rest on our
industry-leading growth, but as you know us very well, that is not in our DNA. And so, we're going to do it from
marketing, to leasing, to development and everywhere in between.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Thank you. I agree.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thank you.

Okay. Our next question comes from Andrew Rosivach from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Caitlin Burrows. Resource have been opened about the
need for physical presence to showcase, even though much of their sales are generated online. Can you talk about how
you capture the economic value of a store that doesn't necessarily run through that store's cash register?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look there's – that's – in our leases, even if it's done in the store, but fulfilled online,
that's part of our sales. That's not really too much of an issue. And I think for all physical retailers, the important – and
even with their online business, they have a multiplier effect that's very important that they see when they have a
physical presence with their online consumer. And they can describe it in great detail. It's anywhere from 3x to 4x.
So, the convergence is there. It's happening and the good news is our retailers are combating effectively the pure online
retailer. And the online retailer understands for them to – beyond the first mover advantage of someone like Amazon
had, in order for them to really grow their business, I think and many, many believe, they need to have a physical
presence because of the way it's moved to mobile and the way it's – the multiplier effect that the omni-channel world is
presenting itself in.
So, that bears, I think, extremely well for us in creating the next wave of retailers. We see that just beginning. So the
interesting thing is the online retailers have still got this unbelievable advantage, and we see it ourselves in
[indiscernible] (37:08-37:11). And giving that benefit even though they should be collecting that use tax instead of
sales tax, but taking advantage of that benefit that the consumer not necessarily entitled to.
As that has begun to swing because a lot of them have a nexus now with warehouses and the like, as that has balanced,
that's going to level the playing field. Obviously, it would be great. We could get congress to level that playing field,
which they should be doing, then I think that's going to reinforce the advantages of bricks and mortar, because at the
end of the day, when you're looking to shop, the mobile device or even the desktop really can't present the good
services that are available with that retailer that a physical environment can.
Yes, they can save you the sales or use tax. Yes, they may have an advantage in convenience, which is slowly being
dealt with by our retailers through pick-up in stores, ship from store. But once that sales tax, use tax advantage is
eliminated, which I think it will be, through nexus toward the government, we'll see. I think our retailers can be really
damn competitive.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Just on the topic of equal playing field. So, Amazon now charges sales tax in 23 states. What
else is remaining to be done on the topic of tax parity? Is there anything that you guys are doing?
<A - David E. Simon>: We're trying. But there are roadblocks in congress, and we're not here to complain about the
government, believe me. But we just want a level playing field, and then the consumer is going to make that choice but

they shouldn't be – and we should let the state decide how they want to deal with it. But it should be level and at the
end of the day, the best retailer, the best mall operator will come out ahead.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Okay. Thanks.

All right, great. Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Thank you. And, Steve, congrats, and thanks for all your help over the years.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Thanks, Ki.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: You're welcome. So, a couple of quick questions. The first, going back to the Sears topic, if Sears
decides to lease their space – sublease their space on their own, do you guys generally have veto power or do other
anchors at the center have veto power? And is there any chance that you can partake on the upside assuming they're –
granted there was probably a significant upside in rent.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, there's two questions there. We certainly have substantial ability to control what
Sears can do with their stores based on existing leases or reciprocal leasing agreements. So, that is yes. With respect to
the upside, to the extent the transaction is being done by Sears within their store, with their capital, it's their transaction,
but we certainly benefit in a position like where you're adding a Primark at King of Prussia or a Dick's at King of
Prussia, that certainly will strengthen our overall offering for our shoppers but not financially if it's being done inside
the Sears store with Sears capital.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Do other anchors have a say?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: It depends on the documents and it depends on the scope of what Sears is contemplating
with their building.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. Thanks for that. And just last question from me. Klépierre, if I understand that deal
correctly, it's going to be a full stock deal between Klépierre and Corio which would, in effect, dilute your equity stake
from the 29% roughly to sub-20%. I'm sure you'll let me know if I got this wrong. Any thoughts on re-upping your
equity stake in Klépierre?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, you don't have it wrong, but I'm not going to answer that question. We like the
investment. It's been a very good investment for us. We think as a reference shareholder and as – and being on the
board, we've added real value. And we are, obviously, we do believe in the merger or acquisition of Corio, and we
support it. And we believe that scale on our business is really important because – on all sorts of fronts, capital, retail,
relationships, ability to invest in the consumer experience, et cetera.
So we're optimistic that that investment will continue to be good for us and grow in value. But I really can't tell you
about whether or not, going forward, we'll increase our stake. But we're pleased and we think there's still opportunity
going forward with our investment in Klépierre.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. I mean, the reason I asked was it seems [indiscernible] (43:13-43:16)
<A - David E. Simon>: I understand. And I hope you understand why I couldn't answer.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: No. I get that. It just seems like a nice area where you could put maybe a $1.5 billion of additional
capital at a very attractive – well, relative to your cost of capital, a very attractive yield. So that's why I asked. But
thank you for your answer.

<A - David E. Simon>: I mean, yeah, listen, the yield on our investment in Europe in both at Klépierre and
McArthurGlen and in Asia have been fantastic. I mean, they've been great yields. And that's what's helped drive our
industry-leading growth.

Great. Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning. How are you doing, Alex?
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Doing well. And, Steve, congrats on the even earlier retirement.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. I just want to go on record. You will have him. You can hug him and kiss him because
he will be going to NAREIT. You can bring him gifts, but don't bring him too much because we'd have to report it
given our conflict of interest policy. But you can hug him and kiss him and whatever else you want. Buy him a drink,
whatever else you want to do with him.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: As long as he gives plenty of strokes on the course, that's what matters. So, question
on Japan, I mean, I'll try to channel my inner David Harris. If we read the headlines correctly, retail sales in Japan have
been impacted because of the increase in sales tax, and yet your productivity over there is actually up year-over-year.
So, is it just a nuance of when the tax hit or is there a difference going on from what the newspapers are reporting
versus what's going on at your outlets?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think our outlets are just so uniquely positioned. And with the increase in that there,
clearly, you had some forward spending and then it did have an initial monthly impact, but then it's kind of level back. I
just think the consumer there is going to look for even more value given the higher VAT rates. So, we just have a
unique portfolio that will continue to perform. But it's affected retail sales, generally, but it's really good to be in the
value space there with great product and a great retailer lineup.
But don't take kid yourself. I mean when you increase your VAT, you're going to affect consumption. We're just a little
bit better positioned to deal with it than some other property types.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. And then as far as the Sears transaction goes, the fact that Eddie is going direct
with retailers, does this sort of indicate that basically the gap is too wide versus what he thinks his boxes are worth and
what the mall landlords think it's worth and, therefore, he's just going direct? Or do you think that we will see some
more trades, because it would seem like the value of his boxes has maximized if you guys can get control of it and do
what you want to do with it versus him doing something with it.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, there's a – we've had a, let's see, 50-some-odd-year relationship with Sears through
a lot of ups and downs, and good times and so on, we expect to continue to have an excellent relationship. I don't think
anything's off the table buying, selling, leasing, sub-leasing, working cooperatively, nothing's off the table there.
Again, I think the market wants to take one scenario extrapolated, I appreciate that. Just like they want to take the one
Amazon space, if in fact they're doing it and extrapolate it. I don't think you can extrapolate anything like that. And we
will – they were on the Primark King of Prussia, given where they are situated in the mall, and what they had already
done with the one level which we cooperated, we felt like Primark would be a very good replacement where they're
situated, plus we needed their cooperation in what we're trying to accomplish. And it happened to be that we were
absolutely aligned, and that set of circumstances, and we think we created a win-win. And I would expect, given the
55-year history, that we'll continue to find those kind of situations with Sears in most cases.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

All right. Great. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from ISI Group.
<Q - Steve T. Sakwa>: Thanks. I wanted to just follow-up on the Primark situation. We understand in Europe and
London, they're kind of, primarily, 35,000 foot boxes. And I think the initial seven, they're taking much larger footprint.
So, I know you haven't announced direct deals with them, but do you anticipate or would you envision sort of more
Sears sublease space, or do you actually think you could do direct deals with them? And would you envision them kind
of being an in-line tenant if [indiscernible] (49:21-49:41)
<A - David E. Simon>: ...properties and others they won't and all depend upon this set of circumstances. And just
because the King of Prussia is one deal that we consented to, it doesn't necessarily mean that, that's going to be the
model on all the others. So, Steve, like I said it's going to be a case-by-case scenario. I would be – if their model is, i.e.
success here, which certainly by every indication of the presence they have in Europe, you would potentially anticipate.
But others have come here and have not done as well, but let's – if it is, then I think it'll be a combination of all the
above where there'll be some consents with Sears on subleases. We'll lease directly. We'll redevelop pads and the like
and it's all going to depend upon the set of circumstances that present itself of that property.
<Q - Steve T. Sakwa>: Okay. Thanks. I guess part of your first answer got cut off, so I apologize. I didn't hear the
whole thing. Just in terms of kind of the type of tenant they are, the price point, do you envision that they could sort of
fit into a large part of the portfolio or do you see them in different kind of segments within the portfolio?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, they're certainly not a luxury store or – higher-end properties, probably not a great fit,
but I'm going to wait and see and see what their store looks like in the U.S., how they – what kind of consumer they're
delivering. And we'll go from there.
The King of Prussia was a relatively a simple decision for us because of where that Sears box is. But I think, again, it's
going to be dependent upon the circumstances. And I hope you're hearing this. But I guess we're having serious
problems with our communication, but I hope you can hear it, Steve.
<Q - Steve T. Sakwa>: No, I did. Thanks. And then I guess just last question. In terms of the kind of the home
delivery, how has that sort of progressed for the mall REITs in general and are there changes you're making for this
upcoming holiday season? And just kind of what's been the early, I guess, maybe coming up on one year, how do you
think that system and service are working?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, Deliv is just one of our efforts along those lines. I think we're pleased as a group.
They've signed up a couple of major, major retailers and they're starting to do shipping this holiday season. And I do
think, over time, there clearly is going to be the ability to deliver or pick up a lot of mall goods at the mall environment.
And I think we're, as an industry and individually, we're just scratching the surface there.
<Q - Steve T. Sakwa>: Okay. Thanks. That's it for me.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

<Q>: Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Most of my questions have been answered. Just one quick one. It looks like you
sold an asset this quarter and reported close to $18 million gain. Just any color on that sale.

Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Dave, I wanted to get updated read from you on the upcoming holiday season. Look,
some of your peers noted last quarter that the consumer was in a bit of a cautious state. How would you assess that
mood today? And in conjunction with that, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how this year's back-to-school shopping
season materialized versus your expectations and what your read on the consumer pulse today and your expectation for
the approaching holiday.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, simplistically, consumer, I believe, continues to be somewhat cautious. The good news
is there's an environment where, I think, at some point in the near future, they will be less cautious, lower oil or lower
gas prices, better job environment, hopefully wage growth, continuation of lower interest rates, just some of those out
there. But they're still cautious.
And that's how we're planning, that's how we're running our business. I don't make – I'm not equipped to make a
forecast on the holiday season; others might, I will not. There's lots of forecasters out there on the holiday season. The
ones that I see or generally feel like it's going to be [indiscernible] (55:23-55:26) last year, weather, hopefully, won't
replicate itself the way it was, longer season, to name a couple. But I don't – I'm not in that business.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Care to share any comments on this year's back-to-school shopping season?
<A - David E. Simon>: The – I think it was generally spotty. I mean, I think certainly it wasn't robust. And I think it
still represented the cautious consumer.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Okay. Fair enough. And just I wanted to confirm one or two things here. First, that the
recent Jersey Gardens and UPV acquisitions will hit the same store in 1Q 2016. And then any color on the lease
termination fees. I was wondering if there were any other non-recurring items in the quarter beyond those – it looks like
$0.02 about lease termination fees and the debt prepayment charges.
<A - David E. Simon>: Simply on Jersey Gardens, it wouldn't be in our comp NOI until 2016, that's correct. And
listen, we've got – given – we are a big company, so we're always going to have other income that could be higher or
lower quarter-to-quarter. Same thing on the expense side, the – but as far as I can – having examined the financials
extremely closely, nothing jumps out at me. The lease settlement income, probably in the scheme of the total years, is
not all that different than some other previous years. It does ebb and flow. We've always got a little bit of extra income
here and extra expense year in and year out, given the nature of our business, but nothing to highlight frankly.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Got you. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Good morning. Question about just, I guess, I'd call it the value proposition of SPG asset
management. If you were to benchmark the in-place rents to the two malls that you were buying from Glimcher to
similar malls that you already own, what do you think the delta is in revenue or NOI per square foot that you could
realize under your management? Is there a way to estimate or quantify that for us?

<A - David E. Simon>: Well, very good question, Jeff. I would say to you, generally, we don't buy any asset if we
don't feel like we can improve it. And there's – so that's kind of a theme that we have regardless of what we do, whether
it's new development, redevelopment, or importantly, acquisitions. What can we do to beat the growth rate that may
exist if that asset is – just sits there and owns.
But the fact of the matter is, I'm not going to give you a number on that. I mean, people are – again, not to put this in
context, but Sawgrass is a unique animal. But when we took it over, I remember the numbers, more or less, correctly, it
was around $55 million of NOI. And next year, we did add a little bit of space here and there and stuff, but next year,
generally, I think it's going to do around 130-ish. We haven't gone lease by lease. There, we might skip lease by lease,
because it can take us three days.
But I think the fact that we were able to do that, not only helped our investors, but also helped the consumers and the
retailers, because I think they did a lot more business with it in our hands. So, we invested more in it. We drove the
tourism. We got better retailers. We got more consumers. The retailers did more business. And everybody was
copacetic, even though Mills have done a good job at $55 million or whatever the rough number was.
So, we think we can drive more traffic to Jersey Gardens. Though I firmly believe Glimcher has done a great job with
that asset. So, that we're experts in tourism. It's right by Newark Airport. I think we can figure out how to get a few
more buses from Newark to go to Jersey before they go to – Rick and I will flag them ourselves if we have to, to make
the numbers work.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Maybe, Steve, that could be your next career move. Actually, a follow-up also, David, is as it
relates to the project that you're looking at Copley Place in Boston, there's a lot of residential products in the pipeline in
Boston for sale, as well as for rent. Does that give you any pause with proceeding on the project? Or are you, sort of,
past the point of no return or is it – not as concerned about it?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, no. We're always focused on supply. We are not past the point of no return. And we're
still working on approval rights both within the appropriate agencies in Boston, but also we have to work through some
of the retailer issues. So we are not at a point of no return and we studied the supply [indiscernible]
(01:01:26-01:01:28) carefully. And it's going to be a gut-check decision here, I would say, Jeff, in the next three or four
months.
Generally, we still feel very, very confident about it, but there's a little bit difference than what we've done historically
as you might imagine. We are really good experts on supply, understanding supply and retail, what's going to get done,
what's going to have an impact, a competitive world, very competitive world in retail. This one is a little bit different.
We hired a couple of great experts to do comp lease, so we've got the in-house expertise. We also obviously hired the
right people in Boston to help us go through that exercise. But it's a good question. It's going to be a gut-check time.
But we are not past the point of no return.
And as you know, in real estate, whether it's office, retail, whatever, there's always announcements of supply. The real
question is what gets built and who gets there first, and who's got staying power. I will tell you this. It's an iconic asset.
It's only getting better. The design is fantastic. Boston is a great long-term city and Lord, I hope we have staying power.
So, we've got a lot of stuff on our side of the equation that gives us confidence that if we do pull the trigger, we will
execute.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: And then just the last question for Rick. I know you touched on spreads and I'm sympathetic to
looking at it over long term. But someone have asked earlier about the pullback and the dollar spread came back a little
bit slightly this quarter. Is that just a function of mix maybe in the quarter or was there any kind of pushback from
retailers in light of the softer retail sales?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: There really has been no pushback from the retailers in terms of their demand and it's
basically a function of mix, what deals come in, in a given period of time. So we're still seeing a very focused retail
with the one space. And candidly, you can look at that with our occupancy and with all the activity that we have going
on in the portfolio.

<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. And let me – because, again, this is a good question. It's a good focus. But let me – let
you – I want you to understand how we think about the business. If we own one property, we could absolutely
maximize rents to the last penny, because at the end of the day, that's all we would care about.
Jeff, we believe in repeat business with our retailers. So we're always calibrating – and we don't – we're not perfect at
this. Believe me. We make mistakes all the time. But we're always trying to calibrate the win-win. All right.
How do you keep the retailer who is our customer, in addition to the consumer, happy? How do we reach our financial
goals? But we are not getting the last dollar, because we do multiple deals, multiple business with them, year after year,
day after day. And so we're never going to maximize rents if we just own one asset.
And so you just need to have that lens on. Yes. Even with that lens on, we still out produce everybody else. But we're
not trying to get to the point of no return. We're trying to find that balance. And I'll be the first to tell you, sometimes
we don't do it. Sometimes we make mistakes. But we're always trying to find that balance for future positive relations
with our clients going forward.
Just like any other business. So let's put that in that perspective. Okay? But that's why we have the opportunity to find
other opportunities that even though we may not maximize – the spread being $9.67, is that the right number? It could
have been $10. Maybe that $0.33 we picked up because they're going to do this, that and the other things for us. So
there is always that balance. And you got to put it in that lens. It's important to understand that.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Yeah. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan from Cowen.
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: Thank you. Just a quick follow-up to Jeff's question on Copley. And I understand it's not –
the plans are not finalized as you've explained. But can you give us kind of a ballpark number that, that project would
entail in terms of total cost?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, sure. It's around – the total cost, Jim, is around $550 million. And again, the vision that
we have on – the top, roughly, 10 floors would be condo sales. We're also expanding Neiman's as part of it and other
retail. So we look at it gross, but then we have condo sales to net. And [indiscernible] (01:07:33-01:07:35) differential,
though it's an art, not necessarily science. That differential – and then we'd own the multi-family, that differential is
roughly – don't hold me of these numbers – is roughly a $300 million-ish differential. But that puts us in – it's kind of a
financial consequence box. And...
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: Okay. Good.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. And that number, from a return, as we look at it, that return is acceptable given what
we're doing there, okay? And I don't want to – I'm not going to give you that number just yet. But when we go, it'll be
in our 8-K, but that's essentially how we're thinking about the deal.
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: Good. Thanks for that. Just a kind of follow-up question on the earlier discussion about
Primark as well, and you had mentioned Primark, Zara, H&M on the second quarter call. And obviously, the European
retailers, they're kind of categorized as fashion apparel. I guess, Primark is more promotional. And all three already
have sizeable market shares in Europe where they operate alongside smaller, higher price point at apparel retailers.
Also, we obviously have Forever 21, UNIQLO growing aggressively here. I'm just curious, if we assume that these
large format retailers continue to grow their share of apparel sales, do you view that as a positive or a negative
regarding the same-property NOI growth prospects of this domestic Simon portfolio?

<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: It's Rick. I think that we price our real estate based on what we believe is the value of the
real estate. And everyone is going to have to compete for that real estate. The bottom line is that it's taken H&M a very
long time. They are now happily established and growing substantially. We're working with Zara, but frankly we have
a lot of very established domestic retailers here that are very competitive and continuing to grow. So, the more people
we have interested in our properties, the better off we are, just enhancing demand. And our job is to do the right kind of
mix in the price and space rates. And I think we've been doing pretty well so far.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. But it's a good question. And it's, again, it's a little more art than science. You got to
weigh the traffic that they may generate versus the competitive nature they may put certain retailers under. And
whether or not they're bringing a different consumer in. So you put it all together and you got to make judgment calls
day in and day out. So – but it's a good question and it's an art, you got to be very thoughtful about that, Jim.
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: Okay. Then, finally from me, and I'm may be asking you to repeat yourself, David, but I
think you did cut out on this. In terms of the Primark deal at King of Prussia, you mentioned it was – I think, you said
an easier decision because of the specific location. Can you just clarify what you meant by that?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, if you've been to the mall, in this case, the Sears box is not as well located as if we were
in the middle of a mall. And our decision may have been a little bit different, had it been, and it's just – so, it's really a
location issue. And the power of that mall is shifting in terms of kind of the focal point given our expansion is now –
we're actually under construction. And it was really – we felt good about it and we've got Sears cooperation on what we
were trying to accomplish to improve the mall. And we did think that because of their position, Primark would be great
to drive traffic down to that wing.
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

All right. Our next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Hey, everyone. Just a quick question, on the last quarter, you guys talked about a couple of deals
on the development side that were not outlets, just curious if there's anything to update on that front.
<A - David E. Simon>: You mean on full price?
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Right.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. We are getting closer, not quite there, but we're working diligently on one ground-up,
full-price development that, I'd say, over the next short period of time that we'll be making an announcement on it. It's
not quite everything is done. But we're optimistic that this will be a partnership that we're looking forward to working
on. But it's not quite all done. Handshake's in place, but stay tuned on that. We think it'll be great and it'll be – besides
redevelopment, it'll be our first full price in quite some time.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: And give a rough size – sort of size.
<A - David E. Simon>: The total investment will be north of $200 million, and we're going to be around the 50%
owner.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Our next question comes from comes from Mike Mueller from JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Curious. If you would weigh your sales based on mall NOI, how different would that
number be compared to the $613 million that you report?
<A - David E. Simon>: Great question. It would be much higher. But that's a great question because you – it's a great
question. And in fact, because every dollar is the same, it doesn't really – it doesn't, obviously, it doesn't do that. But the
fact is we could do it, but I don't have it at this time.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: It's about 10% higher.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. 10% higher?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: 10% higher.
<A - David E. Simon>: Steve Sterrett – but he's leaving, so I wouldn't count any numbers that he says. Steve Sterrett
says it's 10%. But I think we could probably do a little bit more work and get a better number. But it's a very interesting
question.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Got it. Okay. That was it. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure. Thank you.
Operator
And there are no further questions. I'll turn it back to David Simon for closing remarks.
David E. Simon
Okay. Thank you and look forward to seeing you in the future.
