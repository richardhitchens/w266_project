Operator
Welcome to The Walt Disney Company Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Hilda
and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will
conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Singer, you may begin.
Lowell Singer
Good afternoon and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's fourth-quarter 2014 earnings call. Our press release was
issued almost 45 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being
webcast and the webcast will also be available on our website.
Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jay Rasulo, Senior

Robert A. Iger
Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to announce that fiscal 2014 was the biggest year in the
history of The Walt Disney Company, with operating income up 21% to over $13 billion and adjusted EPS up 27% to

$4.32. We're obviously very pleased with this historic performance and believe it reflects the extraordinary quality of
our creative content. It also demonstrates our unique ability to leverage our content across the company and to adapt to
emerging consumer trends and technology.
Today, I want to focus on our unrivaled content pipeline and its tremendous value in an evolving distribution
environment. The accelerated advances in technology have created a new Golden Age for content, with more
opportunities than ever before to reach people around the world. Our extensive pipeline of branded content from
Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, ABC, and ESPN puts us in a unique position to create significant value in this
dynamic era, as evidenced by our four consecutive years of record performance.
Our Studio business has been a tremendous content engine, driving opportunity across the company. In fiscal 2014, the
Studio achieved record operating income and also released four of the year's biggest movies: Frozen, Guardians of the
Galaxy, Maleficent, and Captain America 2. Most are franchise drivers, and this focus on creating and growing
franchises is even more pronounced in our slate of future releases. The most obvious example of this strategy is
Marvel, which has become a strong brand since our 2009 acquisition.
The five Marvel movies we've distributed to-date have averaged almost $1 billion in global box office and established
two new franchises, The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. Marvel has a brilliant team of storytellers, with an
incredible slate of upcoming movies that create unbelievable potential for our entire company, starting with the
long-awaited Avengers sequel, Age of Ultron, which will be in theaters next May. Ant-Man will open in July, followed
by Captain America 3 and Dr. Strange in 2016 and then Guardians of the Galaxy 2, Thor: Ragnarok, and Black Panther
in 2017.
There will also be three Marvel releases the following year, The Avengers: Infinity War Part 1, as well as Captain
Marvel and Inhumans. And in 2019, we'll release the second part of The Avengers: Infinity War.
And on the Star Wars front, this morning, we announced the name of Episode VII, which is The Force Awakens, and
we're looking forward to its release on December 18 of next year. I was on the set in London just before filming
wrapped and saw some exciting footage. And so far everything suggests this will be the movie Star Wars fans around
the world have been waiting and hoping for. We'll follow The Force Awakens with a release of our first of three
standalone movies in 2016. Episode VIII will be in theaters the following year and we'll complete the trilogy with
Episode IX in 2019.
We've got a strong slate of upcoming Disney-branded movies, including our very first live-action Cinderella, which
brings one of our most beloved heritage characters to life in a whole new way for a new generation. We're also looking
forward to Into the Woods, Tomorrowland, The Jungle Book, and Alice in Wonderland 2, as well as a new movie from
our Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.
And our animation is stronger than ever as well. In the last four years, we've released seven major animated movies
under the Disney and Pixar brands to an average global box office of $750 million, including Frozen, which became the
most successful animated movie of all time and a tremendous franchise. Our creative momentum continues with
Disney Animation's Big Hero 6. It's a great movie, and given the incredible reviews it's generating, we expect a strong
opening weekend when it opens tomorrow.
Next June, we'll release Inside Out, a truly innovative original movie from Pixar, and we'll follow that with three
animated features in fiscal 2016, Pixar's The Good Dinosaur, and Finding Dory, the sequel to Finding Nemo, and
Zootopia from Disney Animation.
And today I'm thrilled to announce that John Lasseter will direct another fantastically original Toy Story movie. Toy
Story 4 will be in theaters in June 2017. John created Toy Story and directed its first two films and it's great to have
him back directing one of our most valuable properties. As you know, Toy Story 3 was a tremendous success,
generating wide critical acclaim as well as more than $1 billion in global box office and almost $10 billion in retail
sales, demonstrating that these wonderful characters are clearly just as relevant and beloved as ever.

In fiscal 2014, we had 11 franchises, 5 more than $1 billion each in retail sales, and more than half of them originated
from our Studio. We're releasing a total of 21 tent pole movies under our great banner brands over the next three years
compared to only 13 in the last three years. While there is no sure thing in a creative business, we believe the proven
appeal of our brands and franchises reduces risk and maximizes our unique ability to create significant long-term value
by leveraging successful content across our diverse array of businesses.
Turning to our Media business, ABC is off to an excellent start this season. And while other networks have seen ratings
trend down significantly, ABC is holding strong and is number one in C3 ratings, excluding sports. We're especially
pleased that the network's performance is driven by the success of shows owned by ABC Studios.
Once Upon a Time is up 22% year-over-year in C3 ratings for the key demo. And Scandal, one of the fastest-growing
shows last year, is also up this season. Additionally, ABC has the number one new comedy, Black-ish, as well as the
number one new drama, How to Get Away with Murder.
At ABC News, Good Morning America continues its reign as the number one morning show, and World News with
David Muir is number one in the key news demo. ESPN has locked down an extraordinary portfolio of sports rights
well into the next decade, including deals with the NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball as well as the SEC, ACC,
Pac-12 and Big 12. ESPN will also be home to the College Football Playoffs for the next dozen years, starting with the
first-ever playoff in January, which is already generating a lot of buzz.
Now I'd like to turn to the evolving distribution landscape. The media environment is far too dynamic for anyone to
expect the status quo to continue. We've clearly demonstrated our willingness and ability to be at the forefront of
change impacting our industry, driving technology and business models that enhance value to consumers.
Given the quality of our content and the strength of our brands, Disney is in a great position to thrive in any distribution
environment. The multi-channel model provides compelling value to consumers relative to a collection of SVOD and
over-the-top services, as evidenced by the fact that there are 101 million multi-channel subscribers in the U.S. today,
down only slightly from 101.5 million a year ago. Economic factors as well as technical advances and an explosion of
entertainment choices drove this relatively small erosion.
Consumers in most markets can get a multi-channel subscription with more than 150 channels and a wide array of
diverse and quality programming for around $65 a month, a much greater value than a do-it-yourself portfolio of
standalone options. Between ESPN, ABC, ABC Family and Disney Channels, we own a collection of compelling
broadcasting cable networks. We continue to invest in high quality content across the board to ensure they remain
relevant and valuable to viewers on any platform, and we believe we are extremely well-positioned for the future.
And now I'm going to let Jay walk you through the details of our fourth quarter and fiscal year. Jay?
Jay Rasulo
Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding items affecting
comparability, were $0.89, an increase of 16% over last year, and for the fiscal year, earnings per share, excluding
items affecting comparability, were a record $4.32, or 27% higher than last year. The financial results we reported in
the fourth quarter and the record revenue, net income and earnings per share we posted in fiscal 2014 demonstrate how
our strategy of investing in high-quality content can generate attractive financial returns across all of our businesses
while further strengthening our brands and their position in the marketplace.
I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our fourth quarter results in more detail, and then I'll go through some key
factors to consider as we look to fiscal 2015. Let's start with the Studio, which had its best year ever with over $1.5
billion in operating income in fiscal 2014. Frozen was the biggest contributor to Studio results in the year; however, the
record Studio performance in 2014 was due to broad-based success across the entire slate.
And by the way, the Studio's record financial performance this year was without the release of a Pixar film. Studio
operating income more than doubled in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year due to strong

performance in worldwide theatrical and home entertainment markets. Higher worldwide theatrical results reflected the
performance of Guardians of the Galaxy and Maleficent in the fourth quarter compared to the performance of
prior-year releases. Home entertainment results reflected the strong performance of Frozen.
Q4 operating income at media networks was comparable to the fourth quarter last year. Results at cable are comparable
to prior year as lower operating income at ESPN was partially offset by higher operating income at worldwide Disney
channels. As expected, at ESPN, higher programming costs for Major League Baseball, NFL, college football and the
World Cup more than offset higher affiliate and advertising revenue. We also incurred incremental programming costs
due to the launch of the SEC Network.
Domestic cable affiliate revenue in the fourth quarter was up high single digits, due primarily to higher contractual
rates. Ad revenue at ESPN was up 5% in the quarter, driven by an increase in units sold and higher rates, partially
offset by lower ratings. At broadcasting, operating income was comparable to prior year as higher affiliate revenue and
higher income from program sales were largely offset by higher primetime programming costs and lower ad revenue at
the ABC network. Programming costs were higher in the quarter as a result of higher programming write-offs and a
higher cost mix of programming as well as contractual rate increases. Ad revenue at the network was down low single
digits in the fourth quarter due primarily to fewer units sold. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC
network is running 12% above upfront levels.
At Parks and Resorts, the investments we've made over the last couple of years, specifically in our domestic business,
continue to pay off. During the fourth quarter, operating income was up 20% on revenue growth of 7%. We continue to
see strength in our domestic operations due to increased spending and attendance at our domestic parks and a higher
spending in passenger cruise days at the Disney Cruise Line.
Results at our international parks were lower compared to last year, driven by lower results at Disneyland Paris.
Disneyland Paris recently announced a recapitalization plan aimed at helping to improve its capital structure and
liquidity while enabling it to continue investing in the guest experience, which we fully support.
Total segment margins were up 190 basis points in the fourth quarter and benefited by about 30 basis points due to new
initiatives. As we've said in the past, we expect investments in new initiatives to be accretive to operating income and
margins over time, and while two significant components of the investment plan, MyMagic+ and Shanghai Disney
Resort are still in ramp-up mode, the other investments are clearly making meaningful contributions to the segment's
results. The early returns we're seeing from MyMagic+ are encouraging. During the fourth quarter, MyMagic+ had a
positive contribution to year-over-year increase in the segment's operating income.
We continued to see positive trends in the business with the fourth quarter per capita spending in our domestic parks up
6% on higher ticket prices, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Attendance at our domestic parks was up
4%, with Walt Disney World setting a new fourth-quarter record. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 5%
and occupancy was up 5 percentage points to 83%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 11%
compared to prior-year levels, while booked rates are up 3%. The 11% percent includes the benefit of the timing of
promotional offers, but nevertheless, we feel very good about the volume and pricing trends we're seeing in the
business.
Our Consumer Products business continues to benefit from strong merchandise sales. In the fourth quarter, growth in
operating income was driven by the sales of Frozen and Spiderman merchandise. On a comparable basis, earned
licensing revenue was up 10%. At the Interactive segment, operating income was comparable to the prior year, as
strong results from our Japan games business and the recognition of a minimum guarantee were largely offset by lower
Infinity sales, driven by the timing of the release of Infinity 2.0.
As you recall, Infinity 2.0 was released in late September this year, so we had a shorter window for selling into retail
versus Infinity 1.0, which was released during the middle of August last year. We are very pleased with the results of
the first installment of the game, and we feel good about the launch of the second installment thus far, but we'll have a
better sense of overall performance as we enter the holiday season.

During the fourth quarter we repurchased 16.4 million shares for about $1.4 billion, and for fiscal 2014, we repurchased
84.4 million shares for $6.5 billion.
Before I conclude, let me proactively address a couple of questions you may have about 2015. We expect total
consolidated CapEx in 2015 to be about $1.5 billion higher than in 2014, or up $1.1 billion adjusted for the contribution
from our Shanghai partner. The increase in CapEx is primarily due to the ongoing investment in Shanghai Disney
Resort. We expect cable programming cost to grow low teen percentage points in fiscal 2015, primarily driven by the
first year of both our new NFL and College Football Playoffs contracts. The increase will be heavily skewed towards
the first half of the year, given the timing of the NFL and college football seasons.
Total segment operating income in fiscal 2015 will be adversely impacted by about $225 million due to higher pension
expense and a negative impact from FX. We will benefit from the 53rd week in our accounting calendar, which will fall
in the fiscal fourth quarter. Also in 2015, we expect to continue to return capital to our shareholders via share
repurchase and dividends. So far this year, we have opportunistically purchased 11.3 million shares for $970 million.
Fiscal 2014 was a record year for our company and as Bob discussed, there's much to look forward to in fiscal 2015
and beyond.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A.
Lowell Singer
All right. Thanks, Jay. Operator, we are ready for the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from
Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Hi, thanks. Two questions, if you don't mind. Both on the same theme, which is around affiliate
fees at the cable networks. So Bob, you gave a rather impassioned defense and advocation for the value of the bundle
as it exists. I know in recent quarters – or at least in the most recent quarter, though, you had a comment around how
some trading down to lower bundles or skinnier packages did have – didn't make a list of things that had hurt affiliate
fees at ESPN, and I think in the past quarter. I didn't see that on the list today, so I just wonder if there's any update on
sort of the trends or any more evidence of the growth of people seeking those lower bundles. And then the very quick
follow-up, if you don't mind. Jay, I don't know if you're willing to comment on anything specifically on affiliate fees in
Q4, just how they paced and any puts and takes on that. Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: We saw, Todd, some modest erosion of the expanded basic bundle, but it wasn't a driver of
earnings the quarter that we just announced. And I did have some bullish comments to make because if you look at the
numbers, and you see that 101 million households have some form of multi-channel bundle, it's still clearly the
dominant entertainment or television package in the home, and we think that's going to continue for the foreseeable
future. And while clearly the economy has had some impact over the last few years, and we do see that millennials
seem to be becoming subscribers a little bit later than perhaps they used to, we just feel that when you look at the
quality of what's offered, meaning the number of channels and the programming across those channels, and you
consider the price, that that is likely to remain dominant for a long time. Jay, do you want to...
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Yes. And on the cable affiliate revenue growth, Todd, as I said last quarter, we expected to see high
single-digit growth in the fourth quarter and in fact domestically we did see that high single-digit growth, mostly due to
contractual rate increases.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Okay. Thank you for that color. Thanks.

<A - Lowell Singer>: Todd, you're welcome. Operator, next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks. I have one for Bob and one for Jay. Bob, last month, the news came out that
you're extending your contract for two more years. And in the past, when we've asked you about your priorities, you've
said that you wanted to ensure that Shanghai and Star Wars would be successfully opened. So now that you're staying
for a few more years, what other priorities are you going to add to that list of things that you're focused on?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, thank you for the question. You know, when I got this job almost ten years ago, there
were three priorities. One was to make great content, high-quality branded content, and to put most of our capital in
that. Second was to use technology to distribute more broadly to make our company more efficient, to get closer to the
customer. And to innovate, meaning to make our products better through innovation and to create new products. And
the third was to grow internationally.
And it's interesting that here I am, essentially almost ten years after becoming CEO, and those are still the priorities.
We look at the movie slate and you look at Star Wars and you look at Marvel and you look at what we're doing with
Disney Animation and Pixar, there's no better example, probably, in terms of the first priority than that, and of course
Star Wars is something, particularly for the first film since we purchased Lucasfilm, that is a priority.
But I talked on an earlier interview about our movie slate. We have great visibility at the Studio to our movie slate
between now and 2020. I mentioned that in the next three years we've got 21 tent poles versus 13 in the last three years,
but if you look at the lineup that has not only been talked about but we've actually put into production – we've got
writers and directors and titles and development – it's unbelievably strong. And that ability, as you know, the ability the
company has to leverage that across our businesses should drive great growth. So there's nothing probably greater from
a priority perspective than that.
Shanghai Disneyland represents our best international growth initiative in a long time. And it's rising from the ground
as we speak in a pretty compelling way because of its size and the innovation and the breadth of its quality. And we
hope to be able to announce an opening date sometime early 2015, meaning the date that we will open. We think that
will be a great driver of growth in China and we believe that we've got more opportunities in Asia, not just in China,
but in other markets, for the company. So international continues to be a priority.
And the technology front, we took stock fairly recently at the technology and the technological efforts across our
company, and even we were blown away by the scale. Disney Movies Anywhere is just one recent example of that, the
MagicBand is another. When you see Big Hero 6 and you see where we've taken the quality of Disney Animation,
that's another one. So I don't intend to actually change my priorities at all in the remaining three and a half years that
I'm in this position, and I'm really excited about not only what we've got in store but what those priorities have meant
for the company in terms of creating value in the past nine years.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks, Bob. Let me ask Jay, following on the Shanghai comments. Jay, when you
look this fiscal year coming up, what is the impact on Shanghai on the operating expenses on the park side? I know
you've been building expenses as you, not opened, but had operating expenses, so how do you think about that in 2015?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Well, Michael, you know at the outset when we announced the building of this park, we said there
would be $300 million to $400 million of expenses that were part of that overall spend and that that tends to be very
back-loaded because a lot of those expenses are the hiring, training and pre-opening rehearsals, if you will, before we
start taking in revenue for the park. So they're very back-loaded.
And we also believe that when we announce the opening date, we'll have a better fix on exactly how those numbers
will affect fiscal 2015. But you should assume they will be pretty significant. But the good news is that as MyMagic+
ramps up in terms of overall new initiatives, we hope that the benefits from that project will actually offset, if you're

looking at the segment as a whole, the incremental cost that we're going to take on for Shanghai Disneyland. So I don't
think on balance they're going to be a huge driver in your model for park returns for the year.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. Thanks, Jay.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Yep. Thank you, Michael.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Operator. Next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Hi. Thank you. With so many great brands gaining momentum here that we're seeing, I
guess how should we think about the Consumer Products business long term? And specifically how much of a positive
influence might the opening of Shanghai Disney have on the growth opportunities with Consumer Products in China?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, I don't think that the opening of Shanghai Disney will have an appreciable impact on
Consumer Products in China. What's having the best impact and what will continue to have a strong impact in
Consumer Products in China is the movie business. As you know, China has become among the largest movie markets
in the world. I think it's second. It probably will be first sometime in the next five years. They continue to open screens
at an unbelievable pace. Our films have done extremely well in China, particularly the films that drive success in
Consumer Products or retail, Disney and Pixar, Marvel. We believe Star Wars will do the same thing. So we're quite
excited about that.
If you look at Consumer Products overall, their growth the last three years has been stunning. It's actually been over
20% over the last three years, which I think has gone largely unappreciated and unrecognized. The movies that we've
been talking about, the more successful ones this past year, of course, led by Frozen, but the Marvel films, Captain
America, Guardians of the Galaxy, Maleficent, are all drivers of the Consumer Products business. The Marvel slate that
we just announced, what we talked about with Star Wars, they will be as well.
But then we have other creative content engines at the company that are also helping Consumer Products. Disney
Junior is another example of that when you look at Doc McStuffins and a variety of other product coming out of the
Disney Channel organization. So Consumer Products right now has a wealth of properties, or intellectual property, to
mine across the board, meaning in so many categories.
And I just asked the other day, our head of Consumer Products, what the outlook is for Christmas season. And he said
that our stores in the United States and Japan and in Europe and I emphasize Europe because everybody has been
talking about the woes of the European economy, but even our European stores are comping up significantly over
year-ago and buying at mass retail across the globe for our Consumer Products is also extremely strong going to the
holiday season. I think they've done a great job of mining our IP and creating some of their own, and we're going to
look to continued growth from that unit over the next three to five years.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you. And just a quick follow up for Jay, if I can. I think this time last year, Jay, you
gave us a range for the buyback going into the year. I guess, is there any way you can sort of give us some sense of how
we could expect the buyback to be in fiscal 2015?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Well, I'm not going to make you happy with my answer because I'm really not going to give you
any guidance into what the level of buyback would be, but I'll remind of this. We said that over the long run, we look
towards about 20% of the cash generated by the company being returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and
buybacks.
We've been very much on track with that. You know what the numbers have looked like over the last three years that
have been in that range between $3 billion and this year $6.5 billion on an annual basis. You saw that we
opportunistically, given what happened in the marketplace, we opportunistically took a big buyback so far this fiscal

I would not look to that number for guidance on what the whole year would look like in terms of the pace, but,
obviously, we meet with our Board on this subject. That meeting is coming up and we've neither made a decision as to
what the level will be yet nor am I inclined to announce that. But as I said, part of our fundamental philosophy has been
to use that vehicle on an opportunistic basis to return capital to the shareholders.

Thank you. The next question comes from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - David Bank>: Hey. Thanks very much. Two questions. I guess the first one for Jay. Jay, can you talk about the
progress or the – I guess the progress on Maker. Now it's been part of the portfolio for six months or so or a little more
than that, how are you tracking kind of the earnout progress and how are you using the Maker audience?
Are you directing it to other audiences within the Disney portfolio? How are you monetizing it beyond just the
impressions on Maker? And then second question, I know you can't give us guidance on the Studio earnings run rate
that I always ask for, but when you think about – you have such great visibility into the film slate for the next five
years. When you think about what those films cost, from the past couple of years, and what the P&A spend has been,
both negative cost of P&A, do the expense profiles of the upcoming slate look pretty similar to the ones that we've just
had, so would the profitability per film tend to be about the same on average? Thanks very much.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Okay. Thanks, David. Let me start with Maker. So as you know, we don't report Maker's and
financials and I'm not going to get into the details there. But I can tell you from a progress report perspective, it is
notable how well integrated Maker's efforts have been across all of the segments of the company. They've engaged with
every segment of the company and are beginning to mine the opportunities that each of those segments have, whether
it's IP, whether it's better distribution, whether it's taking content and envisioning short-form applications of that
content.
They've also really put their shoulders to the wheel on the marketing front, and I think that Guardians of the Galaxy and
the fact that they are way out ahead of it in their space was a perfect example of the kind of marketing that you can
have on distribution vehicles like Maker.tv and YouTube, which are ubiquitous and really target the audience for a lot
of our films. So, I think that so far, we are extremely pleased with how integrated they've become into all of the
thinking around the use of the platform that they are so predominant in and how their skill base, both on the analytic
side and as well as the content side in terms of short form, is showing real promise moving forward. So stay tuned there
and I think you'll see a lot more.
On the Studio side, in terms of – I guess the ultimately what was your question, do we envision that the kinds of films
that we announced from an expense perspective and also I guess I'd like to lean towards the P&L and return
perspective, will they look like the incredible successes we've had with these franchise films in the past, and I think the
answer is yes, that we do see a similar cost profile in terms of both the negative cost and the likely range of P&A, but
more importantly, when these films hit their ultimates with every part of the company, whether it is spin off work in
other divisions, whether it's Consumer Products, the rates of returns on these films are staggering, as you can imagine.
And that's why we are in the much more limited slate dedicated to franchise and branded films business that we're in –
because we like the way the economic profile looks, and we like the kinds of returns they deliver.
<Q - David Bank>: That's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.
<A - Lowell Singer>: David, thank you for the question. Operator, next question, please?

Thank you. The next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thanks. I have two questions. I was hoping you could comment on some of the
impact of some of the bigger global issues like the strong dollar, lower gas prices on your parks, and if you could, on
your other businesses. And then secondly, you haven't gotten the advertising question yet, so clearly if you listen to any
of the other media company calls, there's tons of concern about what's going on, how much is cyclical, how much is
secular, but you probably actually are enjoying very solid advertising. So I'd love to get your views of not only the
current marketplace but how you see share shifts in different evolving models?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: I'll take the advertising question. Jay can answer the other part of your question, Jessica. And
I'll break it down between ESPN and ABC, although I think they both are experiencing a marketplace that has similar
characteristics. First of all, from the secular/cyclical question or angle, I'd say there's no question that some money has
siphoned out of traditional media and onto digital platforms. We know that because we have taken advantage of it with
our digital presence. We also know it because we are an advertiser, and a substantial component of our advertising
buys, particularly the Studio and our theme parks, is digital – even though, by the way, there's still a little less data than
we would like to back that up. But digital has become a large component of most advertising campaigns, or a
component, and that came from somewhere.
That said, there's still huge value in the 30-second spot, which we're seeing particularly when the spot runs in
high-quality programming. The other thing that I think is a dynamic that I've heard both from our salespeople but also
from the advertising community in general is that many advertisers are now resorting to far more surgical approaches to
developing their media campaigns and their buys than ever before. And there are sophisticated procurement procedures
in place behind that. I've heard complaints from an advertising executive fairly recently that all of his clients are using
procurement officers. We've seen that too, in terms of selling ads, and that's changed the buying patterns a little bit.
The other thing I'll add on the secular side is the marketplace right now is – I'll call it mildly off or soft. On the ESPN –
we're not really declaring that a trend. We had a very, very strong upfront at ESPN. And we have properties on ESPN
that are selling extremely well, notably the NBA, college football leading into the college playoffs, which is a really hot
property. So our outlook for the advertising marketplace from ESPN's perspective for the year is actually not bad.
On the ABC front, a similar story in that the marketplace today is scattered, not great. But when you have Scandal and
other returning shows on ABC and you have hot new shows and Black-ish and How to Get Away with Murder, you've
got really high quality shows including, by the way, Good Morning America, which has done extremely well in the
ratings, now World News Tonight, which is doing quite well. Our sales team has a lot of good product to sell, and so
when you ask them their outlook, it's actually not that bad.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Jay, you want to [indiscernible] (39:14)
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Yeah, let me take your question, Jessica, in two parts. First, oil prices. We've over the years been
asked a lot of questions about oil prices and I can tell you that other than an indicator of overall economic activity, oil
prices per se have never been a real driver for our business either on the upside or the downside. So I don't expect there
to be big movement, particularly in our Parks and Resorts business for that. People tend to believe that, that would be
very relevant. I don't expect that to be a driver as it's never been before on much more dire situations.
In terms of the strength of the dollar, obviously, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we have an FX impact
coming up. We've also had one this year. It was part of the reason, for instance, that International Parks was down due
to the weakness in the yen. Obviously, we took the Venezuelan devaluation this past year below the line. And we
expect to see a not gigantic but an impact from basically the conversion of our business, our foreign businesses into
dollars.

If you look, on the other hand, relative to the impact of the stronger dollar on our Parks business, this year, this quarter,
we happen to be kind of at the high end of the range that I usually talk about in terms of percent of international
attendance at our parks, which tends to be between 18% and 22%. We're at the very high end of that. So I would say
that, that has not yet affected individual consumption. There are lots of other things that drive that, that are more
economically driven, I think, than exchange rates. So we'll stay tuned but we don't see any fundamental impacts on our
business yet.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thank you.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please?

The next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Thanks. Just a question for Mr. Iger. At the press event that you had when you rolled
out your Marvel slate, I had a chance to speak to some of your most avid Marvel fans. One of the young gentleman
framed the three Studio acquisitions you've done in the last eight years in an interesting way. It went like this. That
Marvel is actually the least risky, because you bought intellectual property and talent. Pixar, you really weren't buying
IP. You are just buying moviemaking talent. But Lucas, in a way, was actually the most risky, because you are just
buying intellectual property, but no talent. And so I know that's a somewhat simplistic formulation, but can you just
remind us or walk us through the steps that you're taking today to ensure that the Star Wars films are successful, in
terms of the talent you're putting there.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, interesting assessment because I think that about Pixar and Marvel, that's largely correct.
There was IP, too, at Pixar in the sense that there were great movies that have been made and Nemo and Toy Story and
Monsters and Incredibles that had the potential for sequels and today, we announced Toy Story 4 as one example of
that. And when we bought Pixar, we weren't guaranteeing we were going to make those sequels. We thought with the
companies combined, there was a better shot at making them and making them well, and I think we've proven certainly
that, that was true.
Marvel came with a brain trust, which is, I guess, another way to put it, to steal a Pixar term, of moviemaking talent
that was extremely impressive, something that I learned very early on in the exploration process. And so, as you said, it
was a combination of the brand and the storytelling and the affinity for those stories that people had with this great
moviemaking talent and a real discipline. And we didn't think it was necessarily a no-brainer because there's still a lot
of work that goes into it, but we certainly believe that if you're looking at a business that is inherently a risky business
because of creativity, we are actually reducing the risk.
In Star Wars, there's no stronger IP in terms of the passion that people have for storytelling, characters and a brand, I
think, than Star Wars, and we're seeing that already. It's actually exceeded the expectations that we had when we made
the acquisition. We knew with that, we couldn't just essentially say we're making a movie and end up with a great one,
that there was a lot of care that went into it and we were fortunate to have to have Kathy Kennedy to manage that
process. But we also knew that that IP would attract great moviemaking talent, and J.J. Abrahms is a good example of
that.
Now, there wasn't a long list of people that wanted to direct Star Wars films because that's a tall order. There's a lot of
pressure on those folks that do so. We're fairly certain it would be long enough and that the talent interested in doing it
would be strong enough that we'd be in good shape. And we're really pleased that a combination of the writing team,
J.J., Kathy and everyone else that's been involved in the creative on the Star Wars film is really delivering, which we
can't wait to prove to everybody next December.

Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thanks. I have two related to ESPN. Bob, there were some comments from Time
Warner yesterday about the potential for an over-the-top service from ESPN including the NBA and how that product
might look. But obviously would love to hear from you what you and the folks at ESPN are thinking about in trying to
attack the broadband-only sub-base, which may be growing in the U.S., as you put rights together and think about
packaging and pricing ESPN over-the-top.
And related maybe for Jay, you have guidance of high-single digit OI growth for cable 2014 through 2016, and you just
did I think 7% reported this year. You said that programming costs would be up teens, so that's an acceleration. So I'm
wondering is that CAGR, are we going to see a step down in 2015 and then a re-acceleration and 2016 to hit that
high-single digit number? It would seem that might make sense mathematically given the programming cost comments
you made.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Ben, the whole issue of the sustainability of the bundle over-the-top, the impact of new
technology is a really interesting one and a tricky one. ESPN's got a few priorities. First of all, buy a great product and
buy a broad array of rights that gives them the flexibility to essentially exhibit those rights in multiple forms of media
so that they have the ability to essentially adjust or adapt to the changing media universe, thanks to technology.
The second thing they want to do is they want to engage more with their consumers. That essentially means be present
on new platforms in a robust way, get closer to the consumer. And I said this in an interview earlier, too, no traditional
media company has done a better job at going digital than ESPN. We see that on the bottom line with huge growth in
advertising revenue, we see it in numbers. ESPN's uniques basically off channel are just staggering in terms of their
numbers. That said, we also have a priority and that's to do whatever we can to make sure that that multi-channel
bundle is sustainable and valuable and continues to add value to consumers because it is a more competitive
marketplace today than it has ever been.
So we don't feel a compelling need to take a product to market right now that is a direct challenge to that multi-channel
bundle, in part because if the bundle were to break up, which we don't foresee happening anytime soon, we are very
well positioned to move very quickly to take advantage of I'll call it a broadband-only universe or an à la cart universe
because of the strength of the brand, the programming, the rights we've bought. There's no need to do it now in a way
that precipitates the downfall of that bundle. Bragging rights to say we're doing it, to say that we're – we've already
established as a company we're pro-technology. We've probably been at the forefront of it from a media perspective in
terms of leading change and adapting to change. But if you do it to a point where you're endangering your own
business model, which is already facing a fair amount of challenge because of all the changing dynamics of the media
landscape, it just doesn't seem to make sense to us right now.
We're ready to do it if we have to. There may be some experimenting with new product. We're going to create new
product like the NBA over-the-top that is designed as add-ons. It's not designed – the package of NBA games that's
going to be on ESPN will be stronger than what we'll ever offer on an over-the-top package, including the Finals,
which will be on ABC and a good part of the post season. If you're really a great NBA fan, your over-the-top package
isn't going to satisfy you enough. In may enhance your connection to or your enjoyment of the sport, but it's not going
to replace it. And that's how were looking at it. It's interesting because I think some may call that a conservative
approach, we think it's actually a smart approach because we're going to continue to grow our digital offerings nicely,
but we're also going to work really hard in making sure that that bundle is viable.
Interesting what we've done on the mobile side with the WATCH apps is one great example of that. We've got really
compelling product that is available. You can watch it on a computer or a great new mobile device if you are a
subscriber. And that makes subscribing that much more valuable. And I also want to say it's not just about ESPN. You
look at ABC and you look at Disney and other potential products that we could create as a company under the Marvel
and the Star Wars brand, we'll be well positioned to go direct to the consumer or with à la carte offerings if the
marketplace demands it. But we don't feel a great need to do that now.

<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thank you, Bob.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Ben, relative to the perspective on the OI at ESPN, I guess I'll say this. I'm not going to change the
guidance that we gave on the Investor Day relative to the compound annual growth rate out through 2016. But as way
of perspective, I think it's worth noting as you think about this that obviously over the next two years, the first year of
those we've talked about the step-up in costs that we're facing,. We kind of articulated those in the prepared remarks,
but whether it's NFL or Major League Baseball, the cost of the college playoffs, College Football Playoffs, the SEC,
those are all step-ups in costs that we'll see this year which when we look a year from now at fiscal 2016 obviously
coming against those. You won't see that as an increase in the relative cost base. So I think maybe that can give you
some perspective on how to think about sort of the path to that overall compounded growth guidance.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thank you both.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: You're welcome.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Ben, thank you. Operator, next question, please?

Thank you. Our next question comes from John Janedis from Jefferies.
<Q - John Janedis>: Hi. Thank you. Maybe a related question on advertising and sports, it seems like the number of
hours of live sports has increased fairly appreciably across TV this year, and so I'm wondering are you sensing any kind
of sports fatigue or pricing flexibility in the market from either an advertiser or a ratings perspective?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: No. Not really. ESPN's lineup of sports is fantastic. Actually, in talking to their sales group
about the current marketplace, one of the things they emphasize is the strength of their hand from a programming
perspective. In a marketplace that I said is, at least at the moment, not all that great. We do know that live programming
has a lot of value to advertisers, and in ESPN's case it's got a great demo with men, so that's also quite attractive. So
we're not seeing what you described.
<Q - John Janedis>: Okay. Thanks, Bob. Maybe a related question. I think there's something like 33 games in at the
SEC Network, so I know it's early, but can you talk about how you view the network's performance and to what extent
you're seeing some of your traditional ESPN advertisers maybe spending on the SEC network as well?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: So far what we've seen, and we're not prepared to be public with any numbers, it's been very,
very encouraging, both their football game performance and adjunct programming around it. They actually have a great
SEC Nation Show – SEC? I think it's called SEC Nation – which is tremendous and they're doing quite well. I don't
have any facts to address the second part of your question about whether we've cannibalized ourselves from an
advertising perspective. I do know that we've moved some games from what would've been on ESPN or ESPN2 on to
the SEC Network, but that had always been the plan. It's also nice that this network has launched in a year that the SEC
has been even stronger than it has traditionally been and that's actually – if ever there was a great time to launch this
network, it's now.
<Q - John Janedis>: Great. Thank you.

specifically for the December quarter if you have it. That'd be great. And then, Bob, I mean, there have been a lot of
great questions on this call in terms of the changing media ecosystem. I thought maybe I would ask about the soft
ratings in cable.
And, Bob, maybe you guys mentioned the ratings at ESPN in the quarter that you just reported, but more broadly in
terms of cable ratings, you sit at the top, you have a very robust internal research team at Disney, and what's your best
explanation for the accelerating declining ratings over the summer? And if you will, which are, in your opinion, the
digital platforms that are taking the biggest share of those eyeballs, be it ad-supported, subscription video formats or
EST formats online? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Yeah, hi, Anthony. First, let me talk about your question on advertising. So I'm going to
reiterate a little bit about what Bob said because I want to put it in context. First, ESPN had a very strong upfront in
terms of both volume and pricing. And we are seeing, you talked about NBA advertising. We're up like 21%
year-on-year in NBA advertising. And the excitement about the College Football Playoff series is palpable.
I will say though that we are looking at a very late-moving market in advertising. I think you've talked to the different
media companies. You've heard this over and over that people are committing cash late, which makes it very hard to
read what the numbers really are going to wind up for the quarter. But suffice to say that there's a little bit of softness in
the pacings. They're slightly down to the tune, I would call it low to mid single digits for ESPN. But I think that, we are
optimistic that as the quarter comes to its end and those events that I just mentioned take hold, that we may feel better
about it at the end of the quarter. But right now, we are down slightly.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Okay.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: On the ratings front, we've seen some ratings erosion. I actually don't want to jump to too many
conclusions because I don't think it's fair to compare a season to a season, meaning this year versus last year, and all of
a sudden declare it a trend. I do know at the Disney Channel, where we have seen some ratings fall off, we've had less
original programming. That's more a timing issue than anything else and we're not concerned about it.
In terms of where competition is coming from and where we see I guess the competition the greatest, you have to
conclude that it's from all over the place. It's a very, very competitive, fragmented marketplace that has people
consuming media from multiple sources on multiple devices and multiple platforms across the board. And if I were to
conclude anything there, it would be that the haves or the better brands with the stronger programming will endure even
if they see some erosion. The product that is in danger are – the product that is marginal in nature, that is either
unbranded or does not have the kind of audience affinity or built-in audience affinity that many of the other channels
have.
I actually think when you think about the health of the bundle as well, well, if the bundle were to fray or break up,
everyone would suffer. The ones that will suffer the most are those smaller, less branded, less popular channels. They,
by the way, they're not going to suffer. They're going to disappear. In an à la carte world, they completely disappear.
So, interestingly enough, what happens in à la carte is much lower choice from traditional platforms or traditional
programmers and just even more fragmentation. But everybody talks about diversity and everybody talks about variety
and that goes away. It's that simple. We like our position because of ABC and Disney and Pixar and Marvel and
obviously Lucasfilm and Star Wars because they're branded. And in a world where there's substantially greater choice
whether you're looking at movies, whether you're looking at television, whether you're looking at apps, whether you're
looking at -internet sites, we think we're fairly well positioned there because of the value of those brands.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thank you very much.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: With that, we'll conclude our broadcast day.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Operator, we'll take one more question.

Thank you. The next question comes from Tim Nollen from Macquarie.
<Q - Tim W. Nollen>: Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask also about advertising and I'm particularly interested
in your position with ESPN, which is very much obviously about live sports, and then ABC, which faces some of the
same broadcast issues as its peers. My question is, how are you thinking about alternative measurement for these two
networks, ESPN being very much about out-of-home and mobile, ABC being perhaps more about [ph] time shifts
(58:46)? And, I guess, what will it take to fully adapt and commercialize new ratings methodologies so that we can start
to really finally close the gap between what I think real viewership is, which is not declining that much, versus your
ability to actually monetize these networks? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: That's a very good question and it describes a very frustrating situation, in a way, because we
know there's more consumption, but the measurement isn't there to back it up. There is some data available but it
doesn't cume the audience with what's on the network. And, so, it's harder to use, in other words if we were to try to
figure out who's watching Scandal on the watch app and who is watching Scandal on the network, we'd get numbers for
both but it wouldn't necessarily be cume numbers and it could be all kinds of duplication. So right now, it is not a
particularly positive situation.
I don't know what it's going to take except probably significant investment to come up with numbers that really reflect
where consumption is today. Which I think would be quite important and quite interesting for those that sell advertising
time and those that buy advertising time. I can't predict when or even if that's going to happen but I'm assuming at some
point the marketplace is going to demand it, and will develop, but it doesn't seem to be anywhere – it's not insight at the
moment.
<Q - Tim W. Nollen>: Are you saying we need different types of measurement to capture that, or is it just simply not
being used effectively enough by the industry as a whole?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: I'm not a tremendous expert on this, but my sense is we need a different type of measurement
