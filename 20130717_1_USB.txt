Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review U.S. Bank's second quarter
results. I'll begin with a few of our quarterly highlights on page three of the presentation.
U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2013 or $0.76 per diluted common
share. Total average loans grew year-over-year by 5.2% and 1.2% or 5% annualized on a linked-quarter basis. We
experienced strong loan growth and total average deposits of 7% over the prior year and 1% or 4% annualized linked
quarter. Credit quality remains strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 9.5% from the prior quarter, while
non-performing assets declined linked quarter by 5.4%.
We generated significant capital this quarter. Our estimated Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III rules, issued in early
July, was 8.6% at June 30, while our Basel I Tier 1 common equity ratio was 9.2% and our Tier 1 capital ratio was
11.1%. We purchased 18 million shares of common stock during the second quarter. These buybacks, along with our
dividend, which was increased by 18% in June, resulted in a 73% return of earnings to our shareholders in the second
quarter.
On slide four, you can see that our performance metrics continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on
average assets in the second quarter was 1.7%, and return on average common equity was 16.1%. Our net interest
margin and efficiency ratio are shown in the graph on the right-hand slide – side of slide four. This quarter's net interest
margin of 3.43% was as expected, five basis points lower than the prior quarter's rate of 3.48%, and Andy will discuss
the margin in more detail in just a few minutes. Our efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 51.7%. We anticipate
that this ratio will remain in the low 50%s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue
trends, while continue to invest in and grow our businesses.
Turning to slide five, the company reported total net revenue in the second quarter of $4.9 billion, a 2.4% decrease
from prior year, but a 1.5% increase over the first quarter. The decline in revenue year-over-year was largely driven by
lower mortgage banking revenue and net interest income, while the favorable linked-quarter variance reflected strong
seasonal fee revenue trend led by payments, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income.
Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide six. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $11
billion or 5.2% year-over-year and 1.2% linked quarter, accelerating from the 1% linked quarter we experienced in the
first quarter. Overall and excluding covered loans, which is a run-off portfolio, average total loans grew by 7.2%
year-over-year and 1.6% linked quarter. Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong
growth in average commercial loans, which grew by 11.2% year-over-year and 2.2% over the prior quarter. Total
average commercial real estate also increased over the prior quarters with average construction loans growing by 9.9%
year-over-year and 4.9% for linked quarter. Residential real estate loans also continued to show a strong growth, 19.7%
over the same quarter of last year and 3.9% over the prior quarter. Within the retail loan categories, average credit card
loan outstandings fell slightly as consumer pays – consumers paid down their balances, and average home equity lines
and loans continued to decline as paydowns more than offset new loan originations. Auto loans and leases, however,
posted a very good growth year-over-year and linked quarter.
We continue to originate and renew new loans and lines for our customers. New originations excluding mortgage plus
new and renewed commitments totaled approximately $48 billion in the second quarter compared with 48 – $46 billion
in the second quarter of last year and $36 billion last quarter. Total average revolving corporate and commercial
commitment increased year-over-year by 10.2% and 2.2% on a linked quarter basis, while utilization remains flat at
approximately 25%, close to where it's been for the past six quarters.
Given early industry indicators, our linked quarter average loan growth of 1.2% signifies that we are continuing to gain
market share. Additionally, our current expectation is that linked quarter average loan growth will accelerate again in
the third quarter to the higher end of our previously stated range of 1% to 1.5%. Total average deposits increased by
$16.1 billion, or 7% over the same quarter of last year and by $2.4 billion on a linked quarter basis with growth in
low-cost money market and savings deposits particularly strong on both the year-over-year and linked quarter basis.
Turning to slide seven on credit quality, total net charge-offs in the second quarter decreased by $41 million, or 9.5%
from the first quarter of 2013 while non-performing assets excluding covered assets decreased by $108 million or

5.3%. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding in the second quarter declined to 0.70% from 0.79% in
the first quarter. During the second quarter, we released $30 million of reserves equal to the first quarter and $20
million less than the second quarter of 2012. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we expect net charge-offs and
non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the third quarter.
Andy will now give you a few more details about our second quarter results.
Andrew Cecere
Thanks, Richard.
Slide eight gives you a view of our second quarter 2013 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of
$0.76 was 7% higher than the second quarter 2012 and 4.1% higher than the prior quarter. The key drivers of the
company's second quarter earnings are summarized on slide 9. The $69 million or 4.9% increase in net income
year-over-year was the result of a decrease in expense and lower provision for credit losses partially offset by a decline
in net revenue. Net interest income declined year-over-year by $41 million or 1.5%. The result of a 2.7% increase in
average earning assets offset by a 15 basis point decline in net interest margin.
The $8.2 billion growth in average earning assets year-over-year included increases in average total loans and the
securities portfolio. Offsetting a portion of the growth in those categories was a $3.1 billion reduction in average other
earning assets primarily due to the deconsolidation of a number of community development entities and a $1.1 billion
reduction in average loans held for sale, reflecting lower mortgage origination activity this quarter versus the same
quarter of last year.
The net interest margin of 3.43% was 15 basis points lower than the second quarter 2012 primarily due to lower
yielding investment securities and lower loan rates, partially offset by lower rates of deposits and wholesale funding
including long-term debt. Noninterest income declined by 3.4% year-over-year, primarily due to mortgage banking
revenue reflecting lower origination and sales revenue partially offset by higher servicing revenue and a favorable
change in the addition to the mortgage rep and warranty repurchase reserve.
Also contributing to the decline in noninterest income year-over-year were reductions in corporate payments, the result
of lower government and transportation-related transactions and other income, which reflected fewer equity investment
gains in the prior year and lower retail products revenue primarily due to end-of-term lease valuations. Offsetting these
declines were year-over-year increases in trust and investment management fees, retail payments, merchant processing
revenue, deposit service charges and investment product fees. Noninterest expense was lower year-over-year by $44
million or 1.7%.
The majority of this favorable variance is attributable to a favorable variance professional services expense, primarily
due to the reduction in third-party foreclosure settlement-related costs as well as an accrual for a Visa-related
settlement charge taken in the second quarter of last year and lower intangible expense. These favorable variances were
partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expense and increases in marketing and technology expense.
Net income was higher on a linked quarter basis by $56 million or 3.9% as a result of a 1.5% increase in revenue and
lower provision for credit losses partially offset by a 3.5% increase in expense. On a linked quarter basis, net interest
income was lower as average earning assets declined by $2.1 billion and net interest margin declined by five basis
points. The decrease in average earning assets was a result of the reduction in other earning assets and loans held for
sale, while the expected five basis point decline in net interest margin was primarily due to lower loans on rates and
securities. Given the current interest rate environment, we expect net interest margin to be relatively stable in the third
quarter which, combined with our expectation for a linked quarter loan growth, should lead to a modest increase in net
interest income in the third quarter.
On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income was higher by $111 million or 5.1%. This favorable variance reflected
seasonally higher payments and growth in all fee categories with the exception of mortgage banking revenue. In June,
we had expected mortgage banking revenue to be higher in the second quarter than the first quarter, primarily due to

very strong application volumes earlier in the quarter. However, since the time we made that statement to the end of the
quarter, rates moved up by about 60 basis points and refinance activity slowed significantly. As a result, mortgage
banking revenue actually came in slightly lower this quarter than last. The $5 million decline in revenue reflected an
increase in origination and sales revenue, including the favorable change in the reps and warranty reserve offset by low
– by a lower gain on hedging activity than the prior quarter.
Although applications were higher in the second quarter than the first quarter, the increase in volume was offset by a
reduction in gain on sale margin. We calculate gain on sale margin based on applications expected to close. On a linked
quarter basis, noninterest expense was higher by $87 million or 3.5% mainly due to other expense, which included
higher insurance and regulatory expense relative to the first quarter. In addition, marketing and business development
expense and professional service expenses were higher in the current quarter versus the prior quarter due to the timing
of business line projects and initiatives.
Turning to slide 10, our capital position remains strong and continues to grow. Based on our assessment of the final
rules for the Basel III standardized approach released earlier this month, we estimated – we estimate that our Basel III
Tier 1 common equity ratio at June 30 was 8.6%, compared with 8.3% calculated under the previously proposed rules.
At 8.6%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and above our targeted ratio of 8%.
Turning to slide 11, in June, the Board of Directors declared an 18% increase in our common stock dividend. As a
result, in the second quarter, we returned 73% of our earnings to shareholders. Dividends accounted for 30% of the
return to shareholders and the 18 million shares of stock we repurchased in the second quarter accounted for the
remaining 43%. Of note, our tangible book value per share rose to $13.48 in the second quarter, which represented an
11% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 1.6% increase over the prior quarter.
Finally, slide 12 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage repurchase-related expense and the reserve for
expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. The rep and warranties repurchase reserve was reduced this
quarter by $43 million and the outstanding repurchase and make-whole request balance at June 30 was $64 million
compared with $66 million at March 31.
I'll now turn the call back to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thanks, Andy. Last Friday, Andy and I had the honor of commemorating the 150th anniversary of the signing of our
national bank charter by ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange. We were joined on the stage by 10
U.S. Bank employees who proudly represented and celebrated the rich heritage that they and their coworkers, along
with many who came before them, have helped to create and build over the past 150 years.
Importantly, as we took that moment to observe and reflect on our past, we also celebrate the present and the strong
foundation upon which we are building our company's future. U.S. Bancorp had posted record earnings for the second
quarter while once again achieving industry-leading profitability metrics. We continue to build our future as we have in
the past by investing in our well-diversified mix of businesses, by maintaining prudent risk management, by focusing
on operating integrity and compliance, by sustaining strong capital and liquidity, and by providing superior returns for
our shareholders. As always, we remain focused on producing consistent, predictable and repeatable results for the
benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders.
That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from our audience.

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Paul?
<Q - Jessica Sara Levi-ribner>: Hi, guys; this is Jessica Ribner for Paul. Just a question, I guess, on your mortgage
banking expectations going forward. Are you looking for higher purchase volumes? Or do you see the same level of
refis? I mean we're part of the way through the third quarter. What's your outlook?
<A - Andrew Cecere>: So, Jessica, let me tell you first from the perspective of what occurred in the second quarter
from a production standpoint, repurchase activity went from about 71% of the book in the first quarter to about 59% in
the second quarter, and applications were also down about 10 points in terms of refinancing. I would expect that trend
to continue. I do expect – again, it's early in the quarter but given the current rates there, I expect mortgage revenue be
down a bit given the rates are today. And we'll continue to update throughout the quarter.
<Q - Jessica Sara Levi-ribner>: Okay; great. I appreciate it.
<A - Andrew Cecere>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko of SIG.
<Q - Jack Micenko>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Looking at the sort of the slowdown in deposit –
average deposits growth, I'm wondering on your perspective and maybe this is a broader question around the whole
loan demand question. But do you think that the banks generally are exhausting really what's out there from a deposit
take? Or are we starting to maybe see maybe a little bit of cash being deployed on the deposit side into investment and
business activities that could maybe possibly lead to an expansion of loan growth in the back half of the year? Just
curious as your observations there.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, Jack; it's Richard. I think it's what you're predicting and it's what we've been saying for
a long time. The first good movement we'll see on bank balance sheets is customers using their own deposits, and I'm
happy to report our deposits while they were up, the number of customers with deposits was up as well. So it's the
customers who already have deposits that are using some of those to, we think, employ them in some form of growth.
After that, we would hope to see our lines of credit especially in the wholesale side move from a utilization of 25% to
anything; 26% would be great. We used to be at like in the mid-to-high 30% utilization level. So there's a significant
amount of pent-up opportunity and customers are paying for those lines to have them available and to keep them
current. And then, finally, there may be new lines of loans that will occur particularly on the large end when some
transactions start to belie underlying growth.
But I will say if we do read it like you do, I think it's a positive that it's not growing any more than that as long as the
number of customers are growing. And to follow our prior comments, I do think we're starting to see some of these
green shoots that we mentioned 90 days ago as being real and sustainable and more green shoots. It's not a rush to a
huge recovery, but it's absolutely and positively no longer a concern of going backwards. We're just seeing customers
being thoughtful, careful. But one at a time, they're starting to get more comfortable about their future and they're
starting to invest starting with their deposits, sometimes getting lines of credit with the intent to use and in many cases
starting to make decisions that have long-term outcomes for a long view of the economy.
<Q - Jack Micenko>: Great. Thanks. And then just the ratio of NCOs on the card book look like it walked up a little
bit. I know in the appendix, you talked about lower recoveries. Obviously dollar amount down and the trend is good.
Can you talk about what that means on the recovery side and what you meant by lower recoveries and how you're
thinking about that going forward?
<A - P.W. Parker>: Yeah, this is Bill. Part of that is really a timing thing as we brought more of the collection
activities in-house on the recovery side; not all of the recovery collection activities but some of them. So as we do that,
that delays the recognition of the recovery. So I don't expect it to have a material long-term impact. So it's really more

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: I just wanted – on the fee side, I just wanted to ask you about just the payments businesses and
specifically in the corporate payments business is still having a bit of a tough revenue trajectory. So was wondering if
you could specifically talk about that one but also talk about just your outlook for the three payments businesses as we
look ahead.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, Ken; thanks. The co-payments business is – 59% is our issuing business and the 29%
falls in – 39% falls in the Elavon or merchant acquiring and 10% falls in the corporate payment side in terms of
revenue. And to start with your question, the corporate payments is about a third of that is government and that
continues to be down 20% year-over-year, particularly based on government spending, probably some of the trickle
effect of the sequester and certainly just the budget increase or decreases that have been evident on the federal side. So
the rest of it continues to actually start showing some supporting and the P-card growth is up 13% over last year. We're
starting to see a flattening and stabilization of T&E for the first time year-to-date. So on the corporate side, while it's
10% of the total, the government piece which is a third of that is still under some form of stress, but the rest is starting
to show some positive trajectories.
As it relates to the Elavon, which is our merchant acquiring, which also has a nice diversification of geographies -- you
know it's a global business. We're continuing to see growth in same-store sales that would reflect what you've seen in
the statistics that the – both the federal government and some of the European government has said. So there's a nice
second-quarter lift there. We have pretty stable margins in terms of how we get paid and we're actually quite
encouraged by what we see on the Elavon side, both domestically and globally.
And then finally on the bigger part of it, the 59%, which is led by our issuing side, we're also seeing nice support there.
As you know, the average net receivables or the outstandings were slightly down year-over-year and that's particularly
because people are just starting to have a higher payment activity and the payment rates were probably 1.5% higher
than they were last quarters or last year. So people are starting to pay them off, but they're using the card, and so credit
spend was up almost 3% year-over-year following another 3% in quarter one's growth. So we're seeing active accounts
growing nicely. They're using their card more often. They [ph] have – right now that they'll (21:51) be paying them
back more prudently. And in the end of the day, that will slow and they'll start to let that outstanding roll over and that
will be another benefit. But credit card sales for us are 9% year-over-year, absent the portfolio that we sold in and I
couldn't be more optimistic about the payments business. As you see a nice trend in quarter two, we should continue to
see that growth.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay, great. And then on – second question, just an expense question, an operating leverage
question. On a – at least on an as-reported basis, we're looking at a little bit of a year-over-year decline in revenues but
a little bit of a year-over-year step-up in costs. And you did call out the regulatory costs this quarter. So I just wanted to
try to understand the balance between revenues, expenses and how do you help us understand that regulatory cost, if it's
now run rated or was that kind of a one-time catch-up?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Great question and I own that. Good question because I tell you, we shoot for positive
operating leverage every year. I think we are still very much in the game to be able to create positive operating leverage
even in the next couple of quarters. But it will be more challenging, and here's my real clear direction for you. As much

as mortgages will probably be down, mortgage revenue, in the next couple of quarters just based on the elements and
you know we're a heavy purchase shop. So our decrease might not be as significant as some [ph] others (23:12)
reported. But I am not going to take an expense reduction into important investments in the next quarter or two just to
accommodate lower mortgage revenue until which time the middle of the curve starts to bend up, and if it does and the
market starts to get stronger, then I think we'll be fine.
So I'm not going to do any near-term adjustments just to appeal to a slightly negative operating leverage if that's what it
has to be, but we are going to continue to watch our expenses. The cost of compliance, as you recall, about a year ago
for the – particularly the consent order was almost $50 million a quarter, and that has trimmed down now to a
substantially less, call it, $5 million to $10 million a quarter as we wind down some of those mortgage-related activity.
But I will tell you that we've continued to add compliance personnel and compliance protocols across the company to
accommodate this higher requirement that we achieved near perfection on all of our operating activities. And so not all
of that $50 million is going to be given back. Most of it, however, though, Ken, is burnt into the current run rate and
you'll see it stabilize. I'm just a little concerned that mortgage might drop off more than I can accommodate in expense
reduction dollar-for-dollar and we're not going to overachieve on that, because I don't want to suffocate in future.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello of UBS.
<Q - Stephen Scinicariello>: Morning, everyone.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Morning, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Scinicariello>: Just a couple of quick ones for you. Just curious to hear your take given the new final
capital rules that we got out there and really my question to you is a little bit more big picture. I mean do you feel that
you guys kind of have a real competitive advantage versus some of your larger kind of brethren given what we've seen
out of those rules?
<A - Andrew Cecere>: Well, the new rule effectively increased our capital ratio about 30%. Our binding constraints
Tier 1 common under the standard 30 basis points – 31 – Tier 1 common under the Basel III standard. So last quarter,
we were at 8.2%. Using the same calculation, we would've been 8.3% this quarter and the new calculation allowed us
to get to 8.6%. 8.6% is about where – about where we think we need to be – our internal guideline is about 8%. And
that is based on an assumed SIFI buffer of 50 basis points and an additional internal buffer of 50 basis points. So I think
from a capital standpoint, we are in very good shape. We are not in a situation where we're trying to build capital to a
level nor are we in a situation that we're over-capitalized and have no use for the capital.
So when we are in a situation like we are today where we're returning about 70% and reinvesting 30%, it allows us to
reinvest at a level to accommodate the loan growth and earning asset growth that you're seeing. So we are in a really
good spot. It allows us to make the investments we need to make at the same time we'll offer the growth that we are
seeing right now.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah and to just put an exclamation point, Steve, we really like our position. We like our
size. We like our simplicity. We like our diversification. As it relates to capital leverage and liquidity, we think we're
substantially where we need to be, but for any fine-tuning that needs to occur, and I think all the rules that come out
continue to remind us that being not [ph] AG siv (26:21) is a positive outcome, but being big enough to matter and
being able to manage a very significant portfolio of a simple balance sheet allows us to be in a pretty good shape and
we like the future we have.
<Q - Stephen Scinicariello>: Now, definitely looks like you're in a real sweet spot going forward. And then the second
question I had for you was just kind of in the same vein of kind of those investments for the future and kind of touched

on a little bit talking about some of the expense initiatives going forward, just kind of curious if there was any maybe
that you wanted to kind of flag for us just so we're aware some of the things that you've got going on. Some of the
things you're investing in and maybe some of the timing of those things, how they might affect the expense line going
forward?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good question, Steve. A couple things. One is we're going to continue to build our wealth
management businesses. As you know, we started this trip three years ago. It was the one piece of the puzzle I didn't
think U.S. Bank had sufficiently demonstrated leadership in not only in our wealth management but in our ultra-high
net worth under a brand called Ascent. We'll continue to open those offices, we're continuing to provide technology to
our teams to create a unique experience and you will see our continued expense initiatives in wealth management.
Secondarily, you'll know that we just recently bought a company called FSV earlier this year in Florida, which is a
prepaid card provider and processor. We continue to extend our position there. We now have no third-party partners in
any part of prepaid, because we have cradle-to-grave capability and a significant leadership position. I want to continue
to add to that investment and build a stronger and a unique position of strength for prepaid as it adds to our card
provision.
And then finally, corporate trust which we recently took across the pond and continue to see opportunities even outside
of America to grow our corporate trust business, we recently become more of a provider on hedge fund servicing and
other areas by some recent acquisitions. There'll be more where that came from, it could be both in the form of M&A
or in the form of organic growth. But I'd say those three areas, which are the three areas that continue to make us
unique: payments, corporate trust and special wealth management growth. I think those are areas you'd want us to
invest and they've got great trajectory now and I want to continue that momentum so that when the world is better and
ready to roll, we'll already be there.
<Q - Stephen Scinicariello>: Excellent. Thanks so much.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yep.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala of Bank of America.
<Q - Erika Penala>: Good morning. I just had a few follow-up questions, and the first is on the dollar cost trajectory
for the remaining of the year. Should we take out the $66 million in quarter-over-quarter increase in regulatory expense
when we're thinking about the run rate for the third quarter? Or will some of that stay?
<A - Andrew Cecere>: You know what I would say, Erika, is the first quarter is seasonally low and then we had a
little bit of a positive insurance recoveries and other expense. And I think the second quarter is more reflective of our
run rate of expense with normal increases. So I would use second quarter as more of the basis for expense.
<Q - Erika Penala>: Got it. And the second follow-up question is you mentioned that mortgage revenues would be
down just a bit, but we heard another large bank mention that they think if rates stay, long rates stay here, that the
mortgage market is going to be down 30% to 40%. Is the message from U.S. Bank that you will outperform the
market? And if that 30% to 40% decline is correct, where are you in terms of your out-performance relative to that
number just in proportion?
<A - Andrew Cecere>: Right. So first, Erika, as you know, mortgage application or gain on sale revenue is one
component of mortgage revenue. There are other puts and takes including servicing revenues and net hedge and so
forth. So my expectation is not to have our mortgage revenue decline to the level you just described. It's going to be
less than that, but I do think it will go down. Application volume is a component of that, but there are a lot of gives and
takes. And again, we'll update as we see more throughout the quarter, but I do expect mortgage revenue will be down a
little bit principally due to the gain on sale, principally due to the applications, but there are some offsets.

<A - Richard K. Davis>: And, Erika, it's Richard. It will be down unless rates were to turn. The thing turned so fast,
we'd be great if we try to predict, you know, the next 10 weeks when we can't see it that far. But we also have a –
always had a focus on purchase. So it's coming our way as it relates to what we're being good at and what we're
focusing our market reputation on. And as you'll also remember, we never were as big on a HARP kind of a product
which is probably more likely to be one of the victims of the increasing rates and we didn't rely on that a lot because we
didn't have a portfolio that allowed us to have as much to refi. So in some cases, we probably should do better than
average, but it will definitely be down and we're projecting the second half of the year to be less than the first half.
<Q - Erika Penala>: Got it. And just one more follow-up. Richard, it was loud and clear as you answered Ken's
question on taking out expenses near-term to accommodate some of the swings in mortgage revenue. I guess no matter
what, we should just look to your consolidated guidance of 50% on the efficiency side as we think about the puts and
takes of...?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, that's a really good way to think of it because we never set that target. It's always a
result, but I can tell you that low-50%s and where we've been forever and especially in the last few years by quarter
that should not change materially that – we will protect that and I can tell you I know we can because mortgage isn't the
only thing that's growing around here and it will just be one of the components we'll keep an eye on. So I'm glad you
heard me because I don't want to be dollar-for-dollar and be shortsighted. We've been working for five years to grow a
substantial amount of momentum and become a revenue company and not an expense company, and I'd hate to slow
that down at this last stage and we're going to be very protective of it.
<Q - Erika Penala>: Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Thanks. Good morning. Hi. I just wanted to drill into a couple of business lines. One is
the merchant acquiring business that you have and I know that you've invested globally there. We had some news the
other night from the FT that suggested that the European Commission is proposing some changes on interchange in
Europe, which I know many people have been thinking about. One of the elements they are supposed to be considering,
supposedly is separating out payments – issuers from processors. And I'm wondering is what that does to your
merchant acquiring businesses in Europe. Is it something that would be an opportunity for you?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, it's definitely not a concern based on what we've read like you have. We're entirely an
acquirer and not an issuer and a processor. So the issues were that – is the gun sights are pointed in that topic. And as
you said, there is an opportunity for us particularly given our closed-loop capability in our own proprietary product that
we believe this could be a net positive for us as a leading acquirer and processor. So we don't see it as a negative. We're
trying to understand whether it's a positive, but we're not worried about it.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. And then separately in auto, could you give us a sense as to what exactly
happened in auto? And what kind of reinvestment in the business you're doing now? And then a little bit on opportunity
for share gain from here? And what would drive that?
<A - P.W. Parker>: Sure. Betsy, this is Bill. Yeah, we had a strong auto quarter both loans and leases and we
anticipate that to be a strong third quarter too. We obviously can monitor the new car sales so we get a good sense of
what our market share is. And in the second quarter, we definitely grew market share to competitive space, but we've
made the right reinvestments to be successful there. We've been in the business long time and we're very good at it.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Right. And there's been some discussion around how the CFPB has come into the mix
here requiring the dealer rebates be done potentially a different way. And I know you've updated the Street on how
you're thinking about it, but has your thought changed at all since your last update?

<A - P.W. Parker>: No. I mean we – when that came out, we took action immediately and narrowed the amount of
dealer reserve discretion. We had no negative consequences to that. I think our dealers all understood it. We've worked
with them and we've seen increase in volume since then.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. So no competitive reaction against what you did?
<A - P.W. Parker>: No, I think. No.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: A couple of banks...
<A - P.W. Parker>: A couple other banks followed, yeah.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: ...but it didn't hurt our volume and we're actually feeling that we've ring fenced a little bit of
the risk. The real issue here, Betsy, as you know is going to be if the banks, as an entity, can compete effectively with
the captives who are not part of the CFPB's oversight and that's long time to be determined. But as it relates to our
position against both of those entities, we're growing market share and we like the business and we're going to continue
to find ways to expand not only in geographies but also in product types that are – start to emerge as rates start to go up.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Compass Point.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I just would like to discuss
some of the increase in commercial real estate loans this quarter compared to what's happened over the last year. You
definitely saw a pickup from the first quarter and we're starting to see just broad growth across, yeah, from the said
data. Is there any particular sectors where you're seeing commercial real estate pickup or any particular regions where
you're seeing that?
<A - P.W. Parker>: Yeah, I can speak to that. This is Bill. We've seen – for several quarters now, we've seen
multi-family being kind the lead property class for demand. And for us, we've seen good new construction activity in
Seattle, both Bay Area and Southern California and then Houston. Those have been the primary areas for us. In other
areas, we have seen some hotel, motel, lodging demand that's picked up a little bit. That's strong pretty much in all the
coastal cities. So those are the primary areas that we've seen commercial real estate growth.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Yeah. And then concerning residential real estate, given that the 30-year has moved up so
much and you're seeing a decline in application volume for conforming 30-year fixed mortgages. Are you seeing any
application shift towards 5/1 ARMs or 15-year fixed given the move in rates? Or is that – you're also seeing a similar
decline as you are for 30-year fixed?
<A - Andrew Cecere>: This is Andy. There's a bit of a shift to more of a shorter duration as you described and a little
bit perhaps more on the variable rate. And we'll also tell you that, which we're putting on balance sheet our Smart
Refinance product has always been shorter in terms of the term there, closer to the 15-year. So the 30-year is not
impacting that as much and the decline is coming on the mortgage production in the 30-year, but there is some shift to
shorter terms.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Would you expect – go ahead, sorry.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I'd say here, as it turns out, I was surprised, but I thought there might be a bit of a tsunami
effect or a cash-for-clunkers effect where we get a pent-up demand and anybody who still hadn't refi-ed would come
into the game now. And it doesn't seem to happen. I mean it seems that people are still moving at kind of a snail's pace.
So if they still see a deal that's better than the one they have, they'll come in. But we're not seeing that kind of one-time
surprise that I thought we might have. That relates to mortgage. But until short-term interest rates start to move, we

won't expect to see a great deal of effect on the commercial wholesale side, although I do still predict there will be a bit
of a rush to the gates when that starts to become the real thing. And we haven't seen that trigger yet and I think that will
be an upper for wholesale lending at that moment in time, which could be a few quarters out.

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Werner of Morningstar.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Morning, Dan.
Operator
Mr. Werner, your line is open. Please state your question.
<Q - Dan Werner>: Oh, sorry. I was on mute. Good morning. Could you give us an update on the bank M&A
environment in terms of what you're seeing? Are you still seeing the big gaps between sellers and buyers at this point,
given that we've seen a lot of M&A activity amongst the smaller banks?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. You know, Dan, we haven't seen any activity. I mean I could make it up, I wouldn't.
But I mean I can make it sound interesting but we haven't.
<Q - Dan Werner>: Yeah.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: We've had no approaches of any significance. We're not approaching anyone. Like you, I
read about the small banks continuing to cobble together to find some critical mass, which makes total sense to me,
because the cost of compliance and just regulatory costs are easier by a larger base, but really none. I mean it couldn't
be more dormant. And our interest couldn't be lower either. So...
<Q - Dan Werner>: Okay.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I think as to an opportunity missed, we're not feeling that need right now.
<Q - Dan Werner>: I was just wondering if there's any changes in that. Thanks.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yep. Good question.

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Jon.
<A - Andrew Cecere>: Hey, Jon.
<A - Judith T. Murphy>: Jon.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Just to follow up on that, how about the payments business and the processing business? Are
you seeing more opportunities there?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, actually that feels a little more heated because first of all we're known to be an
acquirer, an active acquirer. We're known to – we'll talk to anybody, I've said this before, but a few folks that created a
great idea in a garage that's got payments uniqueness attached to, we'll talk to them. And some of the deals we look at

are typically privately held businesses. They're smaller than you would probably ever read about. But these are groups
of people that either don't want to go out and raise the second round or third round of capital and they want to be part of
something bigger. In many cases, we can bring them in to be part of the company as well. Sometimes they just sell and
move on. But I would say we have a very active list of M&A opportunities. Fewer as a percentage would come to the
end, but it's not for a lack of having looked and seeing interest, and people know us, so they're coming at us.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Okay. Okay; good. And then, Andy, maybe a question for you on your margin guidance. You
talked about flattish for Q3. Is that something that's Q3 specific? Or is this more of a longer-term trend where maybe
we're seeing we're near the end of the margin pressure for the company?
<A - Andrew Cecere>: Yeah, Jon. So we talked about the fact that I expected the margin pressure to be worse in the
first quarter, five in the second quarter and start to dissipate as we got into the second half of the year. So it's not a
unique to third quarter event. It's just a function of our reinvestment rates coming closer to our rates currently on the
books and currently rolling off. So we talked about that happening. It is happening and we do expect the relative
stability.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Okay. Good. Thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Let me add one last – we didn't get a question on it, so I'm going to create my own. Richard,
what do you think about the growth of loan volume? Oh, thank you for the question.
We went from 1% linked quarter in quarter one to actually 1.25% in quarter two. We have enough of a view to see that
that will go up in quarter three. I don't know exactly how far because things – we still have 10 weeks to go. But we are
seeing – here's how I would characterize it. Our flight-to-quality, which we've talked about for many quarters, many
couple of years now, has become the real deal and it certainly brought us a lot of good market share in the years going
into this downturn. It's now becoming into a kind of phase two where we were invited into a lot of transactions and a
lot of customers at the depths of the recession when they wanted a strong, our highest ratings helped. And now, they're
rolling these over and we're getting invited back in at higher positions. We're invited in, in some cases, to lead
transactions. And of course, the other business that comes with it is amazing.
So for us to try to articulate why in a basically flat loan growth market we are growing now, while we still think that
can continue and in fact grow, I do think the secret sauce in U.S. Bank's business line is that we've got this
flight-to-quality that's now turning into a – we auditioned, we performed well, and now we're getting the lead part. And
that's really a good thing to see at this point and stage. And then at these commitments, we never talk enough about our
commitments to continue to grow faster than our loans outstanding. And as you all, as analysts, know, the minute and if
those actually get used, whoever has the line of credit has established themselves as the first among few to be the one to
draw on, that's going to be the next round of loan growth notwithstanding new customers. So we love our position
there, we're actually fairly opportunistic and we're going to tell you that in an optimistic way to give you a sense that
we see sustainability there.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Thanks, Richard.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Judy, that's it.
