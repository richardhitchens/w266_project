Operator
Welcome to the Devon Energy third quarter earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only
mode. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This call is being recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Communications and
Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Vincent W. White
Thank you and welcome, everyone, to Devon's third quarter earnings call and webcast.
Today's call will follow our usual format, where I'll cover a few preliminary items and then turn it over to our President
and CEO, John Richles. He'll provide comments on the quarter. And then following John's remarks, Dave Hager, our
Chief Operating Officer, will provide the operations update. We'll wrap up the prepared remarks with a financial
review by our CFO, Jeff Agosta. After Jeff's discussion, we will have a Q&A session, and we will conclude the call
after about an hour. But the Investor Relations team will be available for the rest of the day for any questions that we
don't get to during the call.
During the call today, we're going to update some of our forward-looking estimates based on our actual results that
we've seen over the first nine months of the year and our outlook for Q4. While we will not be filing a revised Form
8-K, we will post estimates reflecting these adjustments that are provided during the call today on the Guidance page of
our website. To access that guidance, click on the Guidance link found within the Investor Relations section of the

Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone.
The third quarter was another solid one for Devon both operationally and financially, as we continued to deliver on our
strategic plan. Higher oil production combined with better prices drove significant improvements in our margins,
allowing us to comfortably exceed Wall Street expectations for both earnings and cash flow for the quarter.
We achieved third quarter U.S. oil production growth of 38% year over year, largely driven by success in our Permian
Basin development programs. Over the past two years, we have doubled our light oil production in the U.S. to 81,000
barrels per day. And by year end, we expect our U.S. light oil production to top 90,000 barrels per day. Most
importantly, our success in growing our U.S. light oil production has resulted in higher margins and improved
profitability in the current commodity price environment.
Looking beyond the low-risk development projects that are driving today's growth, we're also investing in opportunities
that will provide the next leg of high-margin production growth for Devon. In the U.S., we're highly encouraged by the
progress we've made with our Mississippian-Woodford and our Rockies oil plays. Our light oil production in these
plays is growing rapidly and is currently approaching 20,000 barrels per day. Dave is going to speak to this later on in
the call.
We're also laying the groundwork for continued long-term growth with investments in our world-class portfolio of
thermal oil projects in Canada. These projects remain on track to produce at least 150,000 barrels of oil per day by the
end of the decade. And this highly visible oil production growth out of Canada will be a significant contributor to our
long-term success.
Our company-wide focus on oil production is not only delivering volume growth, but it's also improving our revenues
and cash margins. In the third quarter, oil revenue increased 19% compared to last quarter, accounting for nearly 60%
of our total upstream revenue. This growth in oil revenue has helped increase our cash margin per barrel by 16% year
over year to its highest level in recent history.
Another contributing factor to our margin expansion has been our ability to effectively control costs. In the third
quarter, our upstream cash costs per unit of production remained flat from last quarter. This is noteworthy considering
our rapid growth in oil production. At the same time, our focus on capital discipline has resulted in total capital
expenditures for 2013 remaining on track with the full-year guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. And in
the third quarter, cash inflows exceeded our capital demands.
On the liquidity front, we exited September with $4.3 billion of cash, with the majority of these funds residing in
foreign subsidiaries. Our tax position now affords us the opportunity to repatriate an additional $2 billion of cash to the
U.S. around year end at a tax rate in the mid-single digits. Jeff will speak to this in a little more detail later on in the
call.
Finally, before I hand the call off to Dave, I'd like to briefly review our recent announcement to combine substantially
all of our U.S. midstream assets with Crosstex to form a new midstream business. This strategic combination creates
one of the largest midstream companies in the United States, with assets located in some of the country's premier oil
and gas regions. Devon will retain significant influence on the direction of the new company through our majority

ownership interest in both the general partner and the MLP and majority representation on both boards.
This transaction allows us to obtain a market-based valuation for our U.S. midstream business in a tax-deferred manner
that's immediately accretive to our shareholders. As you may recall, our contribution of midstream assets and resulting
equity ownership in the new company was initially valued at $4.8 billion. Based on yesterday's closing prices, the
market value of our ownership interest totaled $6.6 billion or 16 times EBITDA of the contributed assets. This
valuation equates to roughly 25% of Devon's current market capitalization.
Just as important, the transaction improved the growth trajectory of our midstream investment. A key component of our
improved growth trajectory is Devon's 70% ownership in the new general partner. The new general partner will have
incentive distribution rights in the MLP in the highest tier, allowing us to disproportionately increase our share of the
MLP's distributable cash flow going forward. Additionally, the new company's investment-grade credit profile will
enable it to secure and execute sizable organic development and acquisition opportunities across the midstream value
chain. This positions the new business to deliver attractive long-term growth and distributions.
Another significant advantage of this transaction is our improved capital efficiency. Upon closing of the transaction,
future capital requirements associated with our contributed midstream assets will reside with the new company. This
will lessen our overall capital intensity and preserve cash flow for our growing E&P upstream business.
Furthermore, any build-out of new midstream assets supporting our E&P business could be completed by the new
company. This approach eliminates the capital call on Devon while allowing us to maintain influence over the
development and management of the assets via our majority ownership of the new company. Our relationship with the
new company also provides us the opportunity to attractively sell additional midstream assets currently held or
developed by Devon in a manner that's accretive to our shareholders.
So overall, the transaction and the resulting new company greatly accelerate the value proposition of Devon's
previously announced standalone MLP and is another clear and successful example of our efforts to unlock value for
our shareholders.
So in summary, we continue to successfully execute our business plan both operationally and financially. This is
evidenced by the continuation of strong oil production growth from our development projects and the progress we're
making on emerging plays that will enhance our long-term oil and liquids growth profile. Furthermore, our pursuit of
high-margin production combined with effective management of operating and capital costs is improving profitability.
And finally, we took another significant step in unlocking unrecognized asset value within Devon through the
formation of a new midstream business and the planned repatriation of an additional $2 billion at very favorable tax
rates.
So at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave Hager for a more detailed review of our quarterly operational
highlights. Dave?
David A. Hager
Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone.
As John mentioned, the third quarter was one of solid execution by our asset team, resulting in strong oil production
growth. This growth in oil production combined with effective cost management allowed us to expand margins and
grow cash flow.
Looking specifically at costs, our results year to date have benefited from our supply chain efforts and improved
drilling efficiencies. As a result, our service and supply costs have declined by roughly 5% compared to 2012. In
addition, we are realizing cost savings through drilling efficiencies in each of our core operating regions, allowing us to
complete our full-year programs with fewer rigs than originally budgeted. Due to this enhanced productivity, as of the
end of September we had reduced our rig count by 10% from last quarter to 64 operated rigs.

Now let's take a closer look at some of the key operating highlights in the third quarter, beginning with the Permian.
Our production averaged a record 82,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with light oil accounting for 60% of our total
volumes. We are currently running 23 operated rigs in the Permian, and by year end we expect to have drilled more
than 350 wells for the full year.
In the Delaware Basin, our Bone Spring horizontal program continues to be a key driver of our Permian oil growth. We
currently have 12 operated rigs working in the play. In third quarter, we brought 24 Bone Spring wells online with
average 30-day IP rates of 690 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which more than 70% was light oil. These
production results were about 20% better than our type well profile.
With a large portion of our acreage derisked and in the development stage, pad drilling is playing an increasingly
important role in our development plans. With current well costs already meeting our type well economics, we expect
the efficiencies of pad drilling to further reduce costs and enhance our already outstanding Bone Spring returns. We
have roughly 1,400 Bone Spring locations identified, and we fully expect that our ongoing drilling and geologic work
in this top tier light oil play will allow us to further increase our inventory over time.
Also in the Delaware Basin, there have been a number of positive Wolfcamp wells drilled by other operators around
our acreage in both Ward and Reeves County. In the fourth quarter, we expect to begin completing our first horizontal
Wolfcamp test in Ward County. Keep in mind, our 2013 program in the Delaware Basin has been focused on our
low-risk, high-return oil development opportunities in areas like the Bone Spring, but we are paying close attention to
the exploration drilling and derisking industry is doing in the Delaware Wolfcamp.
We are well positioned in the Delaware Wolfcamp, with approximately 140,000 net prospective acres. Across the
entire Permian Basin, Devon has over 300,000 net acres prospective in the Wolfcamp. This includes our Wolfcamp
Shale position in the southern portion of the Midland Basin, where we have been adding to our position and now have
more than 100,000 net acres.
We continue in full development mode with our five-rig program. During the third quarter, we spud 35 new horizontal
Wolfcamp Shale wells and brought 26 online, with average 30-day IP rates of 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of
which nearly 75% is light oil. Landing and completing our wells in the lower Wolfcamp continues to yield consistent
production results that are in line with our type well profile for this play.
On the drilling front, we continue to improve returns in this play by reducing drilling time and completion costs.
During the third quarter, our average well cost came in at $5.5 million, about 10% below our type well. We have
approximately 800 undrilled locations in this light oil resource play, and we expect to expand our inventory over time
as we begin to derisk our recently added acreage.
In summary, Devon's 1.3 million net acres in the Permian represents one of the largest and highest quality acreage
positions in the industry. We continue to be one of the most active Permian drillers. And as a result, we are on track to
deliver basin-wide oil production growth of more than 30% in 2013. We have established thousands of undrilled
low-risk locations in the Permian, and our inventory continues to grow with exciting opportunities in emerging plays
like the Delaware Wolfcamp.
Shifting to the Mississippian-Woodford trend in north central Oklahoma, we are excited about the progress we are
making across our 650,000 net acre position. We have 15 operated rigs running in the trend. In the third quarter, we
tied in 49 operated wells across the trend, many of which were drilled in previous quarters. We continued a very active
program in the Woodford oil shale in the third quarter and spud 57 new Woodford oil wells. During the quarter, we tied
in 10 Woodford wells on our joint venture acreage, with initial 30-day production rate averaging 535 barrels of oil
equivalent per day, of which more than 75% was light oil. This is well above our type curve for the trend. These results
include the Jardot 1-6/7 that achieved an average 30-day IP rate of nearly 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day,
including 1,700 barrels of oil. Even excluding this outstanding well, our third quarter Woodford program exceeded our
type curve for the trend.
Seismic has played a key part in the early success of our Woodford drilling. Of the 27 Woodford wells brought online
this year on our joint venture acreage, we have seen more than a 100% increase in 30-day IP rates in our wells drilled

with the benefit of 3D seismic as compared to those wells drilled without.
We were also achieving some encouraging results in the Mississippian [Miss] Lime on our joint venture acreage during
the third quarter. Our Miss Lime results were highlighted by 14 wells brought online, with average 30-day IP rates of
nearly 500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 345 barrels per day of light oil. While our Miss Lime results
across the trend continue to vary depending on location, reservoir quality, landing zones, and completion techniques,
we fully expect the integration of 3D seismic indoor geologic modeling to optimize our Miss Lime results over time.
To date, we have acquired 3D seismic over a majority of our acreage inside the joint venture area.
We are also seeing encouraging results outside the JV in both the Miss Lime and the Woodford oil shale formations. In
Grant County, where we have approximately 79,000 net acres, we completed a well subsequent to quarter end in the
Miss Lime, with an average 24-hour IP rate of more than 920 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including over 800
barrels of oil. Additionally, during the third quarter we drilled our first Woodford oil shale well in Grant County. This
well had a 30-day IP of 225 barrels of oil equivalent per day and was drilled without the benefit of seismic. With this
well confirming the existence of an oil charged Woodford interval comparable to that of our wells in the JV area, we
are excited about obtaining seismic in Grant County. While it is very early in our testing of this acreage, these results
demonstrate the productive capability of the Woodford and Miss Limes in the north of our JV core.
Combining our Woodford oil shale and Miss Lime results, our third quarter production across the trend averaged 8,800
barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 65% increase over the second quarter. This production growth is especially
impressive given our inventory of over 100 wells yet to be tied in or completed. As of mid-October, this included 19
wells held up by pad drilling, 27 wells awaiting completion, 37 wells currently in some phase of completion, and
another 25 wells awaiting infrastructure build-out. While this level of inventory is to be expected in an emerging play,
we believe the backlog will level off early next year as more and more of our midstream infrastructure is placed in
service. We exited the third quarter with production accelerating to 10,700 barrel of oil equivalent per day, putting us
on track to approach our 2013 exit rate of 15,000 BOE per day for the Mississippian-Woodford Trend.
Also on the emerging play front, our Rockies oil program, the Powder River Basin delivered excellent results in the
quarter, with oil production increasing 34% over the year-ago period to 11,000 barrels per day. In the third quarter, we
tied in two Frontier wells with initial 30-day production rates averaging 740 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which
more than 85% was light oil. We are also excited about two additional high-rate oil wells we brought online early in the
fourth quarter targeting the Frontier formation. The 24-hour IP rates of these two wells each averaged in excess of
1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with light oil comprising almost 90% of the production. In addition, we're
currently completing our first two long lateral wells in the Powder River Basin and should have those well results by
our next call. To date, we have identified approximately 600 risked locations across our Powder River acreage, and we
expect this inventory to grow as we continue to derisk this emerging light oil opportunity.
Shifting to our thermal oil projects in Northeastern Alberta, third quarter production from our two Jackfish projects
averaged roughly 46,000 barrels of oil per day net of royalties. The significant improvement in heavy oil pricing
boosted our Jackfish price realizations by 36% over the previous quarter, helping to improve our cash margins for the
quarter. Jackfish 1 production averaged 29,600 barrels per day during the quarter due to a step-up in royalty rates as a
result of reaching payout in June. However, continuing improvement in our steam oil ratio allowed us to achieve
average gross production of 36,000 barrels per day in the quarter, exceeding the facilities nameplate capacity of 35,000
barrels a day.
As we indicated on our last quarterly call, Jackfish 2 was taken down during the third quarter for scheduled
maintenance. The plant turnaround was completed ahead of schedule, on budget, and with an accelerated ramp-up. This
is significant improvement compared to previous turnarounds in our Jackfish facilities and is a testament to the hard
work and expertise of our thermal project team. Since each SAGD facility requires planned maintenance downtime
every two to three years, efficiency gains on turnarounds lead to higher full-cycle returns.
Also of note, at the end of the third quarter we began steaming a new well pad at Jackfish 2. This pad at peak
production is expected to contribute up to 8,000 barrels of oil per day gross from nine new well pairs. Full ramp-up of
the pad is expected to occur over the next 12 months.

At Jackfish 3, we remain ahead of schedule and on budget, with nearly 80% of the project complete. First steam is
anticipated in the third quarter of 2014, roughly one quarter sooner than originally expected.
Moving now to the Cana-Woodford shale in western Oklahoma, our third quarter production averaged a record 57,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our expanded processing facilities helped to increase oil and liquids production to
21,000 barrels per day, up 58% compared to the prior-year quarter. Liquids now comprise nearly 40% of total
Cana-Woodford production. And with our drilling activity focused in the very best parts of the liquids-rich core, we are
producing a more valuable liquids stream. Combined with our strong, liquids-rich production growth and low operating
cost, Cana-Woodford unit operating margins increased 39% year over year.
Our record production performance in the quarter was underpinned by excellent drilling results. We brought 39
operated wells online with 30-day IP rates of 950 BOE per day, including 475 barrels of liquids per day. These wells
results exceed our play type curve by 15%.
In addition, we continue to improve our drilling efficiency at Cana. In just this year alone, we have seen a 25%
improvement in the number of days from spud to rig release. This improvement in drill time will allow us to finish our
2013 program of nearly 150 wells with only nine operated rigs, three less than our original budget.
And finally in the Barnett Shale in north Texas, our liquids-rich drilling program continues to generate competitive
returns. Our expanded capacity at our Bridgeport facility helped drive oil and liquids production increase 15% year
over year to 58,000 barrels per day, a record production level. Our initiatives to reduce line pressure and utilize
artificial lift to date have been very successful, with net production in the third quarter averaging 1.4 BCF equivalent
per day.
So in summary, we had another strong quarter of execution across our entire North American onshore portfolio. The
core focus areas that I have discussed today on the call are delivering highly economic and robust production growth
for Devon. If you apply a relatively conservative oil-to-natural gas price ratio of 20-to-1 to company-wide production
in the third quarter, our top line growth increased nearly 10% year over year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?
Jeffrey A. Agosta
Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that shaped our
third quarter results and where called for provide updated guidance. I will also elaborate on the good news about our
cash repatriation plans that John mentioned earlier.
Looking first at production, in the third quarter we produced approximately 64 million oil equivalent barrels or about
691,000 equivalent barrels per day. This was in the top half of our guidance range and most importantly was
underpinned by strong high-margin oil growth. For the quarter, company-wide oil production averaged 165,000 barrels
per day, an increase of 16% compared to the same period last year. As John detailed earlier, this growth was driven
entirely by our U.S. properties with light oil production up 38% year over year.
Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect strong oil growth in the Permian Basin and the Mississippian-Woodford Trend
to continue, driving U.S. light oil production up more than 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. This
impressive growth will increase our expected total company-wide oil production next quarter to a range of 170,000 to
175,000 barrels per day. After taking into account declines in dry natural gas, we expect total company-wide
production in Q4 to range between 680,000 and 700,000 BOE per day. Overall, this keeps us on track to deliver on our
full-year production guidance of 250 million to 254 million BOE.
Moving to price realizations, overall our third quarter regional price realizations by product were generally in line with
our expectations. Looking specifically at Canadian oil prices, in the third quarter higher seasonal demand and improved
flow rates on export pipes for heavy oil out of Canada improved our realizations to 75% of WTI or $80 per barrel. This
represents the best oil prices we have seen for Canada since 2009.

Even with this excellent result, the supply-and-demand dynamics for Canadian crudes remain very tight. In fact,
subsequent to the third quarter, increased supply from new oil sands projects, refinery downtime, and outages at
third-party pipelines have resulted in downward pressure on Canadian oil prices. Based on what we have seen so far in
October and November trading, we now expect our Canadian oil realizations to temporarily decline to a range of 50%
to 60% of WTI in the fourth quarter before the impact of hedges.
Offsetting the lower pricing are the attractive Canadian heavy oil hedges we have in place. For the fourth quarter, we
have 40,000 barrels per day of WCS blended crude swapped at a discount to WTI of $22 per barrel. These attractive
hedges cover well over 50% of our expected thermal oil production output for the quarter.
Looking ahead to 2014, the increase in the heavy oil capacity at BP's Whiting refinery will improve demand, and
increased export pipeline and rail capacity will help alleviate transportation bottlenecks. These favorable catalysts
should reduce the overall pricing volatility of Canadian crudes and support the narrowing of differentials as we go
through 2014.
Looking briefly at natural gas, the only notable change to our previous guidance is a minor adjustment to account for
AECO differentials in Canada. Now that we are seeing improved export flow rates out of Canada, we expect Canadian
gas price realizations to improve in the fourth quarter to a range of 75% to 85% of Henry Hub. For natural gas liquids,
we expect our company-wide fourth quarter price realizations to remain essentially flat with the last few quarters,
ranging from $25 to $27 per barrel.
Turning now to our midstream business, once again our marketing in Midstream operations delivered excellent results,
generating $137 million of operating profit in the third quarter, a 25% increase compared to the third quarter of last
year. Increased throughput at our newly expanded Cana and Barnett processing facilities, higher natural gas prices, and
strong cost controls drove our solid performance. Based on our results for the first nine months and our outlook for the
fourth quarter, we now expect our full-year operating profit to come in between $475 million and $525 million. This is
a $25 million increase over our previous guidance.
Moving to expenses, in the third quarter our total pre-tax cash costs came in at $15.13 per BOE. This result was right in
line with our expectations, maintaining costs essentially flat with last quarter. This is an especially positive result
considering the negative volume impact and higher LOE costs associated with our planned turnaround at Jackfish 2
during the quarter. Overall, our cost structure remains one of the best in the industry, even as we transition our portfolio
to higher-margin but higher-cost oil production.
Going to the bottom line, our third quarter performance translated into non-GAAP earnings of $526 million or $1.29
per diluted share. This represents a 47% increase in earnings per share year over year and comfortably exceeded Wall
Street expectations by $0.09. This level of earnings translated into cash flow per share of $3.89, also exceeding the
Street's expectations.
Before we open the call to Q&A, I will conclude my remarks with a quick review of our financial position. During the
third quarter, Devon generated operating cash flow of $1.6 billion, an 18% increase compared to the year-ago quarter.
When you include the nearly $300 million of proceeds from the closing of minor asset sales during the quarter, our
cash inflows totaled $1.9 billion. These cash inflows comfortably funded our total CapEx of $1.7 billion. It is also
important to note that for the full year, our total capital spending, which includes E&P, midstream, and corporate
capital, remains on track to be near the midpoint of our guidance we provided at the beginning of the year.
From a balance sheet and liquidity perspective, we remain exceptionally strong. We exited the quarter with a net debt
to adjusted cap ratio of only 22% and cash balances of $4.3 billion. Of these cash balances, approximately $3.6 billion
resides in subsidiaries outside North America. As John mentioned earlier, our tax position now affords us with the
opportunity to efficiently repatriate an additional $2 billion of cash to the U.S. around year end. We expect NOLs and
other credits to limit our tax rate on this repatriated cash to somewhere in the 4% to 6% range. By year end, we will
have repatriated $4 billion of foreign cash at an estimated tax rate of approximately 5%.

To provide some perspective on the significance of this, you might recall after divesting our international assets in 2010
and 2011, we guided toward a tax rate of about 20%. The lower actual tax rate on the amount repatriated to the U.S.
and the tax-free transfer of $500 million to Canada we made earlier in the year will result in an incremental $700
million benefit to Devon's shareholders, roughly the equivalent of about $1.75 per share.
In summary, it was another solid quarter for Devon. We delivered strong oil production growth. We expanded our
margins through growth in light oil. We maintained strong cost controls, and we remain positioned with one of the best
balance sheets in the industry.
So with that, I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A. Vince?

Thanks, Jeff. As a reminder, during the Q&A session we'll ask each participant to limit his or her question to one initial
inquiry and one follow-up. With that, operator, we're ready for the first question.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC. Your line is now open.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - John Richels>: Good morning.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Looking at the Permian Basin and the Southern Delaware, a couple questions. You talked about
expanding your inventory there. Can you give us a little bit more color on that, like how many of the benches down
there you all have tested and which ones you think are going to be prospective and which ones are in your current well
count? And then the other thing I think is you all just recently acquired Forest Oil's acres down there. Can you give us a
little bit of thoughts on what you're seeing there?
<A - David A. Hager>: Scott, you were talking about the southern Midland Basin, I think, weren't you, not the
Delaware?
<Q - Scott Hanold>: I'm sorry if I said Delaware. Yes, you're correct.
<A - David A. Hager>: Right. Yes, we have tested and there's obviously a nomenclature issue within the industry that
we prefer to call it that we have tested both the middle and the lower Wolfcamp. Those are the primary prospective
zones on our acreage. We are right now for the most part, and it varies a little across the acreage, but for the most part
we are completing in the lower Wolfcamp, and we believe that allows us to actually frac up to the middle Wolfcamp as
well. So by industry nomenclature, I think that would be completing more in the F. And then the frac would contribute
on up through the D in there.
Regarding the Forest acreage, that's the part that I didn't mention in my comments earlier. That's the additional acreage
that we acquired. It's a little over 50,000 acres, I think around 53,000 acres or so total. We haven't drilled any wells on
that acreage yet. We will start drilling those next year. And that's the comment I was making that I do believe it will
expand our inventory. We have not expanded our inventory at all in the comment I gave to you already. But we fully
anticipate that it's going to work and will be additive to the overall position
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. Just to again clarify on your current inventory count in the southern Midland Basin, I think
it was 800 locations. Is that assuming an upper and a lower Wolfcamp?
<A - David A. Hager>: It is considered what is appropriate to complete in each of those, and we have not really
plugged into there that we would have multiple completions at the same location.

<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay.
<A - David A. Hager>: So that's a single completion at each of our locations. It is possible through time we may see
that we may complete in more than one zone from the same location, but we haven't included that in our location count.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay, because I think some of your competitors or peers are talking about anywhere from two to
four different formations prospective in each drilling location.
<A - David A. Hager>: That's certainly a possibility through time, and we have the same opportunities our peers do.
It's just how we choose to classify our locations, perhaps a little more conservative
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. And based on your acreage contracts, do you have to drill the lowest formation to hold
everything?
<A - David A. Hager>: Scott, I'd have to check on that. That is typical that you would, but I'd have to check. Let me
think about whether there's a clause or not. I'll give some clarification here. They're saying we're in the same zone, so I
don't think we have to. Now the more I think about it, I think that's right, if we drill on the upper that it would still hold
the lower.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks.
<A - David A. Hager>: Yes.

Your next question comes from Benny Wong of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Benny C. K . Wong>: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I know the Crosstex deal hasn't closed yet. But can you
tell us how you were thinking about the dropdown pace of assets into the MLP, just to see if you can dimension the
benefit of the combinations versus doing an IPO in terms of speed to market?
<A - John Richels>: Benny, there are really a couple of different dropdowns that we can do in the MLP. As you know,
we put half of our assets into the GP and half into the MLP, so there will be a continuing dropdown from the GP to the
MLP of interest in our midstream company. And then we do have other assets; the one that we flagged at the time –
other assets that we didn't put into the MLP. One of the assets that we flagged at the time was our interest in the Access
Pipeline, which is the pipeline that services our Jackfish and Pike acreage and also has third-party volumes from other
operators in the area, and that's certainly something that we can drop down. When we do that is a little bit up in the air
right now. We're in the course of constructing that. I think it's going to be completed by the end of 2014 roughly, in
third quarter of 2014, and so a 2015 dropdown is certainly possible. We'll have to take stock of things at the time that
we finish it.
I think the really important part and the really exciting part for us is that not only have we got a market valuation of
what those assets are, but in the future it gives us a lot of flexibility around building new assets, dropping down some
existing assets that we haven't put in yet, and also doing acquisition. And by doing that, it accelerates the value over
what it would otherwise have seen.
<Q - Benny C. K . Wong>: Okay, great. And just my second question is in regards to the $2 billion in cash being
repatriated. Can you give an update on what you're thinking there, in particular where you guys want to put it?
<A - John Richels>: Yes, of course. As Jeff mentioned, it's likely to be around year end before we can repatriate those
funds. And, Benny, as you may know, most of the folks on the call are probably familiar with the factors that we've
talked about in the past that we take into account as we allocate our capital. And the objective we've always enunciated
is to optimize cash flow per debt-adjusted share. So when we bring that cash back around the end of the year, we'll
allocate using the same parameters.

We're right now in the middle of or continuing to develop our 2014 capital budgets, and we'll do that over the next
couple of months. And as we move into 2014, we'll finalize our capital allocation decisions. At that time, share
buybacks are always included in our consideration of capital investments, and we've got a great track record of buying
stock back over the years. But to give you any more definite guidelines around that right now would be a little
premature.

Your next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers Investments. Your line is now open
<Q - Jeffrey Campbell>: My question is on the Woodford oil play. My first question is because I wasn't entirely sure
from what I heard. Is all of your current drilling on JV lands, or are you also doing some drilling aside from the Grant
County? It sounded like a wildcat. Are you doing any drilling on your non-JV acreage?
<A - David A. Hager>: This is Dave. We just have one rig that's working outside of the JV. The rest of the rigs are
working within the JV. And that's the rig in Grant County.
<Q - Jeffrey Campbell>: Right. And my other question with regard to the Woodford, I'm looking at the map of your
acreage in the area. Do you believe that you have prospectivity in any of the other counties besides Grant? I'm thinking
non-JV again, like maybe Kay or Osage County?
<A - David A. Hager>: It's possible. We need to drill some wells over there and determine it. Again, we are seeing
such an advantage here of getting 3D seismic, and that's what has really helped us out dramatically within the JV.
We're going to drill a few wells up here in Grant and Kay County without 3D. 3D in and of itself costs a fair amount of
money, and so we want to make sure that we have a working petroleum system up there before we actually spend the
money on the 3D. We now have in Grant County enough confirmation of that through the wells that I discussed that we
are shooting 3D up there. We'll be going through the same process in Kay County.
The overall comment that I've made before is that we have 650,000 acres in total in the Mississippian. Of that, we
believe there is sufficient thickness of the Woodford to have potential prospectivity across 400,000 of that 650,000
acres. To date, we feel we have derisked 100,000 of that 400,000 acres. So we have the thickness across the 400,000
acres, but there are other elements that factor into there as far as the maturity of the oil, do you have sufficient
permeability, et cetera. And that's what we'll have to determine across that other 300,000 acres we're talking about,
some of which is in Grant County and some of which is in Kay County.
<Q - Jeffrey Campbell>: Okay, that was great color. Thanks very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from Matt Portillo of TPH. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matthew Portillo>: Good morning, guys, just a quick question for me in regards to your oil growth guidance for
Q4. It looks like the step-up on a quarter-over-quarter basis is pretty flat, especially with the ramp-up in the Canadian
volumes. I was just wondering if you can comment maybe where we're seeing a little bit of deceleration in the growth
into year end, or if that was in line with your planned expectation going into the fourth quarter here.
<A - David A. Hager>: Yes, Matt, it's a little bit less than we guided to last quarter. The first thing I want to make
clear to everyone, though, about this is our wells are delivering exactly as we anticipated. I went through it area by
area. The capabilities of the wells are there. That is not the issue. There are a couple other issues that have factored into
it, though, overall. First, we are seeing some downtime with our ongoing production in the Permian, especially as it
related to electrical submersible pumps that we're running in all these. Our runtime of those has been a little bit less
than we anticipated. We're working through that issue as we speak, but that has caused our base production to fall a

little bit short of what we anticipated; nothing to do with the productivity of the wells, just the efficiency of the pump.
Secondarily, in the Rockies, because of the success we had with our Rockies drilling program, we took a little bit of
capital out of a CO2 flood that we were going to spend that were going to deliver a few thousand barrels a day and kept
a rig running in the Powder River Basin because of the outstanding results we're getting there. Those volumes
associated with that rig will show up next year but not this year.
Then finally, because of the stronger prices when we put our projection out there that we were seeing in Canadian oil
because of the stronger realizations, we anticipated royalties would be a little bit higher, and so that would cause the net
production to go down a little bit as well. But having said all that, I want to make sure that you understand that U.S. oil
growth in Q4 is going to be greater than 30% versus Q4 of 2012. So we're still having very, very strong oil growth. It's
just some minor issues like that that have nothing to do with the productivity of the wells that have caused it to decrease
it a little bit.
<Q - Matthew Portillo>: Great, thanks for the clarification there. And just in regards to some of the initial well results
you've seen in the Woodford, I was wondering if you could potentially compare the rates of return you're seeing on
your Woodford program versus your southern Midland program. And if you continue to see strong initial rates here in
line with or above your type curve, could we potentially see capital allocated away from the Permian into the Woodford
or an acceleration in your Woodford drilling? Thank you.
<A - David A. Hager>: We're going through that entire evaluation process right now of comparing the returns. And
we're obviously a little bit less than the overall maturity of the program in the Woodford than we are in the southern
Midland Basin. But having said that, we've had some outstanding results this quarter with well, well above the type
curve, and of course highlighted by the Jardot well that had a 30-day IP of 2,200 BOE per day. So we like both these
plays an awful lot. To ask me to make a decision between one or the other is tough because they're two of our top plays
and we like them both, but we're certainly very pleased with the Woodford results.
<Q - Matthew Portillo>: Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Good morning.
<A - John Richels>: Good morning, Arun.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: John, it has been a busy year on the strategic front. By year end, you'll complete two major
repatriations and you've got the midstream transaction. So I was just wondering if you could maybe comment on where
Devon is in terms of the overall portfolio. Anything else that you're working on in terms of portfolio changes, or is this
the asset base going forward?
<A - John Richels>: Arun, as you know, in this business, that's a constant. You're always looking to bring good
opportunities into the asset base, and sometimes that means that other opportunities don't look as attractive anymore
and you move them out. So that's not something that we – it's a continuum. We're not at the end of it. We've always got
to look at that. So it's an ongoing process to continue to try to increase our productivity as a company and our value for
our shareholders. It's something we're looking at all the time.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: John, just to maybe elaborate on that, at one time you guys were doing some analytical work
around Canada and maybe a spinoff or something like that. Have you come to a decision on that, or are you still
evaluating that?
<A - John Richels>: I think these things are all things that we're evaluating all the time. And I think you know that in
our history, we've proven that we're not afraid of making bold moves when we have to. But a lot of things people talk
about and reflect on from the outside don't always add long-term value, particularly when you look at taxation and

everything else that's involved. So we're always looking at how we might bring value forward. And as we previously
said, we're not leaving any stone unturned. But we're not going to do things that – we're only going to do things that
add long-term value and we're not going to take action simply for action's sake. So these are things we're always
looking at, but sometimes they're not quite so simple.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: That's helpful. Dave, I wanted to see if you can elaborate a little bit more on this ESP related
downtime. Is this something that could have a knock-on effect as we think about 2014, or is it more isolated to the
fourth quarter?
<A - David A. Hager>: It's something that we're working on right now and we think is very solvable. Basically, we're
running these ESPs in an unconventional environment, and frankly we're running a lot of sand through these ESPs,
which as you can imagine, running sand through pumps is not a great thing for long-term life. But we are working with
some of our vendors on ways that we can get a better design out there. We're also working on ways that we can
improve the efficiency of replacing these ESPs. And so I don't think it's going to have a long-term impact.
We have a special team. I can tell you internally that it's working very hard along with our vendors, and I think it's
something that we're going to come to a good answer on here in the next three or four months. And frankly, that's just
one of the things that contributed to it. The other I mentioned was the change in the Rockies program due to the
additional rig and also the impact of potentially higher royalties due to improved realizations in Canada. So I wouldn't
overplay that. It's just one of several factors.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Okay. My last question would be just what your new midstream spending levels could look like
post the closing of the transaction?
<A - Vincent W. White>: That of course is dependent upon where we choose to spend capital. And so we're in the
process of working our 2014 capital budget. Until we've got the upstream piece, we won't know exactly what the
midstream piece is. But directionally, surely, we certainly expect it to be down.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Okay. Thanks, Vince.

Your next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Good morning, thank you for taking my question. Going back to the Woodford, can you
give us an idea if that 75% to 80% oil cut that you see in the Jardot well is representative of what the oil/gas split is for
the rest of your wells there?
<A - David A. Hager>: In all of our wells in the Woodford, it's going to have a higher oil cut early in the life, which
certainly is beneficial from a rig return and NPV standpoint. Although over the life of the well, we anticipate they will
become more gassy, and the ultimate – when you look at total EUR, it will probably split about equally one-third each
for oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Got it. Thank you, Dave. And then I know it's early in the play, and clearly this Jardot well
is a great well. But I was wondering if you can elaborate a bit on if this well – if you had an idea ahead of time that this
well might really perform well whether because it's a long lateral or whether there's something you saw on the seismic
that gave you an indication or whether this just a surprise to everybody?
<A - David A. Hager>: It was a long lateral, so that certainly helped. But there also were some other geological
characteristics, which of course I'm not going to tell you, that we had observed ahead of time and that we think that
benefited that. Your obvious follow-on, is it repeatable, I'm sure. And to some degree yes, but we're not going to be
able to drill those wells everywhere across the acreage. But we think we have a good idea for what allowed that and
we'll have some of those type wells across our acreage position we think again.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Dave, you understood exactly what I was after. Thank you for the added detail.

Your next question comes from David Tameron of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
<Q - David R. Tameron>: Hi, good morning. Can you guys just talk about in the Permian, you addressed this a little
bit, but can you give me some color on Delaware versus Midland, the differences between the two, and the rates of
return and well costs?
<A - David A. Hager>: Are you talking specifically, David, about the Wolfcamp or across our entire portfolio?
<Q - David R. Tameron>: No, just what you're seeing in the Bone Spring versus – and I was just citing the wells you
put in the press release as far as – the Permian wells or the Bone Spring wells looked to have higher IPs by a couple
hundred barrels or so, I guess close to 300 barrels on those 30-day rates. And I was looking at that versus...
<A - David A. Hager>: Right. Yes, in general, to answer your question, the Bone Spring are our highest returns in our
portfolio in the Permian Basin and amongst the highest in our entire portfolio as a company, although all of them
generate strong rates of return. The Bone Spring are a little bit better, no question.

Your next question comes from Mark Hanson of Morningstar. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark Hanson>: Good morning, guys, two quick questions for you. First, how would you characterize the Miss
Lime performance relative to your expectations based on results to date? I know you've given a lot of good color this
morning across the trend, both Woodford and Mississippian Lime. It just seems from commentary you provided you're
a bit more enthusiastic about the Woodford at this point.
<A - David A. Hager>: We still like the Miss Lime an awful lot. It is meeting our type curve expectations, certainly
within the JV and is actually above our type curve expectation slightly, so we're very happy within the JV. North of the
JV, in Grant and Kay County, we've had mixed results. I talked about one very good well that we had up there in the
past quarter. We've had some that are not as good. But you have to understand; this was done without the benefit of
seismic. So the primary thing we're trying to do up there outside the JV right now is see if we have enough evidence to
have a good strong working petroleum system, which we now are confident in Grant County that we do have that. And
now that we have that, we'll shoot 3D up there and we'll really refine where we're drilling those wells. And I'd
anticipate the results come much more consistent and to improve with the benefit of 3D.
But overall, as far as the Miss goes, it is meeting our expectations. It's just that this Woodford, particularly within the
joint venture area and now we've had at least one well up in Grant County that's somewhat encouraging as well, it's just
working spectacularly.
<Q - Mark Hanson>: Great, that's very helpful. And then the second question just with your Permian rig count, I saw
that it dropped by a meaningful amount. I don't know if that's related to the ESP issues, but any more information on
where rigs were dropped and the thinking behind that?
<A - David A. Hager>: It has nothing to with the ESP issues at all. We dropped our rig count because we've become
significantly more efficient in drilling our wells. We executed our entire program for 2013, and we could execute it
with less rigs. So if we had kept the same amount of rigs, we would have overspent our capital for this year. And so we
were just exercising capital discipline to stay within the overall capital by reducing our rig count. But we executed the
program we had intended to this year.

And your last question comes from Biju Perincheril of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Biju, we apologize for butchering your name.
<Q - Biju Z. Perincheril>: That's quite all right; I'm used to it. The question I had was in the Wolfcamp. It looks like
the 30-day rate this quarter was maybe a little bit slower than what you had in the past. And I was just wondering if
that's because you're changing anything around on the completion front. Or is that just normal variability?
<A - David A. Hager>: Nothing significant there, Biju, that changed around. It's just what pads we happen to be
bringing on this quarter, but I wouldn't read anything else into it. Next quarter it could go back up just as easily as it
went down a little bit this quarter. There's nothing significant there.
<Q - Biju Z. Perincheril>: Okay. And aerially or geographically, were you drilling in generally the same areas?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yes, generally, we're drilling in the same areas still. One comment I wanted to make too. Scott
Hanold asked a question that stumped me earlier about holding all rights, and the reason was I wasn't thinking about it
as clearly as I should have been. The answer is it's an academic question because we're actually completing in the
lowest Wolfcamp zone. So because we're completing in the lowest Wolfcamp zone, we're going to have all the rights
above that. So it's really an academic issue. We'll hold all that.
<Q - Biju Z. Perincheril>: Okay. And one question along those lines is do you have any plans in the near term to test
different horizons at the same location?
<A - David A. Hager>: Nothing immediate. We recognize the prospectivity there, but we are right now just
delineating our entire acreage position.

Folks, I'm showing the top of the hour, so that concludes today's call. As usual, our Investor Relations staff will be
around the rest of the day to answer any questions that didn't make it into the call or if you come up with other things
during the day.
So before signing off, I'd just like to go over a few key takeaways. First, our core assets are performing very well,
leading to higher oil weighting for our portfolio. This is driven by the 38% year-over-year growth in light oil
production from our U.S. portfolio. Results from our emerging U.S. light oil plays and long-term investment in
Canadian thermal oil are providing visibility on the next leg of oil growth for Devon. Our pursuit of high-margin
production is improving profitability, and we're doing an excellent job of controlling operating and capital costs. By
year end, we will have repatriated $4 billion of cash at very favorable tax rates, translating into about $1.75 per share
benefit to Devon shareholders. And finally, we took another significant step forward in unlocking unrecognized asset
value within Devon through the formation of our new midstream business.
Going forward, our approach to the business remains unchanged. We will continue to pursue our top strategic
objective; that is, to maximize long-term growth and cash flow per share after adjusting for debt. So we look forward to
talking with you again on the next call and thank you very much for joining us today.
