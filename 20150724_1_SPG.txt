David E. Simon
Good morning. We had a productive quarter. We completed several significant redevelopment projects, started
construction on others, announced even more that will further enhanced the value of our real estate. We identified
additional avenues for growth through our two new retail partner joint ventures. And most importantly, we continue to
produce strong operating and financial performance.
Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.63 per share, which included a $0.22 gain on a sale of marketable
securities. Excluding the investment gain, FFO per share was $2.41, which exceeded first call consensus, again, by
$0.06. These results were achieved even with the negative impact of $0.04 for the quarter, compared to the prior-year
quarter due to a strong dollar against the euro and yen.
On a comparable basis, excluding the contribution from WP properties in the prior-year period, and again the
investment gain, our FFO per diluted share increased 14.2% or over $0.30 year-over-year. Occupancy was 96.1%,
leasing activity remains healthy. We recorded spread of $10.87, an increase of 18.4%. Comp NOI for the quarter
increased 3.6%, which was coming off a 5.6% comp increase in the second quarter of 2014. And for those of you that
are interested, we do not include lease settlement income in our comp NOI or new deals such as Jersey Garden, our
recent joint venture activity.
And we also do not include the impact of recently developed or expanded centers. And finally, we continue to produce
strong comp NOI increases year-after-year, as well as continue to operate at the highest margins in our industry. Total
sales across the portfolio increased 2.2% for the trailing 12 months, even with the loss of bankrupt tenants.
On a comparable basis, the sales per square foot, where foot increase for the 12-months ending June 30 was 4.2%. And
as a reminder, our sales per square foot metric is not adjusted to remove any tenants who have vacated their spaces. It
includes tenant sales activity for all months a tenant is open during the trailing 12-month period.
Redevelopment is ongoing at 28 properties, across all three platforms, for a total spend of $1.7 billion. We opened
significant expansion activities at Las Vegas North and Shisui Premium Outlets in Japan, started construction on
several new and strategic projects during the quarter.
Construction continues on some iconic properties, including Roosevelt Field, The Galleria in Houston, Stanford
Shopping Center, King of Prussia, Del Amo, and our Premium Outlets are expanding in Chicago, San Francisco, and
Woodbury. This is my opportunity to develop my list as opposed to Rick's. Our Chicago and San Francisco outlets
open – expansion open in August, and the rest of those, kind of expanding of those iconic centers open in the next 12
months.
We also announced plans for further expansions in Sawgrass, The Mills at Jersey Gardens, La Plaza Mall, and the
shops at Riverside. And we expect our redevelopment investment to be at least $1 billion annually through 2017,
substantially funded with our annual free cash flow, which will continue to contribute incremental growth in our NOI
and reinforce the positions of those assets in the respective marketplaces.
Let's turn to new development. Construction, it continues on three new outlets, all in very major markets, and they're
scheduled to open in the next three months. Gloucester, in Southern Jersey, in Philadelphia, in fact opens in two weeks,
August 13. Tampa and Tucson open in October. And finally we open Vancouver on July 9, with traffic that exceeded
expectations. Construction continued or in fact started in Columbus with our partner, Tanger.
And we are slated to begin construction in one new domestic premium outlet, which will be announced before
year-end. We also started construction of The Shops at Clearfork, our new full-priced development in Fort Worth

anchored by Neiman Marcus, which will open in early 2017.
And we were pleased to partner with Swire and the Whitman Family on the retail component of Brickell City Center,
which will open in the fall of 2016. We own 25% of this project and will manage this center upon completion.
Klepierre continues to progress according to plan. Their integration of Corio is proceeding well. They continue to
recycle their assets and in fact announced a deal to sell a portfolio of Netherland assets for €770 million, and which will
continue to de-lever their company. We also purchased 2% of Klepierre from the BNP offering. We're at 20.3%. We
purchased those and the stock is obviously trading higher than where we purchased that additional 2%.
Balance sheet activity continues strong. We did several secured financings in the quarter, continue to lower our
borrowing cost, increased our debt maturity. Our liquidity is $5.5 billion. Our industry-leading balance sheet continues
to get reinforced and separates us from our peer group. Our unencumbered cash flow is well over $2.5 billion, as Andy
shakes his head affirmatively.
And finally, on the balance sheet, we, as you know, announced our $2 billion share repurchase. We, in fact, in the
quarter, bought $505 million during the quarter of both common and units, which is disclosed.
Now the dividend, and let's not lose sight of the dividend. We have announced yet another increase, sequentially of 3%
to $1.55, and a year-over-year increase of 19%. We will pay at least $6 in 2015, which is an increase of at least 17%
from 2014. And well above where we were in the Great Recession at the height of $3.60 in 2008.
So finally, guidance has been increased again, up to $10.02 to $10.07. And we are now ready for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Our first question will be coming from the line of Ross Nussbaum. Your line is open.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Here with Jeremy Metz. Hey, David, with the
repurchase from the OP unit-holders, who were the sellers of those units? Did you approach them? Did they approach
you? How did that work?
<A - David E. Simon>: A little bit of both. It was associated with the Prime transaction, Ross, that we completed in
2010, and they were the sellers.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Okay. So no members of the Simon family sold?
<A - David E. Simon>: That's correct. That's correct.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Okay, and then on the buyback as well, how should we think about it from a balance sheet
perspective? If I look at your funding needs against your after-dividend free cash flow, my math is basically you can
fund your entire development program with, call it, $1 billion of free cash flow a year. So if you continue to buy back
stock at this rate, obviously, the leverage of the company would tick higher. So how should we all think about
continued buyback versus balance sheet?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, that's a very good question. I think the first – we want that in our arsenal. We are
sensitive to – it's part of our capital allocation strategy. I think you should look at this first step as a trade from one,
from our other marketable securities that we had held, with no reason to hold those, we basically took that capital and
reinvested in our business because we wanted to signal the market that we believe in the continual growth of our
enterprise.
I think it should also signal we're out of the big deal business. So, I think, no one's picked that up, but we're – we don't
see any big deals on the horizon for us. So we are obviously very focused on the development, redevelopment. As you
know, I mean, I stumble. I'm not a very good reader of a text. But you look at our activity in the redevelopment and

new development, it's astronomical. It's industry-leading, lots of great stuff going on.
And I think that's the way to look at it. We are price-sensitive. We want it there. REIT stocks have been very volatile.
But I think it's a signal that we took one investment and reinforced that. We're out of the big deal business.
That's not to say we might find a deal here or there. But the balance sheet is sacrosanct to us, we haven't worked 22
years to do it. We survived the last Great Recession with flying colors. We've quadrupled our dividend and earnings per
share, and all the other stuff that I won't go through at all. But I think it's more of a signal in the belief in our business,
and also, a signal to the market that we're out of the big deal business.
Did I stump you? Ross? Operator?

Our next question will be coming from the line of Michael Bilerman. The line is open.
<Q - Michael J. Bilerman>: Hey, David, good morning. Just continuing in terms of the buyback, you talk about your
business and having confidence in your business. You [ph] then talked (13:51) a little bit about sort of discount to NAV
and the arbitrage that exists between public and private. And I take your comment exactly in terms of flipping out of
Macerich, that $450 million, putting it into your own stock, which I think has great prospects. But would you think
about accelerating or selling interest in any assets to go further into your stock and narrow that discount that exists
between public and private?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think the reason – it's more than just NAV. It's what your enterprise can do in
terms of growing the earnings and cash flow, and then ultimately increasing your dividend. I mean as you know, I
mean if you strip out the gain in WPR, our quarter-over-quarter growth was 14.2%, which as you know, a lot of people
have criticized our size, yet we continue to be industry-leading earnings growth.
So, you've got to look at whenever you invest in something, what's that yield going to get you and as our earnings
grows, that's not a bad investment. So it's more than just the NAV analysis. We also – we will continue to sell what I'd
call lower quality, non-important assets to us.
We don't publicize it until after it's done, but we'll continue to prune the portfolio, but we're not a big believer in selling
our comp assets to reinforce the value of our company for external purposes. I mean, we know what we're worth and
we operate. I mean, that's why we're in this job. We're operating accordingly and – but selling the top assets, at the end
of the day, those top assets tend to grow the most. And I'd rather have our shareholders own more of it than less of it.
We have the free cash flow to take advantage of the arb that may exist between private and public values. And it's just
another tool that we have available to us to take advantage as we look for investment opportunities.
<Q - Michael J. Bilerman>: All right Great. And just one quick one for Rick. The popular press wants to focus a lot
on shrinking retailers and closing stores. Can you just give us an update in terms of who are the fastest-growing
retailers, the most exciting retailers that you're seeing pick up stores? And maybe just break it up between a larger
format and a smaller format store base.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, thank you for the opportunity to talk about my list. I think there's four categories of
retailers that we're really seeing a lot of business with. International retailers, the e-tailers that are looking for a
presence in our properties, we recently just announced and have opened Blue Nile and Bauble Bar and we're working
with a number of others that want to come in to the properties.
Our existing retailers that are looking to grow through brand extension, Maybe you just saw Dick's announce the
Chelsea Collective this fall. L Brands is rolling out White Barn Candle. And the last, are just the new retailers that are
coming on line and just to give – we've done deals recently with Mont Blanc, Frye Boots, Jo Malone's, Suitsupply,
[indiscernible] (17:45). All of these are really exciting concepts that are relatively unique in the number of stores and
that's going to separate our properties.

<Q - Michael J. Bilerman>: Great. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. And I would just say this, Michael, I mean what's exciting, yeah, we have had
bankruptcies this year. It does take time to replace them. But the amount of new concepts and new entrepreneurs
coming into our environment, whether it's restaurants, the e-commerce going to physical, brand extensions, it's really at
a – it's at a high, and our leasing folks – if you've seen what we're going to do at Roosevelt Field, with some of the new
food operators, as well as some of the e-commerce with physical. I mean, it's good stuff. So I mean, in that sense, it's
comforting to see that there's a whole host of new entrepreneurs that want to be in our environments.
<Q - Michael J. Bilerman>: Yes. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from Paul Morgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: You talked about how your same-store numbers don't include your redevelopments. I'm just
wondering I mean at this point right now it seems like you have a kind of very large share of some of your top centers
in redevelopment. Is that a drag, having that excluded, I mean given the strength of some...?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, yes, first of all, we don't consider it a drag. You have to put up numbers in a – or you
have put comp numbers in a historical perspective. And you've got a look – you can't look at it one
quarter-over-quarter. You've got to look at it over a three to five-year period of time. And if you look at our comp NOI
increases over that three to five-year period of time, there clearly you would conclude that we have significant
outperformance. And I don't – as much as everyone wants to focus on a quarter here and quarter there, I want to
reinforce we do have the highest operating margins in the business. We also have the lowest overhead in terms of
however you want to do it, enterprise value, EBIT, percent of EBITDA, percent of revenues in the business. And that's
why we have the best balance sheet in the business, and that's why we're able to grow our dividend 15%, 20% a year.
So, again, certainly, there are – yes, we are remerchandising Houston Galleria and Copley and Stanford and Roosevelt
Field and King of Prussia, and we're moving tenants left and right. We encourage everybody to go see the properties.
And, yes, from a quarter perspective it's going to – it's not going to impress some. But I will tell you what we're doing, I
am really impressed with internally. But I would encourage you and others to look at comp NOI over a – more of an
extended period of time than comp quarter-to-quarter.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: So, I mean, if I do that...
<A - David E. Simon>: But again, you know, long story short, yes, we are having some impact on all the
remerchandising going on in our portfolio.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: So I mean if I take that longer view and look back over the past, say, two or three years in
your numbers, I mean is there any reason to think as I look forward two or three years that you wouldn't be able to do
kind of the same type of numbers, I guess deeper into the economic cycle?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, listen, history is a good indicator of what you might be able to do in the future, but we
would hope that all this stuff that we're doing will accelerate the growth profile of those assets. We have to execute.
Believe me, we are not out of the execution phase. But I would think, Paul, at the end of the day that these assets are
going to grow very nicely and will increase our comp NOI growth, and meet our historical growth.

Now the fact is we're subject to economic cycles. We're subject to tenants going bankrupt. We're subject to downtime.
We're subject to sales of our retailers, volatility. So we don't control everything, but we've had a pretty good track
record. I would hope that that would continue but it's not – you don't fall off the log for this stuff. You've got to do it
each and every day, and our team is pretty good at it.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Thanks. And then just my follow-up on the Sears joint venture, how far you into the process
of going through and saying: well, here's what we're going to do near term, here's what we'd like to do longer term and
kind of how – the size of the potential redevelopments and the timing and when we might get some of those details.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Hi. It's Rick. We are very far along in that process. We've already had multiple meetings
with Seritage. We have developed redevelopment plans. Each of the assets, they are in the process right now of being
priced. And as they become mature, we will announce them and proceed forward. But they include the addition of
specialty stores, mall expansions, adding restaurants, adding boxes, and appropriately sizing Sears. Bear in mind, in our
venture it's almost 850,000 square feet of additional space that we are going to be able to redeploy along with those
TBA auto centers. So, it's a great opportunity, and we're well into it.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Great. Thanks.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Sure.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector.
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: I just wanted to focus a little bit more on the redevelopment pipeline. David, I believe you said
that $1 billion through 2017, and I know it's been going on for a number of years now. What are your thoughts I guess
at this point beyond 2017? Is that by 2017 you are really at this point touching those top-producing assets? Or do you
think you can expand that program beyond?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think as Rick mentioned, I mean, I do think Sears gives us a whole host of additional
redevelopment opportunities. We've got – we are closer and closer to starting – in fact, we're actually starting the
southwest corridor in Copley, which is not in those numbers yet. We are, absent something really out of the expected,
we are going to start Copley very, very shortly. We've got failsafes in that investment, but we are moving with speed to
deliver that. We think that's great. Sears presents a lot of opportunities. We've got outlets that – we've done the big
ones. We're doing a bunch of small ones that we need to look at. Rick, do you want to add to it?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I would also tell you, we've already announced the expansion in Jersey Gardens. That's
going to be a major redevelopment. We have announced the expansion at Sawgrass. Right now we're finalizing an
expansion of Colonnade, redeveloping the Oasis. And I can tell you, we are continuing to mine this portfolio. And I
believe, we will have a continuing series of pretty substantial value-add opportunities across all three of our platforms
[ph] in the out years (26:59).
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: Okay, thanks. And then one of the other focuses that Craig and I have been paying attention to,
of course, on the technology front, the winners in the Simon Launch and in particular the SKU IQ. So from where we
sit, I guess, it's just been hard over the last year to really keep track of exactly what's going on here on these different
initiatives. Can you discuss either the winners or SKU IQ in particular and where you think this may go?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. Look, I don't want to – we are – don't get mad at me, Jeff, but I believe – I think we are
close to putting together with Skyler and Michael an investor – I don't know what you call them, an investor not road
show, but investor meeting to kind of lay out all the investment we made. And maybe with not exactly you, maybe with
somebody else but a well-respected peer of yours. And we'll lay it out to the investment community. All of the different
investments we have made and why, so I think we're shooting for some time in October, but there's a lot of neat stuff
here. These are little – in the scheme of things little investments, but they run from creating energy efficiency with all
of our LED lighting to helping retailers to actually new e-commerce ideas that may go to the mall.

So it's a lot of different categories, different levels of investment in the kind of the A,B, C rounds. And we're happy to
share that data. It's a lot, though, to do it on a call like this, but we will be sharing a lot of that stuff with our investors.

Operator
Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Thank you. A quick follow-up first; have you bought any more shares post the quarter end?
<A - David E. Simon>: We operated – if you're familiar, you have to operate under a 10-B 15 rule once your quarter is
completed. We gave guidelines because you can't be in the market during that period of time. And the guidelines that
we gave to the broker were not met, so the answer is we have not purchased any further.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. And the second question, is there any incremental change in trends you're noticing in the
outlet business? Maybe not the premium, at more infill outlets, but maybe more secondary, where maybe the pricing
gap between full-line mall retailers and the outlet businesses or retailers are maybe narrowing? And you've seen like
T.J. Maxx and Ross doing better. Have the secondary type of outlets, do you notice any less importance or less traffic
or any kind of incremental trends?
<A - David E. Simon>: Not really. I mean, I think not really at all. I mean I think our outlet retailers are very focused
on finding the right balance between full price and outlet, that's why they're very focused on not overexposing the
brand. There have been certain retailers that have had disappointing sales, both in full price and in outlet.
Outlet is no different than full price, and that if a retailer is not hitting it, it will affect their sales in full-price and in
outlet, but no, no trend in that at all. I mean, we have outlets in Cincinnati, Columbus, Indiana, St. Louis that are all
doing just fine. They are affected by retailers that may not be doing, as well as they were a year ago. But that's similar
to the full price mall business as well.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Hey. Good morning out there.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Hey. How are you? Just a few questions here, David. First, just going back to the
dividend and stock buyback. Certainly, as you guys outlined where you want to put your money, redevelopment and
development seems to be the first and foremost.
And then, when you move down from there, once you've solved for paying out appropriate with the taxable income, it
sounds like your bias is still towards increasing the dividend versus buybacks. So I just want to see if that's a proper
interpretation from your comments or if you're thinking that any excess cash may now go more towards buybacks
versus the strong dividend growth?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, the dividend – listen, this just sounds weird. But we're highly profitable, right? So as our
earnings increase, our taxable income increases. And therefore, our dividend increases, very simple. That's the REIT
model. We're great believers in the REIT model. That's why we're all here.

And so, our dividend is going to increase. There's just no two ways about it because we have created a very nice
earnings machine as long as we don't make mistakes about where we invest capital, we'll be in good shape. So, I always
like increasing the dividend more than stock buybacks. We had this unusual situation where we basically took one
investment and felt the most immediate and interesting return would be buying our stock back. And I think having the
flexibility to buy it in a volatile market when there is a big disconnect is what we'll be focused on.
But I would continue to expect, knock on wood that our earnings continue to move up, we're going to be focused on
increasing our dividend. And it's underappreciated in the REIT sector. But if you look at our dividend yield compared
to our peer group, and you look at our dividend growth and the expectations of a higher dividend growth, we look like a
cheap stock. So, I mean, do what you want with that, I guess. I don't know.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Well, which – as an analyst we can't do anything with it because we can't own it. But
obviously, it's good to cash dividend checks. Moving over to Europe, you guys announced the JV with HBC in
Germany and involves a lot of High Street retail. In the U.S., you've shied away from doing High Street retail. You
stuck to the malls and outlets. So just sort of curious, do you have a different view with High Street retail in Europe that
you don't share in the U.S. or it's really again just a pure credit play when focusing on retailers and you're not trying to
do something as far as potential to get at High Street retail in Europe?
<A - David E. Simon>: Look, I think, the market in the U.S. with respect to High Street retail is sophisticated,
expensive. There are a lot of guys that have been at it for a long time. We think Europe is a little bit different in that
maybe there is more opportunity for us to do that just like the opportunity that we saw with Klepierre at the [ph] outset
(36:00) a few years ago.
So, that's not to say we're – the HBC thing is a little bit of credit play. It's a little bit of creating a growth vehicle. It's
betting on, I think, an extremely talented CEO and team in HBC, these guys are entrepreneurs. They're smart. They're
sophisticated. They want to grow their business. We're happy and pleased to be their partner. And I think that entity
ultimately will look to create a broader portfolio.
High Street Europe is a little more interesting maybe from a valuation point of view. U.S. is a little more pricey, got a
lot more sophisticated players. But we'll see how it evolves. But it's – we're making, I think, a good bet where we've got
a very strong partner, strong assets, strong credit and between the two of us that have the nose and instinct for good
deals, we should find some opportunities.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay, okay. That's helpful. Listen, thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Our next question comes from Vincent Chao.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just want to go back to the Sears JV and just curious in the
context of investment opportunities, there's a lot of chatter about different retailers doing something with their real
estate. Just curious if you are having more conversations with others on structures like the Sears or the HBC deals that
you have?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, you know, I think there's got to be more than just marking or financing retailers' real
estate. So for instance, I can just contrast – the reason we did Sears is because – partnered with them is because it's all
about redeveloping over time those boxes. Sears store of the future may be part of it, they may not be, but that's
basically a redevelopment play.
HBC, to contrast it was, yes, they got a mark out of the real estate. But to me, we created – if HBC only wanted to just
mark their real estate and do credit, we wouldn't have played. We saw an opportunity to bet on a very accomplished
entrepreneur, great brands and lo and behold, we did the deal and we're – they are buying the German department store,
but we're entering in German real estate in a big way.

If it's just marking real estate or just a credit, that's not really exciting for us. So, we're happy to talk strategically with
our retailers about it. But there's got to be more to it than just that. And so, I think this world will present opportunities,
but there's got to be more than just marking their real estate, whether it's redevelopment or creating a growth vehicle to
go do something, there's got to be more to it than what I just said.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: That makes sense. But I guess I would just – it seems like there would be plenty of
redevelopment opportunities beyond just Sears, although Sears offers plenty of opportunity in itself, I guess. But maybe
just thinking about other areas, I mean can you just comment on the McArthurGlen pipeline? I think there's one project
that you were expecting to start here this year. But how does the rest of the pipeline look like for potential additional
developments there?
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure. There is – in Provence. We are – in fact, we just bought the land [indiscernible] (40:29).
We are starting construction in September after the growing season, believe it or not, is finished. And that's an
all-systems-go deal. We are in the final throes of expand – about to start the expansion in Roermand which is – we'll be
a partner in with other partners in that project. We have a pipeline in Normandy in Spain with – where we're partnering
with [ph] Sonai (41:09). And we've got – we're looking – we're not quite there, but we're looking seriously expanding
Venice. So, I would say it's a very active pipe in terms of new development and obviously to be able to build starting in
September in south of France is very, very exciting, very pleasing.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Okay. Just one last one cleanup question in terms of the guidance. Assuming that does not
include any future buybacks, just what's closed already?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, Tom and I had this philosophical discussion today, we're a pretty large company.
We're going to earn $10 a share this year thereabouts. We have so many ins and outs. We're just not a portfolio. We got
so many things going on. That's our best guess. We put it all in the blender. We give it to you and everything – it's all
subject to change quarter-over-quarter. The good news is we hit our numbers, knock on wood. Hopefully, we'll
continue. We don't isolate one particular thing over another. And we'll see where it shakes out.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

Our next question comes from Carol Kemple.
<Q - Carol L. Kemple>: Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - Carol L. Kemple>: At this point with your other department store tenants are you seeing any of them want to
right-size space like Sears?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Not really. We are constantly in conversations with them and we are doing a number of
other potential things involving relocating department stores. For example, at Stanford, we had a Bloomingdale's that
was oversized. We worked with them. They built a brand new store. And now, we're redeveloping the old
Bloomingdale's into small shops. Did the same thing with Saks at Houston Galleria.
So, it's a very dynamic process. We're constantly in conversation with them and we're doing a lot of things as a result of
that. But there is not another store out there that has the kind of focused, programmatic approach to decreasing their
footprint size.

Our next question comes from Michael Mueller.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Yes, hi. Just going back to Sears again, what's a rough idea of the dollars that could be
invested in those 10 or 11 boxes over time?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I think we're going to do that on a project-by-project basis. But obviously, as we've
articulated, it's a substantial opportunity. And it would certainly be in a larger amount as opposed to a lesser amount.
But it depends on the scope of the individual projects but that is to come.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Got it. Okay. So it sounds like it could be in the couple – in the hundreds of millions of
dollars.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Potentially, yes.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Got it. And then I guess how does it work, if you demolish a Sears box and do a major
expansion well beyond the footprint, do they participate in that? Or is it just to the scope of the footprint?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Each project is differently but in the Sears venture, they own a part of the Seritage. Our
venture owns a parcel of land. So the venture would be focusing its redevelopment efforts on the parcel of land that is
owned in the venture and that'd be the extent of the activity in the venture.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Got it. Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Hi, good morning. Just quick question on occupancy and the impact of bankruptcies from
earlier in the year. I think we were pretty happily surprised to see that your second-quarter occupancy and same-store
NOI were actually somewhat stronger than the first quarter. I was just wondering if you could go through some of the
progress on re-leasing that space and when you expect to have made up for the lost occupancy and NOI.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. I'll just say our goal – we're going to – we still think we will come close to our year-end
occupancy of last year. But it's going to be – it's not a no-brainer. It could slip what I'd say immaterially. But others
may have a different view of that so I respect that. But we're trending up. We're making progress. And I think we've got
momentum. But it takes time. So we're – our goal is still try to get back to last year. But we lost, what, Rick?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: 940,000 feet.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, 940,000 feet. So, that's a lot of work. So, we're a little bit on the treadmill, but we're a fit
athlete and we're running.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: David's speaking for himself.
<A - David E. Simon>: I wish. I wish.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I would just add one thing that we're making very good progress going through it. And it is
an opportunity. It's hard work. It has a short-term impact. But the tenants that we are bringing in are certainly higher
productivity tenants from the sales perspective. And so far, the rents that we've been able to generate are in excess of
the rents that were being paid by the former tenants that went bankrupt.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Got it. And then just also is there anything you could say on the difference you're seeing in
re-leasing the space at, say, your trophy properties versus whatever you would call the next tier, and the next tier of
your properties?

Our next question comes from Linda Tsai.
<Q - Linda Y. Tsai>: Hi. I'm not sure if this is something you could comment on deeply, but when you look at your
redevelopment plans for Sears, do you think you're approaching your plans any differently from GGP or Macerich? Or
is it relatively straightforward in terms of figuring out what a property is missing and splitting boxes and adding
entertainment?
<A - David E. Simon>: Look. I think they're very – they're both very confident developers, redevelopers. So, at the
end of the day, my guess is it's not going to be all that crazily different, but you know it's so much – so much of that is
dependent upon the location and the local market. But they're both confident developers. I would probably venture to
say it will be similar, but if they are better than us, we'd intend to copy immediately, okay?
<Q - Linda Y. Tsai>: And then retail is cyclical and while there's been a recent wave of closures you also noted that
there's also a lot of entrepreneurial concepts popping up. Do you think there's anything different about the cycle time
around as it relates to maybe omni-channel selling or bifurcation amongst brands catering to high-end or low-end
consumers?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I would just say generally, there's obviously the whole movement toward value on
one hand and luxury on the other continues. The general – the good news about that is we're positioned in both of those
barbells extremely well. But that's not to say, people lose sight of that. That's not to say the middle American mall isn't
doing well. It's part of the community. It gets ignored from a media point of view. There's assumptions made about
those assets. There's extrapolation because one mall went out of business that all malls are going out of business.
But I would say to you that the solid middle malls throughout America continue to do well, serve their purpose. But
you clearly see a movement in a lot of retailers from either aspirational higher-end goods or value. There's no question
about that.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: The one comment I would make to you on the new retailers we are dealing with is that
they are substantially more sophisticated than the crop of new retailers we dealt with, say, 10 years ago, better financed,
much more focused on their niche and it's been much easier to deal with this new crop of entrepreneurs than might have
been the case [indiscernible] (51:14).
<A - David E. Simon>: And look, in today's world, we all have to be better. We all have to be on our game better. So
that's just – that comes with, I don't care what industry it's in, I mean, everybody, the rapid changes in the world is
putting pressure on every industry, every operator. And that's why you got to have strong people, strong assets and a
strong balance sheet to deal with it all.

<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Thanks. Just a couple quick questions. Rick, if you look at kind of the sales and leasing trends, is
there anything that you can talk about regionally? Any big differences that you see?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Look, there are a couple of differences across the thing in our business. The Great Lakes,
Southeast and Pacific are stronger, mountain and New England were a little weaker. The better categories were home
furniture, food, personal care, jewelry and athletic shoes.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: I mean, I'd say, Steve, you're clearly – the stronger dollar and the economic upheavals in
growing markets but with wealthy people, Brazil, what's going on with China and their focus on obviously, Europe,
with the stronger dollar. I mean, it has impacted sales in the high tourist centers and we've got them. I mean, there's no
question. We've got them in South Florida. We've got them in Orlando. We don't have New York City. We have
Woodbury, which has been relatively flat and that's usually a center that grows every year. And that's – I think that's
more of all the stuff going on with the center than the tourism. But the tourism centers have had a little softness. You
see it in the hotel industry. So, we're not immune to that.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: I presume that's not having much of an impact on leasing, just given the long-term nature. Or do
you actually think it's impacting leasing at all?
<A - David E. Simon>: I'd say it's had no impact on leasing.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. And then, David, any just update on kind of the Copley kind of residential project?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I mentioned it briefly earlier which is – look, we're doing the southwest corridor. We're
finalizing the permits there, which is more administrative. So, it is all shaping up to – we start to dig down to support
the foundation going up. That's all moving, should start – the southwest corridor should start in the next month. So, we
have certain failsafe, the way the building is being constructed, we have failsafe.
So, for instance, we're going to do the southwest corridor first, which is because we've got to create a new entrance to
create the way to build, we have to go down into the Turnpike. So we have to create the new entrance first. That's
happening. That's been approved by us, then we go down into the Turnpike, then we go up to support the steel going
up. So, we will be making that incremental decision, but once we do the southwest, we'll do that. And then building the
podium is where it's really guts poker. That's a year decision from now, but all systems are go and we are cranking. We
don't see any reason to stop.
So, we – the kind of nice thing about this is that we can stop, look and listen to the market a year from now. And, yeah,
we would have an investment in it, but we'll always be able to go up. I don't see any reason why we wouldn't go up, but
we're certainly going to go down and build our way up to create the platform to build the tower.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay, and then just last question. Anything on Deliv? That kind of system just seems to have kind
of taken a backseat. Haven't heard much about it. Any thoughts about that or how it's working or...?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I would comment on Deliv that Macy's just recently announced that they are expanding the
footprint of stores in which Deliv is going to be working with them. So that is certainly a positive sign, and we continue
to believe that there is a significant role for all of our properties to play in the fulfillment aspect of an omni-channel
retail business. And it's moving apace.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: So, Rick, do you think it's more a function of just consumers not really realizing it exists, to kind
of get more critical mass?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I think it's just a function of getting the systems right, getting the retailers to the point
where they're ready to fulfill from their store. There's a big systems upgrade, it's going on right now across the entire
industry. And ultimately, it is going to be a seamless integrated experience for our consumers. And certainly fulfilling
from the store to their home is going to be part of that, and Deliv can be part of that solution.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from DJ Busch.
<Q - Daniel J. Busch>: Thank you. Just one quick follow-up on Sears. Given the potential size of the capital spend for
some of the Sears projects that you were talking about earlier, if Seritage can't meet its share of the capital
requirements, is there an opportunity for you to put up a disproportionate amount of the capital to potentially grow your
interest in the joint venture?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, that has to be a negotiated – that would have to be a negotiated part of the deal. But it
seems to me they've got the balance sheet to be able to do that. But I'm sure we could figure it out if they didn't.
<Q - Daniel J. Busch>: And – but is it correct to assume you guys are controlling kind of the process and the strategies
at each of the center?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we're joint venture partners. It's both – it's approval on both sides. I'd say we're taking
the lead on coming up with the plans and the redevelopment and the different uses. But they're riding co-pilot with us.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: And I would also say to you that we have significant another number of Sears stores that
are not in our venture that are in Seritage. And when we meet with Seritage, we are actively working with them as we
have done in the past to help them redeploy those spaces in a productive way, and an example of that is King of Prussia
where Dick's now opened and Primemark is opening this fall. And between the two of them they will 100% occupy the
former Sears store.
<Q - Daniel J. Busch>: And just to follow up on that, Rick. With Seritage taking control of the Sears space and the
talks of other department stores potentially monetizing the real estate, do you see any difference in the operations? I
know it's early, but do you see any potential impact to the way you negotiate or lease or deal with the anchors if the
landlord is no longer the retailer?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: No.
<Q - Daniel J. Busch>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. They don't have the infrastructure to get stuff done like we do. So, I don't see the
dynamics changing.

Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Thank you. Just a quick follow-up. I know most of the conversations are always circling around
upgrading quality and reinvesting in your better assets. But given that you do have some of your walls tied into WPG
and the history there, and just because the stock price has gotten cheaper over the past year, is there a certain point
where a lower-quality portfolio might look interesting just because it's so cheap? Or should we just basically consider
this like a permanent divorce?
<A - David E. Simon>: I don't know even how to interpret your question. We spun off WPG well over a year ago.
They're a separate independent company. They are focused on the strip center and the B mall business. You can hear
that directly from them. We do services for them that ultimately will go away mid next year. Their growth
opportunities are better discussed with them. I think our focus, as you have seen over the years is to buy the bigger

have 200 assets. If you rank them all, does it make sense to get rid of 190 through 200? That kind of thing?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we're always doing that. We just do it, we don't do it ahead of that. So, we are – we have
a deal that's closing mid-August. That was a lot of work and we just didn't want to deal with it. We're close on another
deal. So yeah, we do that. Rich, I know, if you looked at our history, we sold a bunch of stuff. So, yeah, we'll always
sell assets, always part...
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay, so are you marketing things actively, or is it just sort of an opportunistic...
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, well.

<A - David E. Simon>: We market. We've marketed – the two that I am referring to were marketed, yes.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Got it. Okay. And then on the lease term income you guys got this quarter, it was kind of
big. I'm curious; I know you can't tell each quarter what's going to happen. But is that sort of something that's going to
pick up here you think in the last two quarters of the year? Are there more discussions you're having on this kind of
thing?
<A - David E. Simon>: There could be a few deals here or there. But if you look at it year-over-year, year-to-date, it's
not all that different than 2014. So, it's lumpy. Sure, it's lumpy. But I don't think it's going to be all that different, Steve,
right, from...
<A - Steven K. Broadwater>: About the same as 2014.
<A - David E. Simon>: Same as 2014. That's a business that's lumpy in terms of corridor to corridor. It's actually
relatively consistent year-over-year.
