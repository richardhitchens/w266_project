MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2013 NYSE Euronext Earnings Conference Call.
My name is Laura and I'll be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at NYSE Euronext. Please go
ahead, sir.
Stephen C. Davidson
Thank you, Laura. Good morning and welcome to the NYSE Euronext's second quarter 2013 earnings conference call.
Before I introduce today's speakers, let me remind you that comments on the call may contain forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. These statements are based on NYSE
Euronext's current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NYSE Euronext's actual results to
differ materially from those in the statements.
These forward-looking statements speak as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the
future. Please refer to our SEC filings for a full discussion of the risk factors that may affect any forward-looking
statements. Except for any obligation to disclose material information under the federal securities laws, NYSE
Euronext undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events
or circumstances after this conference call.
We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures during this call. These non-GAAP measures are fully reconciled in the
tables attached to the text of the earnings press release that we issued earlier today. We believe that these tables provide
investors useful information about our business trends. However, our non-GAAP measures do not replace and are not
superior to GAAP measures.
Duncan Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter, update you on key
developments in our businesses and conclude with an update on the acquisition by ICE. Michael Geltzeiler, Chief
Financial Officer, will then review the financial results for the quarter. For the call today, we will not be holding a
Q&A session at the end of the prepared remarks. We felt that it would be more appropriate given that we are moving
closer to closing with the ICE management team taking the lead in the process and their call is in just a few days. We
are incorporating slides for the call today, which are available for viewing on our website. And Duncan and Mike will
refer to the slides during their remarks.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Duncan.

All right. Thanks, Stephen. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining today's call. I'll begin my prepared
remarks on slide four because, as you all know, in the compliance world we live in, if we're in a transaction like this, it
means two slides of disclaimers, not one. So you have to please turn to slide four.
Let me start by saying how proud we are of our results for the second quarter. As you know, we've made significant
progress in moving our transaction with ICE toward closing. And at the same time, we've continued to execute against
our own business strategy. We're generating strong momentum ahead of the combination with ICE, culminating with
an impressive set of recent achievements.
We seamlessly transitioned our UK-based derivatives market to ICE Clear Europe. We were appointed the
administrator for LIBOR. We welcomed Oracle to the NYSE as the largest company ever to transfer its listing. Our
market share of tech IPOs stands at 64% year-to-date. And we continue to be ranked number one globally in terms of
capital raising. Trading volumes in our European derivatives franchise, while not as high as the levels we saw in the
first quarter, have continued to show strength. And we're pleased by the growing momentum in some of our newer
products.
We are beginning to generate incremental revenue from our new market data initiatives which should continue to build
during the second half of this year. We've continued to reduce our expenses and are on track to beat our full year 2013
guidance of $1.525 billion. And lastly, we retired the remaining $414 million of our June 2013 notes which will drive
$15 million in savings in the remainder of 2013 and $24 million in annual savings next year in 2014.
So for the second quarter, we reported $0.63 per share on $611 million in net revenue. Modest increases in revenue,
both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, with strong expense discipline drove earnings higher by 24%
year-over-year, reflecting a strong operating leverage in our business model.
Turning to slide five, this provides an update of our derivatives franchise. NYSE Liffe volumes in the second quarter
were influenced by increased volatility in global interest rate markets, resulting from speculation about future monetary
policy. While volumes pulled back from the elevated levels we saw in the first quarter, June was a standout month with
ster futures hitting new monthly records for short sterling and Euribor futures. May also saw an all-time record for Gilt
volumes. Year-to-date long Gilt futures contracts are up 24% compared to the same period in 2012. In recognition of
the growing demand for Gilt products, we're looking to launch ultra-long Gilts and we are also gauging the market
potential for index linked Gilts.
Turning to ster options, growth has been especially strong for the longer dated contracts. And for the first time in any
quarter, the majority of our Euribor options volume came from our mid-curve contracts. Regulatory developments and
our own efforts to build and grow the market for swap like futures have helped push Swapnote to new highs as well. In
the second quarter, more than 25 million contracts were traded, an increase of 62% from the same quarter last year.
It was also an excellent quarter for our MSCI franchise, both in Europe and in the U.S. The MSCI complex on NYSE
Liffe U.S. saw positive trends for open interest, which was up 78% year-over-year and achieved record ADV, up 62%
year-over-year. These results reflect our continuing efforts to extend our product set out along the yield curve.
Turning to U.S equity options, the Amex-Arca complex continued to be an industry leader in equity derivatives
volume, which increased by 24% year-over-year. We were the number one exchange group by market share
ex-dividend strategy trades in Q2 and we've remained number one for the last 12 months.
Please turn to slide six. Slide six illustrates the successful clearing migration of our London-based derivatives market.
In December, we announced that Liffe had entered into a clearing services agreement with ICE Clear Europe.
Leveraging existing NYSE Liffe and ICE Clear Europe technology as well as ICE Clear's previous clearing migration
experience, the joint team successfully completed the transition on July 1, as planned.
The transition involved migrating 75 million contract sides held by 43 different members, along with $11.2 billion in
assets from the previous clearing arrangement to ICE Clear Europe. This move reduces our overall cost of clearing
while at the same time retains existing clearing revenues in the newly merged company. Until the new arrangement, we
are delivering a world-class service at a cost that is $30 million lower than what we were paying to LCH annually, so

that will have a favorable impact on second half 2013 expenses as well as expenses going forward in the merged
company.
The partnership with ICE Clear Europe also brings clearing arrangements for NYSE Liffe in line with the changing
regulatory requirements and will give us greater ability to innovate and deliver a first-class service to our customers. I
mentioned a number of new product ideas on the earlier slide; look for more to come in the coming months.
Please turn to slide seven. Slide seven provides you with a snapshot of our cash equities business. As you all know,
over the past few years, our objective with the cash trading businesses has been to focus on profitability and stability. In
the U.S., we've become less dependent on transaction fees, which has helped soften the impact of a decline in trading
volume as well as the dramatic growth in off-exchange trading, which has impacted our market share.
In the second quarter, the Russell rebalance, the MSCI rebalance and the quarterly expiration, all drove large volumes
to the NYSE market. So, despite higher TRF share levels, NYSE market share has been relatively stable and even
slightly up, benefiting from improved latency and functionality changes after the full rollout of UTP, which we
completed earlier this year.
We will also continue to expand the RLP program in our marketplace, reflecting our initiative to drive retail order flow
back to the exchanges. And in Europe, our market share increased to 67% from 65% in the first quarter, which is partly
due to the successful renewal of our SLP program, where we added a passive market share metric to the existing
obligations.
On slide eight, we show you the continued momentum in our listings business. In the second quarter, the NYSE listings
franchise continued to accelerate. Through the first half of the year, we held the number one position in global capital
raising, in IPOs, follow-ons, as well as tech IPOs and transfers. We raised more IPO and follow-on proceeds globally
than the next four global competitors combined.
New issuance in the U.S. markets picked up in the second quarter, as U.S. equity market indices hit all-time highs in
May. The second quarter was one of the most active quarters for IPOs in recent years. We raised $29 billion in total
global proceeds through 72 IPOs and another $105 billion in proceeds on 256 follow-ons.
The deal size also continued to increase. After only one IPO of $1 billion or more in the first quarter, the second quarter
saw four such deals of $1 billion or more. And I'm most proud of our increasing strength in the technology sector.
We're listing two out of every three tech IPOs that come to the market this year compared to less than two out of every
10 several years ago.
This past quarter, we were pleased to announce Oracle's transfer. And we'll be celebrating the new partnership with The
Closing Bell later today. Oracle is the largest company to transfer and one of five NASDAQ-100 companies to transfer
to the NYSE in the last couple of years. We are very proud of this win and we're confident that this momentum will
continue in the quarters and years ahead.
Lastly, from me, before I turn it over to Mike, we wanted to give you an update on where we stand regarding our
combination with ICE and the transaction timeline which we've updated for you on slide nine. The European
Commission's competition authorities unconditionally approved our transaction after their Phase I review was
completed on June 24. Also, in June, both NYX and ICE shareholders overwhelmingly approved the combination.
In July, both ICE and NYSE Liffe U.S. submitted notice to the CFTC and the SEC Rule 19b-4 was published for
comment. Comments were due to the SEC on July 22 and approval from the SEC is expected on or about August 15.
We are also in the process of obtaining the non-objection from the Euronext College of Regulators and local European
regulatory authorities. So that leaves us expected to close the deal sometime this fall.
Since we are asked frequently, I thought I'd share a word on dividend policy. As we mentioned in the press release,
which I'm sure all of you read line by line, we declared our $0.30 dividend, which is payable on September 30,
provided that the ICE transaction has not been completed as of the September 16 record date. ICE will reiterate its
intentions with regard to the envisioned dividend policy of the merged company should the transaction be completed
before mid-September. Our conversations are also ongoing with all stakeholders regarding the IPO of Euronext, which

we expect will follow sometime after the closing of the transaction of ICE.
We'll continue to be transparent about the process and keep you updated on key milestones and developments as they
are achieved. With that, I would now like to pass the call over to Mike for a review of the second quarter's financial
results.
Michael S. Geltzeiler
Thanks, Duncan, and good morning. Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter of 2013. Our
GAAP EPS was $0.71 per share, which compares favorably to the $0.49 per share we reported in Q2 2012. Our
non-GAAP EPS of $0.63 per share reflects three primary adjustments this quarter as reconciled in the schedule attached
to our press release.
In the quarter, we reported a $22 million charge for merger expenses and exit costs, of which $14 million was related to
the ICE transaction. We also recorded $10 million in non-operating income from the sale of a portion of our equity
stake in LCH.Clearnet. Lastly, our GAAP EPS benefited from a favorable tax outcome with certain European tax
authorities. My review of our financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses, exit
costs, disposal activities, and discrete tax items.
Slide 11 provides our non-GAAP financial results for the quarter. Net revenues of $611 million on a reported basis
were up 1% from the second quarter of 2012 and included a $2 million negative impact from foreign currency
fluctuations. Net revenues were also slightly up versus the first quarter of 2013, driven by higher volumes in our global
derivative businesses and increased market data revenue. Reported costs were lower by $14 million or 4% driving an
11% growth in operating income. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was lower this quarter
versus prior year, which helped drive a 24% improvement in EPS.
Slide 12 provides our consolidated and segment results on a currency neutral basis. The U.S. dollar weakened versus
the euro this quarter by 2%, but strengthened versus the British pound by 3%. For the second quarter, 43% of our net
revenue was denominated in either euros or pounds. On a currency neutral basis, second quarter net revenues were up
2% and operating income increased 11% versus prior year. Operationally, revenues from our Derivative business
increased 9%, was stable for our Cash Trading and Listings business and Technology Solutions fell 4%.
Slides 13 and 14 detail the financial performance for our Derivatives segment. Derivative revenue in the second quarter
of $195 million was up 7% year-over-year, attributed to strong trading in European interest rates and U.S. equity
options. The revenue growth on flat costs helped boost Derivative EBITDA margin to 57%. Derivatives accounted for
32% of our consolidated net revenues and 40% of our operating income.
Revenue capture for NYSE Liffe was lower year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, attributed primarily to fee
changes in French single-stock futures and higher volumes. Capture for the U.S. options business was higher
year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter driven by positive mix and strategic pricing changes.
Similarly, slides 15 and 16 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading
and Listings accounted for 49% of our consolidated net revenues and 50% of our operating income in the second
quarter. Cash Trading and Listings net revenue was $302 million in the second quarter of 2013, up 1% versus the
prior-year period and up 5% compared to the first quarter of 2013.
In U.S. cash equities, our market share was slightly up year-over-year, but down quarter-over-quarter. Off-exchange
traded share remains elevated at 35% of the U.S. equities market, up from 32% in the prior year.
Revenue capture for U.S. cash increased to $0.047 per 100 shares handled for Q2, above the $0.043 recorded in the
second quarter of 2012 and the $0.043 recorded in the first quarter. The incremental increase in capture was due to
favorable mix.
Revenue capture for European cash on a per transaction basis increased to $0.56 in Q2 2013 from $0.52 in Q2 2012, a
decrease from $0.62 quarter-over-quarter. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was due to the renewal of the SLP

program culminating in an increase of SLP activity.
Slide 17 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information
Services and Technology Solutions accounted for 19% of our net revenue and 10% of our operating income in the
second quarter of 2013. Segment revenue was $114 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $5 million from Q2
prior year, but an increase of $2 million sequentially. The increase sequentially is attributed to our market data
initiatives, which will continue to build revenue through the rest of this year.
Approximately 84% of our clients are registered for the new Non-Display license agreement. This momentum will be
further reflected in the third quarter. And on annual basis, it's expected to increase proprietary market data revenues by
double-digits. NYSE Technologies also launched a new product, NYSE Best Quote and Trades Feed, which will serve
as an alternative to the CTA data feed and is particularly geared towards retail and wealth management firms. With that
said, the pipeline is looking strong, but the signing of new large managed-service deals has slowed due to the
uncertainties surrounding the proposed ICE transaction.
Slide 18 provides you with the progress we have made with our Project 14 cost efficiency program. Over the past 12
months, we've reported total operating expenses of $1,539 million, which is $127 million below the 2011 base level of
$1,666 million. Adjusting for currency rates and portfolio changes and discrete investments of $52 million, we arrive at
an annualized expense base of $1,505 million in the second quarter of 2013, which is $161 million below our $1,666
million starting point or 64% of the total $250 million to be saved by the end of 2014.
You'll recall that our original commitment for P14 savings was 60% of the $250 million by the end of 2013. We have
already exceeded this target. Based on the positive development of expenses in the first and second quarter and a series
of savings initiatives planned for the second half, including the $15 million we expect to save in the second half of
2013 with our move to ICE Clear Europe, we expect to surpass our full-year 2013 expense guidance of $1,525 million.
Slide 19 details our cash and debt position as of June 30, 2013. Gross debt at June 30 was $2.2 billion. Decline in total
debt was driven by the retirement of the remaining $414 million of our $750 million 4.8% U.S. notes that were due in
June. This will result in a decrease of annualized interest expense of $15 million in 2013 and $24 million in 2014.
Our debt to EBITDA leverage ratio decreased to 1.9 times due to debt retirement and stronger EBITDA generation in
the first half of 2013 compared to the second half of 2012. Capital expenditures were $32 million in the quarter and $59
million year-to-date, well within our guidance of less than $150 million for the full year. Last week, the board declared
a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the second quarter of 2013, which is payable on September 30, provided that the
ICE transaction has not been completed as of the September 16 record date.
Before I pass the call back to Duncan for closing remarks, I wanted to clarify next steps with regards to the shareholder
election process for the combination with ICE. The deadline for shareholder elections is subject to the deal closure date.
At this time, we do not have a set date for the closing. Once a date is set, our transfer agent will be able to accept the
election choices made by shareholders.
Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Duncan for closing remarks.
Duncan L. Niederauer
Thanks, Mike. In closing, our second quarter results were strong and we're continuing to execute against our strategy.
Revenues are up and non-GAAP diluted EPS is 23% higher for the first half of this year compared to last year.
Volumes in our European derivatives franchise remained strong with growing contribution from our new products.
We successfully transitioned our UK derivatives clearing to ICE Clear Europe, which will drive future efficiencies and
product innovation. Our listings franchise continues to build momentum by maintaining the number one global
leadership position and achieving 64% market share of tech IPOs.
And in the last few weeks in addition to Oracle, we've welcomed Perrigo and Exar to the NYSE. We started generating
positive revenue impact from our new market data agreements and our costs are on track to beat our full year 2013 cost

guidance, as Mike just outlined.
While we're executing our business plan and commitments, we are also well on to the integration planning and
regulatory approval process over combination with ICE. And we're pleased to have already secured approval from our
shareholders and the European Commission.
As Steve mentioned earlier, given that we will no longer be a standalone entity in the coming months and ICE will be
holding their call in just a matter of – in a matter of just a few days, we are not going to hold a Q&A session this
morning. We appreciate your time. And I'd like to thank our employees and our shareholders for all their support
during the approval process and during the last several years. Thanks a lot. See you out there.
