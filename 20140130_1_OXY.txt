Stephen I. Chazen
Thank you, Chris. We just finished a successful year, meeting or succeeding many of the goals we set out for ourselves
and are looking to continue our performance into 2014. Let me give you a brief overview of the key 2013 highlights.
We grew our domestic oil production by 11,000 barrels per day over 2012 to 266,000 a day. We exceeded our capital
efficiency goals, reducing our drilling costs by 24% from the 2012 levels, reduced domestic operating costs by 17%.
We added about 470 million barrels of reserve equivalents, achieving an overall replacement ratio of 169%. Our total
costs incurred associated with those reserve adds were about $7.7 billion, resulting in an apparent finding and
development cost of under $17 [per BOE]. We increased our return on capital employed from 10.3% in 2012 to 12.2%
in 2013.
Turning now to some of the specifics of the key accomplishments of last year. As a result of our development program
we improved our capital efficiency by 24% domestically over 2012, which translates to about a $900 million reduction
in capital for the wells drilled in 2013. Of this improvement 50% came from the Permian Basin, 25% from California,
and 25% from the rest of the domestic assets. We accomplished these improvements while successfully completing our
program by drilling approximately what we had planned.
We also reduced our domestic operating costs by 17% or about $470 million compared to 2012. About 48% of this
improvement was in the Permian Basin, 46% was in California, and the remainder was in the other domestic assets.
While we focused on these efficiencies, we also grew our domestic oil production by 11,000 barrels a day.
With respect to reserves we had a very successful year in growing the company's reserve base by adding substantially
more reserves than we produced, over 90% of which was added through our organic development program. We ended
the year based on a preliminary estimate with about 3.5 billion barrels of reserves, which represented an all-time high
for the company.
Our total company reserve replacement ratio from all categories before dispositions was about 169% (sic) [168%]
(4:51), or about 470 million barrels of new reserves, compared to 278 million barrels we produced during the year. In
the United States our reserve replacement ratio was 190%. Replacement ratios of the California properties and the
Permian non-CO2 properties were similar to the overall ratio.
Our reserve replacement ratio for liquids from all categories was 195% for the total company and 228% domestically.
This reflects our emphasis on oil drilling instead of gas. Our total costs incurred related to total reserve additions for the
year on a preliminary basis were about $7.7 billion.
Over the last several years we have built a large portfolio of growth oriented assets in the United States. In 2013 we
spent a larger than normal portion of our investment dollars in development of these assets. Our organic reserve
replacement for the year reflects the positive results of these development efforts. Our 2013 program excluding
acquisitions replaced 168% of our domestic production with about 291 million barrels of reserve adds. In addition we
transferred 115 million barrels of proved undeveloped reserves to the proved developed category domestically as a
result of the program.
Our acquisitions were at a multi-year low of $550 million, providing reserve adds of 32 million barrels.

At the end of the year we estimate that 73% of our total proved reserves were liquids, increasing from 72% in 2012. Of
the total reserves about 70% were proved developed, compared to 73% last year, 2012 that is. The increase in the share
of the proved undeveloped reserves compared to last year was a result of reserves added at the Al Hosn Gas Project.
We expect to move these reserves to proved develop category at the end of this year once the initial production starts in
the fourth quarter.
Through the success of our drilling program and capital efficiency initiative we lowered our finding and development
costs over recent years. As a result we expect our DD&A expense to be around $17.40 a barrel, only a small increase
from the $17.10 in 2013. This is consistent with our expectation the DD&A rate of growth should flatten out as recent
investments come online and finding and development costs come down.
Success of our organic reserve additions and the efficiencies we have achieved in our operation demonstrates the
significant progress we've made in turning the company into a competitive domestic producer.
One of our long-term goals domestically has been to achieve a 50% pre-tax margin after finding and development and
cash operating costs, so as to generate solid returns. We believe we are achieving that now and expect to continue to do
so in the future.
Consistent with what we have said our focus in 2013 was to enhance shareholder value through our results. For this
goal our program was heavily focused on growing our domestic oil production, improving our capital efficiency – that
is improving our finding and development costs – and lowering our operating costs. We met or exceeded these goals,
and result have increased our return on capital to 12.2%, a significant improvement from the 10.3% of last year and a
testament to the hard work and dedication of all of our employees. We expect to see further improvements in our
returns in coming years as a result of recent investments.
Turning to this year our 2014 program is designed to improve upon last year's strong performance. Let me highlight the
key elements of the 2014 program, which I will discuss without reflecting any of the effects of our strategic review
initiatives.
We expect our 2014 program to be about $10.2 billion, compared to the $8.8 billion we spent in 2013. The increase
includes about $400 million of additional capital allocated to each our California and Permian operations largely for
additional drilling to accelerate their development plans and production growth. An additional $100 million will be
spent in these and other domestic assets for facilities projects that were deferred from 2013. The domestic Oil and Gas
capital program will continue to focus on growing oil production and the entire increase in capital will go to oil projects
in California and the Permian Basin.
We also expect to continue to fund growth opportunities in our key international assets, mainly in Oman and Qatar, and
complete the Al Hosn Gas Project. Our capital for 2014 for Oman and Qatar will increase by about $300 million over
last year.
Our exploration capital increased by about $100 million, in part [ph] due to spending that (9:35) was deferred from last
year. Our Midstream capital increased by about $100 million, a result of spending on the BridgeTex pipeline and two
new terminals at Ingleside. Our chemical capital increased also by about $100 million, the Mexican joint venture we
announced last year, while we complete the New Johnsonville chlor-alkali facility.
Our success in improving our capital efficiency and operating cost structure has provided us with the ability to expand
our development opportunities that met our financial return targets. The capital program production growth that I
outlined reflects that the benefit of our streamlined structure and our commitment to continue to fuel growth by
exploiting our large portfolio primarily in California and in the Permian Basin.
With respect to our 2014 production we expect our company wide production volume to grow to between 780,000 and
790,000 barrel equivalents a day, compared to 763,000 in 2013, with a fourth quarter exit rate of over 800,000 barrels a
day, excluding the planned Al Hosn production. This increase will come almost entirely from domestic oil production,
while we expect to see a continued modest drop in our domestic gas volumes.

Our domestic oil production is expected to grow from 266,000 barrels a day in 2013 to between 280,000 and 295,000
barrels a day in 2014, or about a 9% increase. This growth will come fairly evenly from our California and Permian
operations. Internationally excluding Al Hosn, we expect production to grow slightly.
While the elements of the 2014 program that I discussed assumes no changes to the company structure or its mix of
assets, we do expect the company to look significantly different by the end of the year. [ph] Strategic review (11:26) we
are undertaking will result in large changes to the company's asset mix. Our capital program production expectations
and other elements of the 2014 program will be adjusted as the related transactions are concluded.
Finally, some of our longer lead investments we have been making over the last couple years will start contributing to
our results this year. Specifically the Al Hosn Gas Project expect to start its initial production in the fourth quarter and
start contributing to our cash flow. We expect the BridgeTex pipeline to come online around the third quarter and to
start contributing to our Midstream earnings and cash flow. The New Johnsonville chlor-alkali plant is expected to
come on online early this year and will make a positive contribution to the operations for our Chemical business.
With respect to the initiatives outlined in the first phase of the company's strategic review announced last year, we
completed a sale of a portion of the company's investment in the General Partner of Plains All-American Pipeline in
October, resulting in pre-tax proceeds of about $1.4 billion. After this sale, we continue to own about a 25% interest in
the Plains General Partner, which at current market prices would be valued at about $4 billion.
We have made steady progress in our discussions with key partners in the countries where we operate in the MENA
region for the sale of our minority interest in our operations there. Due to the scale and complexities of a potential
transaction, we expect these discussions to continue through the first half of this year.
We have made good progress in the pursuit of a strategic alternative to the select Mid-Con assets. We expect to provide
further information on any transactions as they conclude, some around the end of the second quarter, and will announce
material developments as they occur.
In the fourth quarter, we used the Plains proceeds to retire $625 million of debt, reducing our debt load by about 9%,
and to purchase almost 10 million shares of the company's stock with a cash outlay of $880 million. We ended the year
with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 14%.
At the February's board meeting, we will review the company's dividend policy, status of strategic alternatives, and
share repurchase authority.
Many of the steps we have taken in 2013, including our success improving our efficiency and the actions that our board
has authorized, lay a groundwork for stronger results for this year and beyond. The operational improvements we
expect to achieve in 2014, coupled with the strategic actions we expect to execute this year, should place the company
in a position to improve its returns while continuing to grow and increase its dividends to maximize shareholder value.
Vicki Hollub will now provide a more detailed discussion of our California and Permian operations.
Vicki A. Hollub
Thank you, Steve. This morning I'll review two of our largest domestic operations, our Permian and California
businesses, describing our 2014 plans as well as longer term growth opportunities. In 2013, we implemented an
important transition plan on both of these businesses. And the success we achieved built a solid foundation for
long-term growth.
In 2014, the specific goals of our operations are, continue the development of our large anchor projects in each of our
operating areas, which will enable us to allocate a significant portion of our capital to projects with solid returns, low
execution risk, and long-term growth; further reduce our drilling and completion costs to improve our finding and
development costs and our project economics; continue to optimize operating costs without affecting production to
improve our current earnings and free cash flow; build on our successful exploration efforts in each of our core areas;
evaluate data and test various new concepts in our pilot areas which will set up the anchor projects of the future.

We manage our Permian Basin operations through two business units, the Permian EOR business, which combines
CO2 and water floods, and the Permian Resources business, which is where our growth-oriented and unconventional
opportunities are managed. I will refer to the CO2 and water flood business as Permian EOR, and the other business as
Permian Resources. The Permian Basin designation will be for the combined operations.
In the Permian Basin, we spent over $1.7 billion of capital in 2013, with 64% focused on our Permian Resources assets.
In 2014, we plan to spend just under $2.2 billion overall in the Basin. The entire $450 million increase will be spent on
our Permian Resources assets, representing about 70% of our total capital spend in the Basin.
We expect the Permian EOR business to offset its decline in 2014 and to actually grow 1.4%. The Permian Resources
oil production is expected to grow faster, at a range of 20% to 25%, and its total production by 13% to 16%. On a
combined basis for the Permian Basin, these should translate to oil production growth of over 6% in 2014 and total
overall production growth of over 5%, while generating $1.8 billion of cash flow after capital.
2013 was a pivotal year for our Permian Basin operations. First, we improved our capital efficiency by 25% and
reduced our operating expenses by $3.22 a barrel, or 17%.
We also began transitioning to a horizontal drilling program. We drilled 49 horizontal wells, with 47 completed and
producing. The combination of improvements in well costs, our own results, and those of neighboring operators has
given us the opportunity to dramatically shift our program to more horizontal drilling in 2014. Our Permian Resources
team will average running about 21 rigs, of which 17 will be drilling horizontal wells. We plan to drill approximately
345 total wells, or about 50% of which will be horizontal. This compares to 330 (sic) [335] (17:23) total wells drilled in
2013, where only 15% were horizontal.
We have two main goals for our Permian Resources business in 2014. First, we intend to continue the evaluation of the
potential across our full acreage position. And second, we plan to pilot various development strategies, including
optimal lateral length, frac design, and well spacing, both laterally and vertically. We believe this will position us for
accelerated development as we exit 2014 and go into 2015.
We believe we have one of the most promising and underexploited unconventional portfolios in the Basin. In 2013, we
added 200,000 net prospective acres to our unconventional portfolios and now have about 1.9 million prospective
acres. This is a prime position in the Permian Basin.
Our acreage in the Midland Basin, Texas Delaware Basin, and New Mexico give us exposure to all unconventional
plays, which is unique. This will give us flexibility to develop our most attractive opportunities first and to mitigate
risk.
Based on the work we've done to date we've identified approximately 4,500 drilling locations across our portfolio,
representing 1.2 billion net barrels of resource potential. We believe we've made conservative assumptions regarding
prospective acres, well spacing, and expected ultimate recoveries, and expect these numbers will grow as we learn
more.
We see the largest near term growth in the Midland Basin, which represents about two-thirds of our currently assessed
resource potential. However our Delaware Basin prospective acreage is significantly larger and potentially there should
be room to grow.
We believe our measured approach to our unconventional portfolio has worked to our advantage. Our Permian
Resources production comes from about 9,500 gross wells, of which 54% are operated by other producers. On a net
basis we have approximately 4,400 wells, of which 15% are non-operated. This has given us the opportunity to observe
the results achieved by other operators in the Basin, learn from those results, and optimize our approach to maximize
the opportunities on our acreage.
The success of our capital and operating cost efficiency efforts in 2013 has enabled us to significantly improve our cost
structure, which has increased our opportunity set. For example a typical well in the Collie area that had an IRR of 24%
before our capital and operating cost reductions now yields IRR of 48%, using the same product prices. We achieved

similar success in all of our most active areas across the business unit.
Finally, we have established a multi-step methodical process for our unconventional acreage in the Permian Resources
business that includes, step one, exploration to establish the presence of a commercial resource. Step two, testing and
data gathering to optimize well and completion design. Step three, pilot programs to assess variability of well
performance to design full field development plans. And step four, transition to manufacturing mode for full field
development. This process is helping us prudently develop our acreage, maximizing cash flow and returns. As a result
we are now prepared to accelerate our activities in the Permian Resources business, where we believe the opportunity
in front of us is one of the biggest in the basin.
Now I'll review our program in more detail beginning with the Midland Basin. We've been most active with our
horizontal activity to date in the Midland Basin, where we've drilled 16 wells. In 2014 we plan to spend $790 million to
drill 147 (sic) [174] (20:53) wells, including 74 horizontals. We expect to average eight rigs in the area during this year.
Now our largest opportunity here is in the Wolfcamp Shale, where we've tested Wolfcamp A and B benches and plan to
target our activity to test the remaining benches. One of our most successful pilot projects in this Basin is South Curtis
Ranch, which has now gone into full field development mode. This is a property that we acquired in 2010. We've
drilled 63 vertical and 6 horizontal wells to date and plan to drill over 200 additional wells on this acreage. Results thus
far have been as expected with initial 30 day production rates for the horizontal wells averaging approximately 800
BOE per day.
In the Midland Basin we also believe there is substantial potential in Cline, which is currently under evaluation. We've
drilled 6 horizontal Cline wells so far and plan to drill another 5 to 10 in 2014. Preliminary results indicate we may
have the opportunity to drill up to 450 Cline wells in the Basin.
Another pilot project is horizontal drilling in the Spraberry, where we plan to drill our first horizontal well the first
quarter, and we'll evaluate next steps with the results. In addition to the horizontal activity we also plan to continue our
legacy vertical Wolfberry development.
In the Texas Delaware Basin, we plan to spend approximately $370 million in 2014 to drill 91 wells, including 48
horizontals. We expect to average five rigs during the year. And our horizontal activity will be focused in the
Wolfcamp, where we believe the A, B and C benches will prove to be the most prospective. We drilled or participated
in 3 horizontal Wolfcamp wells in 2013, and we'll increase that to 45 in 2014. Our activity is centered in Reeves
County, where we historically have drilled vertical Wolfbone wells.
Early horizontal results are proving to have better economics, but there are some plays where vertical development is
still more efficient. In our Collie area we plan to drill 43 vertical wells targeting the Bell and Cherry Canyon
formations. This represents the continuation of the one rig program we executed in 2013.
In New Mexico we plan to spend approximately $370 million to drill 97 wells, including 50 horizontals. We expect to
average four rigs during the year.
The Bone Spring formation in New Mexico is the second largest opportunity in our portfolio, behind the Wolfcamp
Shale. In 2013 we drilled 16 horizontal wells, testing the first, second and third Bone Spring sand intervals. Our results
were very encouraging, and we expect to increase the program to drill 30 horizontal Bone Spring sand wells in 2014.
Of the $2.2 billion to be spent in the Permian Basin in 2014, $660 million will be allocated to our Permian EOR
business. As I previously mentioned this business unit is a combination of CO2 and water floods. It is symbiotic to
manage these assets together as they have similar development characteristics and ongoing monitoring and
maintenance requirements. The last couple of years we have actually spent more capital on water floods as we mature
the next CO2 developments. In 2014 25% of the $660 million will be spent on current water flood development and the
remainder on CO2 floods.
Further we have 1.4 billion net barrels of oil equivalent and reserves and potential resources remaining to be developed
in the Permian EOR business. We believe we are the efficiency leader in the Basin in applying CO2 flood technology
to develop this potential.

Now we have the ability to accelerate growth in our EOR projects as more CO2 becomes available. As a result of our
efficiency advantage many projects that don't work for others work for us.
Over the last several years the focus of our Permian exploration program has been to identify unconventional
opportunities, which are then transitioned to full field development through the process I explained earlier. Our
approach has been very successful, giving us a large opportunity set that we are now working to fully develop. We
continue to see the addition of new plays in the Basin and see years of exploration drilling opportunities ahead in our 2
million prospective acre position.
Now that I've gone through some of the specifics of the program for the Permian Basin, I will explain our overall
business strategy. We are approaching our development program with a multi-pronged strategy that first, maximizes
the field resource potential; second, controls costs to optimize returns; third, gives us a strategic advantage to improve
our realizations.
We are using targeted horizontal and vertical drilling as appropriate, optimizing development and completion plans
from lateral link to frac efficiency as well as lift strategies to maximize recovery. We're making heavier infrastructure
investments like power, water handling, and gas processing to pre-plan for life of field success. These strategies
coupled with our successful exploration program accomplish the first of our objectives.
And we will continue to manage costs and take advantage of our progress along the learning curve with leading
technologies and execution efficiencies to accomplish our second objective.
And we are also investing in additional takeaway capacity, including the completion of the BridgeTex pipeline and
build out of our gathering systems, which will give our crude a strategic advantage to reach either the Houston Ship
Channel or Corpus Christi markets.
Finally, I would like to comment on our plans for the Permian Basin over the next several years. With the combined
businesses we have more than 2.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserves and potential resources. Within each
business we have the flexibility to shift capital among projects within that business, as well as the flexibility to shift
capital between the two businesses as needed. Our large and diverse portfolio creates opportunities for a variety of
growth options.
In the Permian Resources business at our current pace we believe we have over 15 years of development and growth
opportunities. Given that the Permian EOR business is generating significant cash flow, and we expect our opportunity
set to continue to grow, we plan to double our rigs over the next three years to accelerate the development of the
Permian Resources unit's growth opportunities. We expect this to result in the doubling of our Resources unit's
production from approximately 64,000 BOE per day in 2013 to more than 120,000 in 2016.
In Permian EOR while it is large with a somewhat slower growth curve, we have significant opportunities going
forward with continued positive cash flow to fuel the growth of the Resources unit. Combined with EOR growth
opportunities we expect our overall Permian Basin production to grow by roughly 10% compounded annually growth
rate through 2016.
Now we'll shift to California. In 2013 we spent $1.5 billion of capital. Our main goals were to deliver a predictable
outcome, advance low risk projects that contribute to long-term growth, reduce the cost structure, lower our base
decline, create a more balanced portfolio, and test exploration and development concepts. We achieved every one of
these objectives.
We produced 154,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow after capital, we
progressed the development of our steam floods and Kern Front and Lost Hills and started the redevelopment of our
Huntington Beach Field. We improved our capital efficiency by 20% versus 2012 and also reduced operating costs by
$4.70 per BOE or 20%.
Overall in 2014 we intend to continue the capital strategy shift initiated last year, which was to focus the majority of
our capital on low decline projects. Our goals for this year are to accelerate the rate of production growth and maintain

our lower cost structure. We will also continue to advance several low-risk, high return, long-term growth projects and
capitalize on our exploration successes.
In 2014 we plan to spend $1.9 billion of capital, of which 40% will be spent on water floods, 20% on steam floods, and
40% on unconventional and other developing plays. We expect to average about 27 rigs in California in 2014,
compared to an average of 20 rigs in 2013. We plan to drill around 1,050 wells in 2014, compared to 770 in 2013. We
expect this program to deliver around 11% oil production growth or over 4% total production growth, while generating
$1 billion of free cash flow after capital at current prices.
We believe the rate of growth will further accelerate in 2015 and beyond as a number of the steam and water flood
projects reach full production, and the base decline is lowered due to relatively less natural gas development, higher
investment in lower decline oil projects, and a larger share of higher growth lower decline projects in the asset mix.
Let me now share some of the highlights of the program for this year, beginning with the water floods. In the LA Basin,
we plan to spend $500 million in the Wilmington and Huntington Beach Fields.
Our Wilmington Field development in 2013 exceeded expectations. We drilled 135 wells, and we'll increase that by 7%
to 145 wells in 2014. Our horizontal program was particularly strong, and horizontal wells will represent an even
greater percentage of wells in 2014.
In our Huntington Beach redevelopment we successfully brought online our two new fit-for-purpose drilling rigs and
drilled and completed our first two wells in the project. In 2014 we plan to drill 30 wells, and we'll ultimately drill at
least 128 wells.
Our Heavy Oil business unit was the key focus area in 2013 and will be again in 2014. We plan to spend $350 million
to drill about 420 wells, compared to 324 wells in 2013. We'll also continue the multi-year development of Kern Front
and Lost Hills steam floods, and we'll pilot some new projects.
I would also like to highlight that the business achieved record production in the fourth quarter, producing 19,000 BOE
per day, which is an increase of 4,000 barrels per day from the first quarter of 2013.
At Elk Hills our key objective is to lower the high decline rate. And we have made significant progress toward this
goal. In 2014 we plan to spend $600 million in capital to drill 325 wells, which is an increase of $170 million over
2013. About 55% of Elk Hills' capital will be targeting our shale reservoirs, where our capital efficiency efforts in 2013
had a significant impact. We experienced an average of 23% decline in well costs for these programs and 21% decline
in operating costs, which dramatically improved the economics and increased the opportunity set. For example a typical
well that generated 30% IRR prior to our efficiency initiatives now delivers 50% IRR, using the same product prices.
In 2014 we will drill around 130 shale wells at Elk Hills, an increase from 80 in 2013. The remaining Elk Hills capital
will target continued development in the shallow oil zone and Stevens sand.
Our California exploration program has delivered solid results for over five years. The 2014 California program will
continue to explore both unconventional and conventional targets. The unconventional program targets several
prospects similar to the 2013 discovery. The conventional program will target prospects in and around our existing
production in both the San Joaquin Valley and Ventura County. Our extensive proprietary 3D seismic surveys are
yielding an exciting inventory of leads and prospects which will provide years of drilling opportunities.
Lastly, I would like to give you some perspectives on our development plans over the next several years in California.
We expect to continue the capital strategy we initiated in 2013, the shift to lower decline and lower risk steam and
water flood projects. We believe we can grow our California production from 154,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day
currently to 190,000 in 2016, or roughly a 7.5% compounded annual growth rate. Our steam and water flood projects
will contribute 80% of that growth. In fact, 90% will come from projects that are already online. We think this
positions California as one of the lowest risk growth profiles in the industry.
Further, we are a targeting primarily oil drilling, which will make our portfolio more oily, contributing to solid margin
expansion going forward. We expect to grow our oil volumes by roughly a 15% compounded annual growth rate

through 2016.
Over the long-term, we expect our California growth prospects to benefit from changes in our asset mix. Elk Hills and
THUMS, while having the potential for years of continued production, have lower growth prospects due to the mature
state of both of these fields.
On the other hand, our water and steam floods, as well as our unconventional opportunities, should continue to give us
double digit growth for years to come. The share of our production from Elk Hills and THUMS has shrunk from 64%
in 2009 to 44% in 2013. This shift will continue going forward, and the largest share of higher growth projects will
further accelerate the growth rate in coming years.
As in the Permian Basin, we are continuing to test new ideas and to further improve our drilling completion and
development efficiency in all of our projects. We're also working diligently to comply with the new regulatory
requirements created as a result of the passage of Senate Bill 4 in California. We have a dedicated team addressing the
associated issues, and currently we don't expect significant delays in our development plans.
As can you see, while the Permian Basin and California stories are different, they are both very exciting. The hard work
and dedication of our people have put both of these assets in a position for continued success. And 2014 is the year that
both of these businesses will begin to accelerate their growth, as we have completed the transition to a focused,
growth-oriented development program, and we're set for long-term growth. I will now turn the call back to Chris
Stavros.

Thanks, Vicki. Emily, can you please open the line for questions? We're ready to take questions. Thanks.

Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from
Doug Terreson of ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good morning everybody. Steve, Oxy's returns on capital rose last year by almost 20%,
which I think was the objective, or the hope anyway. But your capital spending looks like it's going to rise by another
16% or so this year. And so my question is, how does management prevent capital misallocation and then retrenchment
from occurring again, as it did a couple of years ago? Meaning, have there been changes to the capital allocation
process or in other areas of corporate planning that might enhance the result in the current scenario?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah, sure. I think you – first remember that this number is for an unchanged business.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Right.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: And that's really not going to happen. So the actual spending will be some other number, a
lower number, because some of the businesses won't be here by year-end.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Right.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We've changed the process. I think Vicki's pointed out the change in the domestic business,
and how we're focusing on returns a lot better. And we're not – I think it's basically a lower risk portfolio, and we'll
generate more certain returns.
We expect the returns – we're not actually excited about the 12% return on capital employed. I think we need to be
closer to – in excess of 15%. And so our goal is to make sure that's right. It's with very great caution on my part that
I've allowed the additional spending in Permian and California. They've had to convince me that they're going to stay

on the straight and narrow here.
So I'm pretty sure we're under control. But if it turns out, because we can watch this monthly, because that's what we do
now, we watch it monthly. If it turns out that they get off the wagon, the beer will be turned off.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Steve, one more question. You guys also were...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Or the fine wine, whatever they're drinking.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: One of the two. So you guys were obviously very successful with your cost program. That
helped the result last year. And so, are we mostly complete? Is there more work to do there on the cost program?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: For sure. While I'm – I think we exceeded our goals.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Right.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We'll set new goals. I think my main focus, just so we're real clear, the long-term business
depends on low F&D. Operating costs are fun, because they affect the current year. But we have to develop a long-term
low F&D rate.
Go back to what we said forever. If we add the F&D and the operating costs and the local taxes, we need to be below
50% of the selling price of the product. And if you're going to do that, you'll have pre-tax margins of 50%, and you'll
generate good returns. And that's really the objective.
And so we need to continue to drive, as the reservoirs become more challenging, our costs need to be watched very
carefully. I think we've used this year, 2013 that is, to really hone our ability to control costs. And I think we're there.
We've gone through a multi-year transition of the company, from a very good international producer and an okay
domestic one, to a much stronger domestic business. And this has been not an easy or a quick transition.
But I think at this point we have the people in place to accomplish those goals going forward. We're giving them more
money this year, but I hold myself and them responsible. Unlike football teams, the coach gets fired, not the assistant
coaches, in this.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Well if you guys can make 15% returns on capital that would be fantastic. Thanks a lot.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think we'll be there.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Great thanks.

Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, Steve, and welcome to Houston I guess.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Morning.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: I have a couple also if I may. California is I guess been judged to some extent as not being able
to execute because of a lack of visibility. So you've laid out some targets this morning obviously that suggest a step up
in activity. But what comfort can you give that you have got the permitting, you have the rig count? And I'm just
curious as to where your head is in terms of whether or not separating California is still a viable option and one that you
think would benefit the balance of the portfolio? And I've got a follow up please.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah. I'll answer the last question first, and then we'll let Vicki, the assistant coach here, get
ready to answer how certain she is.
California and the Permian and the rest of the company are quite in some ways different businesses. California can
benefit a lot I think by higher capital spending. And it will generate more growth. We established a base with the – we

might call it boring if you want, steam flood and those kind of projects so they'll have enough cash flow to go ahead.
I think it could be managed differently than we would. And I think it has good prospects. I think the issue that we need
to have a team together that is more aggressive growers, maybe less concerned about dividends, and look more like a
small E&P.
No one will ever – since there's three producers are 85% of the production in California. That isn't going to change.
And so there's never going to be a comp. And to get people to believe and for the management of that business to
deliver, it's probable that they should be separate.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. And then execution...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Is that clear enough?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Yeah that's clear enough. Thanks.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Vicki will answer the rest.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: With respect to our efficiencies I feel like in California certainly we have a lot of potential, as
we outlined in detail in the earnings call a couple of times ago. So we have the resources available.
We have now put together a team out there that's structured in a way that gives them the best opportunity for success.
We have great people. We have very experienced people who know a lot about operating in California, who know a lot
about the types of projects that we're developing. That's our core business. We know water floods, we know steam
floods, and that's the bulk of what we're doing.
So our team understands quite clearly how to do that. And they're among the best in the industry. And so we're
accomplishing what we've said we would do.
And what we're doing going forward with this increase in capital is we're being very disciplined about how we evaluate
and design our projects and implement our projects. So I'm quite certain that we're not going to lose our efficiency
around execution. And with the resources that we have I feel confident that we're going to continue to see the same
results that we achieved in 2013 going forward.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Steve, I guess my follow-up given that you've been fairly clear about how this could
play out. California has not been spending its cash flow up until now. So as a stand-alone company would there be an
intangible drilling cost up worth to the operating cash flow in your estimates? And I guess if I could layer on a third
very quickly. [ph] What are your (43:52) thoughts on the scale of a potential Dutch tender buyback, if that's still in your
thinking? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Obviously California would spend more money and drill more wells. And I'm sure they'll
generate a lot of tax shelter, if that's the question.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Yeah if you could.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah a separate business who competes – a separate oil company that competes with other
medium-size or whatever you want to call them producers obviously is a business that would generate. You basically
use its cash flow.
California has the flexibility however that if you cut back its capital and use money to repurchase shares or something
like that, if the right sort of environment came on. I mean it's unlike some other things, it's a pretty complete business
that has a fair amount of gas opportunity when that's available. It has relatively safe long-term oil, and it has some
exciting oil things to do too.
So I think it's a fairly complete business. And it's a business where if things get bad for regulatory reasons or price or
whatever, it can cut its capital back, still do well. Doesn't get caught on a treadmill of higher decline. It could even buy
back shares. I don't think it ever is going to be a big dividend producer, but I think on share repurchase it could do that
if conditions warrant. But if conditions don't warrant, I'm sure they'll spend all their money.

The process of repurchasing the shares from whatever we do just depends on the situation at the time. When we have
the money, we'll figure out – when we have the money in hand, we'll figure out exactly what the process will be.
But I point out that we repurchased around 10 million shares in the fourth quarter. We wouldn't have done that with the
shareholders' money if we thought that all this wasn't going to happen.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: [indiscernible] (46:07)
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: So I think the process of doing it remains to be seen, because you might have it at one stock
price, you might do one thing, And at another, you might do something else.
There's no other place to put it. I mean it's either some kind of share repurchase or – and there isn't really any debt that
we can do much with. So I think we've taken down the debt. I think the next maturity is in 2016. And I'm not up for
some kind of windfall for bondholders,.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: All right. I'll let someone else jump on. Thanks, Steve.

Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: Yeah. I mean I guess I got a bigger picture question just on Permian and then some
follow-ups on California after those good questions from Doug. Just on your Permian I mean how do you think you're
going to get a fair price for the light oil that you're producing in Permian? What is Oxy going to do about it over and
above what you've already announced with the BridgeTex pipeline expansion. Thanks.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We're going to let Willie answer that since he's a expert in oil.
<A - Willie C. W. Chiang>: Yeah Ed. Obviously we've seen a lot of disruptions in pricing between the regions. And
we're seeing a lot of infrastructure getting built in. And when we look at our production of roughly 50 million barrels a
year or 150,000 barrels a day out of the Permian. Between the BridgeTex pipeline, which goes from essentially
Midland or Permian directly to the Gulf Coast, as well as taking capacity on other pipelines down to Corpus, we
essentially go from a two market business, Midland and Cushing to ultimately getting to Houston Ship Channel as well
as Corpus. And we also get the ability to go to U.S. East Coast and lots of different places. So I think the infrastructure
is going to help us tremendously in that area.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: As a follow on I guess people are concerned that when the crude gets down to the Gulf, it's
still going to be impaired. Any thoughts around that? Or work you've done on that?
<A - Willie C. W. Chiang>: Well the thing everyone looks at is the Brent TI. And as I think about it, Brent's really tied
to world prices. And I think what you're going to see is all the grades as well as TI kind of come to transportation
parity.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: Okay. So no major discount in your thoughts for the crudes once it gets down to Gulf other
than quality and logistics?
<A - Willie C. W. Chiang>: No I think price has fixed the price issues.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: Okay so just coming back to...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I'll also point out that...

<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah that $97 oil is probably okay for us. I mean this isn't some bargain-basement price. So
we feel pretty comfortable that we could be reasonably profitable at $97 and much lower. So sometimes you lose sight
of the absolute price in all this talk about differentials.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: Yeah it's a good point. Just on California then, I mean you gave us sort of some initial
resource estimates for the Permian. Would you be willing to give us a resource estimate to California? People
obviously trying to have confidence, and a resource number from yourselves would obviously help that confidence.

Our next question is from Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Arjun N. Murti>: Thank you. Just another follow up on California where you have a nice growth trajectory here.
It sounds like the greater confidence in it is a bit of the mix here, where some of the stuff that has declined is now
smaller. And you're shifting more to water and steam floods, which you've historically been very good at. And maybe
less reliance on the unconventionals at least in the scope of the years presented here. Is that accurate? And I guess if so,
where are you on the unconventionals from a confidence standpoint? Thank you.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I'll let Vicki answer about the unconventional, but just so you understand, I think you've got
it. But we have the high decline and really no decline. High decline at Elk Hills and really no decline at THUMS,
which was the bulk of the production of the company. It originally was nearly 100%.
And so what has happened is that the little wedge has grown and we've made a lot of progress in improving the decline
rate in Elk Hills. So we're not fighting as big a decline curve.
<Q - Arjun N. Murti>: Yeah.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: And so what we're doing is we're filling it in with things that are real certain, so that the
business has sufficient cash without being on a treadmill to go forward.
And I'll let Vicki talk about the unconventional here, since she's more knowledgeable than I am for sure.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: This year we're drilling 170 unconventional shale wells versus 111 that we drilled last year. So
we increased the number that we're drilling this year. And actually we had hoped to drill even more than we currently
have on the schedule.
But we felt like that from a regulatory standpoint, it was best to take a more conservative approach this year in view of
SB 4. We do have some exciting unconventional projects that are in the permitting process. And we expect to bring
those online in 2015.
So basically part of it's a permitting, just trying to get the permits in line and ready to go. The other part of it is that we
are continuing with the strategy that we developed and that is to as we've said lower our decline and build up a larger
solid base of those types of projects. And that really helps prop us up for the unconventional developments.
<Q - Arjun N. Murti>: Is it a question, Vicki, of the scope of you what have there? You want to ensure you have
enough running room between confidence in the resource and the ability to get permits? Or are there still questions on
all those points?
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Yeah, there are questions on all of them.
<Q - Arjun N. Murti>: Yeah.

<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: We do have, as I said, unconventional plays that we feel very comfortable with the
development of, because there are things that we understand, that we've already started the process of development. So
there's a portfolio that we feel like we could move forward at a fairly fast pace if we had the permitting in place.
There are still some shales that we haven't really tested and evaluated yet. And we're taking the same approach in
California as we are in the Permian, where we're doing a more measured approach to go out, drill a few wells, do some
evaluation, then start some pilot projects, and then from there, progress to full field development. So we're trying to be
very prudent in the way that we approach our shale plays that are outside where we're currently drilling.
<Q - Arjun N. Murti>: Great. Steve, maybe just a follow-up on the MENA comments. I certainly appreciate the scale
and complexity here, and that it's going to take some time. Can you comment that you have identified maybe a partner
group, which is a key group you're negotiating with, and these things can still take time? Or is it earlier stage than that,
where there are still multiple parties that are involved here?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: No, there's a partner group.
<Q - Arjun N. Murti>: That's great. And then just a final one on the stock buyback. Should we think about this
primarily as asset sale proceeds are used for stock buyback? Or your balance sheet is strong that it can be an ongoing
program, even without proceeds?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: The business fundamentally, the overall business or whatever remains in the company, is
able to generate free cash. And so we should see, as I think I said at your conference, part of the program would be,
we'll continue to grow the dividends at a healthy pace, but we'll have a little more share repurchase than we've done
historically.
You will see share reductions from whatever happens in the asset sales or whatever dividends we might take from
anything that was separated from the company. So I think you'll see the share count come down. And therefore the
dividend requirement, the dollar amount of the dividend requirement, come down. So I think you'll see a mix.
But I'm very focused on the value of the stock we're buying. It isn't just about buying shares for fun. Certainly easier
than drilling wells. But I think that – and so you'll see us come and go as the stock price changes. And of course, there
are periods when we can't buy, where we have material information. So there may be periods when we can't buy. But
generally, you should expect to see a regular program at some level, but also some fairly sizable reductions over the
next year, I would expect.
<Q - Arjun N. Murti>: That's great. Thank you so much.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thanks.

Our next question is from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Thank you. Good morning. Steve, I was wondering if you could clarify some of the comments
you had around return on capital employed. So are you saying that – and you guys have made a tremendous effort in
getting return on capital employed up over the last 12 to 24 months.
But I want to make sure I understand. So are you saying that, with CapEx going up next year and with sort of the
doubling of the rig count in the Permian over the next few years and adding seven rigs on California, overall you're
saying ROCE should trend up over the next one to two years, all else being equal?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Product prices aside, yes.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, okay. Fair enough. And then, in terms of your comments on California, given that most
of your growth in California longer lived production and some of your growth in the Permian has a higher decline rate,
doesn't it make more sense to kind of keep those assets together as a portfolio? I'm just trying to understand like how

you balance the cash flow and decline rate between the two portfolios over time?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Remember that the Permian is effectively two businesses. There's the EOR business, which
generates large amounts of free cash flow. So the question really is, how do you – and it has the potential to add this
high growth stuff, but still generate large amounts of free cash flow as a business. We can manage that reasonably well.
California, the potential is, it currently is managed to generate free cash flow. And it will generate a base, ultimately, of
these long lived projects, which basically, by the way, answers, to some extent, your question about the returns.
Because if you turn on a long lived project, your DD&A rate will be relatively low. And so your earnings will be better,
because you got a lot of reserves over a long period.
And so every business, a stand-alone business, has to have a base of money to pay for itself. Now I understand there's a
whole bunch of companies out there that don't. But that's not the way to build a long-term oil business.
So California can spend more, fairly I think easily, and continue to grow. And in the Permian, there's a lot of
competition for rigs and people and stuff. And so I think it's a little more challenging in the Permian. And I think
California – I have a map in my office from 1679 which shows California as an island, and there's some truth to that.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Fair enough. And then, do you guys have an estimate for the return on capital employed
for California at the end of the year?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I don't think so. I think we'll leave those kinds of questions for some other announcement.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.

Okay. And our final question will come from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Yeah thanks. Good morning. I guess maybe taking a little stronger or deeper view of the
Permian, you mentioned in the preview part the cost and the learning curve issues. Have you done anything in
particular to hire people out there? Or has it been learning by watching, learning by sharing info and data with some of
your partners out there?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think Vicki, so as not to frustrate her, went through a long – we've got a lot of gross wells
that the bulk of our production and outcome comes from our own net wells. So we see enormous exposure to what
other people are doing.
We don't actually have to experiment or hire other people. We can actually see what they're doing. We hire people all
the time, but we're not hiring people from radically different cultures. We need people who are trained in a
return-driven, free cash flow kind of culture. And to hire somebody from some small company, they really have a
different kind of culture. They're more an IRR, getting their money back quick, and drilling more wells culture.
So we don't want to destroy the notion that this is a business about generating money and generating returns. And we're
not going to spoil, at least while I'm here we're not going to spoil the stew with a bunch of promoters.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay and then I guess as a follow up even to those comments, if I remember correctly we are in
a new CEO search mode here. Is there any update you can provide on that front?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think the Board will have something to say about that next month. But I expect to be doing
significantly more earnings calls than I had planned.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay that's helpful. Thank you.
