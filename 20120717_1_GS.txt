Our Chief Financial Officer, David Viniar, will now review the firm's results. David?
David A. Viniar
Thanks, Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give an overview of our second quarter results, and
then I'll take your questions.
Net revenues were $6.6 billion, and net earnings were nearly $1 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $1.78, and our
annualized return on common equity was 5.4%. Year-to-date, our annualized return on common equity was 8.8%.
Questions surrounding the stability of the global economy and its future prospects resurfaced in the second quarter. The
situation in Europe remains a primary concern. Despite the systemic benefits of the European Central Bank's long-term
refinancing operations, the market refocused on the broader sovereign challenges that remain. In particular, client
psychology suffered from continued skepticism regarding the mechanisms and political will required to address the
complex series of issues facing European governments. The outlook for the global economy was further clouded by
concerns about slowing economic conditions in the United States and China given weak economic data during the
quarter. The accumulation of these various macroeconomic concerns increased market uncertainty and reduced client
activity. For example, during the second quarter, industry underwriting volumes declined significantly with debt and
equity volumes down by 36% and 15%, respectively. Market volumes also posted quarterly declines in various fixed
income and equity products. While a challenging macro environment may translate into lower industry volumes, our
focus on our clients is unwavering as the advice, execution, and investment management services that we provide to
our global client franchise are more highly-valued in difficult environment.
The uncertainty has also led the firm to conservatively manage its risk profile, maintaining a high level of risk-adjusted
capital and a significant liquidity cushion. We believe our continued focus on serving our global client franchise and
managing our risk prudently is essential to the firm's ability to create shareholder value over the long term.
I'll now review each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion, up
4% from first quarter results. Second quarter Advisory revenues were $469 million, down 4% from the first quarter.
Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A globally for the year-to-date. We advised on
a number of important transactions that closed in the second quarter including Johnson & Johnson's $19.7 billion
acquisition of Synthes, Sara Lee's $7.2 billion spin-off of its international coffee and tea business, and AUSTAR
United Communications' A$2.7 billion sale to FOXTEL. We were also advisor on a number of significant announced
transactions including Cooper Industries' $12.6 billion sale to Eaton, Walgreen's purchase of a 45% stake in Alliance
Boots for $6.7 billion, and Catalyst Health Solutions' $4.4 billion sale to SXC Health Solutions.
Second quarter Underwriting net revenues were $734 million, up 10% sequentially. Equity underwriting revenues of
$239 million were down 6% from the first quarter, reflecting weaker issuance activity. Debt underwriting increased
21% to $495 million, diverging from lower industry-wide issuance volume due to our involvement in several
significant transactions. During the second quarter, we participated in many noteworthy underwriting transactions
including BTG Pactual's $1.7 billion IPO, IHS's $1 billion secondary offering, and Chesapeake Energy's $4 billion
dollars bridge loan. Our Investment Banking backlog increased from the end of first quarter levels.
Let me now turn to Institutional Client Services which is comprised of FICC and equities client execution,
commissions and fees, and security services. Net revenues were $3.9 billion in the second quarter. Our FICC and
equities client execution business produced significantly lower results relative to the first quarter, driven by macro
concerns and weaker market sentiment. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2.2 billion in the second quarter,
down 37% from the first quarter as most businesses produced lower results. Our rates, currencies, credit, and

commodities businesses were negatively impacted by client risk aversion and lower volumes following more acute
concerns about the situation in Europe and broader macroeconomic weakness. While volumes were also lower in
mortgages, the business benefited from better asset price stability.
Turning to Equities which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues
for the second quarter were $1.7 billion, down 25% sequentially. Equities client execution revenues were 51% lower to
$510 million, reflecting higher levels of volatility and declining market values. Commissions and fees were $776
million, down 7% from the first quarter on lower volumes. Security services' net revenues of $409 million were 11%
higher sequentially due to seasonally stronger client activity. Turning to risk; average daily value at risk in the second
quarter was $92 million, down 3% relative to the first quarter.
Let me now review Investing & Lending which produced net revenues of $203 million in the second quarter. The firm's
investing and lending activities across various asset classes, primarily including debt securities and loans and equity
securities, are included in this segment. These activities include both direct investing and investing through funds as
well as lending activities. Our investment in ICBC [Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited] produced a loss
of $194 million during the quarter. Other equity investments generated net losses of $112 million, reflecting losses in
public equities, largely offset by gains in private equities. Net revenues from debt securities and loans included net
interest income and net gains of $222 million. Other revenues of $287 million were primarily driven by the firm's
investments in consolidated investment entities.
In Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion, up 13% from the first quarter,
largely due to incentive fees related to the sale of our client's remaining investment in ICBC. Management and other
fees were consistent with the first quarter at $1 billion. During the second quarter, assets under management increased
$12 billion to $836 billion. Inflows in fixed income due to the acquisition of Dwight Asset Management were partially
offset by $4 billion of market depreciation.
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation benefits expense – which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior
year equity awards, and other items such as payroll taxes and benefits – was accrued at a compensation to net revenue
ratio of 44% which is consistent with the firm's accrual in the first quarter of 2012. Second quarter non-compensation
expenses were $2.3 billion, 4% lower than the first quarter, reflecting reduced costs across a number of expense
categories. Total staff at the end of the second quarter was approximately 32,300, relatively flat from the first quarter of
2012. Our year-to-date effective tax rate was 33.2%.
Many of the last several quarters presented challenging operating conditions, with macroeconomic concerns taking
center stage. As we've said many times, our opportunity set begins with the client's decision to transact, and the recent
environment has damaged client sentiment and reduced overall activity levels. As a management team, we recognize
that we cannot control the macro environment. However, we remain committed to using all the appropriate levers
available to us to improve returns without negatively impacting our client franchise or longer-term prospects. We have
a long history of adapting, and we'll need to continue to allocate resources effectively to meet our clients' need to
maximize returns. In a difficult operating environment, we have two principal levers to enhance returns: expense and
capital management.
A year ago we announced a $1.2-billion expense initiative. We subsequently increased the amount to $1.4 billion.
We've met that target and continue to focus on improving operating efficiencies across the firm. We're currently
targeting approximately $500 million in additional run rate cost savings to be achieved by yearend.
During the quarter, we repurchased 14.3 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.5 billion. We believe that
we have sufficient flexibility to manage our capital levels appropriately for the remainder of the year. However, the
level of ongoing share repurchases will continue to be driven by our assessment of the risk to the broader operating
environment, our earnings generation, and the potential for more attractive opportunities to put our capital to work for
clients.
In this environment, we will continue to focus on helping our clients navigate the challenging market conditions. We
will work to balance near-term uncertainties with longer-term strategic goals. We will invest for growth in attractive

region and businesses and reduce our commitment to businesses experiencing lower client demand. Doing this
effectively is the key to protecting our global client franchise and thus our ability to generate attractive long-term
returns for our shareholders.
With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today, and now I'm happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Hi. Good morning, David.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Good morning, Howard.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Just picking up where you left off in the prepared comments; with all that you're willing and
trying to do to control expenses and capital management, we still have a 5% return on tangible equity. Just curious what
else is in your mind and the partners' minds about getting back to exceeding cost of capital and other than just waiting
for a more vibrant macro environment.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Howard, look. I think you've heard me talk about this before. We're controlling the levers we
can, which are expenses and capital. We, obviously, don't want to go too far on either one because we think at some
point the world will get better but I think that all of those things will let us perform a little bit better in a tough
environment. We're not going to cut our way to prosperity, and we're not going to cut our way to the appropriate levels
of returns, and I think that we'll continue to do the best we can with our clients, manage our expenses, and manage our
capital, but I would not expect that we're going to have acceptable ROEs in a macro environment like this.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Understood. Thanks, David. And, then given the recent Fed 2.5 and Basel III NPRs, I was
just hoping you could give some thoughts on some of the Basel III guidance after you and the team incorporate some of
these recent NPR rules.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Yeah, what I would tell you is when we sit here today, best estimate and these are still rough
and all done manually, if we looked at Basel III today, it would be slightly below 8%. And, if we roll forward and only
just pure math at consensus estimate and largely the passive items like credit correlation, mortgage securitization,
they're going to roll off by the end of 2013, we get to slightly under 10%. And that's about 0.5% lower than we told you
last time because of some of the new Federals and about 0.5% lower because of lower consensus estimates that have
come out. So, those are the two things that have really changed since we spoke last.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Great, thanks. And, then finally for me, $1.5 billion of share repurchases is pretty impressive
this quarter. I know there is a lot of variables in this but if the stock does the same trajectory as it did last year, i.e., it
remains below tangible book, we saw you pick up share repurchase in the third quarter and then get a little quieter in
the December quarter. Is that still a fair assumption to use? Or, are there other things specific to this operating
environment or valuation that we should be thinking about for this year?
<A - David A. Viniar>: We can't give you a prediction. It's going to depend on a lot of things. And, again, you've
heard me talk about this before; it's a very big dilemma in an environment like this. We tend to be very cautious. We
tend to conserve cash and conserve capital, and yet, we have a stock price trading well below tangible book. And, I
know when we look back in the future we're going to wish we bought back more at this price. And so, it's a trade-off
between caution in a difficult environment, seeing what our earnings are, and calibrating it with the very low stock
price. And so, it's not a science and it's something that we look at all the time and we'll just have to see as we go.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Great. Thanks for all the thoughts, David.
<A - David A. Viniar>: You're welcome.

Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hello.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Good morning. First of all, I loved the nine minutes' prepared remarks. Is there anything you can
tell us on the asset servicing sale on the capital freed up, potential gain, revenues impacted, anything you can help us
with because I think I get the strategic rationale of not investing in core business?
<A - David A. Viniar>: So, there wasn't a lot of capital attributed to the business. So, I don't think it's going to free up
that much capital. We have very little book value, so a very large portion of the purchase price will be gains. I think the
transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter so it probably won't come until then. And, there was not a lot of
revenue and earnings associated with it. So it will have a very immaterial effect on our business going forward.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay, I appreciate that. This might be nitpicky, but is it fair to assume that what you and others
have bought – well, let's just stick with you guys, what you bought back in the quarter was one quarter of your CCAR
approval?
<A - David A. Viniar>: We have not disclosed that number, nor am I going to start right now.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: All right.
<A - David A. Viniar>: But, it was a good try, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Can – Alliance Boots, on the advisory side, I could take my guesses. But, can you help us of
what you owned and what it contributed in the quarter?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I would; I'm not going to give you exact numbers, but we had a very small, very small equity
investment in it and a slightly larger but still very small amount of debt. So, the gains from those were not terribly
immaterial.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay. That's good. And, then lastly, any color would be helpful, but you have the expense plan
going on. You just told us about more. You have the buyback which is actually reducing your share count. Can you talk
about how you think about the potential operating leverage, God help us if revenues actually do go up some day
because it seems like the incremental margin potential is big?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Look, we – I think you said it well. We think we're very well set up because the other thing
you didn't mention was the amount of liquidity we have, and we have a lot of liquidity also, which can be used if we
see good business opportunities. And so, we think that we have the staffing levels at the right places and the right
seniority; our expense base about – taking it down to where we think it ought to be; capital levels where they ought to
be; and if we see good opportunities, obviously, we'll start generating capital again. Remember, in addition to that, our
risk is extremely low. The VaR, while it's just one measure of risk, $92 million is the lowest it's been since the third
quarter of 2006; it's almost six years. So, I think if we see the world get better and you know my view on this, it will get
better; I just don't know when. We're in a cyclical business. I think we're extremely well set up, and the last thing I
would add to that is our client franchise. We continue to have a very high market share in all of the most important
businesses. And, I think if there's more to do, we'll get more than our fair share of it.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Last one that's related to that is you made your comments in Europe. You guys have been very
defensive on it and right. Have you seen any signs that either the logjam or the ultimate solution is near?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Look, I'm not an economist and I'm not an expert in this but there's nothing that we've seen
that – you heard my comments that gives us a lot of confidence that there is a solution coming any day now. I hope I'm
wrong there. And, as I said, I'm not an expert in this and I know there's a lot of people over there who are working very
diligently to come up with the right solution. But, we've been through this for a very long time.

Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi, David.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Good morning.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: A couple of cleanup questions on that. On the sale to STT, what's the impact on FTE?
<A - David A. Viniar>: The impact on...?
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: FTEs?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Oh!
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Headcount.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Betsy, I don't actually know that number off-hand. So, how about if we get back to you on
that?
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay.
<A - David A. Viniar>: I think it's going to be maybe a couple of hundred people, but I'm not 100% sure. So, we'll
come back to you on that.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And, then the $500 million in cost saves by yearend, does that include the STT sale?
<A - David A. Viniar>: It's going to be pretty immaterial. It's really going to be a $500-million run rate savings on our
ongoing expenses. The expenses that we had associated with that were not very big.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right, okay. And....
<A - David A. Viniar>: The revenues and the expenses were not very big.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And, can I dig in a little bit to where the opportunity set is for the expenses? Is it more
coming from the non-comp line where there is opportunities for you to leverage some of the investment spend you've
been making in your IT backbone?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I'd say it's actually more – it's on the margin non-comp expenses and more people related and
it won't necessarily result in lower head count. In fact, I would expect that with campus hiring coming on, we'll
probably have higher head count by the end of the year, but we'll have a more junior and less senior weighted head
count going forward.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. So, more skewed towards comp than non-comp?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Yeah, that's right.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And, then just lastly, we have been getting closer to derivative proposals coming out
of the CFTC. Can you just walk us through how you're thinking about shifting the business, if at all?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I think you said it well. We're getting closer, but we're still not there. Even some of the things
that have been agreed upon haven't been released yet. We're, I think, not saying wait and see because we have a lot of
people working on getting ready. But, we're not really making wholesale changes yet until we know the final rules. But,
I think you're right; we're getting closer, but we're just not there yet.

Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Yes. Hi.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Good morning, Kian.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Hi, David. Two questions; on NPR2, I assume you're assuming in your 8% calculation or
below 8%, a standard methodology for NPR2 rather than an internal one. Is that correct?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Yes. That is correct.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: And, is it likely that you will be able to move to an internal model, i.e., the 50 basis points
could come back?
<A - David A. Viniar>: We don't know yet. It's something we have to work through and we'll work with the
regulators. It'll take a little bit of time, but I don't want to overstate it. We just don't know.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: And, could you give us an idea, the 283 market risk-weighted assets that you have disclosed
in the past for 2011 and in one of your presentations, where would we be standing at this point for the 283?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Kian, I'm sorry; I don't have that number right at my tip of my fingers either. We'll come back
to you on that one.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Okay, no problem on that. And, lastly, if we look at the risk rating post NPR2 on the
securitization, which will be about 20% on the highest tranche. If I look at Europe, we would be around 7 under CRD3.
How do you see your business developing in such a context considering the European have an advantage on the
securitization front going forward?
<A - David A. Viniar>: You ask a very fair question there. I would tell you that some of the rules, even the ones you
talked about, didn't come out as badly as we thought they might have, which would have made the divergence even
greater. But, I think we are looking at this and we're just going to have to see how it unfolds. But, I think it does put the
U.S. firms at a competitive disadvantage. I think you're right. And, it might end up with a smaller mortgage
securitization business for us.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: And, if I may, one more; in terms of capital movement within the firm, how do you see the
capital moving towards higher growth areas? What are the segments, either by business, where you see opportunities or
geographies from your perspective?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Look, we've talked a little bit about this before. We continue to be pretty optimistic about the
growth markets. Obviously, they're not a straight lineup and some of them are experiencing some difficulties now. But,
over the next three to five years, we continue to think that there's going to be greater economic growth in some of the
growth markets than some of the developed markets. But, we're also pretty bullish as the world starts to get better,

<A - David A. Viniar>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I just wanted to follow up on the article I'm reading in the Wall Street Journal, Goldman Builds
Private Bank, sets a target for $100 billion in additional loans. Can you describe what you're doing in the private
banking area and with regard to targets for loans?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Sure. I think there might have been some overstatement there. Look, we've been in the private
wealth business for a long time. You know that's a very important business to Goldman Sachs. We've always lent to our
private wealth clients. I think having the bank has just made that a more efficient and more profitable business. So, we
intend to continue to grow that slowly as we have been.
As far as corporate loans go, as we've mentioned, especially with the retrenchment of some of the European banks,
there are some of our clients who really need dollar funding. We have some available through the bank. We'll use it
where we think it's most efficient. We have the most profit opportunities. We have the clients who need it most. So
again I think we're just going to be more efficient. And all I tell you is the total bank has a little over $100 billion in
assets and only about $50 billion in deposits which are used for a variety of things. So you can do the math on the
loans.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So do you have a $100 billion loan target?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I would say we have $50 billion of deposits right now. They're going to grow slowly over time
as we can grow them. And we will use some amount of that for our loans. So, as I said, you can do the math.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So now a real big picture question; in deciding to go this direction more aggressively, you could
either decide to expand the balance sheet, expand loans, expand the bank; you could have gone the other direction, said
we're going to de-bank and really shrink what we have, especially trading below tangible book; or you could have just
put off this decision to another day. So why decide this now? What was the urgency in addition to the European bank
situation? And did you consider the idea of de-banking or just dramatically shrinking your balance sheet?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Mike, I think I told you there might've been some overstatements to start. I think that – again,
I've told you before, that I think the idea of de-banking is not really something that's on our mind. We're regulated by
the fed. We're going to be regulated by the fed. We are a bank-holding company and we're going to be one for the
foreseeable future. So that hasn't changed. But I don't think there's any big change in our strategy that's coming. This is
something that is part of what we are. We're going to grow it where we see opportunities. We're going to take
advantage of the opportunities we see, but it's not a big change in strategy.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then lastly, you're still trading below tangible book value and I know you have a lot of
confidence that your assets are marked accurately. Anything else you can do to realize that value in addition to more
aggressively repurchasing your stock?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I think that's really the main way.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Thanks, David. Maybe a follow-up question just on the return environment, it seems
like if you look across the industry, it's tough enough for someone like you or even the top five players in the industry
to still generate a 10% ROE. So it's got to be, depending on mix, even tougher for firms that are kind of in the 5 to 15
ranking. Given that you're big on the advisory side in the financial services sector, has there have been any pick up in
discussions, dialog on bigger moves, instead of just the cost cutting, strategic decisions in the industry of exiting certain
businesses, paring down certain regions? Like, are we at that point just given that this weak macro environment has
been kind of just slugging along for a few years?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Look, it's a really hard question. We've talked about, you never know what the future is going
to bring. We're in a cyclical business. We know we are in a cyclical business. It's hard to know when the cycle is going
to change. We think we have tremendous upside in a lot of our businesses, while we're trying to pare down and perform
as well as we can in this difficult environment, it's not returns that are acceptable to us or to our shareholders, and we
know that. But the question is how much of the upside do we want to give away to have slightly better performance
today? So, we're not at the point now where we're thinking of wholesale strategic changes, or wholesale shrinkages in
any way. We have a long history of doing this incrementally, as we see how the world unfolds, and I think I would
expect that that's what we're going to continue to do.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay. I mean that was for you. I was saying more for the industry. Like meaning when
you look across like the financial services sector, based on the conversations through like – on the advisory side, have
you seen a pick up in dialogs based on the environment and potential changes taking place?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I think we have talked about seeing some of the European banks retrench as – with some of
the difficulties, but other than that we're not really seeing wholesale changes.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay. And then on your cost reductions, just that $500 million, that makes sense, no
wholesale changes, but in terms of where you're seeing those opportunities, like are you still over-invested in Asia or
Europe, and you say you're pulling back more there, is it certain product areas or certain businesses, or is it across the
board still?
<A - David A. Viniar>: The only thing I would say is, well, because we still think it's a great long-term opportunity,
we're certainly pulling back less in the growth markets than other places, but that doesn't mean that, as we said, they're
not a straight line up either. But we're pulling back less there.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay. And then last one, just on the OTC shift, it seems like we're getting closer in
terms of the number of rules that are out there, but still it seems like it's going to get kicked to 2013. When you look at
whether it's the clearing opportunity and then obviously the give up on some of the revenues, do you have any
indication or any estimate of – I think most would expect the OTC market can get cleared. The challenge is what
portion can trade on a [indiscernible] (30:53) or can transact? And then the pricing goes away or goes to those
platforms. So when you look at the OTC market, what portion can go in that direction? And then even though pricing
goes down there, how much capital can you be saving as a lot of these products get cleared?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Mike, it's really hard for me to give you specificity on that question. The rules aren't done yet.
The industry is still looking at how these things are going to unfold. If I give you specific numbers, I would literally be
making them up, and I don't want to do that.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.
<A - David A. Viniar>: You're welcome.

Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Hi.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Hi Brennan.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: A lot of my questions have been asked, but just maybe a couple of quick ones. FICC results
were actually a little bit better than we had been looking for. And in the press release at least you highlighted the
strength in the mortgage business, and you commented on asset price stability helping out there. Was there some
benefit from Maiden Lane? Or can you give us a little more granular impact on with that was?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I think that's one of the things that helped. I think some of the Maiden Lane transactions being
cleaned up, I think that took a little bit of overhang off the market. I think that was good. I think you probably saw
there've been some tenders in Europe, which have been helpful. So there's been a lot of things that have taken some of
the overhang off the market. And as investors have also been searching for yield, I think they've felt pretty good about
the mortgage space. And so I think it's been a pretty attractive space for people.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And then circling back to the private bank question, and I know you stated pretty
clearly that the article overdid it a little bit. But when you think about some of the regulatory constraints that are being
applied to the capital markets businesses, and couldn't this potentially be an opportunity to create some more stability in
your earnings base? And given, as you said, the great relationships you already have with many of your high net worth
clients and such, the opportunity to maybe grow the bank to just give a bit more of a baseline for Goldman, is that
something you guys are thinking about as well, or not really? Am I overdoing it?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I want to neither overstate nor understate the opportunity. I mean as I said, private wealth
business is a good business for us, we have a bank, we are a bank, a bank holding company with a bank, we're raising
deposits, and we'll use some of those deposits for private individual loans, some of it for corporate loans, but we're not
a retail bank. We don't have branches, we're not going to bring in $1 trillion of deposits, and so there is no change in the
strategy of Goldman Sachs. We're largely a wholesale firm. We also have a bank and we'll use those deposits that we
have and grow them and use them wisely for profitable opportunities where we see them.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Good morning.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: A couple of questions on the Investment Management business if I may. First, just a
point of clarification; in terms of the incentive fees in respect of ICBC, is it fair to say that probably if we split those
out, we'd have the normal kind of seasonal double-digit millions of incentive fees? That's the first question.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Yes.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Okay. The second one is, I'm afraid, back on the private banking segment; can you
give us some clue as to the portion of the $839 billion of AUM that at the moment you would classify as being with
wealthy individuals as opposed to being institutional or retail?

<A - David A. Viniar>: Chris, again, I don't have those numbers with me and so we're going to have to come back to
you with that.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Okay. And then really following on to that, in terms of, I'm sorry to push on the
strategy, but it is a really topical issue particularly given obviously what seems to be a desire to diversify here. But
would the focus you would say remain on your traditional U.S. client base? Or would you focus perhaps a little bit
more of your effort on obviously what is the faster growing Asian markets where obviously you have a strong footprint
in the investment bank?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Well, we've talked about before growing the private wealth business outside the United States
has been a big focus of ours and especially in some of the growth markets as you mentioned like Asia where we think
there is a lot of wealth that's been and being created. Given our investment banking relationships and given the strength
in our private wealth business that has been a strategic focus of ours for a while and continues to be.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Okay. And then if I was to ask you what portion of your – I thought you've answered
the question, but your portion of your wealth management assets that are actually outside of the United States, would
you have an idea whether it was 20%, 10%?
<A - David A. Viniar>: It's very small right now. It's a very small number but it's something that we're looking to grow
rapidly.

Your next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Oh, hi. Good morning.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Good morning, Roger.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: I'm just going to come back to a couple of things that have been asked already. One
on the buybacks, were you fairly spaced across the quarter? Or were the buybacks more concentrated earlier part than
the latter part, given the gyrations in the markets?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I think it was. I mean, you can see by the average, I think we were relatively evenly spaced
across the quarter.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. So I mean, as you balance all the things that you've talked about and the risk
environment as you would characterize it, it appears not as – certainly not as bad as parts of the fourth quarter last year
were. I think you did pullback on the buybacks. Is that a fair characterization?
<A - David A. Viniar>: As I said before, this is something that we're going to consider as we go forward. I don't think
you should take the fourth quarter as an example of anything other than it's what we decided to do in the fourth quarter
of last year, and we're just going to see how things unfold as we go forward.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. On the $500 million in additional run rate cost you're going to take out, does
that assume a current-ish run rate for the balance of the year?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I'm not sure I understood that question.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Well, is it an assessment of where you need to get your cost base to relative to
current levels of revenue generation?

<A - David A. Viniar>: Yeah, it's assuming things are kind of stable as they are, we expect that by the end of the year
we will have taken out, round numbers, another $500 million of costs, it will come out over the next couple of quarters.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. And is there anything that you or the Board, management would be looking to
make a determination otherwise? In other words, if there's a bigger structural cost change that would have to occur
given a view that the revenue profile is going to be challenged for a long period of time? I know that's not your view
right now.
<A - David A. Viniar>: That's always the hard question and it's always hard. I can't tell you we won't reach that
conclusion. It's hard to reach that conclusion. History tells us that we will do things more on an incremental basis, but
we'll have to see how the world unfolds.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Yeah, okay. And just two more quick ones; Investing & Lending, you talked about
some private equity gains and I guess within that, how much was realized versus unrealized? And was most of the
realized the Alliance Boots that Glenn was asking about?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Well, the second question is easy. Most was not the Alliance Boots. It was a pretty small
number, as I said. I don't have what was realized versus unrealized with me, but most of it was what we'll recall event
driven, which means it was based on a company that was private, went public...
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Got it.
<A - David A. Viniar>: ...so then we're able to see the price, a bid for a company that we have an investment in, so it
was mostly event driven.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. Fair. And then lastly just on securities services, you mentioned revenues were
up sequentially. Were balance – prime brokerage balances up?
<A - David A. Viniar>: They were roughly flat.

<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Just two small things; just a little bit more clarification on the Basel III. You mentioned
11%, now being closer to 10% for 2013. I just wanted to check that excludes any additional litigation and whether now
you've got more sight of the rules, whether you may kind of up the mitigation, or give us some details on that?
<A - David A. Viniar>: It excludes active mitigation. As I said, there's some stuff that just rolls off. That's included in
there. It largely includes any active mitigation and it's something that we're really starting to go through with the
businesses now. So I don't have a better update for you on it, but we're going to start looking at it pretty closely.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Okay. And just a clarification on Investment Management, I mean you obviously
mentioned the impact of the acquisition on the net new assets, but would it have had any impact on the absolute

<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Good morning.

we've had the impairment charges related to consolidated investment entities running through the D&A line. I don't
know, it's been something in the neighborhood of $100 million a quarter. How should we think of that going forward,
because to the extent that that continues, that would be potentially a meaningful part of the $500 million?
<A - David A. Viniar>: It's not what we were thinking of in the $500 million, but we certainly hope that those
diminish over time. We like our investments to be good investments, and obviously the ones that are impaired are not,

and we think we are through a lot of it, but I can't tell you that other things aren't going to go the wrong way.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Is that something we should look at market trends and almost like a private equity type, we
should mark things up or down? Or is that...
<A - David A. Viniar>: No. It tends to be very idiosyncratic, and it tends to be more based on the performance of an
investment rather than the markets.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Okay. And you mentioned earlier Europe, and we've heard a lot, at least we were hearing a lot
about market share gains in different businesses as European competitors have pulled back. As we come into summer
and the environment really hasn't been a whole lot better, I guess A, are you still seeing that? Is it spreading at all? And
B, how meaningful of an opportunity really can that be for Goldman Sachs?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Look, again, you've heard me say this, we think that it is an opportunity, we think that there's
going to be needs in Europe and that the banks are retrenching, but so far there just hasn't been that much activity. And
so it's really hard to see it come through. We think that over time that will be a really – and certainly over the
near-term, it could be a meaningful opportunity for us, but we haven't seen it yet.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Okay. And I guess, finally, was there any DVA gains to note in the quarter?

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Wharton with JPMorgan.
<Q - Steven E. Wharton>: Hi, David.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven E. Wharton>: I'm still struggling a little bit with the comp issue. I mean I think we've had this discussion,
but it's becoming more material now. I mean, basically under the Basel rules, the capital that you have to have today
more than has doubled. And I recognize we're kind of in a cyclically slow environment, but in the past you guys said,
well look, relative to the peer group our ROTE is better, so it justified like the comp ratio you were producing. But now
your return on tangible equity is kind of in line or even below some of the peer group. And you're still comping at like
44%. Now I recognize in the fourth quarter you tend to true that up, so that the aggregate full-year number tends to go
in the lower 40s. But at what point do you just recognize like that the business has changed because of the capital or
maybe the revenue environment, and that the new structural normal comp ratio should be something materially lower,
like maybe in the 30s, so shareholders get appropriate returns above their cost of capital?
<A - David A. Viniar>: First of all, I think it's a dangerous thing to compare comp ratios, because you have a lot of
very, very differently structured firms. So, I don't think you can compare comp ratio among firms. I think we're very
cognizant of the returns that our shareholders get versus what our employees get. As you know, the ratio itself has
come down pretty meaningfully in the last several years. We'll see what it ends up being this year. We also live in a
competitive environment, and we could cut comp very dramatically in one year and it would help our returns, but we
live in a competitive environment. We still have people leaving for multiyear offers away from us, some from our
competitors, some from other industry participants, and so we try and balance those two things as best we can.

<Q - Doug Sipkin>: Yeah, hi. Good morning, David. How are you?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Good, thank you.
<Q - Doug Sipkin>: Just two questions. One, you mentioned the IB pipeline had improved a little bit. Can you talk
about maybe where you are seeing it? And then just a follow-up, it just seems like on the margin you're starting to see a
little bit more M&A activity, obviously very gradual. Maybe you can comment on if something is happening? Or is it
sort of just guys saying, all right, this is the environment and we still want to do something? Thanks.
<A - David A. Viniar>: So the covenants, first of all, you have heard me talk before about that. Backlog was up. It's an
indication. You shouldn't read too much into it. As you know, some deals never get into backlog. Some deals that are in
backlog don't get done, but I think it is an indication that we saw a little bit more activity in the first quarter, and it was
I'd say more M&A and debt focused than equity focused, given how tough the equity markets were. And you're right,
we're seeing a small pick up in M&A volumes. We continue to see a very large number of discussions. I think some of
that pick up are cross border deals where people think that they can pick up assets cheap in various locations, but I
think it's still a question of CEOs becoming more confident before we see a very big pick up in the merger business,
which is at historic lows. And so I think we're poised for that to happen, but it's not going to happen until CEOs become
more confident.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning, David. Thanks for taking my questions. First of all, on the I&L portfolio,
given now that you've seen the text of the NPR, are you thinking of any changes to the overall balances within that
portfolio from what you've already read in the NPR? And are you thinking about potentially changing the amount of
capital supporting that business?
<A - David A. Viniar>: There are some things that are just proposals and we're still going through them and trying to
understand exactly how to interpret them because they're not so clear. But as of now, we're not thinking necessarily of a
change in strategy, but we're going to have to look at what the capital requirements are and we're going to have to make
sure that investments we make will have the appropriate returns given the capital requirements that we have and if they
don't we won't make them.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: And then forgive me if you've already mentioned this, but I jumped on the call just a couple of
minutes late. Any material changes to your stated exposures to the GIIPS countries in the second quarter relative to
what you've put out for the first quarter?
<A - David A. Viniar>: No, they're up a little bit, but they're still our gross exposure, which as you know is exposure
only net of cash and U.S. Treasury collateral, but before any hedges, is still under $4 billion and net after you take into
account CDS hedging, which are with banks outside of the country, is roughly $2.5 billion. So about as well as it can be
and still be operating in those countries.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: And then I guess within that, just one additional question on the commercial/high net worth
business, would there be loans that would be made in that business that would be included in future GIIPS exposures
potentially? Or is it more focused on Asia?

<A - David A. Viniar>: No. It would be there too. If we have clients in those areas, if we can structure them well and
have the right protections maybe with collateral outside the GIIPS area, maybe with collateral with very big haircuts.
We would certainly use the dollar funding capacity that we have possibly because we have a lot of important clients in
those regions for loans in those regions as well.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - David A. Viniar>: You're welcome.
