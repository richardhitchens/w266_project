Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported first quarter net earnings of $183 million,
or $0.31 per diluted share, on net sales of $2 billion. Excluding special items, we achieved solid first quarter net
earnings of $153 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, as our businesses delivered strong operating results despite
unusually severe winter weather throughout much of North America in the quarter.
Special items in the quarter included a gain resulting from an amendment to a postretirement healthcare plan, a gain on
sale of a non-strategic asset, and restructuring charges associated with our previously announced SG&A cost reduction
initiative.
I will begin this morning with a few comments on the housing market and overall economic conditions before turning
to a discussion of our business results. The unusually severe winter weather, dampened market momentum early in the
year and housing starts in January and February declined slightly on a seasonally-adjusted basis compared with
year-ago levels.
As the winter weather has moderated, markets are improving. In March, single-family housing starts increased to
635,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, 2% higher than a year ago. Single-family also comprised of a greater
percentage of total housing starts in March compared with February. Prices for existing homes are 13% higher than last
year, and fundamentals of job growth and improving household formation support our expectation for continued
recovery in the housing markets.
Although the weather disruptions expense during the past few months has slightly diminished the overall housing
outlook for 2014, the market consensus continues to forecast significant growth compared with 2013 and we are
planning for approximately 1.1 million starts, including over 700,000 single-family starts. Globally, Chinese demand
for our logs and pulp remains strong, as the pace of orders resumes following a normal seasonal slowdown associated
with the Lunar New Year. Orders from our Japanese customers weakened slightly at the conclusion of the first quarter
due to uncertainty regarding the effect of the increased consumption tax. However, Japan remains a very strong
customer for our logs, and we expect that demand will remain generally solid overall.
Let me now turn to our business segment starting with Timberland, charts three to five. Timberland's had an
outstanding quarter contributing $164 million to earnings, an improvement of more than 20% compared with last
quarter. Demand for Western logs was strong in the quarter, and prices rose in export and domestic markets.
Operating margins improved due to higher harvest volumes and our operational excellence initiative. The strong
performance of our Western Timberlands business also reflects increasing benefits from the Longview Timber
acquisition, which contributed $53 million of EBITDA in the quarter, an improvement of $18 million from the fourth
quarter. In the south, log prices rose modestly, continuing the slow upward trajectory we observed in the fourth quarter.
Weather resulted in a lower southern fee harvest volumes as well as reduced silviculture spending.
First quarter earnings from disposition of non-strategic Timberlands are usually minimal, and as expected, dispositions
declined to $4 million in the quarter. Excluding dispositions, the segment earned $160 million – this is the highest
quarterly Timberlands earnings excluding land sales since the second quarter of 2006.
Wood Products, Charts 6 and 7. Wood Products earned $64 million, an improvement compared with the fourth quarters
despite the effects of severe winter weather. Weather resulted in reduced sales volumes for most products as demand
stalled and transportation challenges related to Canadian railcar and trucking availability made it harder to deliver
products to our customers.
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter improved to $93 million, compared with $88 million in the fourth quarter. In lumber,
EBITDA improved by $17 million. This improvement is primarily attributable to increased lumber sales realizations,
which more than offset lower sales volumes and higher Western log cost. Operating rates improved, and the business
did a good job of controlling cost in the quarter, despite weather-related disruptions.
In OSB, EBITDA declined by $10 million, as our prices fell by 3% and sales volumes declined by approximately 5%.
Manufacturing costs rose slightly, as the business incurred higher energy and maintenance cost as a result of the
extreme weather.

EBITDA for engineered wood products fell slightly compared to the fourth quarter due to costs associated with the
startup of the Evergreen Alabama mill. And EBITDA for the distribution business improved by $1 million, despite a
significant number of lost days due to weather-related closures. Operational excellence efforts for all our Wood
Products businesses remain on track, and we expect to see additional benefits as the year progresses.
Cellulose Fibers; Charts 8 and 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $54 million to earnings, down from $65 million in the
fourth quarter. Despite the harsh weather, the mill system ran very well in the first quarter. Average pulp price
realizations rose as markets tightened due to lower levels of supply.
Energy costs were higher as a result of the weather, and pulp sales volumes declined due to timing of shipments and
Canadian transportation issues similar to those that affected our Wood Products businesses. As expected, maintenance
expenses also rose due to an increase in the number of scheduled annual outage days.
Real Estate, Charts 10 to 12. WRECO contributed $12 million to first quarter earnings, down from earnings before
special items of $71 million in the fourth quarter. First quarter earnings included $2 million from land sales. The first
quarter is typically the weakest quarter for our real estate business, and home closings declined seasonally. This was
partly offset by an 8% increase in average prices and lower selling expenses due to the decreased closing volume.
Gross margins were approximately 21%.
During the first quarter, we made significant progress against our SG&A initiative to reduce cost by $75 million by
2014 year-end. We incurred $18 million of restructuring charges in the quarter, primarily for severance as efforts to
simplify and streamline our processes and operations reduced our staffing needs. We are highly confident we will
achieve our target run rate by year-end 2014.
I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our second quarter outlook.
Patricia M. Bedient
Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everybody. Although the housing market has gotten off to a slow start in 2014, we
expect to see demand pick up as we move through the quarter. The harsh winter weather has now dissipated, and the
strength of underlying market fundamentals should begin to yield better results in the second quarter. The outlook is
summarized on Chart 14, and I'll begin my comments with Timberlands.
In the west, export prices are expected to soften somewhat, but overall, demand and prices remain at favorable levels.
The effect of the increased consumption tax is causing Japanese demand to weaken compared to the first quarter.
However, we expect that volumes to China will increase in the second quarter as activity returns to pre-holiday levels.
Demand from domestic sawmills is also anticipated to increase as homebuilding picks up, although prices will likely be
somewhat softer. We expect increased log and haul costs as we begin to harvest sites with higher elevations and longer
hauling distances. Silviculture costs are also expected to increase.
In the south, we expect pricing to continue its slow but steady upward direction. Volumes are expected to increase
slightly offset by higher silviculture costs. Dispositions of non-strategic land sales will be higher in the second quarter
compared to the first with anticipated Q2 sales at approximately $20 million, which will be substantially completed by
the end of this month. Including the effect of these land sales, we expect that second quarter earnings in the Timberland
segment will be comparable to the first quarter.
In Wood Products, we expect that the seasonal pickup in homebuilding will result in increased sales volumes across
major product lines, resulting in improved earnings in all businesses. Lumber sales realizations have softened thus far
in the quarter. However, they should stabilize as demand improves throughout the quarter.
OSB prices appear to have bottomed out, and we anticipate slightly improved realizations for the second quarter
compared to the first quarter. Demand in engineered wood products is improving, and we expect higher sales
realizations during the quarter. In addition, our Evergreen Alabama plant is scheduled to begin shipping commercial
product, I-Joists and Microllam, in May.

In our distribution business, customers are continuing to express signs of optimism, and channel inventories are still at
relatively low levels. On the cost side of the equation, we expect lumber manufacturing cost to improve with the higher
production volumes, and log costs will likely increase marginally due to seasonally higher log costs in Canada
offsetting favorable variances in the west and south.
OSB manufacturing costs are expected to remain flat, as the positive effect of higher productivity is offset by slight
increases in resin and some planned annual maintenance downtime. Engineered wood products manufacturing costs
should improve especially for veneer costs, which were negatively impacted by adverse weather in the first quarter.
Costs should also decrease as our Alabama plant moves from start-up to production next month.
Weather-related transportation issues should moderate now that the extreme winter weather conditions are behind us.
We anticipate overall earnings in our Wood Products segment to increase significantly in the second quarter compared
to the first, depending on the strength of the spring building season. Sales realizations in our Cellulose Fibers segment
are expected to continue to improve. Global softwood pulp inventories were below normal at the end of the first
quarter. Liquid packaging realization should also improve primarily due to higher grade mix. We expect lower energy
and fiber costs, given more favorable weather conditions, compared to the first quarter.
Maintenance costs are also expected to be slightly lower this quarter. Earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment should
increase significantly in the second quarter compared to the first. We expect improved results in our real estate segment
as we move into the seasonally stronger second quarter and weather improves. We expect to close approximately 650
single-family homes in the quarter, up from the 508 closed in Q1.
We anticipate higher average home prices with margins similar to the first quarter of around 20%. Selling costs will
increase due to the higher closing volume. Earnings from land and lot sales are also expected to improve moderately
compared to the first quarter income of $2 million. Overall, earnings in our real estate segment are expected to increase
in the second quarter compared to the first.
The earlier announced combination of our single-family homebuilding business with TRI Pointe Homes is on track,
and we anticipate closing just after the end of the second quarter. The decision of whether to distribute the shares using
a spin or split will be made by the Weyerhaeuser board likely later this quarter. We remain excited about the benefits of
this transaction, which should create an even more powerful homebuilder with additional long-term growth potential.
Now, I'd like to refer you to Chart 13 and make some comments regarding unallocated items. As discussed in our
earnings release, three special items in the first quarter accounted for $49 million of pre-tax earnings. These items
included a restructuring reserve of $18 million for our SG&A and R&D cost reduction initiatives that we announced in
December. Most of the first quarter reserve is for severance for identified personnel reductions across the company.
The majority of these reductions are taking place over the remaining quarters of this year. As a result, very little benefit
is in the first quarter operating results. We expect additional restructuring expenses of approximately $10 million to $15
million, as we complete the overall cost reductions, and we expect to achieve our targeted run rate by the end of this
year.
Special items also included a benefit for $45 million for one quarter of the amortization of the reversal of a liability
associated with the postretirement plan amendment. We expect each quarter of this year to have a similar amount. The
final special item was a $22 million gain related to the sale of non-strategic property.
Unallocated G&A expenses for the first quarter, as shown on Chart 13, totaled a positive $1 million. The change, when
compared to the fourth quarter, is primarily the result of income from changes in share-based compensation, which is
driven by the change in quarter-end stock price, as well as a shift from unallocated pension expense to pension credits
due to the performance of the pension assets and a change in the discount rate. Unallocated function expenses were also
somewhat lower than normal.
I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments, and I'll refer you to Chart 15 for these comments. We ended the
quarter with a cash balance of $780 million, down from the $835 million at year end. The first quarter is typically our
lowest cash generation quarter due to the seasonal build in working capital, as well as lower housing market activity.

Cash flow from operations was $109 million, which included income tax related receipts of approximately $60 million.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $65 million, and we expect total expenditure for the year of approximately
$400 million. Our long-term debt was unchanged from year-end and we have no maturities until 2017.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle and I look forward to your questions.
Doyle R. Simons
Thank you, Patty. I am pleased with our first quarter results, as we delivered strong operating performance despite
unusually severe winter weather, significantly increased EBITDA from our Longview Timber acquisition, and took
actions against our commitment to reduce SG&A cost.
We're beginning to realize the initial benefits of our operational excellence efforts, and I look forward to sharing
additional progress with you as the year progresses. We're relentlessly focused every day on growing a truly great
company by driving superior operational and financial performance to increase cash flow, grow our dividend, and
generate additional shareholder value.
With that, Carmen, I think we will open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Great. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research
Group.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Thank you. Congratulations on a very good quarter.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you, Mark.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: You ended the first quarter with $780 million of cash and I believe you're going to have
some more cash coming in as part of the TRI Pointe acquisition as well. Could you give us a sense as to what you think
is the necessary or the right amount of cash from a longer term basis to run the business that you would tend to want to
have – recognizing where the first quarter might be different than a different quarter, but order of magnitude. What type
of cash level do you typically like to have to run the company?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Mark; it's Patty, and I'll take that one. I think as we think about the cash
balance, there are a number of considerations to think about. One of course is where we are in the cycle, and we believe
we are still in the early innings of the homebuilding recovery, but also, what we need for working capital to support the
increased activity.
The other thing of course is what is the level of liquidity, and we have very good liquidity. One of the things I didn't
mention was that we have our line of credit for $1 billion, but we have no borrowings outstanding.
So, as we look at cash going forward, we wouldn't anticipate that we would need the level of cash that would be
indicated by the $780 million that you referenced at the end of the first quarter, as well as the additional receipts from
the TRI Pointe acquisition. The other thing that we will not have going forward, of course, is the cash generated from
income from WRECO. So, that's the other offset to that. So, a lot of things that go into that number, and so, those are
the things that we are looking at in terms of what is the best use of that cash going forward to build shareholder value.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thank you. Doyle, as we think about operational excellence, should we expect there to be
any meaningful impact in your Timber rotations or your harvesting plans in general. Obviously, Longview is causing
you to have some optimization, but if we leave Longview out of it, is there a meaningful effort that's going to change in
the way you're managing your Timberlands?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Mark, we're applying our operational excellence lens across our entire company, including
Timberland, both the legacy Timberland as well as the Columbia Timberland, what we call Columbia Longview
Timberland.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Right.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: And just as an example, Mark, I would say that in this quarter, while we clearly benefited
from the higher volume and prices in the quarter, part of this strong quarter in Timberland was the result of the
operational excellence initiative that we had put in place, specifically in logging and trucking cost improvement in
merchandising, and also, making sure we're getting the right log to the right customer to capture the full value.
So, we're looking across through an operational excellence lens across all of our businesses including Timberland, and I
can't speak specifically to the exact impact on the harvesting and that type of thing, I can tell you we have already
started to see improvement in our Timberland operation as a result of our operational excellence initiatives and a little
bit of that showed up in the first quarter.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Okay. That's very helpful. And just one thing, it sounds like you're going to see the log
shift towards China away from Japan a little bit overall year-over-year. What's happening to the China margins? You've
talked about improvement in some of your China margins in past quarters. Is this shift going to push the overall margin
down, or are we seeing China pick up?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: So, Mark; this is Patty. As we think about China, the difference in margins I would say
come from some softening in Japan. So as you know, the great mix that goes to Japan is a little richer great mix, that
also in terms of their competition for that log goes into the overall volume that goes into Asia. So, we expect that the
China margins will see some pressure in terms of just the overall amount. And I think I referenced that in our outlook
comments, but from a perspective of overall demand from China, we believe that will continue to stay strong. And
then, as we go forward and get more of the pickup in housing domestically, that domestic log – saw log competes with
the China demand. So, those two will put tension on each other in terms of the pricing.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Perfect. Very helpful, Patty. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Thanks. Hi, guys. Good morning. Congratulations on the progress. I guess, first question on
WRECO, what would be your interpretation for us in terms of the fact that you do have closings now picking up and
cancellations down. And in particular, are you seeing, Doyle, a pickup in the first-time homebuyer in the market?
Because that seems to be what's been missing here in the cycle in terms of extending it going forward?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: George, I agree with you. I think that is what's been missing in for this housing to get back to
the 1.5 million houses, 1.6 million houses, 1.7 million house level that we've seen historically. We're going to need to
see the first-time homebuyer start to gain some traction. I think we're starting to see a little bit of that, but there's still
some challenges in the mortgage market regarding loan availability and the amount that's required to be put down and
just the credit scores that are currently required.

Encouragingly, I think we're starting to see a little bit of loosening of some of those standards, which I think is healthy,
and that will prompt more first-time homebuyers into the marketplace. So, we are cautiously optimistic that we're going
to start to see more and more first-time homebuyers stepping into the market, and we think that's what's going to take
this housing starts to the next level.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Okay.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah, George, one of the other things that is just holding back a little bit that first-time
homebuilder or buyer is the fact that the FHA limits have also been reduced somewhat. So, I think that's putting a little
pressure on that marketplace as well. But as Doyle said, overall, as we look forward for housing, we're optimistic about
what will happen for the rest of 2014.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Patty, the FHA limits has been a much discussed topic, and it's a good thing that you bring
it up. Do you think that that winds up being a burden or an impediment for a year, or do you think if you're through – a
quarter or two down the road, we should have already had the impact of that in terms of demand?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, I think it's yet to be seen, and I think it's one factor in the first-time homebuyer. I
think the other pieces of the overall mortgage availability as well as just what's happening with consumer confidence
and economic activity overall. So, I think if that continues to improve, even slowly but steadily, that that will overcome
some of that pressure that comes from the FHA limits.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Thanks. My last question, I'll turn it over. Within EWP, can you comment, or maybe
provide a little bit more granularity on why you feel you're on target with some of your operational improvement
programs. And, Doyle, you mentioned you expect – or Patty mentioned that you expect sales realizations to be up, I
guess, marginally in the quarter. Is that because of the tail-effect from last year, or is that because there's some new
price increases in the market? Thanks, and good luck in the quarter.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. Good question, George. On ELP specifically, what we saw in the quarter was we had
some startup costs, as we mentioned, associated with our Evergreen Alabama mill. We also had some weather impacts
in the quarter. We, like I said, remain confident that we're going to increase the earnings in that business by $30 million
to $40 million EBITDA in 2014 compared with 2013. We also, to your point, are encouraged and confident we're going
to see some price increases and are already starting to see those in the second quarter versus the first quarter. Some of
that due to mix, but some of that due to just overall improvement in prices as we move into the stronger spring seasonal
period.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Gail.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: And I guess before I ask my question; Kathy, just want to acknowledge the retirement. Best
of luck, and I guess we'll have you for another quarter on the call, but thanks for all your help.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Thanks, Gail.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: I guess, just starting with timber, results were higher than what you might have suggested
last quarter, and I'm just wondering what surprised you in the quarter, where the upside came from relative to what you
might have expected?

<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. Gail, we were encouraged by our results in our Timberlands business in the first
quarter, and I would basically point to three things. One thing was, we clearly had higher prices, as prices strengthened
in the quarter versus the fourth quarter, that resulted we – as a result, we had a little bit higher volumes to capitalize on
those higher prices in the quarter.
The second thing is, as I mentioned earlier, we had some benefit from our operational excellence initiatives,
specifically in some cost improvement on logging and trucking, and also did a good job of merchandising. And what I
mean by that, as I mentioned earlier, is getting the right log to the right customer at the right time to fully maximize the
value.
And then third, and importantly, we saw a really nice improvement from our Longview acquisition in the quarter. As I
mentioned – or as we mentioned, that was up approximately $18 million from the prior quarter. We saw about $6
million of synergy benefit – or let me put it this way: in terms of the synergies from Columbia, we are at a run rate, as
of the first quarter, about $6 million a quarter, which would translate into about $24 million of synergy benefits on an
annual basis. And as you know, that's well ahead of our original target of $20 million in synergies. So, those are the
three buckets that contributed to the Timberlands improvement in the quarter versus the prior quarter, and maybe
versus some expectations.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And I don't suppose you could quantify the operating excellence contribution there?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: As we've said before, Gail, we will quantify that on an annual basis because it will be lumpy.
But I will tell you it did have an impact in – a significant impact – I guess it depends on how you define significant, but
it did have an impact on the bottom line in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: All right. And can you talk about maybe the weather impacts in the quarter, both potentially
if you can quantify what it might have done to you, and just maybe taking a step back and what it might mean from the
markets? For instance, lumber seems to have accrued up in Canada, are you starting to see that come back? So, if you
could just maybe talk about both, I guess, the financial impact and direct impact as well as how you think it might
impact the market as everything unfolds in the second quarter?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Sure. So, let me start off with by saying I was proud – we were proud of the way our people
managed through the weather conditions in the quarter; as you know, there was a lot going on. In terms of quantifying
the impact, it is differential by of business as you would expect, but I would say in Timberlands, it was minimal.
In our Wood Products business, if you look across our Wood Products businesses, the impact by business was
somewhere in the $2 million to $ 5 million range per business. This had to do with things like closures and lumber for
example, we lost 27 days due to closures and distribution. We lost over 50 days due to weather closures.
In addition, we had slow backs. As you know, when you have frozen logs in a saw mill, you can't run as fast so that
was part of the issue. We had transportation issues in Canada and in the U.S. and we even had a couple mills for a short
period of time specifically in one of our OSB mills, we're not able to get logs to the mill to run.
So, those were some of the challenges that we had. Again, I thought our people did a really nice job of managing
through that in our Wood Products business. And then, in our Cellulose Fibers business, Gail, the impact there from
weather was approximately $4 million, and that was primarily due to higher energy cost and some railcar availability
specifically regarding our Grande Prairie mill.
In terms of going forward, most of these issues we think are behind us. We still have some transportation challenges
that we'll work through specifically in Canada as you talked about, but all in all, we think most of it is behind us and
we'll be able to work through it as we move through the second quarter.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And just on the market perspective, any worries that production buildup in Canada
as transport issues unwind will have an impact on the market? Is that why you're looking for fairly muted lumber prices
in the quarter?

<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: So, Gail, I think as we referenced, our realizations thus far in the quarter were softer. I
think that likely part of that is due to that issue, but I think now we see them starting to stabilize and think they will
move up from this point. So, I think we'll work through that nicely. Again, it is dependent upon how housing activity
comes back, but the underlying fundamentals for housing and now with the improved weather, things look good at this
point, so--
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And just one last question. Can you talk about I guess looking at WRECO and the
activity you're seeing there and as it suggests for housing activity more broadly, are you seeing a – can you kind of
quantify and give examples of any seasonal pickup you're seeing. And also, you operate in regions that would have
been affected by weather, but also ones that probably weren't. I mean, did you note a difference in trend beyond just the
underlying market fundamentals that give you confidence some of these sluggishness in housing or a lot of the
sluggishness in housing in the first quarter was weather-related versus something else?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure. I think there are a couple of things as we look at our own markets. If you think about
our Winchester subsidiary, which is in the Washington D.C. area, was really hammered by weather. Even the first part
of the second quarter hammered by weather. So, it's a little tough to see exactly the impact that weather had, how much
of it, but it was significant and we're starting to see that now come back around.
I think the other – in the first quarter, markets that were a little rougher were not surprisingly those that were potentially
a little overheated in the prior year, and I would reference Phoenix and Las Vegas there. Phoenix is now stabilizing as
well, so that's a good thing. California, Los Angeles is doing well. And here in the Puget Sound, of course, the market
did not go down as far as some of the other markets that we had. Texas also continues to remain strong.
So, I think again, as we look forward, a lot of that's behind us. I think the other thing that has put a little bit of a
dampening effect on the marketplace is sort of a good news, bad news. We had some pretty significant price increases
over the course of last year. And I think that has slowed that a little bit. So, we don't have as many closings as we'd like,
but they're closing at higher prices. So, one sort of helps to offset the other one. But, as I said before, we are much more
excited now about homebuilding as we look forward with this really harsh weather in so many geographies behind us.

Your next question is from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Alex.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Can you remind us how much incremental capacity the Evergreen Alabama plant will add to the
EWP business, and what your utilization rates will be once that plant starts up?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: In Evergreen, which is – has started up now and will be shipping product, the 1st of May,
it produces two products primarily I-Joist and Microllam, and we have about 61 million lineal feet would be the
capacity that we would note for I-Joist, and about 4 million cubic feet for Microllam solid section. In terms of – it's
moving into commercial production now, it won't be operating at full capacity to start with as we move that product
into the marketplace. I think overall, if we were to discount the Evergreen mill, we're operating across that part of the
business in the engineered wood at around 70%, but it's very differential by product line. For example, our Microllam
product is operating at very, very high operating rates; that's one of the reasons that we're excited about having the
availability from Evergreen coming online.

<Q - Alex Ovshey>: I appreciate that detail, Patty. And then in pulp, there has been some recent price erosion on the
softwood side in China even though inventory seems to be in pretty good shape. Do you have any thoughts on why
we've seen prices move lower in China, and any visibility into the pulp price environment in China over the next couple
of months?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, I think as we look at one of the things that puts pressure on a papergrade softwood,
is of course the additional hardwood capacity that is coming on line. But China does need softwood to go with the
hardwood. So, I think even though prices may soften here later, that we still are feeling good about pricing overall
moving up in the second quarter and that would certainly include our soft pulp price going up as well.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah, Alex, if you look at the – as we mentioned, quarter-to-quarter first quarter to fourth
quarter, clearly fluff prices were up and we anticipate that trend will continue into the second quarter. And part of that
has been the disruption in the overall supply side of the equation due to the weather, but we do think that's going to
carry over clearly into the second quarter overall.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: That's helpful, Doyle and Patty. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Just a couple questions on Timberland exports. My understanding is Chinese log and lumber
inventories are actually pretty high rate now. I guess, the question is are you seeing the same thing? And then, just on
the – you referenced the consumption tax increase in Japan and the slower to file there. Can you quantify that, is that –
do you expect that down 5%, 10% in Q2?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: From the Chinese perspective, I think inventories did build a little bit during the lunar New
Year period, as I referenced in my comments. We anticipate, as that gets behind us, that demand will in fact continue to
increase in China and that will be helpful in decreasing the overall log inventories in China.
In terms of Japan, if you look at it historically, when there's been a change to the consumption tax, you normally see a
little bit of pre-buying, then you see a little bit of weakness as it goes in, and then stabilization. And it's hard to tell
exactly how that's going to play out this time, but that's – our guess is it's going to be a similar type pattern. We
probably did see a little bit of pre-buying, now we're in the period where there maybe a little bit of weakness due to the
adjustment to the consumption tax, but long-term, we continue to be very encouraged about the demand out of Japan.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Okay. And then just on operational excellence, it looks like you're getting some traction there.
Just wondering if you're able to share at some point in the future your targets, your timing, and sort of the CapEx
required to get where you want to get to?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yes. So, let me talk generally about OpEx across all of our businesses, and I would tell you
we're encouraged by the progress that we've made against the targets that we laid out in December. As we previously
said, we will quantify the benefits on an annual basis, but let me give just a little bit of color directionally on some of
the benefits that we're starting to see. I already hit on Timberlands a little bit, but clearly, part of our good quarter in
Timberlands was a result of our operational excellence initiatives and specifically, as I mentioned earlier regarding cost
improvement on logging and trucking, and also on merchandising, again making sure we get the right log to the right
spot.

In terms of lumber, our manufacturing costs were lower than the prior quarter; that, as you know, is the key focus of
our operational excellence efforts. I will tell you that was somewhat hampered in the quarter by weather, but I can tell
you plans are in place to start to really capture the benefits from our efforts there in the second quarter, and we're
confident we'll see the benefit of that in the second quarter and going forward.
And in our OSB business, the reliability was challenged. Our key focus there is improving our reliability, again as we
laid out on December 17, that was challenged during the quarter due to weather, but we started to see an improvement
late in the quarter and that improvement has continued into the second quarter. And then, the other initiative there is to
improve our mix of high-value products, our enhanced products, and just an example there, we're starting to make our
flooring product at our Hudson Bay mill.
In ELP, as I mentioned earlier, we had some weather impacts, but we are confident that we will see the improvements
that we've laid out in ELP. And similarly, in distribution, where we are there, we – as I mentioned, had over 50 days of
closure due to weather in the first quarter, but I can tell you, all of our sites have completed an extensive analysis of the
customers, the products line, the pricing, the warehouse cost, and delivery costs, and I can tell you one by one those
sites are turning to profitability, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing there.
In Cellulose Fibers, we can give you a number of examples of operational excellence, but I think the one that I would
highlight for the first quarter is, we had record production at a number of our mills despite the very severe winter
weather, and that's not the case across the board, if you look at what happened in that business overall – and when I say
in that business, I mean in that industry overall in the quarter. So, we did a good job of running those mills despite the
tough weather. And then we talked about SG&A, and we're making great progress on our SG&A. I'm confident we're
going to get where we need to be.
So, I think the summary is we're on track, we're working hard on these operational excellence every day, we're starting
to see some benefit, and much more to come, and we'll – like I said, we will update you on an annual basis on exactly
where we are versus the targets that we laid out on December 17.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Thanks for the additional detail. Look forward to the annual reconciliation.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D. A. Davidson.
<Q - Steve P. Chercover>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<Q - Steve P. Chercover>: Just two quick questions. First of all, can you just tell us what criteria would determine
whether a split or a spin is preferable?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure, Steve. As we think about those, we think about the spin as being like a special
dividend, and the split is more akin to a share repurchase, so if you think about the criteria that you would use for each
of those. In addition, one of the things that we look at when we look at the spin versus the split is of course in the spin
you're just issuing the shares pro rata to the existing Weyerhaeuser shareholder base. In a split, shareholders are given a
choice to exchange their Weyerhaeuser shares for the shares of what we think is a very strong homebuilder going
forward.
So, the split gives the investor base the opportunity to choose which one, and we think that it has the added advantage
of then placing the stock with more of its natural investor base, whereas there may be some people who are

Weyerhaeuser shareholders who would say I don't really want to own homebuilding long-term, I want more of a forest
products exposure. And so, it really is the fact that that one is simpler. Certainly the spin is much simpler. And the split
though a little more complex, does have the ability to place the stock with more of its investor base. And it is – the split
is what we did when we did the Domtar transaction in 2007. Although it is a little more complex to execute, it is
something that we have done in the past.
<Q - Steve P. Chercover>: Yeah. I mean, it does make sense, I guess, to get it in the hands of those who want it. From
a tax perspective, is one more advantageous than the other?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: No, there really isn't any difference from one versus the other.
<Q - Steve P. Chercover>: Okay. Thank you for that. And then the second question was, you've elaborated on why
you remain confident in the housing recovery. So, can you just tell us how you position the Wood Products business? Is
your operating stance predicated on an 18% increase in starts which is the difference between 2013 and the 1.1 million
starts that you expect, or is it based on your order file from week to week?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Well, I would say it's both of the above. I mean, we clearly are matching our supply with our
demand, but we're also, as we look forward, we continue to anticipate an improvement in housing as we said. So, you
factor in all those equations as you look to the future for our Wood Products business, but I like the way we're
positioned in our Wood Products business. Our focus, as mentioned earlier, is running the capacity that we have better,
and we're starting to make improvements in doing just that. And in terms of our overall – if you look at it any of our
mills that we've closed have either been started up, which was Evergreen, or permanently closed. We do not have any
mills sitting idle at this point and, like I said, I like where we're positioned in Wood Products. And I think we're very
well positioned to fully capitalize on the continued improvement in housing going forward.
<Q - Steve P. Chercover>: So, you're ready to serve 1.1 million starts, but you're not going to run for practice, right?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: That is correct.
<Q - Steve P. Chercover>: Okay. Thank you, Doyle and Patty.

Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon [Vertical Research Partners LLC].
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Yes, Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I just have three quick ones -
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Chip.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Good morning, Doyle and Patty and Kathy. And again, good luck to you, Kathy, as you later
this year move on into retirement. I wanted to ask you first on the land sales now that we have a reconfigured
Timberlands business with the Longview properties. Is sort of the second quarter, is that an unusually high level land
sales you would expect going forward, and I know it's erratic, or would that represent kind of a normal level?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, it is lumpy from quarter to quarter, sort of historically if you can call a seasonality to
it. The first quarter is usually a little lower. The second quarter at $20 million does not involve Longview land sales.
So, it's not that activity is not coming as a function of Longview. So, I would say that, $20 million probably is more on
the high side from a quarterly perspective, because that would give you a run rate of around 80. But it's going to be
lumpy from quarter to quarter and from year to year, really based upon on the opportunity that we see. So, we look to
upgrade the portfolio through the land sales because those are for the most part exchanges that we are doing. So, it's a
function of continuing to look for the best opportunity and that's why you see the lumpiness. We're not trying to hit a
particular target in any one quarter; it's really opportunistic.

<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: I see. And then, I guess the second one is, I know in December that kind of the two
sub-businesses within Wood Products that sort of need the most improvement obviously are EWP and distribution. And
I was wondering sort of when do you get to a point where they need to show the kind of improvement you expect them
to, versus maybe making other decisions in those businesses? In other words, would that be a couple of years or maybe
a year?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Chip, as we very specifically said on December 17, we anticipate and fully expect both of
those businesses or each of those businesses – let me be very clear, each of those businesses, to improve EBITDA by
$30 million to $40 million in 2014 versus 2013.
At this point, we remain confident that that's in fact exactly what's going to happen, and we're taking a lot of very
proactive steps to make sure that is in fact the case. So, that's the timeline we've laid out and that's the timeline we're
committed to.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Okay, very clear. And one quick one for Patty. The interest expense in the first quarter at $83
million was a little less than we had thought. Is that a good run rate to use for the rest of the year, assuming nothing big
– well, forgetting the – even with the split off, it would seem not to change much?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah, I think that that should probably be a pretty good. That is net of capitalized interest,
so a few million can change quarter-to-quarter depending up on what projects we're doing, but there shouldn't be
anything particularly different in that number going forward.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Very helpful. Thank you.

Your final question will come from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Just real quick, going back to the question about really the cash balance, in the past, you guys
have talked about using some of your cash position to continue to grow that Timberland portfolio. Can you maybe just
update us on what you're seeing from your perspective on the acquisition environment, and are there any other deals
you guys are looking at on that front?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: I would just say we are constantly looking at opportunities to grow our Timberland base, and
we will, as we have historically, will be very disciplined in doing that and we're not going to grow just for the sake of
growing. If we can find acquisition opportunities like the Longview acquisition, where we can drive value for
shareholders, that's something we will pursue going forward. So, as we have been historically and we continue to be,
we look at lots of different acquisition opportunities, but we will continue to be very disciplined in the way we
approach those going forward.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Okay. Thanks, Doyle. And then, Patty, maybe can you just remind us, are there any sort of
restrictions tied to the proceeds coming from WRECO, the $700 million plus or minus, just given the way that the
homebuilder unit was in the TRS and then just the nature of the transaction? Are there going to be any near-term
restrictions related to that incoming cash?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah, Collin, as you think about that cash, it is unrestricted. But as you referenced, it is
coming into the TRS. So, there are no additional restrictions as a result of it coming from the homebuilding business
other than the fact that would be the same as any other cash that is in the TRS in terms of moving at around between
the REIT and the TRS, but it is totally unrestricted other than that.

<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Okay. Well, can you maybe just remind us like some of the mechanisms to get back that
amount of cash out of the TRS and up to the REIT.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, one of the things that certainly you can do is dividend cash from the TRS to the
REIT. There are limitations as to how much cash can be dividended in any particular year, and that's really a function
of the earnings in the Timberland business. The other thing that you can do there is no restriction in terms of borrowing
cash from the TRS, although you do need to pay interest income on that borrowing from one to the other. Certainly, if
you want to move cash down, you can make a capital contribution. But I think your question is more about moving
cash from the TRS up to the REIT. So, you can loan it up without restriction, you just have to pay interest income on
that down to the TRS.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Okay. And then, just – you guys referenced in I think your 2Q outlook and some of the
prepared remarks, just about some of the momentum you're starting to see in the U.S. south as far as log pricing there.
Can you guys quantify that at all? I mean, we've kind of heard mixed messages depending upon which specific region
you're in, generally the Gulf South not being as strong, but kind of Georgia, Florida, the Carolina is being a little bit
stronger. Can you just maybe put a little additional color on that and maybe quantify the type of movement you're
seeing in the south?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: I would answer that by saying if you look at 2013 prices and the log prices in the south were
up roughly 4%. As we said in our comments, and as shown on the slides, prices were up again modestly in the first
quarter versus the fourth quarter. And what we anticipate is a slow but certain increase in lot of prices in the south
going forward. Yes, quarter by quarter, it will vary by region and you'll see one move up more than the other, but
overall, we are encouraged by the trend that we see and are confident that over time, prices will continue to improve in
the south as we see housing continue to rebound.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Okay. Great. Congrats on the quarter.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Thank you, Collin.
Doyle R. Simons
Okay. As I understand it, that was our last question. I'd like to just end by thanking everybody for joining in this
