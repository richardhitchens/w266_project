MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning my name is Jackie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome
everyone to the Medtronic second-quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now
like to turn the call over to Jeff Warren, VP Investor Relations.
Jeff Warren
Thank you Jackie. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic second quarter conference call and webcast. During the
next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief Financial
Officer will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2015 second quarter which ended October 24, 2014.
After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning we issued a press release containing our financial statements and
the revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be
considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any
forward-looking statement.
Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports
filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the
reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at
medtronic.com.
Also, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second
quarter of fiscal year 2014 and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant-currency basis.

And finally, today's earnings call does not constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or
solicitation of any vote or approval. In connection with the proposed Covidien transaction, Medtronic Holdings Limited
has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a preliminary joint proxy statement of
Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien Plc that also constitutes a preliminary prospectus of New Medtronic. The registration
statement is not complete and will be further amended. After the registration statement has been declared effective by
the SEC, the final joint proxy statement prospectus will be mailed to Medtronic shareholders and Covidien
shareholders.
You should review materials filed with the SEC carefully as they will include important information regarding the
proposed transaction, including information about Medtronic and Covidien, the respective directors, executive officers
and certain other members of management and employees who may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of
proxies in favor of the proposed transaction. Please also review the disclaimer page at globalmedtechleader.com for
additional information on forward-looking statements and other important information on the proposed transaction.
And with that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.
Omar S. Ishrak
Good morning and thank you Jeff and thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported second
quarter revenue of $4.4 billion which represents growth of 5% and Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96,
growing 5%.
Q2 was a strong balanced quarter where revenue growth was at the upper end of our outlook range for the fiscal year
and within our mid single digit baseline goal. Our performance was well balanced across our three groups with two
largest groups, CVG and RTG, both delivering mid single digit revenue growth and Diabetes achieving double-digit
growth.
Our Q2 results were also balanced from a geographic perspective with 5% growth in both the U.S. and in international
markets. Looking ahead, we expect that our three primary strategies, therapy innovation, globalization, and economic
value, coupled with our increasing market diversification will enable us to consistently deliver dependable growth in
healthcare. In addition, we believe our pending acquisition of Covidien will further strengthen and balance our growth
profile.
As we have done previously, we are quantifying, communicating, and executing in each of our independent growth
factor. Our new therapies growth vector contributed 310 basis points to our overall growth in Q2. This is over 100 basis
points higher than last quarter and at the upper half of our previously stated 150 basis points to 350 basis points
expected range. Our organization continues to bring forward new products and services, which are being received
enthusiastically by our customers around the world.
Let me now discuss some of the innovations that have boosted our overall revenue growth by delivering meaningful
clinical and economic value to the market. Starting with our Cardiac and Vascular Group, we launched our Attain
Performa Quadripolar Lead system in the U.S. in September. This next-generation system coupled with our
AdaptivCRT response improvement algorithm and efficient VectorExpress programming technology drove a step
change in our CRT-D implant volume intra-quarter. Attain Performa also continues to drive sequential CRT-D market
share gains in Japan where we have picked up nearly 20 points of incremental share since launch. In our low-power
business, our Reveal LINQ miniaturized cardiac diagnostic monitor continues to deliver significant revenue growth
well exceeding our expectations for this product.
The business also launched our new SEEQ Mobile Cardiac Telemetry system which is intended for patients who
require up to 30 days of monitoring. The SEEQ sends important cardiac data to Medtronic Monitoring Center, a
dedicated data center staffed by certified cardiographic technicians to drive early detection.
In AF Solutions, we continue to take market share with our Arctic Front Advance Cryo system and are also beginning
to ramp up our redesigned phased RF product line. In Structural Heart the U.S. launch of the CoreValve transcatheter

valve continues to drives growth with over 200 sites now trained to implant this innovative and differentiated
technology.
Looking ahead, our CVG pipeline remains robust with several meaningful therapies poised to launch of the coming
quarters including our CoreValve Evolut R transcatheter valve, Resolute Onyx Drug-Eluting Stent, IN.PACT Admiral
drug-coated Balloon, Endurant IIs aortic stent graft and Micra Transcatheter Pacing System.
In our Restorative Therapies Group, we also see innovation driving growth. RTG continues to execute on its
neuroscience strategy as evidenced by our recent acquisitions of Visualase and Sapiens. These two advanced
technologies are expected to further bolster our strong leadership position in the rapidly growing field of neurosurgery.
In Spine, we're in the process of launching a number of new therapies including the PRESTIGE LP Artificial Cervical
Disc, the DIVERGENCE Anterior Cervical Fusion System and our new Pure Titanium Coating interbody fusion
devices.
As expected, the sequential stability in BMP for five quarters is now being reflected in our year-over-year growth
comparisons. We expect that our new product launches, combined with continued stabilization in BMP, will lead to
modest growth in our overall Spine business in FY 2015.
In Neuromodulation, InterStim Therapy for bladder and bowel control and Activa DBS system continue to drive
growth. In surgical technologies, our recently launched NuVent sinus balloon system is off to a great start in taking
share. Customers appreciate NuVent's general ease of use and navigation-enabled rapid target identification and
confirmation.
In our Diabetes Group the strong ongoing U.S. launch of the MiniMed 530G system with the Enlite sensor is driving
not only solid growth in insulin pumps but outstanding growth in CGM. Our focus in selling and supporting the pump
and sensor as an integrated system continues to translate into global share gains in insulin pumps and U.S. share gains
in CGM. The MiniMed 530G is the only system in the market that automatically stops insulin delivery if glucose levels
fall below a predetermined threshold, an important step toward our goal of developing a fully automated artificial
pancreas. Multiple clear-view studies have demonstrated the value of our Threshold Suspend feature, including
publications in The New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA.
Regarding our next-generation system, the MiniMed 640G and 620G, we have completed successful user evaluations
and are now ramping manufacturing in preparation of broadly launching in international markets later this fiscal year.
It is also worth noting that in Q2, we realigned our Diabetes Group into three specific business units focused on
transforming diabetes care. The first business, Intensive Insulin Management will concentrate on type I and intensive
type II diabetes management. The second business, non-intensive diabetes therapies will focus on type II solutions
across the diabetes care continuum. The third business Diabetes service and solutions will focus on improving the
customer experience by bringing together data management and customer support solutions including consumable
supplies and financial services. We believe that collectively these businesses can leverage Medtronic's technology and
services to expand access, integrate care and improve outcomes, collaborating with patients, providers and payers to
change the management of diabetes.
Our next growth vector, emerging markets contributed 145 basis points to our company growth. This was an
improvement from last quarter and roughly in line with our minimum 150 basis point expectations. Greater China
returned to double-digit growth in Q2 as expected. We continue to have impressive growth in our Middle East and
Africa region, which delivered the ninth consecutive quarter growth above 20%.
Latin America also had a good Q2 driven by another quarter of growth exceeding 20% in Brazil. In our Central and
Eastern Europe region, while we continue to monitor the situation closely, we are encouraged by the rebound in
Russia's growth profile to the upper single digits in Q2. In India we continue to optimize our distribution in a complex
market environment and we are focused on capitalizing on this major market opportunity in what is one of the most
underserved regions in the world.

We remain confident and enthusiastic in the long-term outlook of emerging markets. We continue to invest in these
markets, aligning our strategies with our customers with market-specific initiatives. We also remain focused on
developing new public partnerships, private hospital partnerships and channel optimization strategies. We expect our
emerging market growth to steadily improve and consistently contribute 150 basis points to 200 basis points to our
overall growth.
Finally, services and solutions, our third growth vector, contributed 45 basis points to our overall growth within the 40
basis point to 60 basis point annual range that we have targeted. Our Cath Lab Managed Services business continues to
grow in Europe. In order to strengthen and grow this business both within Europe and in other regions around the
world, we completed the acquisition of NGC Medical in Q2, a privately held Italian based manager of cardiovascular
suites, operating rooms and intensive care units.
NGC brings significant expertise in material management and managed equipment services, infrastructure design and
turnkey installation that it has developed over the past 30 years. We believe these core competencies will further
enhance the momentum of our Cath Lab Managed Services offering making us an ideal partner for hospitals that seek
to drive operational efficiency and contain costs.
In fact, we now have almost 40 long-term agreements with hospital systems including 21 agreements added this quarter
from our NGC acquisition, which in total represent over $900 million of committed revenue over an average contract
period of five to six years. As part of our broader integrated health solutions portfolio, our Cardiocom business also
continues to deliver strong results with over 80,000 patients in our service, driven in part by the growth in government
accounts, home health providers and hospital systems.
Similar to our Cath Lab Managed Services business, Cardiocom has multi-year agreements with our customers that
provide and produce an attractive stream of high-quality recurring revenue. In addition, Cardiocom serves as a
foundational healthcare services platform through which we expect to strengthen our ability to deliver new, more
comprehensive integrated care solutions in the future.
Turning to the P&L. Non-GAAP EPS growth was 140 basis points above our reported actual revenue growth but short
of our annual leverage expectation of at least 200 basis points. Our gross margin rate fell short of our expectations but
despite the shortfall, we delivered on our EPS objectives driven in part by a 70 basis points sequential improvement in
SG&A spend. Gary will walk through some of these dynamics in greater detail shortly. Our growth continues to fuel
strong free cash flow generation. After adjusting for a multiyear donation we made to the Medtronic Foundation and
certain litigation payments, we delivered nearly $1 billion in free cash flow in Q2, of which we returned over $850
million to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends.
We remain disciplined in how we deploy our capital; selecting M&A investments that we believe are attractive and
aligned with our growth strategies and offer high return metrics while minimizing near-term shareholder dilution. As
we noted at the analyst meeting in June, the acquisitions we have done since FY 2009 have provided $1.4 billion in
revenue in FY 2014 without any net dilution and collectively we expect these will begin to contribute to earnings going
forward. We continue to see this strategy playing out successfully. Just this quarter, we made three additional
acquisitions – NGC Medical, Sapiens, and Visualase that met our acquisition guidelines. We are actively making the
necessary trade-offs to offset any dilutive impact to earnings.
We remain focused on reliably delivering on our baseline financial model: mid single digit revenue growth, EPS
growth 200 to 400 basis points faster than revenue growth, and returning 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders.
To achieve these goals, we continue to execute on our three primary strategies: therapy innovation, globalization, and
economic value. We believe our acquisition of Covidien will meaningfully complement and accelerate all three of these
strategies, strengthening our long-term market competitiveness as well as driving further sustainability and consistency
in our long-term financial performance.
As we move through the Covidien integration planning, regulatory approvals and the closing process, we continue to
become more excited about the potential of the Medtronic/Covidien combination every day. And we remain fully
committed to the transaction, which we expect to close in the early calendar year 2015. We believe the acquisition

remains extremely attractive financially, even following the updated financing plan we announced in October. We have
identified achievable cost synergies that are expected to make the transaction accretive in the first year on a cash basis
and neutral to accretive within three years on a GAAP basis. We also expect the combined company to generate
significant free cash flow, which could be deployed with much greater flexibility.
Our joint integration planning efforts continue to move forward and we are actively developing a comprehensive
integration strategy that is guided by four clear priorities: preserve, optimize, accelerate, and transform. Our first and
highest priority is to preserve. Both Medtronic and Covidien have been consistently executing, meeting our individual
growth projections and strategic plans. First and foremost we must preserve the ability of both companies to continue to
deliver these reliable mid single digit revenue growth results and EPS accretion. This means that our organizations
must stay focused, minimizing unnecessary distractions that could potentially risk delivering on our existing
commitments as we come together as one company.
Our second priority is to optimize. Specifically, this means that we will focus on achieving our projected cost
synergies. Optimizing our two organizations is expected to result in a minimum of $850 million in pre-tax annual cost
synergies by FY 2018. For the most part, Medtronic and Covidien are very complementary in terms of the customers
we call on, the products we sell, and the markets we serve. However, we know we have ample opportunity to find cost
synergies in non customer-facing areas such as facility duplication, administrative redundancies and other back office
functions. Our integration planning teams are working well together to ensure that we reach these projections.
Our third priority is to accelerate. Among the several opportunities that we are currently assessing and prioritizing to
accelerate our market presence and drive increased revenue, there are two very specific identifiable items within our
individual strategic plans that we expect to accelerate. First, linking the Medtronic drug-coated balloon with the
Covidien peripheral vascular sales channel can achieve growth beyond what each individual company had planned.
Second, we expect the integration of Covidien's neurovascular business into our Restorative Therapies Group will
significantly enhance our neuroscience strategy through a more comprehensive product portfolio for neurosurgeons and
interventional neuroradiologists.
Finally, our fourth priority in combining Medtronic and Covidien is to transform. This applies to both how we innovate
and build new value-based offerings for the market as well as how we partner with others throughout the healthcare
industry worldwide to drive new transformative business models and solutions. We have an opportunity to truly meet
the universal needs of healthcare, improving clinical outcomes, expanding access and optimizing cost and efficiency in
a way that no other company can. We believe that our industry leading products, clinical and economic expertise,
global footprint and financial strength will position us to be the preferred partner for physicians, hospital systems,
patients, payers and governments around the world.
Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our second quarter results. Gary?
Gary Lee Ellis
Thanks, Omar. Second quarter revenue of $4.366 billion increased 4% as reported or 5% on a constant currency basis
after adjusting for a $38 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Q2 revenue results on a geographic basis
were as follows. Growth in emerging markets was 12% and represented 13% of our overall sales. The U.S. grew 5%
and represented 56% of our overall sales and growth in non-U.S. developed markets was 2% and represented 31% of
our overall sales.
Q2 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.96, an increase of 5%. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per
share were $0.83, a decrease of 7%. This quarter's GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments on an after-tax basis included a
$64 million multiyear donation to the Medtronic Foundation and a $60 million charge for acquisition related items
primarily associated with transaction cost in connection with the pending Covidien acquisition. It is worth noting that
on a cash basis, Q2 diluted earnings per share were $1.02, an increase of 5%.

In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, revenue of $2.286 billion grew 5%. Results were driven by growth in Low Power,
Structural Heart, and AF & Other, partially offset by declines in Coronary and High Power. In Cardiac Rhythm &
Heart Failure, revenue of $1.320 billion grew 5%. And it included $18 million of combined revenue from our
acquisitions of NGC Medical, Corventis and TYRX. High Power revenue of $670 million declined 5%, off a difficult
prior-year comparison but sequentially grew 7% as reported on the strength of the U.S. mid-quarter launch of our
Attain Performa Quadripolar CRT-D system. Our daily CRT-D implant volumes were flat prior to the launch but
jumped to mid-teens growth post launch. In fact, despite having Attain Performa available for only part of the quarter,
Q2 in total represented our highest level of average daily CRT implants in over 3.5 years.
As we have noted over the last several quarters, we believe the best way to view the high and low-power markets is on
a rolling two quarter basis given the variability in quarter to quarter dynamics. We estimate that global high-power
market growth is flat to slightly down with low single digit growth in international markets offsetting low single digit
declines in the United States.
Last week, we announced the launch of our Evera MRI SureScan ICDs in Japan. We expect Evera MRI, which allows
for full body MRI access, to be well received by the Japanese market given their preference for MRI technology. Low
Power revenue of $524 million grew 11% driven by the strong global launch of Reveal LINQ.
In June, data from the CRYSTAL AF trial were published in The New England Journal showing that in patients with
recent cryptogenic strokes, our Reveal monitor detected AF better when compared to standard care. We continue to
make progress on our global clinical trial for Micra and expect CE Mark by the end of this fiscal year with U.S.
approval in FY 2017.
AF Solutions grew over 30% as we continue to take share and grow the AF market. Results were driven by robust
growth of the Arctic Front Advanced CryoAblation System, which grew over 30% as well as strong double-digit
growth from the international launch of our PVAC Gold phased RF system. We continue to make progress in bringing
our phased RF technologies to the U.S. markets as we are enrolling our VICTORY AF pivotal study for patients with
persistent AF.
In our Coronary & Structural Heart business, revenue of $743 million grew 6%. Coronary declined 2% although our
drug-eluting stent share remained stable in the United States and was up slightly in international markets. The business
executed on a strong global launch of our NC Euphora balloon, which gained market share in an area where share is
usually very sticky. Our agreement with ACIST where we co-promote their FFR technology in the United States also
continues to go very well.
We also just received CE Mark for our Resolute Onyx DES and are preparing to broadly launch in Q3. Resolute Onyx
built on the superior deliverability and proven clinical performance of Resolute Integrity, with thinner struts to improve
deliverability even further and is the first stent to feature our CoreWire technology, which markedly enhances visibility.
Structural Heart grew 19% on the continued strength of U.S. CoreValve launch. Our global transcatheter valve revenue
in the quarter was $131 million, representing growth of over 60%. We estimate the global transcatheter valve market is
now annualizing at over $1.5 billion.
Our team is aggressively adding new centers, with a presence now in over 200 U.S. centers. We are executing to the
launch as planned with focus on training and strong procedural results. Our share was stable in our experienced
accounts. In international, the launch of CoreValve Evolut R 23 millimeter valve is now underway with very strong
customer reception to the platform. We are expecting to broaden this platform with the approval of our 26 millimeter
and 29 millimeter valves in early calendar year 2015. Evolut R is our next generation Recapturable System with a
differentiated 14 French equivalent delivery system. In addition, our U.S. IDE study for Evolut R, a 250-patient single
arm study with 30-day follow-up, is now enrolling.
In our Aortic & Peripheral Vascular business revenue of $223 million grew 3%, or 5% after adjusting for the
divestiture of our Pioneer Plus product line and the voluntary product recall of the below the knee DCB. This is the last
quarter we faced the negative effect of these two discontinued product lines, which should lead to improved reported
growth in this business going forward.

Aortic revenue grew 3% driven by double-digit growth in thoracic with Valiant Captivia stent graft achieving strong
share gains. In AAA we received CE Mark and FDA approval for our Endurant II in the last week of Q2. Endurant IIs,
a unique three-piece version of our market-leading Endurant platform, will launch in Q3.
Revenue for our Peripheral business grew 4% in Q2. However, after adjusting for the discontinued product lines just
mentioned, our Peripheral business grew in the mid-teens with strong double-digit growth in SFA DCB products.
Looking ahead in the first calendar quarter of 2015, we are expecting U.S. approval for our IN.PACT Admiral
drug-coated balloon as well as the major medical journal publication of IN.PACT SFA one-year results. We expect our
IN.PACT Admiral DCB to drive growth in Peripheral in the coming quarters.
Now turning to our Restorative Therapies Group. Revenue of $1.650 billion grew 4%. Results were driven by growth
in Surgical Technologies, Neuromodulation, and BMP. Spine revenue of $746 million grew 1%. Core Spine growth
was flat year-over-year, a modest improvement from last quarter. We are encouraged that both the global and U.S. core
Spine markets continue to stabilize and are beginning to show a bias towards low single digit growth.
Our core Spine business is launching a number of new products this fiscal year, which are expected to return our
overall Spine business to modest growth in FY 2015. In addition to working with surgeons to develop the leading
technology in Spine, our business continues to focus on procedural innovation and our surgical synergy program, which
integrates enabling technologies, surgical tools, spinal implants and our expertise.
Interventional Spine, which primarily consists of our balloon kyphoplasty product line, declined 5%. While we saw
good underlying procedure volumes, we were affected by a product supply issue related to our cement delivery system.
BMP sales of $120 million grew 9% with stable underlying demand. While sales of BMP bounced around a bit, we do
believe we have turned the corner and would expect BMP sales growth to be slightly positive going forward.
Turning to Surgical Technologies, revenue of $410 million grew 10%, and included $3 million of revenue from our
acquisition in the quarter of Visualase. Surgical Technologies had balanced growth across neurosurgery, ENT, and
advanced energy. Neurosurgery grew in the upper single digits driven by growth in Midas Rex power equipment,
capital equipment service revenue, as well is revenue from Visualase.
ENT also grew in the upper single digits driven by solid results in ENT Power Systems due to the recent launch of the
M5 Microdebrider and monitoring disposables. The recent launch of NuVent sinus balloon also drove growth in ENT.
In Advanced Energy, strong adoption of our proprietary Aquamantys tissue sealing and PEAK PlasmaBlade
technologies drove solid double-digit growth.
In Neuromodulation, revenue of $494 million increased 4% led by upper single digit growth in our Gastro/Uro and
DBS businesses. Gastro/Uro results were driven in part by the success of our Care Pathway program resulting in solid
new InterStim implant growth in the United States. We also received FDA approval and launched the Verify
Evaluation System, which is used to provide advanced trialing of our InterStim system.
In DBS, our global focus on neurologist referral programs and the strength of the early stim data in international
markets, which shows DBS provides superior benefits for patients with early motor complications from Parkinson's
disease, continues to drive solid new growth.
Our DBS business also acquired Sapiens in Q2, a developer of advanced DBS lead technology that features 40
individually programmable stimulation points that can more precisely stimulate the intended target in the brain.
We expect to finalize development and initiate clinical studies to bring this technology to market. In Pain Stim, recent
reimbursement changes have softened the U.S. market. However, we gained modest share globally on the strength of
our SureScan MRI spinal cord stimulation system with its proprietary AdaptiveStim automatic stimulation adjustment.
In our Diabetes Group revenue of $430 million grew 10% driven by the ongoing U.S. launch of the MiniMed 530G
system, which includes the Enlite CGM sensor, a smaller, more comfortable, and more accurate sensor.

Globally insulin pumps grew in the mid single digits and CGM grew over 40%. Looking ahead, we are planning a
limited launch of our next-generation MiniMed 640G system with predictive low glucose management in international
markets in Q3 followed by a broader Q4 launch. Likewise, our MiniMed 620G, the first integrated system customized
for the Japanese market, has begun its limited rollout and will also broadly launch in Q4.

month we announced the first enrollment in our U.S. pivotal study of our predictive low glucose management
technology, which includes the study of our new insulin pump design and fourth-generation CGM sensor. This sensor
has new intelligent diagnostics that are expected to result in enhanced accuracy, and it's 80% smaller than the in light
sensor currently sold in the United States.
Looking ahead, it is worth noting that in Q3 Diabetes will face a difficult comparison due to the $23 million in deferred
revenue that was recognized in Q3 last year.
Turning to the rest of the income statement, please note that all of my forward-looking outlook and guidance comments
do not contemplate the effect from the expected closing and related financing of the Covidien transaction.
The Q2 gross margin was 73.8%. This was below our expectations due to several factors. Including a product mix shift
in CVG, the outperformance in BMP sales, and our acquisition of NGC Medical. As we have noted in the past, BMP is
one of our lowest gross margin products due to the profit sharing agreement arrangement with Pfizer. NGC Medical,
which we acquired in the quarter, also has a gross margin that is significantly below our corporate average. However,
both BMP and NGC have operating margins that are similar to corporate average due to lower spend in SG&A and
R&D.
The gross margin also continues to include significant spending related to resources diverted to address quality issues
in Neuromodulation and Diabetes, which negatively affected the Q2 gross margin by approximately 40 basis points.
Looking ahead, we would expect that gross margin to improve sequentially on an operational basis driven in part by
positive manufacturing variances that have already occurred flowing through in the back half of fiscal year, as well as
continued execution on our cost of goods sold reduction program, resulting in gross margins around 74.5% on an
operational basis in the second half FY 2015.
However, based on current exchange rates, we would expect to have a negative 50 to 60 basis points foreign exchange
impact in Q3 and Q4 which would result in reported gross margins that are similar to our Q2 reported gross margin.
Second quarter R&D spending of $374 million was 8.6% of revenues. We continue to invest in new technologies as
well as generate clinical and economic evidence to drive future growth.
We expect R&D expense in FY 2015 to be around 8.5%. Second quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.507 billion
represented 34.5% of sales both on as-reported and operational basis and in line with the outlook we provided. We
continue to expect FY 2015 SG&A to be in the range of 33.7% to 33.9% implying leverage of 50 basis points to 70
basis points on an operational basis. Amortization expense for the quarter was $89 million. In FY 2015 we continue to
expect amortization expense to remain around $90 million per quarter.
Net other expense for the quarter was $63 million. This result was favorable to our prior expectations due in large part
to changes in FX, which resulted in $12 million gain in Q2 from our FX hedging program.
We continue to hedge the majority of operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our
earnings from foreign exchange. However it is worth noting that there is a growing portion of our profits that is
unhedged especially in emerging market currencies, which can create some volatility in our earnings.
Based on current exchange rates we expect FY 2015 net other expense to be in the range of $180 million to $210
million, which includes an expected $120 million impact from the U.S. Medical Device Tax, as well as increase royalty
expense from the Edwards agreement. In Q3 we expect net other expense to be in the range of $30 million to $40
million based on current exchange rates.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $8 million. At the end of Q2 we had approximately $14.5 billion in cash and
investments and $13.7 billion in debt. Based on current rates we would expect Q3 net interest expense to be the range

of $5 million to $10 million. This forecast does not include any potential impact from the planned financing of the
Covidien acquisition, which we would expect to exclude from our Q3 non-GAAP net interest expense.
Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate in Q2 was 19.5%. For FY 2015 we expect an adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate to
be in the range of 18% to 20% and we expect to be at the higher end of this range until the presently expired U.S. R&D
tax credit is reinstated.
In Q2 we generated $951 million in free cash flow after adjusting for the Medtronic Foundation donation and certain
litigation payments. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow, excluding one-time items, to
shareholders. In Q2 we paid $298 million in dividends and repurchased $555 million of our common stock.
As of the end of Q2 we have remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 34 million shares. Second quarter
average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 993 million shares. It is important to note that we expect that the
cash we receive from stock-option redemptions, which was $158 million in Q2, will also continue to be used to
repurchase shares on the open market to partially offset the dilutive impact. These share repurchases are incremental to
our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. For FY 2015 we would expect diluted weighted
average shares outstanding to be 998 million shares including approximately 995 million shares in Q3.
Let me conclude by providing our fiscal year 2015 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We are tightening
our constant currency revenue growth outlook to 4% to 5% for FY 2015. And based upon our current forecasts for the
back half of the fiscal year, we would not be surprised to be at the upper end of this range. While we cannot not predict
the impact of currency movements to give you sense of the FX impact if exchange rates were to remain similar to
yesterday for the remainder of fiscal year then our FY 2015 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately
$280 million to $320 million including a negative $130 million to $150 million impacting in Q3.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line. We continue to expect FY 2015 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the
range of $4 to $4.10. Based on current exchange rates this implies earnings per share growth in the range of 7% to 10%
on a constant currency basis after taking into account the currently expected $0.08 to $0.09 of negative foreign
currency impact to earnings. While we don't provide quarterly guidance, we would point out that Q3 typically had had
modestly lower revenue and similar earnings per share to Q2. Given this and the fact that the U.S. R&D tax credit has
not yet been reinstated, we would not be surprised to see some models shift a few pennies of earnings per share from
Q3 to Q4.
As in the past, my comments and guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the
fiscal year. In addition, as I've mentioned earlier, our outlook and guidance do not contemplate the impact of the
expected Covidien transaction.
Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to remind you that we will have an extra selling week in FY 2016
which will occur in the first quarter. This means that Q1 will have a total of 14 weeks, an anomaly due to the way our
fiscal years are structured with this catch-up week occurring once every six years. Omar?
Omar S. Ishrak
Thanks, Gary. Before opening for the lines Q&A, let me briefly conclude by stating that Q2 was a strong balanced
quarter. We continue to strive to reliably deliver on our baseline expectations. And looking ahead, we believe our three
primary strategies, therapy innovation, globalization, and economic value, coupled with our increased market
diversification will enable us to consistently deliver dependable growth in healthcare. And we believe our pending
acquisition of Covidien will further strengthen and balance our growth profile.
With that, we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of our
Cardiac and Vascular Group, Chris O'Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Group, and Hooman Hakami,
President of our Diabetes Group, to join us. We are rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so please limit yourself to
only one question and if needed only one related follow up. If you have additional questions, please contact our
Investor Relations team after the call.

Operator, first question, please?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Good morning.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: So, Gary, I was hoping I could get you to talk about a couple of items. First, as we think
ahead to the Covidien closing, can you just talk a little bit about how you view your debt load post the closing given the
borrowing in the U.S. and what your comfort level is going to be with your debt ratios going forward? And then
second, really where I'm headed is I also want you to talk about your capital allocation strategy post-closing given your
access to Covidien's cash flows and how that shifts with a much greater cash flow opportunity post close?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Okay. Well, with respect to the debt levels as I think everyone's well aware, to finance the
transaction at this point we've changed. Instead of using our O-U.S. cash and using that as part of the transaction, we
will finance the entire cash component of the transaction, which is basically about $16 billion that we're going to need
to finance. Now, that'll be both through some bank debt and obviously going to the capital markets. We've clearly had
discussions with the rating agencies around that. We've taken a look at the finance and that's well within our ability to
do. We don't think that should be any issue. Obviously, it will result in slightly lower ratings from the agencies but still
well in line with our expectations.
We expect over time that we've kind of committed to the fact that we want to maintain, get it down kind of a 3 times
leverage, which I think will occur over the first few years as we get the synergies and as we drive the growth in the
business. We think the leverage levels will be – probably we can maintain kind of at those levels and be very, very
comfortable going forward and give us the financial flexibility we need as an organization. So obviously, as much as
we prefer to be using our own cash for the transaction, the ability to go and use outside debt to finance the transaction
fits very well into the financials and our expectations moving ahead. So we don't think that's going to have much of an
impact on our overall cash flexibility.
As far as the capital allocation goes, as we indicated when we did the transaction, we still are committed to returning
the 50% free cash flow to shareholders. That's where our commitment still remains. But as we indicated when we
talked about the transaction, just getting access to the Covidien, both U.S. and O-U.S. cash, improves our cash
availability in the U.S. dramatically from around 35% to 40% that we have right now to above 60% as we go forward.
So that clearly improves our flexibility and gives us the ability as we take a look at the combined companies going
forward on what we might do with capital allocation or reinvest it back in the United States. And as we indicated, that
was one of the key factors for the transaction and the structure we came up with, is to improve that overall flexibility as
we move ahead. So we have not changed our capital allocation but obviously we'll have increased flexibility as we
move forward after the transaction closes and we'll have to evaluate that as we get together as a combined company.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Let me ask one to Omar, then I'll jump. So Omar, you grew 5% this quarter which
makes it your first quarter in 4.5 years since the company's done so, and it's really on the back of new products and new
therapies in the U.S. market. The emerging markets business grew 12% this quarter and it's still growing I think below
what your targets are internally. So could you talk a little bit about that incremental engine? How do you get emerging
markets to go from 12% to 15%-plus, which I know is really where you're targeting?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well frankly, I'm targeting even higher than that Mike. But it's true, that we said that mid-teens
is our baseline expectations. And I think we've had a little bit of a tough couple of quarters in emerging markets in
relative terms because of some changes we made in distribution and also some difficult comparisons as well. We

expect to get to mid-teens in the emerging markets quite shortly because there is a balance here. Some of the emerging
markets are doing very well, others under pressure and it so happened that Central and Eastern Europe which was a big
driver of growth had a lot of pressure in the past three or four quarters. That's coming back. China had a return to
double digit this quarter and we expect China to continue in that range. India has been a problem and it's going to take a
little while to sort out. It's primarily around our distribution channels, but that has a fairly small impact right now on
our overall numbers. And Latin America is coming pretty strong, growing well over 15% in fact.
So this is a balance of different countries here, which have different profiles. I think it's fair to look at this on a yearly
basis as opposed to a quarterly basis and I think that's the way we're looking at it and we're pretty confident that on an
annual basis, getting around the mid-teens is a realistic objective. But as I mentioned earlier in all seriousness, I've
challenged the team, that the opportunity there in terms of the underpenetrated market amongst people who can afford
the care really deserves growth higher than that. So it's not quite that simple though to get all those different
constituents together. And it's going to take a little while but the opportunity is clearly there. I think mid-teens is still a
very realistic and achievable annual goal. We'll have quarter-over-quarter fluctuations simply given the breadth of
geographies we're dealing with.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay, thank you, Omar. Congratulations on the quarter.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Good. Thanks, Mike.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Thanks, Mike.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions, I guess the first question just talking about
consistency of growth Omar has been a huge focus of the business and as you head into Covidien and you reiterated
you want to be a more consistent business and certainly on the top line, that looks like the case here in the quarter.
Maybe for both of you, just thinking about gross margins, this has sort of been the third straight quarter where GM's
have been a little soft and there's been one-time issues but I think, investors I think are looking for sort of conviction
around whether you really can deliver 200 basis points to 400 basis points of leverage to a much stronger top line
number. I think based on the last three quarters Gary or Omar there's a view that maybe there are some structural forces
weighing on a gross margins. So could you talk about why you're still confident that you can deliver from a
Medtronic-individual perspective, better leverage on that top line which is obviously improving here over the last few
years? And I had a quick follow-up.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: First, you're right to point out that the gross margin has been under pressure for variety of
reasons over the past several quarters. And although the range that we talked about is still the range that is realistic and
we think achievable. I'd like to point out that given the mix of products and the mix of businesses that we are now –
that's now in our current planning, the operating margin number on which the leverage is built, is a more reasonable
metric to look at as opposed to the gross margin. The gross margin is really only a portion of what contributes to the
overall operating margin and now given our services and solutions business, scale that we're getting in NGC, the lower
SG&A that'll result from that with a lower gross margin will result in positively growing operating margins. So that's
the number that we're more increasingly focused on looking at. We're not losing sight of the gross margin from a
pricing perspective on our products, which we will absolutely still monitor but the operating margin itself is – probably
it's a more meaningful indicator for us.
And going forward with Covidien we'll have to take a look at the combined company, which we're beginning to do. I
think clearly as our growth rate goes higher, significantly higher, then the leverage is something we'll have to look at as
to what's a reasonable amount. I think the absolute EPS leverage is a number perhaps to look at that stage but right now
we're still sticking to our commitment which we still have to prove that we can deliver, that grow consistently at mid
single digits, deliver the leverage that we've talked about, and only after we've reliably established that and are

confident that the growth rate can reliably be higher than that, can we talk about different kinds of leverage. So those
are the two points. First let's focus on operating margin on an overall basis. Second, let's deliver a few more quarters of
what we've talked about as our baseline expectations and then we'll think of change profile potentially. And then the
Covidien adds more mix to that. Yes, go ahead.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. So, Omar, very helpful. And then execution obviously is the second thing I think you've
been very focused on here the last several quarters. Maybe just talk about two points of execution in the U.S. market in
this quarter, one, high powered market's been softer for several quarters, how much of that is product mix for you guys
and how much you think can really be improved through better execution, better management?
And then just secondarily, TAVR roll out, obviously still a strong number but flattish sequentially based on your
commentary. What do you think you share with TAVR market share and how happy were you with the results there
this quarter? Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I'm going to let, Mike Coyle talk about the dynamics. What I will say that from my
perspective, when I look at the overall execution of our businesses in terms of this new product launches. I really, am
encouraged and I'm quite pleased. I think the team has by and large met their commitments, not only in terms of dates
but in terms of the traction that these products have achieved. Their inter quarter dynamics, there are other factors here
which relate to the exact share position or the growth numbers on a short-term basis. But the real meaningful indicators
that I looked at and the team has clearly executed so. But, Mike, may be you can give some more color to the market
dynamics.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Yes, just specifically on the two markets that you mentioned on the High Power side,
obviously despite the fact that we have a year-over-year decline of 5% in the High Power number, that really has more
to do with the prior year than it does in the current quarter from the standpoint that there were some unusual dynamics
in the prior year second quarter. Because of the fact that we had this meaningful destocking in the first quarter a year
ago, as we brought on the new what we call Blackwell platform or the Evera Viva/Brava product lines.
So if you look at the prior year number, it was an unusually high because of the quarter end dynamics in the second
quarter. But when you now look at the actual performance on a run rate basis, especially since the second half
introduction into the U.S. of the new quadripolar Attain Performa system, we are actually seeing very nice growth
dynamics and I think in the text, you heard mid-teens kind of growth in unit implants for the second half of the quarter,
which obviously reflects very good execution and matches frankly what we saw in other geographies like Japan for the
differential performance of the product line. So we think there is very good execution going on there.
In the TAVI product line, obviously from a performance perspective, the rollout is going just as we had envisioned it
would in terms of new centers being opened and revenues generated. Obviously, what was a little different in the
quarter was the fact that there were some positive competitive dynamics going on with new product introductions. And
we have to remember this is the market that is in its infancy is going to respond to new technology introductions.
So one of our competitor obviously brought in the product line that allowed them to compete in the larger valve sizes,
which gave them an opportunity to differentially grow in and catch where they are. Which – while we are in roughly
200 accounts, they are in almost double that. And so that's a big opportunity for them to grow in accounts where we are
not there yet.
And obviously there is also a reaction to new products comings into the market, where there is trialing and then
accounts are going to decide what they are going to settle on in terms of overall share. Fortunately for us, we are now
heading into that cycle with the Evolut R product. We will have our CE Mark for that product. We have it for the 23
millimeter valve. We will be adding the 26 millimeter and 29 millimeter by the time we get into the fourth quarter of
this fiscal year. And then by midyear next year, we will have that availability of product in the United States.
So we think this is going to be a competitive market. The good news is it looks like it's going to be growing faster than
we had projected at the time of analyst meeting, and we're happy to participate in it. I think the important thing from a
CVG perspective is no single product line dominates our growth profile. As you heard from the number of new product
innovations, whether we're talking about the diagnostics area, the new products in CRT-D, whether we're talking about

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Wondering if you could just focus on with the Covidien transaction, just with respect to
accretion that you're talking about, FX definitely has an impact on Covidien's results. So I was wondering if you could
just weigh in on how you guys are thinking about FX moving ahead as you bring that company into the Medtronic fold
and how will hedging I guess look like?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I'll clearly let Gary take this one.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: All right. Well, as we indicated, obviously, as far as the transaction goes, the combination of
Medtronic and Covidien, our expectations as we look at this have been as we indicated and it will be basically cash
earnings per share neutral to accretive in the first year and obviously GAAP accretive by the third year going forward,
and we still – that's assuming the synergies and everything else that we played out. So we still have that expectation.
To be honest with you, as far as beginning and exactly what the impact of foreign exchange is on the combined entities,
we're just starting to get into the details that really put together our detailed FY 2016 types of plans and trying to assess
what that will be and what it will mean as we go forward, obviously fine tuning the synergies and all those details. So
to have – to indicate what the FX impact is, I don't have an answer for that at this point in time as we move ahead. But
you're absolutely right, I mean, clearly FX and where it's at right now both for Medtronic and for Covidien, for any
company obviously that's operating internationally, it's a headwind that we're going to be have to be facing and dealing
with.
We obviously have had a hedging program in place which is more than what they've done, they've done some, but not
as much as we've done. And we'll have to evaluate that and determine what the impact is as we get into, but I don't have
any detailed answers at this point in time to give any specifics on what that impact could be for FY 2015 or obviously
FY 2016.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: One comment that I can make on this is that look with Covidien, given the breadth of
manufacturing facilities, again we don't want to kind of just create one just for FX. But if it makes sense, given the
diversity of manufacturing locations and the spread of cost globally, I think over the long-term, this is not a short-term
thing, but over the long-term, we can plot, not a hedging, but a more balanced strategy on FX that will give us some
protection. So I think the addition of Covidien actually gives us that added flexibility, which over the long-term if you
plan it carefully might help us.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: More of a natural hedge.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Provide more of a natural hedge.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Great. And then, just a clarification on the tax rate given the change in finance, you've
talked about 2% lower, I guess, off the blended tax rate? Is that the blended tax rate as we see it from a non-GAAP
basis today or should we be thinking about that as a blended tax rate, if we adjust both your tax rate and Covidien's tax
rate on to like more of cash earnings, so it would be certainly lower than what the non-GAAP number is today?

<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: No. It should be on non-GAAP number, is what you should base on. What we have done is,
we've assumed that, based on what our non-GAAP normal tax rate is in there, if you blend those together and then
assume, as we indicated approximately 2% benefit from the financing, that's kind of a roughly where we expect. But,
obviously, there is a lot of moving parts there that are outside even our control. I mean, what happens if the R&D tax
credit, all these different things will have impact on where their rate is. But generally just take our two rates blend them
together and it's a 2 percentage point improvement on the top of that.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: And that's going to be on a new cash basis tax rate?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: That's on the non-GAAP rates.

Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Great. Thank you, and good morning.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Hi.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: So two questions, some product question for a Mike, but first for Omar or Gary. Now
that we are closer to the close of the Covidien deal, I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more of a
detailed update on this synergy target as you guys have expressed, a minimum of $850 million, just as your closer and
getting started with the planning, your confidence in that $850 million? If there is a potential for upsides where might
that come, just want to get some comments for you as you get close to the close?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think, first of all, the planning is going very well. We've got detailed list now of when the –
when can going to expect to get some of these savings. We've risk assessed difference levels of savings and we feel
pretty comfortable with the $850 million number.
I think it's premature for us to talk about upsides at this stage to that number. We do have a good funnel of
opportunities. But our basic priorities around preserving the two businesses and their growth profiles, their R&D
expenditure, the commercial presence, I think that remains and that's important for us to protect.
As you go further and further away from the customer and non-customer facing areas. Clearly there are opportunities
and we are building a list, some of these will take a little longer to translate, they've got more risk associated with it.
We don't want to do anything that creates any supply disruption of our products, so we should be a little careful.
So, again, I'm sorry, it just a little premature to talk about upside specifics. Only to say that we feel pretty good about
the baseline number that we've committed and we're looking further areas. Gary do you want to?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: No. I mean, I think you said it well, I mean, the teams are clearly are down in the details, so
versus something that was kind of high level estimate when we put together. Obviously, we have much more detail
plans around that number at this point in time as Omar indicated. We feel comfortable still about getting to the $850
million, there is upside, we will communicate on that when we get to that point. But we – there's nothing that gives us
any pause on the $850 million at this point.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Okay. Great. And then on the product side for Mike. Mike, I was wondering if you
could comment on two things. First on, LINQ and then on your U.S. quad pole CRT-D lead launch and on LINQ, is
that again over $100 million this quarter and could you give us any revised thoughts on how big you think that
opportunity might be beside sort of the obvious comment that it could be bigger than you originally thought? And then
just some qualitative comments on the quad pole launch would be great?

<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Sure. I think, the diagnostics area is one that we are particularly focused on as a potential
growth driver, not only for the product revenue that come with LINQ and with the SEEQ patch that we have, but also
because it's sort of the door for improving diagnosis of patients and then also getting actively involved in patient
management. And so, we see service revenue opportunity associated with those products, as well as obviously, the
product revenue.
So, I'm not prepared to give you a quantification of how fast – update the numbers that we talked about at the analyst
meeting here earlier in the spring, but it clearly is going to – have the potentially to be a $1 billion market, we will talk
about at what time period that that's going to play out.
I think the thing that is very interesting about it is, well, it's not only, obviously, the revenues that we are getting off of
this particular product, but the fact that by essentially more than doubling the number of patients who are getting
diagnosed for syncope. We typically get 8% or 9% pull-through on devices, pacemakers that get diagnosed, because
these patients are getting effectively diagnosed with the LINQ product. So it's helping us in multiple ways creating
service revenue, creating product revenue and then actually driving devices revenue of which we get a differential
share.
And now on the quadripolar lead system, I think it's important to sort of understand that this is a lead, but a device
system that offers significant advantages over what was available in the market prior to its approval from the standpoint
that the AdaptivCRT algorithm, which minimizes right ventricular pacing has been demonstrated to provide better
outcomes in heart failure and now physicians no longer have to choose between having a quadripolar lead and being
able to select that algorithm.
Secondly, the design of the lead itself, where we have this narrow dipole that some have been referring to as a tripole
system, actually that narrow dipole, is limiting the dispersion of current which is lowering the amount of phrenic nerve
stimulation, which has been a problem with prior generation quadripolar lead.
In addition, the fact that we have steroid on H1 gives us much better pacing thresholds for improving of longevity of
the overall product. And then our 16 vector selection process using the VectorExpress program, basically allows high
degree of efficiency to be brought into the procedure by in two minutes being able to tell what optimal vector is across
16 different options. So it really is a better product and that's why we have seen share movement that we have seen in
Japan and why we expect to see share capture here in the United States.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Thanks, Bob. Next question?

Our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.
<Q - Ben C. Andrew>: Good morning. If you could talk a little bit more about the diabetes space, that's exceptional
growth. I was hoping you could maybe talk about what you think the market is doing and then what the persistency is
of patients on CGM as you start them up on the products here in the U.S.?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Sure. I'm going to ask Hooman to take those questions. Hooman, why don't you go ahead?
<A - Hooman Hakami>: Sure. Look, the overall market for pumps is growing in the mid to high single digit range.
Our performance there in the U.S. internationally continues to be very, very good. So we're encouraged by what we
saw in Q2. In the U.S., we grew 12% overall versus prior year. And from an emerging market standpoint, we're
growing exceptionally fast as well, 27% growth. So we feel good about what we see and it's really driven by the
strength of our 530G System in the U.S. And that obviously drives the pump revenue but also the sensor sales as well
because this is a system. And I think we can continue to see that kind of strength as we think about the second half of
the year.

<Q - Ben C. Andrew>: And what about the continued usage of CGM as patients go out over time? Do you see a high
persistence and consistent use of the sensors, once patient start on it?
<A - Hooman Hakami>: We do, actually, yes. The fact that it's a system helps. It's not a standalone sensor. But the
fact that if the system and the system is regulating based on the sensor values, helps with that. So we really have here
what is a therapy versus just a standalone component. And I think that helps drive the adoption of the CGM sensor.
<Q - Ben C. Andrew>: Okay. And last question, you keep talking about share gains in the U.S. but your competitor is
growing over 60%. Is that consistent with the sensor growth you're seeing? Or how do you calculate that?
<A - Hooman Hakami>: Yes. Our sensor growth in the United States, actually if you take a look at our overall sensor
performance just in the U.S., our sensors grew about 59% in Q2 and higher than that actually in Q1. So for the second
consecutive quarter, we've been calculating share gain in the United States for sensors.
<Q - Ben C. Andrew>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Thanks, Ben. Hey, we're past the top of the hour. We'll take two last questions.

Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Hi. Good morning. Can you guys hear me okay?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes.
<A - Jeff Warren>: We can.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay. Thanks. First for Omar, it looks like the Covidien deal is on track. And in the past
quarter, Covidien announced the divestiture of their drug-coated balloon. Do your anticipate any more divestitures
going forward? And I had two follow-ups.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I don't want to go into specifics on the regulatory process here other than to say that as far as
we are concerned, they are all on track. We haven't got an approval yet. So there are still steps to kind of go through.
But the fact that we called the shareholders' meeting, we've given a date for it, says that we've got some confidence that
this will flow according to our original projections, but it isn't done yet. So we'll have to kind of see how it progresses.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay. And then two quickies on the legislative front. It seems like there's some growing
momentum in Congress to repeal the med tech tax, so your thoughts there, and then any thoughts on the R&D tax
credit. Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, we'd clearly welcome the repeal of the medical device tax. We have been close to this
before and there is several compounding factors that haven't allowed that to happen. Although I agree that right now, at
least from what we hear, there is a fair amount of momentum and consensus to get this one through. I mean, I really
cannot comment any further than that on that aspect.
As far as the R&D tax credit is concerned, we expect an extension, but it has to happen. I mean, I think we're hearing
all the noises that that should happen shortly. But again, I mean these things until they are absolutely done, you cannot
really guarantee it. So that's where we stand. In both cases we're optimistic, perhaps more confident on the R&D tax
credit because that's happened before. With the medical device tax, it looks better than before but we'll see. There are
still many variables left here.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Thanks, Glenn.

<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Hey. Time for one last question.
Operator
Our final question comes from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Brooks E. West>: Hi. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, a quick one for you, just on the
quality spend that's hitting the gross margin line. That just seems like it's dragging out a little bit further than you had
anticipated. Can you talk about a resolution timeline there and how we should think about that going forward? And I
had a follow-up for Hooman on diabetes. Thanks.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yes. As we indicated, obviously the biggest impact on the quality and it's basically obviously
diverting resources into the quality area to focus on it, from both in neuro and diabetes. We continue to make sure that
we are making all the investment necessary to get that accomplished and i's a high priority across the organization and
so it's top of mind. And as a result of that, my expectation right now is I would say diabetes I think is probably getting
closer to having theirs kind of resolved and move, completed. And so I think that will probably start to lessen as we get
in here probably even in Q3 and Q4.
I think neuro will continue probably for the rest of the year as our expectation because, but then as we get into FY
2016, I think you will start to see that dropping as they continue to implement their various programs. But I think,
neuro will continue for a period of time at least for the rest of fiscal year until we get into next year, but they're making
progress. I think the teams feel good about where they're at, but it has been costly and something that we give a high
priority to as we move ahead. So, I think you'll see some improvement as you go into back half of the year. But I think
that headwind will still be there for part of this year and then probably see improvement as you get into FY 2016.
<Q - Brooks E. West>: Great. And then Jeff, can I ask a question, a follow-up on diabetes here?
<A - Jeff Warren>: Yes, go ahead
<Q - Brooks E. West>: Yes okay, for Hooman. I thought the structural comments on the diabetes franchise were
interesting. And I'm wondering how much of this is reorganization, how much of this might you need to build or
acquire and then specifically on the service and solutions, data management is interesting. Is that Cardiocom, but how
deep might you get into supplies and some of the other tertiary products that especially type 2 diabetics might use?
Thanks.
<A - Hooman Hakami>: Yes, the genesis of the structure is really for us to become a much more holistic diabetes
company, not just a type 1 pump and sensor company, but a true global diabetes care organization and that's really the
impetus behind the organizational changes that Omar talked about in the text. If you take a look at the three business
units that we've created, the first one, the intensive insulin management, this is really our core business where we're
going after the type 1 patient and the intensive type 2 with products and solutions.
The second one, the non-intensive diabetes therapy business is really our step into type 2 in a broad way. And this starts
with the Sanofi partnership but I think you'll see from us that it's going to extend. And with Sanofi, I think we've got
some really innovative thing on the horizon that we're both excited about. And then service and solution, this I think,
absolutely can leverage Cardiocom. There is asset both within diabetes, with CareLink and across Medtronic with
Cardiocom that can be leveraged as we think about patient management and data management. And you'll see some
additional activity from us along these lines later this year. But I think you can even extend beyond those types of
things. So I think it's going to be a mixture of both organic and inorganic activity as we look to build out particularly
non-intensive and also service and solution.
<Q - Brooks E. West>: Great. Thanks so much.
<A - Hooman Hakami>: Yes.
