Thanks, Matt.
We continue to plan against the global macro backdrop that is volatile and one where some economic projections have
recently been revised downward. That said, we are seeing solid pockets of underlying growth in many our markets. The
good news for us is that we plan for a volatile environment, our businesses are executing well, and we are tracking to
our expectations for the year.
As a result, we had a good quarter. EPS was $0.38, an increase of 6% versus last year. Our Industrial segment profits
grew by 9%. Our relative position in key markets is improving. We've gained share in transportation, aviation, power,
and healthcare behind great new products. Orders grew by 22%.
For the first time in a while, we are seeing volume improving for GE Capital the U.S. GE grew margins by 90 basis
points. We continue to generate benefits from our simplification efforts, and are on track for more than $1 billion of
cost out for the year. Margins improved in six of seven businesses and our cost-out momentum was strong.
We remain on track for CFOA for the year so we're running the company well. And we're executing on our portfolio
strategy. We launched the Synchrony IPO in July and, as we move forward, this will dramatically reduce the size of GE
Capital and our presence in consumer finance. And we've invested in platforms like Milestone Aviation, a helicopter
leasing business linked to GE Aviation. So we're on track to create a smaller GE Capital focused on commercial
finance.
At the same time, we announced the sale of Appliances, a legacy GE business. The Synchrony spend, Appliances sale,
and also an acquisition from the second quarter are all a part of repositioning GE to be the world's best infrastructure
and technology company with a smaller Financial Services division. This is a more valuable GE with 75% of earnings
from industrial by 2016.
We're winning in the market. Orders were robust in the quarter growing 22% and this was driven by 31% equipment
orders growth and 10% in services. Orders pricing was positive in the third quarter. Technology drives high-margin
share and we took orders from more than 1,000 Tier 4 compliant locomotives in the quarter and are ahead of the
competition.
Aviation continues to enjoy great success with LEAP wins, GEnx share growth and GE9X launch orders. For the first
time in a while, power and water equipment orders grew in the United States, up 41%. We now have 13 H turbines in
backlog. And we're enjoying good success in oil and gas with subsea orders growing by 63% and the launch of 20K
blowout preventer.
NPIs are helping healthcare to grow in the United States and new innovations are helping LEDs to grow orders by 60%
and power conversion by 30%. Service orders grew by 10% with growth in five of six businesses. Aviation commercial
spares were up 29%, and power gen services grew by 10% despite some sluggish end use markets. Last week, we
announced new analytical applications and that our pre-activity solution revenues will exceed $1 billion in 2014.
Orders growth was broad-based geographically. U.S. orders were strong with growth a 25%. And growth markets
expanded by 34% with five of nine regions up in the quarter. These include China at 26%, orders in the Middle East,
North Africa and Turkey doubled, Latin America was up 54%, Africa up 9%, and Canada up 46%.
Backlog is a record high of $250 billion, up more than $20 billion in the past 12 months. We had a service backlog
true-up in Aviation driven by finalization of terms with CFM for LEAP, which reduced the total by $2 billion.
Nonetheless, we're at record highs. Strong orders positioned GE for sustained growth in the fourth quarter and beyond.
Segment profits grew by 9% with six of seven segments expanding. Year-to-date segment profit is up 10%, driven by
5% organic revenue growth and 50 basis points of margin expansion. Organic growth was up 4% in the quarter and 5%
year-to-date. Aviation and Transportation remain very strong with equipment growth of more than 10%.
Oil & Gas organic growth was up 10%. We saw a strong U.S. environment in Healthcare, and Power & Water had
tough comps in the third quarter but will have a very strong fourth quarter shipments versus last year. And for the year,
our industrial organic growth should be at the high end of our framework.

We had another strong quarter of margins at 16.3%, up 90 basis points. Big drivers continue to be value gap,
productivity and simplification and we expect this to continue. Year-to-date margins are up 50 basis points and service
margins have grown by 170 basis points year-to-date. With service orders growing by 10% and strong margin
expansion, we're seeing some of the early signs that our investment in analytics are paying off. We remain on track to
grow Industrial segment profits by 10% at least this year.
We've generated $7.2 billion of CFOA year-to-date and are on track for $14 billion to $17 billion for the year. For the
quarter, we grew CFOA by 41%. GE capital dividends are on track for $3 billion in the year. We will generate
substantial CFOA in the fourth quarter, driven by much higher industrial earnings and stronger shipments than last
year.
We continue to have strong liquidity and balance sheet strength. GE capital Tier 1 ratio was 12.1%, up 80 basis points,
and we're targeting buyback in dividends of more than $11 billion for the year. In addition, we expect the Synchrony
split to take GE shares below 9.5 billion by the end of 2015. Our capital allocation continues to be disciplined and
balanced.
Now let me turn you over to Kieran Murphy, who is the leader of our Global Life Sciences business. This is a strong
GE franchise with expanding organic growth margins and cash flow. Kieran joined GE in 2008 and has 25 years of
experience in the life sciences industry.
Kieran Murphy
Thanks, Jeff. Good morning and thanks for giving me the opportunity to tell you more about Life Sciences, a $3.7
billion business within GE Healthcare. The healthcare industry is moving towards a more precise diagnosis with more
precise treatment to address an annual waste of $350 billion since around 90% of currently marketed drugs only work
for about 40% of people.
Precision medicine will improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. And this is driving the demand for
biologics as opposed to chemical medicines, improving efficacy and reducing side effects. We are an essential
component of drug manufacture for this industry.
Our presence in life sciences extends from the research lab, where we help in the discovery of new medicines, to the
manufacturing plants, where we deliver capacity and productivity and then, all the way through to supporting clinicians
who use our diagnostic agents to make refined diagnosis for tens of millions of patients around the world every year.
The expansion of biological medicines for the treatment of diabetes, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases
drives demand for GE products and services, which are embedded in biopharmaceutical drugs. Today, these drugs
make up six of the top ten revenue-generating medicines.
Also, in the emerging markets, particularly China, there is a growing market need for genetic bio drugs called
biosimilars. This has the potential to be a significant growth opportunity over the next five to ten years. And the next
evolution of medicine, regenerative medicine, which is based on regenerating cells, tissues and organs in the body, is an
area where GE is investing for the future. All of this adds up to a market growing at around 8% per year.
We have a broad portfolio of products, which are split into two main areas: Bio Processing & Research, serving
academic and pharmaceutical customers; and Diagnostics, aimed primarily at clinicians.
For biopharma manufacturing, we have a leading global franchise built on a portfolio of products we acquired with the
Amersham acquisition in 2004, and we've continued to build value through successful R&D investments and a series of
strategic deals, resulting in a comprehensive offering that enables start-to-finish solutions for production. This
start-to-finish solution creates productivity opportunities for customers, and I'll return to that later.
Our research and applied markets business has a series of strong brands for protein characterization, purification and
analysis, critical to the discovery of these new medicines. Once selected, these consumables remain embedded in the

scale-up of the drug, all the way to an FDA approved manufacturing process.
Within the Diagnostics business, we are the global leader in contrast agents used across a spectrum of diagnostic
imaging, including X-ray, MRI and nuclear medicine. We supply customers through a global network of large-scale,
low-cost manufacturing facilities.
With novel in vitro technologies developed at the GRC, we have expanded our service offering to allow researchers to
better understand the underlying biology of disease which, of course, in turn leads to the development of these new
precision medicines, which we then help to manufacture. And that brings me on to how critical we are for the
biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry.
Over the past six years, biological medicine sales have grown at 10% per annum to $170 billion, due primarily to
expansion of monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer and increasing demand for products like insulin. Our
hardware and consumables are embedded in the FDA-approved manufacturing processes of these products.
This manufacture of biologics is completely different to the industrial process for making traditional chemical-based
medicines. It requires cells to grow, to produce specific proteins, which are then extracted and purified. This is an $8
billion market where we have built a leading position, all starting from the pharmacy and chromatography platform,
which was part of our mission.
We continue to build on this product and service platform organically as well as through deals, moving upstream with a
series of acquisitions, such as WAVE and Xcellerex, which added fermenters and disposable technologies to the
portfolio; and recently, HyClone cell media, part of the $1 billion acquisition from Thermo Fisher. This creates the
start-to-finish solution I referred to earlier.
We enjoy close strategic partnerships with the leading pharmaceutical companies, who depend on us for reliable
high-quality supply. The move to biological medicines that has driven double-digit growth over the past few years will
continue, as expansion in Asia creates new demand for manufacturing capacity. We are uniquely positioned to help in
this expansion, both for global pharma companies wanting to localize production in new markets and for local
manufacturers wanting to establish domestic production of crucial medicines.
We effectively partner to deliver factory-in-a-box solutions. Our FlexFactory and KUBio solutions can provide a
complete factory in less than half the time required for a traditional plant, 36 months to less than 18, and at a fraction of
the cost. Essentially, we provide a faster and more cost-effective way of creating capacity and access to the emerging
markets.
Lastly, we are investing in the cell therapy or regenerative medicine space. An example of this would be the creation of
cells, for example, to reverse diabetes. The bottleneck right now in this industry is to move from research or small-scale
to industrial-scale production, and this is an area where we can bring our bioprocessing tools and expertise to enable
this revolutionary change in medicine. It's an emerging market where we have low revenues today, but we see it as
having the potential to create a $1 billion business in the future.
In summary, the Life Sciences business is a high-margin, high-quality growth business within GE. We are a trusted
supplier to the pharmaceutical industry for biopharmaceutical research and manufacturing. GE Healthcare's deep
relationships with hospitals provide greater access for sales growth in diagnostic and research products. We leverage
GE's great strength in research and analytics from the Global Research Center and our software center in San Ramon.
We use the global operations and commercial teams across the world to sell into emerging markets.
This is a business where in 2014 we are delivering strong growth, especially in bioprocessing, with margins expanding
by 100 basis points through business integration and organization simplification, and we are generating in excess of $1
billion free cash flow. Overall, the deal return for this business is in the low teens. This is a growing and valuable
business within GE, and we continue to see a healthy pipeline and have great confidence in the future growth of the
business.
And now I'd like to hand over to Jeff Bornstein.

Thanks, Kieran. I'll start with a third quarter summary.
We had revenues of $36.2 billion, up 1% from the third quarter of 2013. Industrial sales of $26 billion were up 3%, and
GE Capital revenues of $10.5 billion were down 1%. Operating earnings of $3.8 billion were up 3% in the quarter.
Operating earnings per share of $0.38 were up 6%. Continuing EPS of $0.34 includes the impact of non-operating
pension, and net EPS includes the impact of discontinued operations. We had a small benefit in discontinued operations
this quarter associated with truing up taxes on the Grey Zone payment.
As Jeff said, CFOA year to date was $7.2 billion. We had industrial CFOA of $5 billion and received $2.2 billion of
dividends from GE Capital. In the quarter, Industrial generated $3 billion of CFOA, up $900 million versus the third
quarter of 2013. For the year, we're on track to deliver on the $14 billion to $17 billion framework we provided.
The GE tax rate for the quarter was 18%. That brings the year-to-date rate for the Industrial company to 20%. We
expect the total year rate to be in the high teens. The GE Capital tax rate was 3% for the quarter, and that was consistent
with the low single-digit total year rate that we previously communicated.
On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were up 3% reported, up 4%
organically. Industrial segment operating profit was up 9%. And GE Capital earnings were down 22% on lower assets,
the Synchrony minority interest impact, and lower tax benefits. I will cover the dynamics of each of the segments in the
next couple pages.
First, I'll start with other items for the quarter. We had $0.03 of restructuring and other charges at Corporate. Two cents
of that related to ongoing industrial researching and other items, as we continue to take actions to improve the
Industrial cost structure.
We also had a $0.01 charge related to the announce Appliances disposition. We moved the business to held-for-sale
and recognized prior service costs related to pension and retiree health for Appliance employees. On a pre-tax basis,
that was $113 million of the total $435 million restructuring and other charges we incurred in the quarter.
I want to give an update on the Industrial cost dynamics. On the left side, you can see our restructuring gains profile.
For the year, we expect to invest about $1.4 billion in restructuring and other charges, with about $1.2 billion incurred
through the first three quarters of the year. We had gains this year of about $0.01 from the Wayne disposition. And so
for the year, we're expecting restructuring net of gains to be $0.09.
We like the paybacks and the operating leverage that we're getting from these projects. The average payback is about
1.5 years. Approximately 55% of these projects relate to product and operating costs, and the rest is associated with
SG&A.
On the right side, I'll give you a quick update on two important cost-out commitments. First on structural SG&A, we've
taken out $674 million year to date on our way to over $1 billion for the year. As a result of these actions, Industrial
SG&A as a percent of sales has come down steadily. Year to date, we're down 1.6 points versus 2013. We expect to be
about 14% for the year driven by an additional $300 million-plus of cost out in the fourth quarter and strong volume.
In Corporate, we've taken actions to reduce our operating costs as well. Year to date we've taken out $436 million
through simplification efforts at corporate headquarters, GGO, and reductions in our social costs. For the year, we
expect to deliver more than the $500 million target we established at the start of the year.
As Jeff said, Industrial segment op profit is up 10% year to date. When you look at Industrial including Corporate,
operating profit was up 17% year to date, 19% in the quarter. This excludes the investments we've made in
restructuring net of gains and the NBCU income we had in 2013.
So I'll start with the segment summaries, first Power & Water. Orders in the quarter of $6.4 billion were higher by 9%.
Equipment orders were up 8%, driven by strong renewables up 42%, partially offset by distributed power down 32%

and thermal down 8%. Renewables saw strength in Europe, Latin America, and the U.S., despite the later than expected
IRS clarification on PTC eligibility.
Distributed power continues to see projects push. We booked about 30% of the units that pushed from the second
quarter but saw some projects pushed to the fourth quarter in 2015. We believe all these projects are viable but are
located in tougher regions like Egypt, Libya, Angola, and Kazakhstan.
Thermal orders were down on four lower gas turbines but higher on a gigawatt basis driven by the large H-class order
in the U.S. from Exelon. This brings our total H units in backlog to 13. We now expect total year gas turbine unit
orders to be about 105 to 110 versus 125 driven by disruption in the Middle East and some U.S. customers are shifting
from F-class to H-class technology. This shift has required some of our customers to re-permit their sites and has
delayed some orders.
Service orders in the quarter were up 10%. We had strong orders for upgrades and transactual outage volume, as
discussed in the second quarter call, and AGPs in the quarter were 18 versus 15 a year ago. Revenue of $6.4 billion in
the quarter was down 2%, with equipment down 8% and services up 6%.
Equipment revenue was driven by distributed power down 35% on 24 fewer units versus last year, partially offset by
strong renewables up 18%. Revenue was a little lower than expected. Wind units were 150 less than planned, driven by
late IRS guidance, but we still expect to ship above 3,000 units for the year. Distributed power was also lower by about
10 units as projects were delayed.
On gas-serving units, we've shipped 64 units year-to-date, and now expect to ship 105 in the year versus the 85 to 90
we planned. Service revenues in the quarter of $2.9 billion were up 6% on higher AGPs and upgrades. From an
operating profit perspective, we were just shy of $1.2 billion, was down 8% driven by negative price and mix from
higher wind and lower distributed power, which more than offset cost benefits including SG&A, which was down 10%.
Margins were down 110 basis points in the quarter.
For the fourth quarter, we expect strong double-digit revenue growth on higher gas turbine shipments up about 40%
and higher wind turbines up about 30%, bringing the total-year shipments to about 105 on gas turbines and about 3,000
wind turbines, which is within the original framework. As we discussed on the second quarter call, we still expect
total-year AGPs to be higher and distributed power units to be lower, impacted by the delays we discussed previously.
In Oil & Gas, orders at $4.9 billion were up 10%. Equipment orders were up 14%, up 20% organically, excluding the
impact of the Wayne disposition. We had strength in subsea up 84% with strong Brazilian orders, downstream
technology up 64% driven by demand in small-scale LNG, partially offset by D&S, which was down 12% in the
quarter.
Service orders were up 6% with strength in sub-sea up 27% and turbomachinery up 8%, partially offset by M&C,
which was down 8%. Organically, M&C was up 7% with demand for control solutions improving in both Industrial
and Oil & Gas applications.
Revenues of $4.6 billion grew 7% year-over-year, with equipment revenue higher by 9% and services up 4%.
Operating profit of $660 million was up 27% on strong cost performance, project execution and a positive value gap
offset by lower M&C mix. Margin rates expanded in the quarter 240 basis points.
Our outlook for the year remains intact for the business with double-digit op profit growth. However, we are
moderating our view of orders growth from high single digits to low double digits to mid single digits. We expect
orders to grow the fourth quarter. As you know, orders in the space are very volatile, and we continue to see some big
projects pushed to the right.
Next I'll do Aviation and Healthcare, starting with Aviation. Travel demand continues to grow with RPKs August
year-to-date up 5.1% domestically and up 6.3% internationally. Orders for aviation were very strong in the quarter, up
30%, with equipment orders up 35% to $6.8 billion and services higher by 20%. Equipment strength was led by $3.8
billion of GE9X orders for Emirates, Etihad and Lufthansa. We also won $1.3 billion of CFM LEAP orders, bringing
our program-to-date win rate on the next gen narrow-bodies to 78%.

Military equipment orders were down 40% but up 3% year-to-date and are on track to be flat for the year. Service
orders were driven by strong commercial spares up 29% to $30.9 million a day, partially offset by military spares'
weakness. Revenues in the quarters of $5.7 billion were up 6%, driven by commercial equipment revenue up 22%,
military up 8% and services down 1%.
Commercial spares were up 19%, offset by military services down 17%. Leverage in the operating profit was strong
with 16% growth on better price performance and volume, partly offset by higher GEnx shipments with 65 units in the
quarter, up 39 from the third quarter of 2013. SG&A ex Avia was down 4% in the quarter and margins expanded 190
basis points.
Overall, David and the Aviation team delivered a strong quarter. We expect the Aviation business to continue to
expand its technology leadership. GEnx shipments will be higher in the fourth quarter and we still expect to ship about
300 units for the year.
In Healthcare, orders were up 1% with better growth in the U.S., which was up 3%. Europe was up 4% and Latin
America was up 18%. This was offset by Japan, down 12%, and the Middle East, down 15% in the quarter. Equipment
orders of $2.7 billion were flat on lower Japan and Middle East orders. Our U.S. equipment orders were up 4%, driven
by very strong imaging and ultrasound orders, which were up 10%.
We believe the U.S. market was up as well but more modestly. China HCS equipment orders were up 6% in the third
quarter and they're up 11% year-to-date. China growth was slower driven by tender decision delays in public hospitals.
In Kieran's business, Life Sciences, equipment orders were strong, up 15%, and service orders for Healthcare in total
were up 4%.
Revenues in the quarter were up 4% with developed markets up 2% and emerging markets up 11%, including China up
8%, Latin America up 30% and the Middle East up 16%. Op profit grew 9%, driven by volume and strong cost
productivity, offset by negative price. SG&A was down 5% in the quarter. Looking forward, we expect the U.S. to
remain volatile, but our products are performing well.
Our position in China is very strong, and we believe underlying healthcare demand remains strong in the long run with
an aging population, increasing insurance coverage and continued government spend in healthcare. As you heard today,
we have a very exciting Life Sciences business with a unique position. Simplification will continue to transform our
cost structure in this business.
Next is Transportation, which had a very strong quarter. Orders in the quarter were up 134%, led by equipment orders
up three times or $2.1 billion. The business took orders for more than 1,000 Tier 4 compliant locomotives to be
delivered over the next three years. Locomotive loading is nearing current capacity levels for 2015. Carloads continue
to be strong, led by agriculture, petroleum and intermodal, and network velocity continues to be a challenge. Mining
equipment orders remain weak, down 38%. Transportation service orders were up 8% in the quarter.
Revenues were up 10%, driven by locomotive volume with units up 49%, partially offset by services, down 3% on
mining weakness. Operating profit was higher by 12%, driven by local volume and cost productivity, and SG&A was
down 5%, and that allowed margins to improve 40 basis points in the quarter. We're very pleased with the team's
execution on the Tier 4 loco and expect to continue to fill out our order book for 2016 and 2017, and we feel great
about our ability to execute against this orders growth.
Energy Management, the business continues to improve. Our orders in the quarter were down 1% with digital energy
down 25% and industrial solutions down 7% on weak European demand and the impact of exiting certain markets and
products as part of restructuring. Power conversion was strong, up 30% in the quarter, driven by marine. Backlog grew
9%. Revenues of $1.8 billion were down 1%. Op profit of $59 million was up three times on strong cost and

And then Appliances & Lighting, the core industry within appliances was up 9% in the third quarter. Retail was up 9%
and contract up 7%. Revenue in the quarter was up 1% to $2.1 billion with appliances up 2% and lighting down 2%.
Appliance revenue was driven by volume up 3% while strong LED growth of 59% in lighting was more than offset by

traditional product declines.
Operating profit of $88 million was higher by 14% on strong productivity. And SG&A was down 11% and margins
expanded 50 basis points. As we announced in early September, we reached an agreement with Electrolux to sell our
Appliance business. We hope to close that transaction in mid-2015.
Next I'll cover GE Capital. As you know, we successfully completed the IPO of 15% of our North American Retail
Finance business now known as Synchrony Financial. As a publicly traded company, CEO, Margaret Keane and the
team will host their own investor call later this morning. We continue to make progress on separation efforts and expect
the split-off to take place towards the end of 2015, subject to regulatory approval. In the meantime, Synchrony will
remain consolidated in GE Capital financials.
GE Capital's revenue of $10.5 billion was down 1%, primarily from lower assets, partially offset by higher gains. GE
Capital's net income of $1.5 billion was down 22% driven principally driven by lower assets, which includes minority
interest impact resulting from the Synchrony IPO and lower tax benefits.
Earnings were also affected by the timing of our Nordics consumer platform exit which, as previously, announced
move from third to fourth quarter. E&I of $365 billion was down $19 billion or 5% from last year and down $7 billion
sequentially. Non-strategic E&I was down $11 billion or 8% versus last year.
Net interest margin in the quarter was 5%, which is essentially flat. GE Capital's Tier 1 common ratio on a Basel I basis
remains in a strong position and ended the quarter at 12.1%. This is up 40 basis points sequentially and 79 basis points
year-over-year.
Our liquidity levels are also strong and we ended the quarter with $80 billion of cash with $15 billion attributable to
Synchrony. Our commercial paper program remains stable at $25 billion and we have substantially completed
long-term debt issuance for the year at $9.4 billion. On the right side of the page asset quality trends continues to be
strong and stable. Now I'll walk through each of the segments.
The commercial lending and leasing business ended the quarter with $170 billion of assets flat to last year. Onboard
core volume was $10 billion, up 5%, driven by increases in both the Americas and international. We continue to see
strengthening in the U.S. largely in the equipment financing with volume up 7%. The team is staying disciplined on
pricing and risk hurdles and the new business returns in both lending and equipment were largely in line with the first
half of the year. Earnings of $617 million were up 29% driven by lower marks and impairments primarily in our
corporate air book as well is higher gains and tax benefits.
The consumer segment ended the quarter with $141 billion of assets up 4% from last year driven by Synchrony. Net
income was $621 million, down 31%. As I mentioned earlier, Synchrony team will cover all the details of their quarter
in a call later this morning. Our share of their earnings was $509 million, down 25% net of minority interest in
investment in its standalone capabilities. The international consumer business was down as well from the effective
lower assets which were down 16% year-over-year consistent with last quarter.
In real estate, assets of $36 billion were down 9% versus prior year. The equity book is down 28% from a year ago to
$12 billion. Net income of $175 million was down 62% primarily from non-repeat of prior year tax benefits. In the
current quarter, we sold 72 properties from real estate equity book with a book value of roughly $0.5 billion for $122
million in gains.
In the verticals, GECAS earned $133 million, down 23% from lower assets and tax benefits. Impairments, including
our annual review completed this quarter, resulted in a $197 million after-tax impact, roughly in line with third quarter
of last year. The impairments were driven by value declines in 50-seater regional jets, older 767s, and older A320s.
Overall, the portfolio is in great shape, and we finished the quarter once again with no aircraft on the ground and zero
delinquencies. We do not anticipate any updates in fourth quarter to the GECAS impairment process. New volume was
much stronger at $1.4 billion, up 62%, with very attractive returns in line with the first half of the year.

As Jeff mentioned before, we were excited to announce the Milestone acquisition on Monday. The acquisition
combines GECAS global reach and leasing expertise with a growing helicopter financing business that will diversify
our business and put our capital to work at good returns. This is in line with GE Capital's strategy to grow in the
mid-market and industrial vertical space where we have deep domain expertise and are competitively advantaged. The
deal is expected to close in 2015 pending regulatory approvals.
Energy Finance earned $61 million, down 59%, resulting from lower assets and gains and higher impairments. EFS
volume was up strongly at 152% year over year at very attractive returns. As you look forward to the fourth quarter, we
expect GE Capital to be about $1.8 billion in earnings, including the gain from exiting of our Nordics business.
However, we continue to aggressively work on opportunities to reduce the size of our non-strategic portfolio. And
these transactions could impact earnings and the tax rate in the fourth quarter. So overall, Keith and team continue to
execute the portfolio strategy and deliver solid operating results.
So with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Thanks, Jeff.
We remain on track for our 2014 operating framework. Industrial segment earnings were driven by sustained organic
growth and margin expansion and are expected to grow by at least 10% this year. GE Capital is on track with higher
earnings in the fourth quarter due to the timing of the Nordic consumer finance platform sale.
Corporate is on track as expected. And as expected, Corporate has been a drag in 2014 because our restructuring
investments exceed gains. However, this will be a real tailwind in 2015. Cash and revenues remain on track, and we
expect fourth quarter organic revenue to be robust.
Despite a volatile global environment, GE expects to have a good fourth quarter and deliver on our 2014 framework. In
addition, we are changing the portfolio to position GE for long-term growth. The GE team has done a good job of both
strategic and operational execution. With a big backlog, high levels of recurring revenue, and a restructuring program
already in place, we believe that GE will deliver for our investors in times like these.
Now, Matt, let's turn it back over to you and take some questions.
Matthew G. Cribbins
All right, thanks, Jeff. Why don't we open it up and take some questions now?

<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: I appreciate the detail on the presentation. It's really helpful. Guys, I wanted to get your sense. If
you look at the markets, it's telling you that the world is falling apart, but then we see the numbers here and they look
pretty darn good overall, and overall in the space haven't been that bad. What are your customers telling you? Are we at
a risk of a real pullback in customer activity as we get into the fourth quarter just based on this new growth contagion
that's out there and this growth fear?

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Scott, just to give you a view of the world, and again, there's certainly a lot going on, but I
would say the U.S. is probably the best we've seen it since the financial crisis. When you look at rail loadings and
things like that, you've got a decent and healthy U.S. market. Europe is slower, for sure. But I think most companies,
industrial companies haven't counted on Europe and Japan for much incremental growth. And energy growth across the
emerging markets – two weeks ago I was in the Middle East and North Africa, still pretty healthy, robust. China I think
is more of a micro story than macro story now; aviation, healthcare very strong; if you're in the right industries, very
robust, Mexico better. So if you look at it geographically, Scott, I think it's this slow growth pattern with volatility, but
not a lot different than what we've seen in the past.
And then kind of industry by industry, aviation remains strong. Transportation remains strong. Power, it depends on
what segments you're in. Oil and gas, you definitely have more caution in oil and gas, but I've been with a bunch of the
COs just in the last couple days, and the long-term projects I think are still underway. But there's certainly, I would say
– there was already caution before the last I would say month or so around there. So I think it fits a pattern that we've
seen the last couple years, and the underlying activity is still reasonably healthy but not universal. There are some parts
that are clearly stronger than others.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, fair enough. And just healthcare, it's unusual for you guys to make a big management
change like that in the middle of a quarter or middle of the year, I should say. And the healthcare numbers were pretty
good. What was it, Jeff, that you didn't like about the direction of what's going on in healthcare that really catalyzed the
change there?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Scott, these things are always individual by individual. I think John Dineen was a really
good leader here. I think he's got good opportunities. As you saw yesterday, he's got a nice new assignment. And
sometimes I just think it works for the individual and for the company. So again, I think the healthcare business is still a
key business for us, but it gives us a new set of eyes. And I think in John's case, the future made sense for him as well.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: I normally don't ask three questions, but what – people are asking questions, why put a
non-healthcare, non-domain experience guy into a business like this. Jeff, you've said in the past that you really want
more domain expertise within the businesses, and John is – I think he's very good obviously, but it came as a little bit
strange to put a non-healthcare guy in charge of the healthcare business. Can you just explain that a little bit? And then
I'll pass it on.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yes, Scott, look, I loved Flannery's global experience. I thought that was outstanding. He's
got a great strategic mind, but he has more experience in healthcare than I had when I became the CEO of Healthcare
more than 10 years ago. So I think he's got a nice, a really a nice background and has real hands-on experience with it
outside the United States.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Great. Thanks, Scott.

<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Good morning, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yes, obviously, very pleased to get detail on Life Sciences. It's a real gem of an asset, but relatively
small in the scheme of things. I'm wondering, Jeff, is this a business you want to grow a bit more aggressively going
forward from here?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Well, there's two – maybe I'll start it and, Kieran, turn it over to you. I think in the
bioprocess manufacturing, we've been able to do bolt-on acquisitions behind organic growth, and I think that's been a

great GE success factor over time. So I think that formula is one that we continue to get experience with. And on the
other side, on the diagnostic pharma side, that's more of a heavy R&D side, right? So I would say maybe bolt-on
acquisitions on the bioprocess manufacturing, maybe some R&D collaborations, but I don't see a big deal. I don't know,
Kieran, why don't I turn it to you?
<A - Kieran Murphy>: Yes, I agree, Jeff. Look, I think the prognosis for growth for this business is actually very
strong. We have a great portfolio, especially in the bioprocessing space. We've done some nice deals here to give
ourselves this start-to-finish that I referred to in the pitch, and there's no question that with the innovation in medicine
moving more toward biology and really strong continued growth in monoclonal antibodies, we're in a great position to
serve that market.
And of course, if you look at what's happening in the emerging markets, especially in places like China and the need
for infrastructure, I think our solutions are ideally suited to that. So I see great opportunity for growth. From our
standpoint, GE infrastructure globally gives us such a great reach into the markets, especially as with places like China
and the Middle East and Latin America, the infrastructure of GE gives us a great backbone to actually reach into these
markets and do projects in difficult situations.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, thanks. And then, Jeff, as a follow-on, expressing confidence in the 7% organic for the year is
obviously encouraging given the headlines. But you clearly have the backlog in place, but you've talked about some
deferrals in 4Q, maybe 2015, in oil and gas and perhaps power. So I'm wondering to what extent are you concerned that
perhaps these delays might push into 2015 and, therefore, maybe 4Q comes in a bit weaker. So what gives you
confidence that you can get the 7% for the year?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I would circle back. I don't know, Jeff, why don't you – the power stuff is really the hub of, I
guess, our confidence. And I don't know, Jeff, if you want to...
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes, we have a fourth quarter in front of us that we think is going to be very strong. Just
for instance, year-over-year in the fourth quarter, our gas turbines shipments are going to be up more than 40% year
over year. Our wind shipments will be up more than 30% year over year; Aero shipments 16%. Even commercial and
military engines are going to be up mid-double digits, and we're looking for a 30% increase in locos year over year. So
we're looking at a fourth quarter that we think is going to be very strong, and we expect the Power business to be up
substantially in the fourth quarter.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: And this is stuff, Nigel, that's already sited and financed and in backlog and stuff like that.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes, for the most part, most of the gas turbines or 100% of the gas turbines are in backlog.
We're in good shape on wind. So a good part of the volumes that drives the fourth quarter, we stand pretty firmly on. I
would say, as I've said before, distributed power is the place where we've seen the most volatility, and based on the
places we're selling, I think that's going to continue to play out that way. But I think we feel good about a strong
revenue quarter in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: No, that's very helpful. And just a quick follow-on to that, so obviously, very strong equipment
orders – shipments in place for 4Q. Normally, that would dent margins, but you had service margins up so strong in this
quarter so I'm wondering could you maybe add some color on where you stick on margin 4Q as well?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: We continue to progress on where we expect to continue to progress on margins. We're on
this journey to 17% plus in 2016. We're 50 basis points up third quarter year-to-date and we expect to be on the
trajectory to get to 17% in 2016. So we'd expect to continue to progress.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I just think the tailwinds, the macro stuff SG&A is good, value GAAP is good and I think
the service productivity actually has good momentum as well.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Thanks, Jeff.

The next question comes from Steven Winoker. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: Thanks and good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: Hey. So, maybe just, it's been a little while now that you've been moving forward with
Alstom. How has your thinking continued to progress as time has passed? We've got another of quarter of information
behind us from Alstom and within your business. Where are you in the process and how are you thinking about the
opportunity now versus a few months ago?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Steve, here's what – again, we're just in the process itself. I mean, I think the regulatory stuff
is ongoing per schedule. We haven't seen anything that is a surprise. They are in the same markets out there that you
guys see every day, so some good, some bad on that, but not a big surprise there. And I would say synergies, the
opportunities for synergies are probably greater than what we would have expected and so we continue to work on that.
So, I think other than that, I don't really – there's not a lot more color I can add, Steve. I'll do more at the outlook
meeting on Alstom but I'd say we still like what we see. We still think there's good potential to run it as a combined
entity better.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: Okay. And then maybe just diving a little bit into the order price profile on – I think it's slide
three, obviously, pretty positive across most of those segments and then we saw yet another quarter were Healthcare
was negative and kind of used to that at this point and obviously you called out the positives in Life Science.
So maybe just continue to give us a little understanding – obviously, this must be within systems and kind of what's
happening. Is there any change here? How the Affordable Care Act you're seeing sort of play out so far and maybe are
you looking at this thing with a little more of a fresh eye these days? Just some thoughts on that front.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes, so I think healthcare has been, everything else being equal, reasonably consistent for
quite a long period of time. I mean, we've seen quarter-over-quarter year-over-year equipment pricing in the down 140
basis points roughly, 150 basis points in a point time. A little bit better on service. But I don't think we see anything
that would suggest that the dynamics around those product cycles, the market behavior around the price is changing.
So we're very focused on winning with technology and gaining share that way and as I said, we had a reasonably, for
the first time this year, we had a reasonably strong equipment market here in the U.S. for us, up 10%. We don't think
the market was up that so we need to win on technology and execution and I think the price dynamics of equipment and
imaging are what they are and I don't see anything changing there.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Steve, there's a little bit of healthcare that's on the high-tech learning curve so you get – our
CM rates are equal to or greater even sometimes when the price is down because we're getting the cost down in the
product as well. So it has a unique, I would say, visibility compared to some of our other products and technologies.

<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: So you got a big, obviously, a big equipment number coming through in the fourth
quarter. There will be a bit of the mix impact. I think you gave some color on the margin. It seems like it's going to be
up. Maybe if I just look at normal seasonality, which has been pretty consistent in the last two years, and profits, 3Q to

profit perspective, somewhere around low sixes at 6.1 type of number?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: We...
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Or will it be better than normal seasonality?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: No, we expect to be up obviously with the higher volume in the fourth quarter and we
expect to continue to build on the cost gains we've had throughout the year both in terms of SG&A and corporate costs.
So we're expecting an increase in profit and we expect to earn more in the fourth quarter for sure and we're expecting
strong double-digit revenue growth and we expect to continue to make progress on margins.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Right. So I guess will it be less than the 50 bps in the fourth quarter year-over-year? I
mean, it sound like the mix is going to be tough.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: We have a very heavy equipment quarter in the fourth quarter, for sure. But as I said, we
expect to make progress on margins for the year. We expect to stay on that trajectory to get to 17% plus in 2016. So
with 50 basis points in the third quarter, I would expect us to have decent year.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And then one last question on the turbine forecast for next year, you guys have
the orders, sales are a little bit higher, orders are a little bit lower. Can you still grow your turbine shipments next year
at this stage of the game?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Steve, when we do the outlook meeting in December, we'll give you a little bit more color
on what we're thinking about 2015. There's also going to be – there's starting to be, Steve, a higher mix on big units as
well so we'll try to spell that all out, but you definitely see the market mixing towards the bigger units.

Our next question comes from Deane Dray. Please go ahead.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Deane.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: On Synchrony, the timing of the split-off transaction, I know you're saying late 2015, it
depends on regulatory approvals but for modeling purposes what do you suggest that we be using?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: You're right. We were hopeful that we can get the exchange executed in late 2015. If I
were modeling next year, I think I would just model Synchrony in the year and change happening on 1/1 of 2016. We
can't tell you today exactly when in late 2015. I think for modeling purposes I would have it in for the year.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Great. That's helpful. And then showcasing life sciences today we talked a lot about growth.
Maybe you can share with us what the returns have been on these investments and I don't know if you can still trace
back to the returns on Amersham but maybe start there.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes, we've looked at that. If you go back, I believe Amersham was done in 2004. When
we go back and look at it, over the last roughly 10 years, in this business, we've collected about $10 million of cash.
Obviously, we had the Emerson investment, we had in several other investments along the way. We've got order of
magnitude $13 billion invested.
If you look at the business today at $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of EBITDA, we think the multiple, if you split it the
way Kieran described it, if you think about BioPharma and research as a very high multiple of EBITDA based on
transactions Merck and others have done; and the diagnostics business being a lower multiple business, lower growth,
lower margin. At 15.5 times those EBITDA numbers, you get a total value of call it – I'm sorry $27 billion, $17 billion
we've got today roughly $10 billion of cash collected versus the $13 billion we've got into it. You get something like a

Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Good morning, just a couple of quick ones. Jeff, you noted the unit outlook is a little
cloudier on energy now. I think the size of units are moving up, but I think the color in the quarter was thermal order
dollars were down but you had higher gigawatts in orders. Can you give us a little bit of color then? What's really going
on new unit pricing, and does that imply that these first H units really go out at very, very tough pricing?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Sure. So it's definitely a dynamic with the H. As we talked about, we've got 13 in backlog.
And we have some customers that are rethinking what otherwise might have been F-powered capacity with the
H-powered capacity. Generally speaking, one H unit will replace two F units.
So on the pricing front, the initial – these are launch orders, so the initial H orders are going to be tougher, no question
about that, and we'll get down the cost curve as quickly as possible. But I think generally speaking, we think the
technology has been incredibly well received, and we're where we thought we would be, if not better, given the early
2014 launch of the technology. So we feel like we're more competitive. We had a great quarter in the U.S., took 11
units [indiscernible] (56:17).
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I think the other dynamic, Jeff, that I would talk about, Jeff, is the mix of regions is
probably better, so the U.S. is probably the place where there's the most interest right now. And that has tended to be a
slightly better margin type region for us. So that's a positive.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: All right. I'm just trying to understand the disconnect between Power & Water order price
up 1.3% this quarter.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I got you. I'm sorry, Jeff. Yes, I got it. I'm sorry. The H turbines, because they're new,
they're not in the OPI number. There's no price to compare to last year.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I'm sorry, I misunderstood the question.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: You partially got what I wanted to know too, but there was a second element implied, so I
appreciate that. And then just maybe stepping back to the Milestone deal, maybe I wasn't thinking about it this way, but
focusing on the core and GE Capital, I didn't really think that meant M&A was on the table. I thought that was
probably more an organic idea. What is your appetite for M&A in Capital moving forward?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: So, Jeff, here's what I'd say. This is a strike-zone deal for what we do in GECAS. We know
how to do this. It's an operating lease business. It matches very well with our footprint geographically on where we
have resources and operating capabilities deployed. We know how to manage businesses like this that are very
asset-intensive, and we really like what the returns look like over time. It also lines up, like GECAS does, with our
Aviation business. So a very high percentage of this portfolio are GE-powered helicopters, and we think that provides a
lot of synergy. So we've been I think reasonably consistent saying that we were going to continue to grow our core
mid-market and industrially aligned verticals as we move forward. At the same time, we are very aggressively working
the $135 billion of non-strategic parts of the portfolio, and we've got a lot of things in motion there.

So I think the other way you need to think about it a bit is we've got capital available, and we'd rather deploy the capital
at very attractive returns than put the capital to work in a bank at a negative carry. So I think this makes all the sense in
the world, and I don't think in any way is it inconsistent with anything we or Keith [Sherin] have communicated.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from John Inch. Please go ahead.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Thanks, good morning, everyone. Just given the puts and takes in Power & Water between orders
and heavy shipments, and I know it's got such a big influence on cash flow. Jeff Bornstein, are we thinking that
operating cash here is going to be toward the lower end of $14 billion to $17 billion, or is it too close to call?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: As we sit here today, I would say we expect to be about the midpoint of the range. So
we've got a big fourth quarter in front of us, no question about it. If you think about last year, we did $5.5 billion of
CFOA Industrially in the fourth quarter. Based on the earnings improvement, what we expect to get from a working
capital improvement by liquidating all that inventory in the fourth quarter, we think we've got a path to be about
midpoint of the range between...
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: With much higher Industrial earnings, John, and much higher shipments. So we ought to
have a good fourth quarter, I'd say, on cash.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. And then FX, one of the dynamics of GE that makes you different is just you carry
high-value of your equipment versus other industrial companies. It could be for either of you. Does FX and the decline
of the euro and the yen, does that open a door to Mitsubishi and Siemens to really become much more aggressive on
the OE pricing that could influence a dynamic going forward? How are you thinking about it based on everything you
know so far?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I'd say, listen, a great part of our industrial footprint here is that we make product all over
the world. So we can be flexible about where we make product. If FX becomes that big an issue, we can be flexible
about where we make product. So I don't think we're anticipating FX being a competitive issue for us.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I would echo that, John. I think the dynamic is really one where we've got the right global
footprint to do whatever ultimately we need to do.
Operator
And our last question comes from Andrew Obin. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Hi, yes. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hi, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Just a question: you sort of highlighted H turbines being successful and some of your customers
are really looking into them. But you also said that it required some re-permitting. How disruptive could it be? And
could we see a pause in North American cycle because of that?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: No, I think – in North America, I think a lot of that planning is already underway. So I
would say, Andrew, not much. I think the whole product line is well positioned and it's great to have a large block
turbine, but we also are still seeing activity on the other turbines as well. So I think – I don't know, other than the 13,
we've got another 15 Hs that are out there kind of being...
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Globally.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Globally, which should enter the backlog sometime imminently. And so we're just seeing
pretty good momentum there. And I don't see it disrupting the, let's say, the flow from commitment to order to revenue.

<Q - Andrew Obin>: Sure, and if I could just squeeze one more in. Measurement and controls, could you just give us
a little bit more color how it's improving and where we are on the coal within that division?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: So the organic, we've done some dispositions there, Andrew, so I think the organic is up
mid-single-digits kind of range, 7%, something like that.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: And so we've seen that be pretty decent in the last quarter.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes, so I would say, excluding the disposition impacts, the M&C business has started to
turn a little bit organically. Orders in the third quarter were up 7%. Revenues, as I said in the script, were up 8%, and
they're getting some operating leverage. So we've seen a little bit more strength in oil and gas applications and
industrial applications around controls. And so we're hopeful that we're trending more positively here in the M&C
business. As you know, that's important. It's a very profitable business for oil and gas.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Matt, I want to just...
Matthew G. Cribbins
Sure.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
...before we cut off today, I think we talked a lot about execution in the quarter, but I wanted to elevate just a bit. We
really remain on track to get the company at 75% industrial, 25% GE Capital while growing EPS every year, this year,
next year and into the future. And I think in addition to the good execution in the quarter, the strategic moves the
company continues to make with Alstom, Appliances, re-mixing GE Capital, continues to make this a more valuable
company. So I think that's in addition to the current quarter operations. I think we're executing on the portfolio to create
a much more valuable company.
Matthew G. Cribbins
