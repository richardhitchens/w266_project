Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Baxter International's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to Miss Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations, at
Baxter International. Miss Ladone, you may begin.
Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations
Thanks, John. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Joining me today are
Bob Parkinson, CEO and Chairman of Baxter International, and Bob Hombach, Chief Financial Officer.
Before we get started, let me remind you that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook,
new product developments, and regulatory matters, contain forward-looking statement that involve risks and
uncertainties, and of course our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to
today's press release and our SEC filings for more details concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially.
In addition, in today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing
business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial matters being discussed today to the comparable
GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issue this morning and available on our website.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.
Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Mary Kay.

Good morning, and thanks for calling in this morning. We're pleased today to announce our financial results for the
first quarter and also to provide you with an update for our full-year 2011 outlook.
As you saw in our press release which was issued earlier this morning, EPS of $0.98 per diluted share exceeded
guidance for the quarter and increased 5% versus the prior year on an adjusted basis. This performance was the result
of better-than-expected sales and gross margin, operational leverage, and the benefit from our ongoing share repurchase
program.
First quarter sales growth, after adjusting for FX, was also up 5%, as growth improved on a sequential basis across
multiple product categories. And we benefited from the sales of our generic drug business, which we had expected to
divest in the first quarter, and therefore did not include in our original guidance for the year. We now expect to close
this transaction within the next few weeks.
While Bob will provide some more details on our first quarter financial performance in just a few minutes, I'm pleased
that our – that given our current outlook, we're in a position to raise our full-year sales and earnings guidance. Our
strong financial position continues to provide us the flexibility to invest in and pursue opportunities that expand our
diverse product portfolio with innovative products that save and sustain patient lives and position our company for
enhanced growth, always with an eye toward delivering increased value to our shareholders.
Innovation remains our most strategic imperative and will continue to be the driving force behind our future success.
Although R&D spending in the quarter was somewhat below the prior year, we do continue to fund all major R&D
programs and have made significant progress in advancing our pipeline over the last several years. I'd like to take a
moment just to update you on a few key programs and some recent highlights.
First, during the quarter, we submitted a Biologics License Application, or BLA, to the FDA for the U.S. approval of
TISSEEL fibrin sealant as a hemostatic agent in vascular surgery. This is an expansion beyond the current marketed
indications, and completes the necessary clinical requirements for a broad hemostasis label, which represents a very
significant opportunity for our Regenerative Medicine business.
Secondly, we announced approval in Europe of PREFLUCEL, a seasonal influenza vaccine utilizing our proprietary
Vero cell technology, under the mutual recognition process. The 13 participating European unit countries, including
Germany, Spain, United Kingdom, and the Nordic countries, will formally implement the license on national level,
making the vaccine available for the 2011 and 2012 influenza season.
And lastly, we continue to be successful in driving differentiation of GAMMAGARD LIQUID by offering various
dosage forms, enhancing delivery options, and expanding the number of indications. For example, we recently
introduced the first and only 30-gram dose vial for GAMMAGARD LIQUID in the United States. This new dosage
form is the most frequently prescribed dose for primary immune deficiency patients and enhances user convenience.
As you know, we're currently awaiting FDA approval for GAMMAGARD LIQUID [ph] Sub-Q, (5:01) which we
submitted to the agency last year. We continue to expect approval in the second quarter of this year, allowing us to
launch in the U.S. and participate in this fast-growing segment of the market.
In addition, late last year, we completed the Phase III clinical trial of HyQ, which allows for enhanced delivery of
GAMMAGARD LIQUID subcutaneously facilitated by recombinant human hyaluronidase. We're currently in the
process of preparing our submission for approval in both the U.S. and Europe, and expect to communicate final top line
results later this year.
As you know, Baxter is also conducting Phase III clinical trials exploring the use of GAMMAGARD LIQUID as a
therapy for two neurological conditions. The first is a trial for the treatment of multi-focal motor neuropathy, or MMN,
a neurological disorder characterized by progressive limb weakness. We completed enrollment in 2010 and expect to
conclude the trial later this year and submit for approval in 2012.
And finally, we continue to advance our Phase III trial for Alzheimer's. To date, we've randomized 330 patients and are
on track to complete enrollment by mid-2011. With an 18-month follow-up period, we currently expect to complete the
trial by the end of 2012. In addition, we plan to initiate a second confirmatory trial before the end of this year.

Also, our primary investigator, Dr. Norman Relkin, has now submitted a manuscript regarding the Phase II data for
consideration by a leading peer-reviewed journal, and if accepted, the manuscript will be published in the coming
months. These achievements depict just a handful of the programs in our pipeline that will present great opportunities
for Baxter in the years to come. I'm increasingly encouraged by the progress we continue to make, and we look forward
to updating you on additional R&D achievements throughout the year.
Before turning the call over to Bob, let me briefly comment on the announcement we made earlier this week regarding
the acquisition of Prism Pharmaceuticals, a specialty pharmaceutical company that has developed and received FDA
approval for multiple presentations of NEXTERONE, an antiarrhythmic agent amiodarone IV, including the first and
only ready-to-use premix IV formulation. Given that this drug is typically administered to patients in extremely
time-sensitive and critical care situations, the benefits of a ready-to-use premix IV form of NEXTERONE are clinically
significant. For this reason, we believe this unique product satisfies unmet clinical need, offers an opportunity to
expand the current market, and also has potential for application in additional geographies outside the United States.
This transaction demonstrates our intent of being more proactive on the business development front. It also exemplifies
the types of opportunities that we'll pursue, those that complement our existing portfolio and expand our
market-leading position, leverage our global footprint, channel, or customer relationships, capitalize on our core
scientific or manufacturing capabilities, and provide for low integration risk, which provides a higher confidence in
achieving success.
As always, I'd be happy to address any questions on these or other topics during the Q&A, but with that, I'd like to now
ask Bob to review our first quarter financial results in more detail and also our guidance for the rest of the year. Bob?
Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item for the quarter
before turning to our revised financial outlook for 2011.
Starting with sales, worldwide sales totaled $3.3 billion in the first quarter and increased 5%. Excluding foreign
currency, sales also increased 5%, which compares favorably to the guidance we provided of sales growth in the 2% to
3% range. This is the result of better-than-expected sales in Medical Products, partially due to the benefit of the generic
business that we were – that were not planned, as well as strong sales of antibody therapies.
In terms of individual business performance, beginning with BioScience, global BioScience sales of $1.4 billion
increased 3% in the first quarter. Excluding foreign currency, BioScience sales increased 4%. Within the product
categories, recombinant sales of $512 million were flat to the prior year, and excluding foreign currency, sales
increased 1%. Excluding the UK tender impact of approximately $20 million, total ADVATE sales growth was in line
with overall market growth of 6% to 8% on a global basis. We expect improved growth in the second half of the year
for the recombinant business as we begin to annualize the impact of the UK tender in the third quarter of 2011.
Moving on to plasma protein, sales in the quarter were $308 million and increased 5%. Excluding the impact of foreign
currency, sales increased 8%, which was result of very strong volume, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, for FEIBA,
albumin, and plasma-derived factor VIII. In antibody therapy, sales of $374 million increased 16%. Excluding foreign
currency, sales advanced 18% and continue to reflect the success we've had with our commercial strategies and a
benefit related to meeting demand previously served by Octapharma.
Volume growth globally of more than 20% was partially offset by the impact of our pricing touch-ups implemented last
year, and a 3 percentage point impact from the termination of the WinRho distribution agreement in mid-year 2010.
Sales in Regenerative Medicine, which includes our biosurgery products, totaled $140 million and increased 18% on
both a reported basis and after adjusting for foreign currency. These results reflect solid growth, particularly for
FLOSEAL, and a benefit of just over $10 million in incremental sales related to the ApaTech acquisition which was
completed in the – at the end of the first quarter last year. Excluding ApaTech, sales growth for the category was in

high single digits.
Finally, revenues in the Other category, which includes vaccine, totaled $74 million and were down 38%. In the
quarter, strong growth of the FSME vaccine was more than offset by the difficult comparison related to pandemic
revenues which were approximately $50 million in the first quarter of 2010.
As you know, last year we combined our medication delivery and renal businesses to form a new business, Medical
Products. This new organization aligns common areas of capability within Baxter while creating increased capacity to
pursue new growth opportunities. Going forward, we will be reporting the combined business as a new segment.
Total global sales in the first quarter for Medical Products were $1.9 billion, reflecting an increase of 6% on a reported
basis. After adjusting for foreign currency, sales increased 5%. Turning to the product categories, renal sales totaled
$587 million and increased 1% on a reported basis. Excluding foreign currency, sales declined 1%, as strong PD
growth, particularly due to continued momentum from patient gains in the U.S., Latin America, and Asia, was offset by
the expected loss of PD patients to another provider, and lower HD revenues.
Sales in the global injectables category increased 15%, to $517 million, and excluding foreign currency, sales increased
14%. Contributing to this performance was very strong growth in our contract manufacturing and compounding
businesses, as well as strong demand for MINI-BAGS and select premix drugs.
I'd also mention that the global injectables category includes the generic injectables business, with sales of
approximately $40 million in the quarter. As Bob mentioned earlier, we now expect to complete the divestiture of this
business to Hikma Pharmaceuticals during the second quarter.
IV therapy sales totaled $428 million and rose 9%. Excluding foreign currency, sales were up 10%. Double digit
growth in the U.S. was a result of share gains associated with the new Novation agreement, improved IV pricing, and
increased demand for a variety of nutritional products including greater customer adoption of CLINIMIX, our
proprietary dual chamber parenteral nutrition therapy.
Infusion system sales totaled $211 million and increased 1%, and were comparable to the prior year after adjusting for
foreign currency. Lower COLLEAGUE revenues were partially offset by improved sales of access sets and expanded
placements of the Spectrum pump.
Finally, anesthesia sales declined 7% and totaled $118 million in the quarter. This performance was driven by an
unexpected reduction in inventory levels by a major U.S. wholesaler as we finalize a fee-for-service agreement, and
competitive pricing pressures related to generic sevoflurane.
Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin for the company was 51% in the first quarter, which exceeded our
expectations and reflects a sequential improvement of 100 basis points versus the fourth quarter. Compared to the prior
year, gross margin was 90 basis points below last year's gross margin of 51.9%. Favorable mix and margin
improvements from across the portfolio and a modest benefit from foreign currency were more than offset by the
incremental costs associated with the Castlebar PD solution issue we discussed last quarter, and the impact from
manufacturing inefficiencies incurred in the plasma business during 2010.
SG&A total $716 million in the quarter and increased 5% versus the prior-year period. SG&A as a percent of sales was
21.8%, which is similar to last year. We continue to aggressively manage general, administrative, and discretionary
spending areas across the company and are beginning to recognize the benefits associated with the actions that we
discussed last quarter. However, as expected, these savings are more than offset by select investments in several key
promotional activities aimed at demand creation and new product launches, as well as incremental pension expense and
the pharmaceutical drug tax.
R&D spending of $214 million declined 6% in the quarter as investments in key R&D programs across the portfolio
were offset by lower milestone payments to partners, completed clinical work, and a modest impact from foreign
currency.

The operating margin in the quarter was 22.7%, 30 basis points lower than the prior year. Interest expense was $10
million, compared to $19 million last year. The reduction is primarily the result of higher-rate debt that matured in the
second half of 2010 and higher interest income.
The tax rate was 21.1% in the quarter, 210 basis points higher than last year's rate of 19%. This is in line with our
expectation and is the continued result of a change in earnings mix between higher-tax and lower-tax jurisdictions.
And finally, as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings per share increased 5% to $0.98 per diluted share, which
exceeded our guidance of $0.92 to $0.94 per share.
Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations was strong in the quarter and totaled $371 million, compared to $279
million in the first quarter of last year. Growth in cash flow can primarily be attributed to lower U.S. pension
contributions this year of $150 million, versus $300 million in the prior-year period. In addition, free cash flow of $173
million improved by $124 million versus the first quarter 2010. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $198 million,
versus $230 million in the prior-year period.
DSO ended the quarter at 56 days, which is higher than last year by three days. This is largely due to our international
country mix, as DSO in the U.S. remains at approximately 30 days.
Inventory turns of 2.4 improved year-over-year. This is primarily driven by improvement in BioScience with a
reduction in plasma inventories.
And lastly, during the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 12 million shares of common stock for $640 million,
or on a net basis, 9 million shares for approximately $510 million, in line with our objective.
Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our financial outlook for the second quarter and full
year 2011. First, for the full year, we now expect earnings per diluted share of $4.20 to $4.28.
By line item of the P&L and starting with sales, we expect full-year sales growth excluding foreign currency of 3% to
4%. We currently expect foreign currency to benefit sales growth by approximately 1 point. Therefore, we now expect
reported sales growth of approximately 4% to 5%. This outlook includes first quarter sales of approximately $40
million related to the generic injectables business, the divestiture which is expected to close in the second quarter. As a
reminder, full-year sales for this business totaled approximately $200 million in 2010.
For the full year, we now expect gross margin in the 51% to 51.5% range, a modest improvement over the gross margin
rate in 2010 of 51.1%.
We expect both SG&A and R&D to grow in low to mid single digits for the year. We expect operating margin to
improve modestly, as savings related to the optimization charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2010 and other mix
benefits more than offset cost inefficiencies in the plasma business, increased pension expense, and the impact of
pharmaceutical drug tax.
We now expect interest expense of approximately $75 million, and other expense, which includes non-controlling
interest, to total approximately $40 million.
Given our mix of earnings, we expect our tax rate to approximate 21% to 21.5%. And finally, we expect a full-year
average share count of approximately 575 million shares, which assumes approximately $1 billion in net share
repurchases.
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect cash flow from operations of approximately $2.8 billion. This
includes a 2011 pension contribution of $150 million, and an outflow of approximately $300 million related to the
execution of the COLLEAGUE consent order.
Now, to expand on the full-year sales assumptions for each of the businesses. First, on a constant currency basis, we
expect low single digit sales growth for the Medical Products business. Excluding the impact of generic injectables
divestiture, sales growth is expected to be mid single digits.

Within the product categories, we expect anesthesia sales growth in the low to mid single digits, infusion system sales
to be flat to down 2%, and IV therapy sales to grow in mid single digits. This category also includes parenteral nutrition
products which are expected to grow in high single digits. In addition, we expect global injectables sales to increase in
low single digits. Excluding the generics divestiture, we expect sales in this category to increase 10% to 12%. And for
renal, we expect sales growth in low single digits as lower HD revenues modestly offset low single digit growth in PD.
For BioScience, we now expect sales, excluding foreign currency, to grow in the 4% to 6% range. For the recombinant
business, we continue to expect growth for the full year to be in low to mid single digits, which includes the annualized
impact of the UK tender.
Second, we expect plasma protein and antibody therapy sales to increase in high single digits. I'd remind you that our
guidance assumes the return of Octapharma in the second half of the year, therefore antibody therapy sales growth will
moderate in the back half of 2011.
Third, we expect Regenerative Medicine sales to grow in low to mid teens. And finally, we expect the Other category
within BioScience to decline approximately 20%, reflecting a difficult comparison in the first quarter from pandemic
revenues recorded in 2010.
For the second quarter, as we mentioned in our press release, we expect earnings per diluted share of $1.01 to $1.03,
and sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of 4% to 5%. Based on current foreign exchange rates, we
expect reported sales to increase in the 6% to 7% range, reflecting a 2 percentage point benefit from currency.
Thanks, and now I'd like to open the call up for Q&A.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Thank you. Can you hear me okay?
Operator
We can hear you loud and clear.
<A - Robert Parkinson, Jr.>: If you can just – yeah, that's better, Mike. Go ahead.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. Thanks, appreciate it. Just couple clarification questions first maybe. The $40
million in generic injectables sales that you reported this quarter, do you think that the Street had backed out that full
business at this point? I mean, I think we had, just wasn't sure whether you thought consensus had already taken that
business out of the model?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I'll have Mary Kay answer that. Go
ahead.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Yeah, Mike, I think for the most part, given that our guidance excluded it, we had expected
to close it in the first quarter, that most of the models had taken out the generic injectable business.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. And then one other. You're raising your earnings guidance for the year, but you're
not raising the cash flow guidance. Can you just comment on that?
<A - Robert Hombach>: Yeah, I mean, that's something we continue to take a look at, and given that COLLEAGUE,
as we indicated, is a pretty big driver as we execute on the consent order, depending on how that plays out, we could

see some upside to that approximately $2.8 billion guidance that we've given to date.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. And then I'll go ahead and ask the question you're going to get probably three or four
times, which is, Bob, do you just want to comment on how you think the octagam return, whenever that does occur in
Europe and the U.S., how you think that will influence the market, not necessarily just the back half of this year, but as
we go out 12 months?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I don't know. It's probably difficult
to speculate, Mike. I think their share globally was what, Mary Kay, roughly 11%? Is that about right?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: Right. Low double -
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: That's where it's -
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Right.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, it's just low double digits, as you
know. So it's meaningful, but it's – in the context of the global market, Mike, it's not that significant. I do think that any
time there's a quality-related issue, I think it's realistic to assume the customers are going to be somewhat more
thoughtful about how they jump in and so on. So we'll see how it all plays out. As Bob described in his comments,
we're assuming mid-year relaunch. What the scale of capabilities are going to be at their end I think is also speculative
at this stage. But I do think customers are going to be thoughtful before they just jump back in the boat. So we'll see.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. I'll let some others jump in. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay, Mike. Thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
David, your line's open. Could you try pressing your mute button possibly.
<Q>: Hey, this is actually [ph] James (25:22) in for David.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, [ph] James (25:23).
<Q>: First question is on how growth trends should be developing through the year. Clearly there are a couple of
different growth and margin headwinds in 2011. But as you walked through last quarter, it seems like most of these fall
more in the first half than in the second. If I look at guidance, though, it looks like EPS growth is actually expected to
be declining a little bit in the second half versus the first half? I don't know, maybe some of this is related to the return
of the competitor to the market in the second half, but is there anything that I'm missing here? And how much do you
think this reflects conservatism about the back half of the year, versus just very strong results in the first quarter?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, let me start by – and maybe all three
of us can think about this, because I think there's a lot of moving parts. Obviously, as we move out of the second
quarter, given our assumption on Octapharma relaunch, as we – and then as we move into the fourth quarter where we
had volume from Octapharma last year, that makes the year-to-year comps more challenging in that regard. So that's
one item. Bob, Mary Kay, what are some of the other pieces?
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, and just to build on the
Octapharma thing for a moment. Given the long lead cycles in this business, we are going to be thoughtful about how
we manage throughput in anticipation of them coming back in the market. We've seen very strong demand for our
products in the first quarter. We're going to continue to support that demand, but again, be thoughtful. So we're
tempering our growth and our – thoughts in the back half of the year related to IVIG related to the Octa situation.

And I think at this stage of the game, in any year, as Bob mentioned, there's always puts and takes. And so, we did see
some slight benefit in the quarter from retaining the generics business, that we expect to close that divestiture here very,
very shortly. So in terms of run-rate, we'd have to make a slight adjustment for that, and I think a little bit of
conservatism as well, given that we've just got one quarter under our belt here for 2011.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: The other thing I would say, James, is that
we're clearly expecting our R&D to ramp up in the second half of the year. The fact that the first quarter R&D spending
was below last year, in some ways was as much of a kind of a timing artifact as anything. As I mentioned in my
comments, obviously all of our important programs continue to be funded, and our strategic intent is to continue to
grow R&D. So that, too.
So again, a number of moving parts, from the R&D ramp-up, to the Octapharma, and so on. And as Bob said, first
quarter of the year, start off well, we're pleased, but we still got a long ways to go, in an environment which continues
to be turbulent, and so on. So I think those are all factors that we dialed into our thinking.
<Q>: Okay, that's very helpful.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay.
<Q>: Second question's just on HyQ. Obviously we're getting a little bit closer to the launch there. Was there anything
you can tell us in terms of how you're thinking about speed of launch after approval, how that might go in terms of
share ramp, and any type of extra infrastructure required there?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we're still a ways from launch, as
you know. As I mentioned, our – we continue to expect to file for approval in the third quarter in both the U.S. and the
EU, and again, I don't want to speculate on what the turnaround time would be on approval, but clearly it's sometime in
2012, and more likely in the latter half of 2012, all things considered. So we're still a little bit away from the launch.
I think, given the sales force expansion that we put in, predominantly in the U.S. last year, focused on GAMMAGARD
promotion targeted at underdiagnosis of primary immune deficiency and so on, we have then in our base really SG&A
resources and the commercial resources and so on. I think that we can adequately promote HyQ later on next year when
hopefully we get approval.
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: And I would just add,
operationally, recognize that HyQ is going to be essentially our 10% GAMMAGARD LIQUID product with kitted
with hyaluronidase from Halozyme. So switching over from regular to HyQ is going to be very straightforward from us
from a production and logistics standpoint.
<Q>: Okay. And then one just last one, on Castlebar. Maybe I missed this earlier, but you broke out the impact
financially last quarter. It seems like this still having impact on margins. Can you give us a sense of just how material
that was this quarter and how that should progress through the year?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, go ahead.
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, it was a fairly significant
impact in the first quarter. It's about $25 million in margin. And we continue to service those customers in Europe from
production facilities around the world and incurred some pretty significant freight. We've been able to somewhat
normalize our inventory levels, and while we do expect to incur some additional costs here in the second quarter as we
look to try to resolve that issue, it won't be quite at the same rate of negative impact that we saw in the first quarter. But
$25 million in the first quarter is what we absorbed.
<Q>: Okay, thanks. I'll jump back in queue.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks, James.

Larry Keusch of Morgan Keegan is on – of – is on the line with a question. Please state your question.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Hey, yeah. Good morning, guys.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Larry.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Just a very quick housekeeping. On the U.S. injectables business, you obviously mentioned
the $40 million in revenues. Did that have any contribution to earnings?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Not much.
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Very low. As you know, this is
a very low margin business for us. Very low.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Okay. Yeah, great. That's what I had thought. Okay, just two questions for you guys. First
off, as we think about the future and how you guys think about a fractionation capacity for IVIG, it is my understanding
that you guys haven't shut down the Glendale facility as you've moved production into LA frac, and I just wanted to get
some sense of kind of how you're thinking about that older facility, what the plans are there.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. Yeah, several aspects to that.
Obviously our long-term outlook for the growth of the plasma protein business continues to be very positive. And then
that's further augmented by the new product introductions, including HyQ, and new indications, and then of course the
bigger issue of Alzheimer's. So this question that you ask, Larry, of capacity clearly has been front and center for us for
awhile.
We have flexibility within our global manufacturing footprint today, between Vienna and Rieti, our two European
locations, and then in LA. We've kept old LA frac, if you want to use that term, in operation somewhat longer perhaps
than we had earlier anticipated, but I will tell you, one of the things we're evaluating now, given our projections of
longer-term demand, and to put ourselves in a position where we can be flexible for additional demand for new
products, such as HyQ and Alzheimer's and so on, we're evaluating the merit of making investment to keep at least
some of old LA frac in operation for an extended period of time, okay?
The other thing I would say is that we also have and continue to evaluate the merits of a new greenfield site at some
point, which, candidly, we think is inevitable in the coming years. We spend a lot of time thinking about how we could
do that on a modular basis. But I think both of those variables are things that we are now contemplating in this equation
of long-term capacity.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Okay. And Bob, just on that one, and then I got one other quick one -
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: – but it sounds like on LA frac, at least old L.A. frac, I should say, it sounds like you haven't
really committed any meaningful CapEx at this point, although perhaps maybe there is some -
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, we haven't, but – just to – we likely
will.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Yeah.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Because it is an older facility, and if we're
going to keep it in production for the foreseeable future, we're going to need to make some investments there. But
obviously, there'll be a nice return on those investments, given the underlying demand and what we're trying to support
here.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Okay, great. And then the last question, again sort of more strategic, is, you guys continue to
do a great job with your cash generation. Obviously the free cash flow was up meaningful year-over-year. Your

debt-to-total-cap is in the low double digit range, kind of 12ish percent. And you've been sort of talking about business
development and a share repurchase for awhile. You're obviously doing some of the share repurchase, but again, just
given the leverage ratios of the company and the free cash flow generation, what's impeding you from doing more?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: In terms of more -
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Either more BD -
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: More deals?
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: – or greater share repurchase, yeah.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, again, the – Bob can comment on
this, I mean, you're very familiar with our capital allocation framework. That remains unchanged. Frankly, we would
like to direct more dollars to business development opportunities. We're pleased that we were able to close the Prism
deal recently. This is going to be a nice opportunity for us. The – NEXTERONE could be I would say globally
somewhere in the range of a $150 million, $200 million product. It – high margins, and we need – and it's why I
commented in my prepared comments today, Larry, on this. I think this is the kind of deal that we want to do more of,
like the ApaTech deal we did last year. I'd like to do a handful of these kinds of deals every year, and I'd like to deploy
more of our cash toward those kinds of things that can accelerate our growth going forward.
And I think our whole BD momentum actually is accelerating. We got a number of deals in the hopper that we're
evaluating. But this quick answer to your question is what's constraining us is probably our discipline not to do bad
deals, and make sure we are very discerning in the kind of things that we pursue. But I believe that those opportunities
do exist. I believe, going forward, we will do more of them, and it will be again within the framework that we've
discussed with you all many times.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Right. And I do recognize that obviously a huge chunk of your cash is sitting overseas, so I
get that as well.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank's on the line with a question. Please state your question.
<Q>: Hi. It's actually [ph] Catherine (36:10) for Kristen. I just have a couple of quick questions. A slight increase in
gross margins, and the guidance. Can you just break down the different components? How much of that is FX versus
the others?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Bob, why don't you handle that? There's a
lot of moving parts.
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure. Sure. As we mentioned,
we did absorb within margin a pretty big hit related to the Castlebar issue. The pension issue which we talked about last
quarter does affect both margin and SG&A, so year-over-year, that's a drag on margin.
We did see positive mix benefits, as some of our higher-margin product lines grew faster in the quarter, including
nutrition products as we mentioned, biosurgery. IVIG has slightly higher than average corporate margin, so we did see
some mix benefits that offset that.
The FX benefit I mentioned is a modest benefit. As we've talked about in the past, we have a fair amount of natural
hedge, given our manufacturing footprint around the world and our – the on-the-ground nature of many of our

operations in countries around the world. So we have a fair amount of local expense we incur that offsets some of that.
We do some hedging at a corporate level for the major currencies. And so any impact on FX tends to be fairly muted.
As emerging market currencies have appreciated, though, pretty significantly here over the last several months,
particularly Latin America, some Eastern European and emerging Asia countries, we do get a slight benefit from that,
because we do not hedge. We do have some local expenses, but we tend not to hedge in those locations because it's
difficult to make it cost effective. But again, it's a modest impact, not significant.
<Q>: Okay. Thanks. And then, on upcoming tenders in Europe for recombinant, could we see another shift like we did
last year?
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No. At this point, there are no
significant upcoming tenders in Europe, on the magnitude of the UK tender certainly. A smaller tender later this year in
Ireland is really the only one.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: [indiscernible] (38:16) I think early – I
think 2013.
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It's now in early 2013?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's the only other – yeah.
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, and as we said in the
past, the vast, vast majority of our global [ph] assay (38:24) franchise is not subject to tenders.
<Q>: Okay. And then the last one, in anesthesia, the unexpected reduction inventory. How should we look at the
impact for the rest of the year?
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, as we said, I mean, we're
working to finalize the fee-for-service agreement with the distributor that we mentioned, and certainly, to the extent
we're success in doing that which we expect we will be, we should see a normalization in volume as we move
throughout 2011.
<Q>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We're looking at mid single digit
anesthesia growth I think for the rest of the year.

David Roman of Goldman Sachs is on the line with a question. Please state your question.
<Q - David Roman>: Good morning, everybody. Want to just come back to your comment on IVIG. I think you'd said
that volume was up 20% against reported constant currency growth of 18%. I'm assuming that that's volume for Baxter
as a corporation. Could you maybe sort of articulate what you see is going on in the end-user markets? Are – on a
global basis, maybe looking at U.S. and international, are you seeing similar trends in the overall market that you are in
your business and your business is being amplified by benefits from Octapharma? Or is the benefit from Octapharma
contributing the bulk of the improvement in your business?
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, I'll direct a – our view is
that the market in the U.S. continues to be in the mid single digits from a ongoing growth perspective, and then markets
outside the U.S. growing at higher single digits. And as we look at the quarter and adjust for Octapharma and this
WinRho effect that we talked about, we're still looking at 9% growth for the IVIG franchise, with the impact of some

price from the touch-up strategy we implemented in the back half of 2010. So given that we're clearly growing faster
than the market. Even adjusting for Octa, we do feel like we've made good progress there.
<Q - David Roman>: Okay. And then maybe follow up on the gross margin. Clearly, I think, better than what most
people were looking for this quarter at 51%. And you're sort of guiding to a slight improvement as we head through the
course of the year.
What are sort of the puts and takes on the gross margin line? Obviously currency has got – the dollar has weakened
over the course of the first quarter and actually throughout the year. Does it – on an underlying basis, would the
improvement in gross margin through the back half of the year be greater than what you're going to report because of
currency?
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: As I mentioned, the impact of
currency is fairly modest, but given where we're at today, given the strength of many currencies versus the U.S. dollar,
it would be a slight benefit going forward. Again, we factored some of that into our guidance certainly. But it's not
going to be a material impact to us.
<Q - David Roman>: Okay. And then lastly, when you adjust for some of the puts and takes this quarter on the
recombinant [ph] trend (41:20) tender or the inclusion of the generic injectables business, it looks like the – you're still
sort of running the 4% to 5% organic growth range, which is certainly higher than you've put up the past several
quarters.
But do you – I think a year ago, on this same conference call, you had talked about revisiting sort of the long-range
plan. Is there any update on when we might sort of hear more about your revised sort of long-term targets?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, we're – David, this is Bob
Parkinson. We're evaluating that. We may do something before the end of the year. Not as formal as perhaps we've
done in the past. Maybe a conference call or something like that.
We're still knocking that around. We realize there's a desire to get some line of sight in terms of our longer-term
outlook. We clearly have, recently, as we do every year, a very detailed long-range financial plan.
As I think I've commented previously though, I think given some of the dynamics in the external environment, the one
thing I'm sensitive to is, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. So I just want to continue to monitor the external
environment, both the economic environment as it relates to underlying demand for our products, and certainly
healthcare reform initiatives that are not, as you know, unique to the U.S. and manifest themselves in a lot of ways in
countries around the world.
So we are sensitive to a desire, though, for you all to get more visibility. And like I say, we may do something later in
the year. If we do, it'll be maybe a in-depth conference call or something like that. So – but we haven't made a final
decision on that, but we are sensitive to doing that before too long.
<Q - David Roman>: Okay. That's great. Thank you very much.

<Q - Matt Miksic>: Hi. Thanks for taking all of our questions this morning. Just a follow-up on the Octa question and
when they're coming back. I wanted to just clarify, first, your guidance assumptions in the back half.
Has it been your planning assumption that they come back with a full supply, sort of bringing 11% share's worth of
product back to the market? Or is this something that you'd expected or built into guidance as more of a slow build over

<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well of course, we don't really have a true
line of sight into that. I think given the nature of production of plasma proteins. Augmented by the fact that I think you
know that some of the plasma suppliers to Octapharma had redirected their plasma and sold that to other fractionators,
including ourselves, by the way. I don't think as practical matter there's a scenario that is like turning on a light switch,
okay?
But on the other hand, we don't have any insight in terms of what they've been manufacturing over the last number of
months in anticipation of kind of breaking the regulatory logjam, for lack of a better way to describe it. So we've
assumed retention of a little bit of that business in the second half, but – on a volume basis.
So that – Matt, that's probably the best I can do. I mean, I'm – at this stage, I'm kind of speculating.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Okay, and that's helpful. And then the – from the market, on that same topic, in the wake of the
Octa being withdrawn from the market in Europe and U.S. -
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: – have you gotten the sense that hospitals, tenders, any of those things are sort of being looked at
or considered in a different way, given the risk of having another supplier having a similar issue? Or are customers
looking at suppliers differently in the back of that event?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, look, this is a business that, going
back over many years, has encountered, on behalf of a number of the participants, regulatory issues. Okay? It's part of
the nature of the business when you're dealing with human proteins.
And every time there's an event like this, I do think that customers evaluate and really assess the value of a
high-quality, sustainable supplier, and dial that into their thinking, in terms of, do they tender, do they contract? If they
contract, what's the terms of the contract? And so on.
And I do think that the recent event with Octapharma, not unique to the U.S., I think around the world, clearly has
stimulated thinking about, gee, is there a way to contract with manufacturers in a way that we're not subject to the kind
of volatility and risk in terms of supply? I – that's just natural.
But I think at this stage, most of that is just kind of anecdotal. We'll see how it plays out.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: And one last follow-up on recombinant and the UK tender there. We've been sort of working
through that – annualizing that tender impact last year. On the back of that – or first, if you could remind us when we
come out from underneath that comp?
And then also, on the back of that, is that a market that is in sort of the mid single digits currently? Is it in the low
single, is it in the mid to upper, when you start again performing at what's a – what's more like a market growth rate?
That'd be helpful.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Talking about globally, Matt?
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Yeah.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, well – yeah. I mean, the UK tender,
is the first part of your question, on the timing. I mean, fundamentally we come out of it in the third quarter. I don't
know exactly when in the – on the comps.
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, no, I think the full impact
of the UK tender -

Rick Wise with Leerink Swann is on the line with a question. Please state your question.
<Q - Danielle Antalffy>: Hi, good morning, guys. It's Danielle in for Rick. How are you?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good, Danielle. How are you?
<Q - Danielle Antalffy>: Good. Good, thank you. Just a follow-up on David's question on the gross margins. Thinking
longer-term, how quickly can you guys get back to sort of the 2009 52%-plus levels? And then following up on that,
what are the puts and takes that can get you there faster, versus slower?
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think we – as we've talked
about in the past, we continue to see opportunities to expand both gross and operating margins going forward. The
company generated significant improvement in both those metrics from 2004 through 2009. The pace at which – we're
not going to be able to match that as we go forward from this point, but we do see opportunities to continue to improve
that.
So without putting a timeline on it, it is something that, even in the midst of what you see as a difficult quarter related
to the Castlebar issue we absorbed, the pension expense increase and so on, we still see the opportunity, through
growing our higher-margin businesses faster, to continue to drive some positive mix benefit there.
So going forward we will improve gross margins I do believe, but don't want to put a timeframe on how fast getting
back to 2009 levels. The world was very different in 2009. That's pre-U.S. healthcare reform, pre-austerity measures in
Europe, and so on. So that's something we'll continue to work through here, and as Bob mentioned, we'll think about
providing some longer-term view on that perhaps later this year.
<Q - Danielle Antalffy>: Okay, great. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. On the Medical Products division,
can you talk about where you are with integrating med delivery with renal? And sort of when we can expect to see a
real impact to both the top and bottom line? How quickly, what level of impact? And then one quick renal follow-up
after that.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. Well, on the Medical Products
piece, Danielle, it is our belief that there will be – there's not going to be a big ta-dah moment there in terms of impact.
This is continuous improvement.
And getting back to the primary motivation of integrating those two businesses and combining them had more to do
with enhancing product development timelines and improving effectiveness in a number of areas. It was not certainly

exclusively – in fact not even primarily a cost reduction effort, okay, in terms of structural cost and so on.
Now having said that, there is meaningful opportunity there, it's something that will impact us and roll out over time.
But I would not expect to see some big announcement there about a big chunk of structural costs that we're taking out
and some kind of organizational announcement and so on. It's going to be of an evolutionary nature, not a dramatic
nature like that.
But I will tell you, over the next five years, in a lot of different ways, we believe the combination of those businesses –
back to your earlier question about margin improvement – will be helpful to bolster gross margin growth.

<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay, on the first, I mean, we're going into
the clinic with home hemo in the – in mid-year, so I mean, within a matter of months. And then the second part of the
question was what? Why don't you guys take that, I don't -
<A - Robert J. Hombach, Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, so you mentioned the PD
drivers in the U.S. So absent the Fresenius issue, I think we had previously mentioned that they have been a customer
of ours in the U.S. for PD and had taken the decision to transfer their patients onto their own therapy.
We've largely absorbed that issue here, maybe a bit more in the second quarter. Absent that though, we are seeing
strong U.S. PD patient growth as a result of the change in reimbursement here in 2011, and are very pleased with that.
But we will have at least one more quarter of issue there as the last few patients are transferred over.
<Q - Danielle Antalffy>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thanks, John. We have time for one more
question.
Operator
Okay. Our final question is from Rajeev Jashnani with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Rajeev.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: I had a question on the recombinant factor VIII market in the U.S. And just looking at PPTA
data over the past 6, 12 months on a rolling basis, it looks like it's in sort of the low single digit range. And I was just
wondering if you could provide some updated thoughts on the state of that market and whether you might anticipate
some acceleration, and perhaps touch on the macroeconomic sensitivity in that market?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think the PPTA data's pretty much
in line with what we commented on in terms of mid single digit market. Mary Kay, why don't you expand on that.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: Right, yeah. Yeah, Rajeev, I think the
12-month rolling average in PPTA I believe is at around 4%, which is in line with what we call mid single digit range,
4% to 5%. And remember, too, we did do destocking in the back half of the year, so PPTA growth would be impacted
by that as well.
So the market, net of our destocking, is probably growing a little bit faster.

<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Okay. And then is that about the rate you would expect to see going forward, or is there [ph]
increasing – (53:32)
<A - Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yeah. Yeah, no, as Bob commented, we
believe that the global market is growing in 6% to 8% range, with the U.S. growing at a slower rate, more like 4% to
5%, and international markets growing at a faster rate.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Thanks.
