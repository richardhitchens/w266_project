David P. Abney
Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results that
demonstrate the power of UPS's diversified business model.
Again, this quarter, the International segment led the way. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit
operating profit growth. The U.S. Domestic business is growing operating profit on higher B2C demand. Supply Chain
& Freight continue to execute in a challenging macro environment.
Turning to the economy. The consumer market in the U.S. remains healthy, and e-commerce forecasts have been
elevated for 2016. And we are seeing that growth. On the other hand, our B2B volume is affected by the continuing
weakness in industrial production. In fact, global GDP and industrial production growth forecasts have been
downgraded slightly. Delayed inventory drawdowns and soft export demand likely will remain headwinds in the latter
part of 2016. Additionally, we are mindful of the current political commentary on trade. Increased trade not only
bolsters business, but also produces jobs here in the U.S. and abroad.
Historically, following ratification of trade deals, we have seen about a 20% increase in U.S. exports to the countries
involved. UPS is a steadfast proponent of trade, and supports agreements that minimize friction in the global supply
chain. Trade legislation to accelerate economic expansion, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, is vital to the health of the
U.S. economy. We encourage our political leaders to support and pass pending trade legislation.
Turning to our business, the strategic initiatives implemented over the last two years are ensuring we remain on track to
achieve our long-term financial goals. We continue investing in four priority areas. We are adding network capacity,
achieving greater efficiency through technology, deploying industry-specific solutions, and expanding in high-growth
markets. In Europe, we have completed about one-fourth of the projects associated with our $2 million capital
investment plan. During the second quarter, we announced new automated facilities in Belgium and France.
In addition, we began an extensive program that would dramatically improve time and transit in our intra-Europe
ground network, with some trade lanes improving by as much as two business days. The majority of the benefits of
these investments are still ahead of us, and will guarantee our position as a market leader in Europe for many years to
come.
We're also investing heavily in our U.S. operations, and in a few minutes, Richard will update you on our technology
and capacity projects. A pillar of our strategy in the U.S. is deploying industry-leading e-commerce capabilities that
help online retailers take advantage of consumer trends.
We recently released the fifth annual U.S. Pulse of the Online Shopper study that highlights some of these changing
trends. This year's survey revealed that most shoppers prefer home delivery, while also expressing an interest in an
alternative delivery location. To provide more delivery options, UPS is expanding our Access Point locker program in
several major U.S. markets. These automated pick-up locations augment our more than 8,000 existing U.S. retail
locations, and the more than 25,000 Access Points worldwide. We're providing more convenient alternatives for urban
online shoppers.
New technology features were also introduced for the 24 million My Choice users in the U.S. For example, members
can now use the Follow My Delivery feature to track their package using real time maps. These new capabilities are

unique solutions to create value for our customers, and further differentiate their online offering.
Our investments are broad-based and targeted for the needs of customers in multiple industries. This quarter, we
announced a specialized set of global services for healthcare companies performing clinical trials. And in Europe, we
expanded our field stocking locations for medical device distributors. UPS health care customers are gaining additional
alternatives for shipping their sensitive materials globally with the assurance of our guaranteed services.
UPS also launched a market-leading partnership with SAP and Fast Radius to support end-to-end 3D printing solutions.
This capability is linked to more than 60 UPS store locations and the urgent delivery capabilities of the UPS network.
This partnership is enabling UPS to expand into an adjacent market with great growth potential.
We entered another adjacent industry in 2015 with the acquisition of asset-light truckload brokerage services of Coyote
Logistics. The combination of Coyote's capabilities and the UPS's integrated network is providing customers with
unmatched flexibility. Next month will mark the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. The synergies and
procurement, asset utilization, and cross-selling remain on track to achieve our 2017 targets. In fact, cross-selling has
already produced several great wins.
Before I turn it over to Richard, I want to take a moment to recognize a milestone, we will achieve in August. UPS
marks our 40th year in Germany and our entrance into Europe. Over that time, our business has matured rapidly, and
the European operations have become a cornerstone for our integrated network. Today, we operate in every European
country, generating more than $6 billion in annual revenue, using our best in class Pan-European network.
The expansion in Europe, and the growth of our business around the world, are made possible through the hard work
and dedication of UPSers. As our strong momentum carries into the second half of the year, I want to thank all of our
employees around the globe for helping make and maintain UPS as the market leader.
Now, Richard will review the financial highlights.
Richard N. Peretz
Thanks, David. The second quarter operating results demonstrate the value of our flexible business model, as we had
another solid quarter. Additionally, we are seeing high growth in the e-commerce and healthcare sectors, while the LTL
and forwarding markets remain challenged. Even with these dynamics, currency neutral revenue growth increased 4%,
while fuel surcharges were a drag of around 120 basis points.
Second quarter earnings per share were in line with expectations. Our performance reflected the gains from our
investment strategies despite the mixed macro environment. The International segment outperformed while U.S.
Domestic was on target. And, finally, Supply Chain & Freight was slightly below expectations.
Now for details by segment. U.S. Domestic revenue increased 2.4%, as lower fuel surcharges reduced total revenue
growth by about 100 basis points. Average daily volume increased 2.5% led by Next Day Air products which were up
about 6%. The Next Day Air gains were produced by customers of all sizes. Demand was consumer based, as more
online retailers are providing faster delivery options to stay competitive.
During the quarter, ground products increased 2.4% over last year. As B2C expansion outpaced B2B by more than 5 to
1.
Base rates accelerated slightly from last quarter. Lower fuel surcharges reduced yield growth by about 100 basis points.
The higher base rates were able to compensate for some of the changes in product and customer mix.
Operating profit increased about 3%. And operating margin expanded to 13.7%. Enhanced productivity and lower fuel
cost resulted in operating cost per piece decline 0.2%.
Once again, we are seeing good improvements in our daily operating statistics, despite the fact that delivery stops were
up over 3%, ORION lowered driver miles by 0.3%. In addition, overall productivity gains continued, as direct labor

hours grew less than the volume.
Our investment in ORION is bending the cost curve, and we remain on track to complete phase 1 implementation later
in 2016. We are continuing our multi-year investment strategy in hub automation in the U.S. operations. So far in 2016,
we have announced new projects in California, Colorado, Illinois, and Texas. These facilities are adding increased
capacity and improved productivity.
Now, turning to the international segment, which had another remarkable quarter with operating profit expanding more
than 11%. On a two-year stacked basis, operating profit is up more than 30%. Export daily volume increased almost
4%, as improvements in all international regions offset slower U.S. exports. Europe lead the way with significant gains
in cross-border products and export growth to all regions of the world. In fact, the Europe to U.S. Lane grew at
double-digit pace this quarter.
Cycling out of the revenue management initiatives that we started in the last half of 2015, we are seeing good non-U.S.
domestic daily shipment growth, which is up 4.5%, while, at the same time, currency neutral revenue per piece
increased 1%. We saw higher base rates; however, they were offset by changes in product and trade lane mix.
Currency neutral revenue for the segment increased 1.5%. The lower fuel surcharge did impact revenue growth by
about 170 basis points. The cost and productivity improvements held operating expenses down during the quarter. As a
result, operating margin expanded to 19.9%. The International segment had a record second quarter, with its highest
second quarter delivery volume, operating profit and one of the best margins ever.
Now, let's turn and look at Supply Chain & Freight. Total revenue increased more than 13% due to the addition of
Coyote Logistics. The new truckload brokerage revenue offset tonnage shortfalls in international forwarding and the
U.S. LTL business.
Freight forwarding revenue and operating profits declined as we wrapped last year's rate actions. Cargo capacity
continues to outpace demand, contributing to the weak market conditions I mentioned earlier. Expansion of the buy/sell
rate and cost containment efforts led to the operating margin expansion. The unit remains focused on growing the more
profitable middle market.
In the distribution unit, we experienced strong revenue growth in the healthcare, aerospace and automotive sectors this
quarter. In fact, this quarter, healthcare became the top revenue sector within the contract logistics business.
Distribution operating profit jumped more than 10%. And the margin expanded. The UPS Freight business remains
disciplined on pricing, with revenue per hundredweight up 3%. The units' execution of revenue quality initiatives is
driving higher shipment yields. Total tonnage was lower by about 10%, due, in part, to the weak LTL market
conditions.
Now, to update you on our cash position, for the six months ended June 30, UPS generated $3.7 billion of free cash
flow, a 13% increase over last year. And this was after spending $1 billion on CapEx. The company paid just over $1.3
billion in dividends, an increase of almost 7%. In addition, we purchased over 13 million shares for more than $1.3
billion. Combined, we are on schedule to meet our return to shareholders goals we set for the year.
Looking at the rest of the year, our strong International performance and the return on investments we are making in
our network, give us confidence in our ability to achieve our full-year earnings guidance of $5.70 to $5.90 per share.
As I discussed in February, we expect 2016 operating profit by quarter to follow the same pattern as it did in 2015. We
still expect the fourth quarter operating profit growth to be above our annual guidance, somewhere between 9% and
11%. The additional work day between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the continued strength in e-commerce, and our
strategic investments position us well for another solid fourth quarter.
Looking at the segments, in the U.S. Domestic, we expect strong fourth quarter results. However, we will face tough
comparisons in the third, as a result of one less operating day and lower worker's compensation cost last year.
Therefore, we anticipate third quarter operating profit to be relatively flat year-over-year.

For the International segment, we expect to continue into the second half of the year the progress we've made, with
operating profit growth in the 8% to 12% range. The Supply Chain & Freight segment is where we anticipate the
current market trends in International air freight and the U.S. trucking markets to remain soft. In addition, lower fuel
surcharges will weigh on reported revenue growth. Therefore, total annual revenue growth for the segment should be
around 10%.
Now, let's look at taxes. The faster growth of our profits from the International segment means that we'll have a slightly
lower tax rate in 2016.
In summary, UPS's financial performance this year clearly demonstrates the value of our diverse business. We are
embracing the opportunities created by the evolution of the global e-commerce marketplace as it expands beyond a
traditional retail base. We continue investing in strategic technologies, systems and expanded capacity, and by our
execution, we are strengthening our leadership position. At the halfway point of the year, our business is responding
well to the changing macro environment, and we are confident about the remainder of 2016.
Thanks for your attention today. Now, I'll ask the operator to open the line. Operator?
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth Scott Hoexter>: Great, I just want to follow-up. Richard, thanks for the overview on the International
side there. And the strength you are talking about continuing it. Maybe some of the advances you've made, you talked
about advancing two days on some of the service deliveries. What is accelerating that pace and how are you achieving
that operating margin gains?
<A - James Jay Barber, Jr.>: Ken, this is Jim. We talked over the years about the network in Europe. David
referenced it in his opening comments. I think the key to our success in Europe has been, and will continue to be,
making sure the network and the service and product offerings are best in class. And so that means always maintaining
the network, putting the speed in and making sure that the customers feel the benefit of that. And as you've seen over
the years, they have said that. Obviously, the marketplace is changing. In Europe, we know that as well. So it forces us
to continue to relook and reevaluate everything we do. The margins, they've always been strong. I think I'll flip it to
Richard to talk a little bit about the margins as well.
<A - Richard N. Peretz>: Thanks, Ken, and Jim. I do want to point out that the margin of 19.9% is very strong, and it
does include that multi-year hedge that we've talked about on the call the last few quarters. So I want to remind you
that, even adjusting for that, we're still over a 17.5% margin, which is the highest of any player in the industry.
And along that route, if you recall the currency, we've been using a multi-year hedge strategy. And what happened is,
in 2015, you saw a lot of volatility, and the euro go to the dollar from 1.35 down to 1.11. So, 2017 will be a transition
year where we expect to have somewhere around $300 million impact for the change in the currency.
We have moved to a different hedge strategy because the volatility has increased so much on currency where we're
using more of a rolling average. So the year-over-year, going forward, will not see these dips if you see a lot of
volatility in currency. But, overall, that 17.5% is really a result of all the efforts of Jim and his folks really putting
together and making adjustments in the network, and as the same time, the quality of revenue that we're bringing in.
<Q - Kenneth Scott Hoexter>: Great. Appreciate the insight. Thanks.

<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. Great, thanks. I wanted to ask about some of the comments around the third-quarter on
the Domestic side relative to the fourth quarter. So I'm guessing there's probably some level of investment that needs to
happen [ph] in advance of TPP (20:40) that you guys really start to shore up and get ready for that surge again.
Just thinking about it on a year-over-year basis I guess I just want to make sure I understand the comment around the
tougher comps from the third-quarter of the Domestic side. Are there specific cost items that we might expect this year
that we didn't have last year? I just want to make sure I understand that cadence of Domestic in 3Q and 4Q. Thank you.
<A - Richard N. Peretz>: Okay. This is Richard, Chris. And I think the first thing to keep in mind here is that we
continue to see margin expansion. Because of operating days, how holidays fall, things like that, it's not a linear
movement of the expansion of the margin. But over the year-to-year we've kind of guided that we continue to see
improvement and expect to see improvement going forward as well.
When you look at the third quarter specifically, there is one less work day, and that does have an impact, as well as last
year we had some worker's comp credits that won't repeat this coming year. So, when you take all of that into account,
you have to kind of look at, and we did at the beginning of the year, understanding how the quarters would look.
And what we saw is that we need to make that sure that you guys had some transparency to understand that work day
shifts some of the profit around. And if you look at this quarter, this quarter, we had a good improvement, and that
improvement was really driven by the operational improvements, even though we saw so much volatility in fuel this
year, in the second quarter. We actually saw a 25% increase in fuel from April to June, so we were chasing the revenue.
But when you step back and look at what we expect for the fourth quarter, we're going to have a strong fourth quarter.
We're putting our plans in place, and we look forward to completing 2016 very much like we told you we would at the
beginning of the year.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. That's helpful color. I appreciate the time.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon – Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Good morning, guys. Maybe just following up on Domestic, Richard, I guess the step
below trend long-term guidance growth in that Domestic segment obviously going down this quarter to 3% and then an
expectation for flat in 3Q. Maybe as you think over the course of the next sort of one, two, three years and that rate of
margin change how should we be expecting that to happen to get to that longer-term 15%? And what do you think is
going to be different about next year and the year after that wouldn't let you get back to that kind of 8% growth that you
guys have put out for a long-term target in Domestic?
<A - Richard N. Peretz>: Great. So, first, if we step back, If you recall, when we guided this year, and what we've
seen through the year, is we have seen some softness in the macro measures. Everything has kind of come down each
quarter of this year. And so we take that into account, obviously, with how we think about this year. The good part
about this year is, even with that softness, we're putting initiatives and investments in that are bringing returns, and
that's why we are able to leave our guidance right where we expect it to be at the first part of the year.
That being said, we are in a multi-year process of investments, both in the ORION that David talked about in his talk,
as well as the hub automation and how that will continue. So, all of those things are about putting together the
multi-year process of where we're going to improve the margin that we laid out really at the end of 2014. We're putting
those investments in. Those investments are paying the return we expected, and we just expect as we get more of that
integrated into our network, we'll continue to see the benefits of that.
So, we feel very comfortable where we're at. We know we're on a roadmap for the next few years, and we're following
that road map.

<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: All right. Thank you very much for the extra color on that. Thanks.
<A - David P. Abney>: Okay, This is David, and we're going to take an online question. This one is from Nate
Brochmann. And as a large e-commerce shipper takes over more of its own delivery within the denser cities, does that
change the density equation at all, and the need to retrofit all of the regional sort facilities? And how is that project
progressing? And what have you learned thus far, in terms of benefits heading into another peak?
So Nate got his bang for his buck in that question. And I will start and address the first part of it. Then I'm going to turn
it over to Myron to talk a little bit about the retrofit and peak. And it's not unusual for any of our large shippers to make
decisions whether they're going to outsource or insource different parts of their business.
Our focus is our diverse customer base. This makes it so difficult for any one company to be able to match our density
no matter their size. So with our integrated network, it creates efficiencies, we're constantly increasing our value
proposition. So we always believe that even our large customers would have more density with us than going in another
direction. So we feel very confident in our strategy from that regard.
Why don't you talk about the retrofit and peak preparation, Myron?
<A - Myron A. Gray>: So, Nate. The process itself is going well, and we continue to realize 20 to 25% productivity
improvements as we go along. Keep in mind this is a multi-year, multi-phase implementation. And you've heard about
some of the cities that we introduced earlier in Richard's comments.
Our goal is to automate the top tier one hubs, and there's approximately 30 of them in the U.S. That process as much as
60% of our volume. Three of those automated hubs are in our air operation, and the remainder will be in the ground.
All new hubs moving forward will be built using an automated design and the second phase of it will be to go to the
Tier 2 hubs and automate them as well. So we feel very good about the progress that's being made, and we're on plan
and the goal is to get it completed no later than 2020.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yeah, good morning. I wanted to ask a bit in specific about ORION, I know Richard you
offered some comments on kind of the high-level multi-year productivity and so forth. But is there – is 2017 or are you
starting to see this year, where there's the reduction in the rollout cost and really, getting some of the cost-savings
coming in a bigger way, is that – are you starting to see that? Or is that something which would be maybe a bigger
support for domestic margin performance in 2017? And then you have mentioned a phase 2. I don't know if you want
to comment on that. I know that's a couple of questions but maybe just some perspective, a little more detail on
ORION. Thank you.
<A - Richard N. Peretz>: Sure, Tom. What I'll do is I'll start off and then I'll hand it off to Myron to talk specifically
about the benefits he's seen. But when you think about the investment and when we've been on the road talking about
ORION, we have talked about that later this year we'll complete call it the first phase of ORION. And then we are
investing the dollars in call it phases 2 and 3 and 4, but on top of that, it's not just the investment in ORION, it's also the
investment in hub automation and what that does to the network.
So, we are using those investment dollars and call it the additional expense that we're using to train up for ORION in
other ways so that we get the end results. And that's kind of what we talked about at the end of 2014, and we continue
to talk about each year.
We are investing in our network, and it's pulling through when you see the reduction in miles and things like that. But
the next phase is additional capabilities that will save money, and then additional features by having the hub mod and
there are some other things that we're working on as well that's just a little too early to go into. With that, I'm going to
send it to Myron to talk just a little bit about what he's seen operationally with the results of ORION.

<A - Myron A. Gray>: Tom, let me start with we expect to be 100% fully deployed by the end of 2016 with ORION.
And we will continue to see the benefits that we have alluded to earlier, more than 8 miles per driver in savings. For
example, this quarter we saw our delivery stops grow more than 3% on 2.5% average daily volume gains; however, we
were able to reduce our miles driven by 0.3%, which helped keep our cost per piece down by 0.2%. So as the volume
continues to grow, our wages are growing at a lesser pace than the volume.
So we're continuing to see benefits. And that's phase 1. Phase 2 will actually begin in the back half of this year, well
into 2017, and we hope to have the phase 2 completed by 2017, when we hope to see additional benefits from ORION.
And, again, that's just one of many technology projects that we'll continue to roll out that should help us to continue to
bend the cost curve. So we're real pleased with what we're seeing.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Actually I just want to follow-up on the ORION question.
So I understand the savings this year but there's probably some implementation cost. Can you quantify what the
implementation costs are this year and if ORION has been a net positive or tailwind to earnings this year? And do you
think that next year, how do you think about next year given the savings from Phase 1 but maybe the cost from Phase 2,
any color there would be helpful.
<A - Richard N. Peretz>: Sure. So, again, this is Richard. And yeah, we are seeing the savings, and if you just step
back for a moment and look, year-over-year, we continue to see the margin expansion. The margin expansion is a direct
result of all of the things Myron just talked about. We'll continue to see those improvements. And it is a net-positive,
but we also are spending some of the savings in order to invest in the next phase and the next capability. And those are
all important pieces, and that's why my comment a few minutes ago about the margin will improve year-over-year, it
won't always be linear by quarter. And so that's an important part, because we are investing for new capabilities and to
continue to bend the cost curve because of the investments we're making and the plans we have for the next few years.
<A - David P. Abney>: This is David, I just want to stress that ORION is one of these things that – it's the gift that
keeps on giving. So what we have seen with ORION is we're seeing benefits that are greater than what we originally
believed. And that continues to reinforce itself every year. We have a lot more we're going to accomplish through
ORION with the later versions and taking it to various countries. So we're very positive about ORION and about the
returns that we're getting. And the investments that we're making are certainly worth it.
All right, next question would be fine.

The next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: Yeah, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. As we look out, can you
talk about where the pricing is falling in the U.S. Domestic market, and why with this tremendous growth in B2C that
we're not seeing a little bit more traction on yields, which I think could also talk to this discussion on domestic margins,
because obviously we've talked a lot about costs. But, what are we doing on the revenue side, and is there ability to take
more price?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, Brandon, this is Alan. Thanks for the question. So, for the quarter we achieved our
2% to 3% range in our base pricing, and the core pricing actually remains firm. We actually saw a bit of an acceleration
from the first quarter. Keep in mind that some of the other phenomena we're seeing out there is the offset of about a
100 basis points due to lower fuel surcharges, and we're continuing to see changes in the customers and product mix,

and specifically the package characteristics, as we bring more lightweight into the business.
The other thing I would say is that, even with some of those package characteristics and customer product mix
challenges, we did see margin improvement overall in the U.S. Domestic business. So, we think the base rates
improvements remain steady and they will continue to remain that way, and core pricing right now is firm. Thanks for
the question.

Next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott Schneeberger>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I'm just curious here at the midpoint of the year,
obviously reiterating the guidance range. I'm curious. Looking out over the second half, what do you view as the swing
factors that would put you toward the high-end or the low-end of the range? Thanks.
<A - Richard N. Peretz>: Sure, Scott, this is Richard. And I think when you start and you look at where we're at
year-to-date, first of all, on earning per share, we're at about 8.5% growth in earnings per share on a target of 5% to 9%.
So we're pleased with where we are for the first half of the year. We're actually right in line with where we expected to
be. But when we look at guidance, there's really two factors we're looking at. The first is the external and what's
happening on the external measures, because our volume does have some correlation, especially when you get to B2B,
to what's happening with both domestic GDP, things like industrial production and things like that may all have
softened somewhat from first quarter to second quarter.
The other side of it, of course, is what's happening internally. The things Myron has talked about in his operation, and
those improvements that we're seeing. So we put all that together and we say, do we have – economic assumptions are
realistic? And then, how are we benefiting from the initiatives that we've implemented? And so, we think we balance
all that, and that's what we're seeing in 2016. We're seeing a nice balance, where we're making up for some softness
externally with what we're doing internally. And that's allowed us to grow our earnings per share for six quarters in a
row, and we'll continue to work those plans for guidance going forward.
<A - David P. Abney>: So just to add to Richard's answer. It's our investments and strategies that have allowed us to
offset some of this economic shifts that we've seen in the last year and a half, and we felt very comfortable about our
strategic initiatives. We're extremely focused on them, and it's allowing us to overcome some of those headwinds.
We'll take the next question. We'll do an online question. This is from Helane Becker. And it's, are you seeing any
signs of weakness in the U.K. related to anything, including Brexit? Jim?
<A - James Jay Barber, Jr.>: So, David, thanks for that one, and Helane as well. I think I get this question every day,
quite frankly, over the last couple of months. But I think to give you a little bit of backdrop on it, I go back and just
remind you of something here. Back in 2008, when we bought [ph] Links, (37:05) it was our choice in the U.K. to
strengthen that market, to feed the network we talk about a lot, and obviously, to also feed that country and the
consumers. It took us a couple years to get it done. We were done in 2010.
And although we don't talk much about country-level performance, I think this question will get us pretty close to it. I
can just tell you that, from the years 2010 through 2015, that U.K. operation for us is best-in-class in many ways that
we measure our business. So that acquisition and integration that took us about 3 years has paid dividends for many,
many, many years now.
Brexit, we don't see changing that for that market, quite frankly. Our job is to continue that priority, number one, to
take care of that economy and the consumers, our employees and the shareholders, and link it into that European
network. So that's priority one.
The issue, obviously, becomes what the free trade agreement is set up to be. Don't forget a couple of things I think,
from my perspective. One is, there are many – there is a number of free-trade agreements in that union as well. You've
got the Norway model, you got the Swiss model, then you've got the EU model. So how it unfolds, we will see, but

there are various models that could unfold. We've analyzed scenarios as far left as a WTO set-up, all the way back to
something close to what they have today. In the end, I think our priority is to advise, and advocate, and support
consumers as the free-trade agreements are finalized in the coming years. And then continue to, whatever happens,
support that market and the network. And I think we could easily say there will be somewhat more complexity, but I
think our job is to simplify the complex in the network for consumers and continue the great service, and that's what we
plan to do as that unfolds.

Our next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford, of Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Hey, good morning. Just wondering what your point of view is today on the acquisition
environment, as you start to lap the Coyote acquisition. Obviously taking into account what you have said historically
about acquisition criteria. Are there specific segments or verticals that you're more interested in? And I guess I'm
leading you into UPS Freight in particular, given some of the softness that we see in that LTL market. Do you think
that, that business is of sufficient scale today, or are there potential acquisition opportunities in that segment
specifically? Thanks.
<A - David P. Abney>: Okay, Ben, thanks for the question. This is David, and I'll answer the first part. And then you
talked a little bit about Coyote, so I'll ask Alan to briefly hit that, and then the LTL environment, and Myron will take
that.
But from a acquisition standpoint, we have an active process, and we're really looking in what I'll call just three general
buckets that we're always taking a look at. First is, new opportunities. New opportunities that would help us to add
more value to our customers. And then, any time that we can expand capability within our networks. So if it's
something that we don't feel as strong about as we'd like to then that would be that second criteria.
And then, third, the trade lanes are shifting throughout the world. And so a geographic presence is always important.
Over the last few years, the emerging markets has been a place that we've put a lot of attention on. So, adjacent markets
which is what we did with the Coyote acquisition, is keen on our mind. But at the end of the day, whether it's organic
growth or it's inorganic growth, our focus is on growing this business, and at the same time, having profitable returns.
So, from a Coyote standpoint, Alan?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, just a quick update on Coyote. Certainly their customers and our customers and new
customers are responding very well to the new Coyote and UPS combined value prop. For the quarter, we continue to
see strong year-over-year growth in loads, and our gross margins also expanded for the quarter. As I think we all know,
the truckload market remained soft, but certainly this asset-light model has provided some great flexibility in the up and
down cycles.
And then just lastly, I'll just say that, as far as the synergies related to the acquisition, we're seeing some good work
happening there in procurement asset utilization, cross-selling, and then organizational synergies that are benefiting
both Coyote, and also our U.S. Domestic and Supply Chain & Freight segments, and we're on track. And now I guess
I'll turn it over to Myron to talk a little bit about the LTL.
<A - Myron A. Gray>: Ben, as you are well aware, the LTL market, for the last 16 consecutive months, has
experienced softness. And our customer base is telling us that they have high inventory levels. And in addition to that,
with high inventory levels, the opportunity for restocking is soft is well. All those things considered, we believe that we
have the appropriate scale at UPS freight. We will, however, continue to monitor the market and make the appropriate
adjustments, and make the right business decision moving forward, in terms of whether or not to expand our scale.
Thank you.

The next question will come from the line of Allison Landry, of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Good morning. Could you speak a little more to your earlier comments about U.S.
consumer interest in alternative delivery methods? I wanted to understand how well penetrated it is, even in the urban
areas, and, specifically, how much you think it would need to increase from here in order to move the needle on
density? Thank you.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Allison. This is Alan. There are a number of things, first of
all, that we're doing to improve density, and it's really part of the whole e-commerce value proposition and ecosystem
that we've put in place.
The UPS Access Points, UPS My Choice, the synchronized delivery solutions, and certainly SurePost Redirect, which
is now at about the 30% of those packages are being redistricted back into the ground network. On Access Points right
now, we'll probably finish the year at about 27,000 Access Points globally. And we continue to expand there.
So, yes. So when you think about bending the cost curve, I guess the one-tenth contributes to about $200 million in
bottom-line cost, when we increase the density by one-tenth. And then I guess the last thing I'll say is that we continue
to be bullish about Access Points, and we're expanding the current model. And as you probably saw, we invested in our
locker expansion after some tests we ran last year, and we're laying in 300 lockers into the United States. And your
point about urban America, and urban anywhere in the world, lots of consumers out there who have challenges
receiving packages at home in urban areas, and the Access Points and the lockers is a great solution for them, and it
also benefits UPS.

Our next question will come from the line of David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Ross>: Yes, good morning, gentlemen. You talked a lot about the U.S. and also about Europe. Can you
talk a little bit more about Asia and the rest of the world, and what you're seeing going on there from a trade
perspective?
<A - James Jay Barber, Jr.>: David, this is Jim. Certainly the Asia market, it also continues to change. Obviously the
biggest market out there from a China perspective, we currently, quite frankly, are seeing very, very nice and actually
momentum picking up in our middle market growth based upon the solutions we're providing to the Chinese consumer
as their model shifts at the same time. Certainly the network that we have in place has served us well for many years.
This quarter, over all, I think the block hours were down about 0.5% percent.
You saw in the early opening comments of the call this morning, and the releases that the export volume continues to
grow at UPS. That includes our Asia-Pacific region, as well as our Latin America region at the same time. So we
continue on. One of our big focuses out there is our intra-Asia network. It's a great opportunity for us. We laid that in,
in 2010. We think it has lots more upside. We'll continue to do that and really align that as well to the emerging market
strategy that David just referenced a minute ago that we continue to invest in and I'm confident we'll be referencing on
the calls to come. So appreciate the question.

Our next question will come from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jack Atkins>: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time. So, I was wondering if you could expand for a moment
on your comments around B2B trends. You referenced in the press release that B2C grew five times that of B2B. But
could you maybe comment exactly sort of what the growth rate was for B2B in the quarter? What portion of your U.S.
Domestic package business B2B makes up now? And what customer verticals are you seeing particular strength and
weakness on the B2B side? Thank you.

<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, this is Alan. I'll take that question. On the commercial B2B side we did see a slight
increase. The good news is we've seen a slight increase the last few quarters there. It's mainly being driven actually by
the retail sector and returns. But we are seeing some growth in some other areas. Wholesale, health care, and
professional services are some of the other areas, and also consumer and home goods.
As you know, industrial production as I think David indicated was pretty soft, and the B2B is really being driven now
by retail and some of those other sectors that I've spoken about. I think our investments really in some of these sectors,
including healthcare, are helping us to gain share in that particular area, so kind of outrun the economic challenges.
And then lastly our B2C business is about 45% of our business today.
<A - David P. Abney>: Okay. The next question will come from – online, and the question – and this was from the
buy-side is, "Do you see any long-term opportunities to expand streamlined delivery routes with the ride-sharing
programs?" So, Alan?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Thanks, David. I think, again, everyone knows on the call that we made a strategic
enterprise fund investment a few quarters back in a company named Deliv, which is a retail to consumer same-day B2C
delivery company that actually uses the excess capacity out there in the market with people that have vehicles that want
to participate in that program, similar to what's happening on the ride-sharing part of the economy there.
They are a leader in this new space, and we're excited to learn more from that. The other thing I would say is Coyote is
really a technology platform that's doing the same thing. It's matching up excess capacity in the marketplace from
thousands upon thousands of carriers that have backhaul excess capacity, and we're providing a similar service with
Coyote. So we're excited about that in the heavier truckload type business as well as for the prospects potentially on the
pick-up and delivery side. Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kelly Dougherty>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to think about the U.S.
Domestic volume growth. Obviously, things like Prime are driving demand for more premium products, but would love
to get insight on how other retailers are pursuing e-commerce, if they're offering free shipping on some or all spending
levels. Do you expect that will show up more in your deferred offerings, though that certainly didn't seemed to be the
case this quarter? Just trying to get a sense of what you think the volume and maybe the revenue mix will be as
e-commerce grows?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yes, so this is Alan. A couple of points on your question, first, the holiday offerings here in
July were pretty widespread amongst a whole number of retailers, and I think we'll see more and more of that, certainly
in this summer timeframe, but also in other parts of the year to drive growth in the e-commerce sector for these
retailers, which is critically important for them. Certainly the e-commerce growth drives significant growth in our
Ground business and our SurePost business, and then on the overnight and deferred side, mainly in the saver and the
second-day air business, but the key here is that we've got this great portfolio, so when the customer absolutely has to
have it, they're usually willing to pay for that. And we have the full gamut of services to get those goods to them when
they want it, and then we have the more economical alternatives, along with some of the other value adds like UPS
Access Point, UPS My Choice, an omni-channel that really drive those retailers and those consumers to UPS. Thanks
for the question.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey, thanks for taking the time. I guess this is piggybacking on Kelly's question. Can you
walk us through some of the factors that were impacting U.S. Domestic package deferred volume and yield trends,

which have diverged a little bit from the rest of the U.S. Domestic portfolio with volumes down a little bit, but yields
up year-on-year. And if you could specifically address if we're seeing the impact of any large customers changing their
delivery methodologies that are impacting deferred trends.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, this is Alan, I'll take that. First, our premium Next Day Air products grew at nearly
6% and the Ground was up more than 2%. So certainly our customers are responding to the continual expansion of our
Next Day Air and our Next Day Air Early service to more postal codes. In fact, all of our Next Day Air services
experienced growth.
On the other hand, Saver, Ground, and SurePost, and certainly deferred are focused more on the e-commerce and retail
customers, and so, on the deferred side, you really need to look at it on a two-year stacked basis. We almost grew 15%,
following strong double-digit growth in 2015. Thanks for the question.
Operator
And the last question in queue at this time will come from the line of Ravi Shankar of Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Ravi Shanker>: Thanks for squeezing me in here. And I'm going to try and squeeze in two follow ups if I can.
The first one is on 2017. So, between the FX hedges rolling off, and the ground growth costs, do you think EBIT can be
higher in 2017 versus 2016? And the second question is on Amazon, do you feel like your delivery share with them has
held constant, or is it up or down in the last 12 months? Thanks.
<A - Richard N. Peretz>: So, Ravi, this is Richard, and I'll start with the first question on the guidance for 2017. And I
think the important thing is, we had said that as we move forward, we have continued initiatives that will continue to
improve the operating margin. That being said, obviously, different segments, things will happen, and growth rates
might have to be adjusted. It's a little early to talk about exactly what's going to happen, and that's really because there
is a lot of things going on in volatility of currency, too.
So the year here we are in end of July, we have time still. And if you tell me where, in November, the dollar-euro is or
the sterling-dollar, that will be a lot about the story of how much variation. That's why we say the plus or minus
numbers.
An important thing is that, we have a plan that will improve by segment. Our first priority is to reinvest in this business
because of the strength of the company. We continue to deliver the highest ROIC and the highest margins in the
business, and our plan is to continue to do that. And we will continue to do that while, at the same time, having
dividends of over 3%, or around 3%. So, as we get closer to the 2017, I'll guide you appropriately, but we are in the
middle of putting all of those plans together.
And then, your second question around the percentage of our share of any one customer is something that we – we
obviously continue to win customers based on our strategy to win customers. We don't comment on any one customer.
But you can see our volume growth for the U.S. was up about 2.5%. You adjust for fuel. We saw revenue growth of
about 3.4%. So it was a strong quarter.
We laid out for you how we think the fourth quarter is going to look, and that's another strong quarter. And we're going
to end up delivering on the guidance numbers that we gave you at the beginning of the year. And I think that's the most
important thing.
<Q - Ravi Shanker>: Thank you.
<A - David P. Abney>: Okay, we have one last question, and this is an online question from Tyler Brown. And it's
about return logistics, reverse logistics, and kind of two part. Could you talk about what kind of growth rates you are
seeing in return volumes? And talk a little bit about our capabilities on this front, and do we need to do something to
add to our capabilities?

So, Alan, if you'd take that.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, thanks for the question, Tyler. Yeah, as I said earlier, returns growth has been strong.
It's in the mid-teens. And, as you all know, returns is very good business for us, because customers tend to drop those
packages off. So we have high-density pickups at those drop-off locations, and then high-density deliveries back to the
retailers. UPS has some of the most technology-advanced transportation return services, with things like returns on the
web, RS1, RS3 print label return. So when it comes to label generation, shipping, tracking visibility, enabling speedy
refunds for the consumers, for customer experience, we've got some of the best returns solutions in the business.
You combine that with the UPS stores, the UPS Access Points, the lockers, the other alliance partners, UPS drop boxes,
there are millions of packages being returned or being delivered to those drop-off locations, casting that wide net. And
again, I just tie that back to the whole e-commerce ecosystem that we have that really benefits retailers and consumers,
and makes UPS the e-commerce transportation company of choice. Thanks for the question.

I would now like to turn the program back over to Mr. Childress. Please go ahead, sir.
Scott Childress
Thanks, Steven. I want to thank everyone for submitting an online question today, and for your interest in UPS. If you
submitted a question that did not get answered, please reach out to the investor relations team or myself after the call.
Now, I'll turn the call to David for his closing comments. David?
David P. Abney
Okay. So, UPS performed well in the second quarter. We expanded our margins in our International and in our
Domestic small-package business. And, very importantly, we're investing today to ensure our future performance. So
we're at the halfway point of the year. So to UPSers this is halftime, and we've had a good first half. We were on plan.
But it's very important, and we're all committed to our plans, and confident in our 2016 guidance.
So, on behalf of the 435,000 UPSers around the world, thank you for your time today, and for all of you, thank you for
investing in UPS. Thank you very much.
