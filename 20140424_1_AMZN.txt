including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to
have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the
quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this
webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures
regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of
2013.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks, Dave. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow
increased 26% to $5.35 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $1.49 billion. Trailing 12-month capital
expenditures were $3.85 billion. We continue to make additional investments in support of business growth consisting
of investments in technology and infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, and additional capacity to support
our fulfillment operations.
Return on invested capital was 9%, up from 1%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus
current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common
stock and stock-based rewards outstanding was 476 million shares compared with 471 million shares one year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $19.74 billion or 23%, excluding the $10 million favorable impact from
year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue increased to $5.47 billion, up 8% or 8% excluding foreign
exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.02 billion, up 27% or 27% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM
increased to 66% of worldwide sales, up from 64%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 23%. Active customer accounts
exceeded 244 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid
units.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $14.06 billion or 71.2% of
revenue compared with 73.4%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $5.18 billion or
26.2% of sales, up approximately 240 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.24 billion or 11.3% of revenue
compared with 10.8%. Tech and content was $1.82 billion or 9.2% of revenue compared with 7.9%. Marketing was
$843 million or 4.3% of revenue compared with 3.8%.
Now, I'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate segments or stock-based
compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $11.86
billion. Media revenue grew 12% to $2.82 billion or 13% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to
$7.83 billion, representing 66% of North America revenues, up from 65%. Other revenue grew 60% to $1.2 billion.
North America segment operating income increased 23% to $562 million, a 4.7% operating margin. In the International
segment, revenue grew 18% to $7.88 billion. Adjusting for the $24 million year over year favorable foreign exchange
impact, revenue growth was 18%. Media revenue grew 4% to $2.64 billion or 4%, excluding foreign exchange. And
EGM revenue grew 27% to $5.19 billion or 26%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 66% of
international revenues, up from 61%.
International segment operating loss was $60 million compared with $16 million loss in the prior period. CSOI
increased 14% to $502 million or 2.5% of revenue, down approximately 20 basis points year over year. Excluding the
favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 10%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes
stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 19% to $146
million or 0.7% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $73 million. GAAP net income was $108 million or $0.23
per diluted share compared with $82 million and $0.18 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $771 million year-over-year to $8.67 billion.
Inventory increased 24% to $6.72 billion and inventory turns were 9.1, down from 9.5 turns a year ago as we expanded
selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 19% to $10.59
billion, and accounts payable days were 68, consistent with the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've
seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently
unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding
exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict
demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies
amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a
material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions,
investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates,
and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2014, we expect net sales of between $18.1 billion and $19.8 billion, a growth of between 15% and 26%. This
guidance anticipates approximately 160 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating
income or loss to be between a $455 million loss and $55 million loss compared to $79 million in income in the second
quarter 2013. This includes approximately $455 million for stock-based compensation and amortization from intangible
assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other
operating expense, to be between $0 and $400 million compared to $409 million in the second quarter of 2013.
We remain [indiscernible] (8:31) focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and
convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks.
And with that, Dave, let's move to questions.
Dave Fildes
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how
to initiate a question?
Q&A
Operator
Absolutely, Mr. Fildes. [Operator Instructions] We'll hear first from Mark Miller with William Blair.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Yeah. Hi, Tom. I was hoping you could maybe just lay out for us what do you think the main
reasons are for the acceleration and growth here in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter? And then a specific
question on Prime Pantry: is one of the motivations to get the customer on that program, it might make it easier to
convert them to AmazonFresh? And if so, would you want to run this operation as a breakeven like you do with Kindle
to enable a bigger business? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of growth, we did. We saw very solid growth, good growth in Q1, up 23% on a
local currency basis. In North America we saw similar growth rates in Q1 as we saw in Q4 of last year, as well as Q1 of
last year, all at 26%. In international we saw the growth accelerate a little bit on an exchange adjusted basis from 15%
to 18% from Q4 to Q1. But we're really seeing is we're pleased with the overall fundamentals. We continue to add new
customers. In stocks continue to be healthy. Third-party units as a percentage of units are about 40%, so still very

strong. FBA adoption continues to be strong around the world. Continue to add new selection. We saw strong growth in
many different areas, including Web Services. And so again, a lot of different areas contributed to the growth rate that
we saw in Q1.
In terms of Prime Pantry, we just think it's an exciting option for Prime members. It's available only to Prime members
so that they can get their everyday non-bulk items in one box and we think that it's interesting for customers, and again
it's a great way that we could add the selection and have the selection for those customers.
Operator
Moving on to Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. On the famous Drone interview that Jeff had with
Charlie Rose you said something that caught my attention, which was that every elasticity study that you do says that
Amazon should be raising prices. I have two questions around that. The first is does that equation also work in reverse?
Meaning that if higher prices don't dampen demand, does it also mean that lower prices don't stimulate demand like
they used to?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of pricing, we've been very consistent. We want to offer great value to customers.
And so we work very hard to make sure that we can offer and afford to offer great prices for customers. And so that's
something that we've been working on very hard over the years. That's certainly one of the reasons why you've seen the
growth rates that we've experienced along with getting closer to customers from a shipping perspective, making sure
we have great in-stocks and other service attributes.
In terms of price increases, we certainly have increased the price on Prime, but again, that was after many years of not
raising the price, even though the cost of – transportation costs certainly had gone up. And the fact that we'd certainly
added a lot of selection, going from a little over one million items in the first year to over 20 million items. So it's still
an incredibly great value for customers, and that's why we did that. So again, we're all about making sure we have great
values for customers, and we'll continue to do that.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: Okay, thanks for that.
Operator
Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein has the next question.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner>: Hi. Thank you. I have two quick questions about AWS. First, everyone would agree that AWS
is vast opportunity. So given how large the opportunity is, why is it that you're not hiring more people, launching more
projects and growing faster? What are the limiting factors for growth of AWS?
Second, you have a long history of cutting prices for a few specific AWS products, but you did something somewhat
unusual in late March, when you cut prices across EC2 and S3 products in one shot. Why did you only cut your prices
after Google cut theirs? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of AWS, the team is doing a fantastic job. We are adding a lot of resources. We've
grown our employee base there dramatically over the years and continue to add people there. And that's the way we've
been able to launch all the new services that we've had over the past several years. And we continue the pace of
acceleration in terms of new things that we're doing is increasing. And we've published a lot of statistics around that.
In terms of pricing, we think this is our 42nd price increase that we've had in AWS – sorry, price decrease in AWS and
we're very excited on behalf of our customers to be able to do that. The team works very hard to be able to afford those
lower prices and we're excited to do that. And so, in terms of the timing of when we launch these price decreases, they
come at different times and it happened to come in the presentation that we're giving around that time. But, again, we're
very excited about the opportunity and we continue to invest in that business given the big opportunity that we have

there.
Operator
Our next question will come from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: Tom, can you walk us through the process on how you think about and how you model, how
much you're willing to play for exclusive content such as video or video game content? And then, another question. Is
it fair for us to assume that the business model of the Kindle Fire TV is similar to what Bezos has said regarding selling
other hardware roughly at roughly breakeven and then making money only if consumers use it? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of video content, the team does a very nice job of various modeling. Certainly,
we're trying to estimate what the usage is of all the content that we launch, and we have a number of different ways that
we do that. We do have, certainly, for some of the content that we've been selling, both in terms of physical format as
well as selling on the transactional side, we certainly see what those sales are – what those unit sales are, so we have
that as a benchmark. We also have other models to look at, that help us guide to what we think the usage will be of
those. But, again, the team's done a nice job looking at different ways to model that, and I expect that we'll continue to
refine that over time as well.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: And the Kindle Fire TV?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah. In terms of Fire TV, I can't talk about the economics of the device itself. But what I
can say is it's very early and we're extremely pleased with what we see in just the few weeks here. And the team
certainly made what we think is a killer product, and where the team is – very hard trying to keep in stock on that
product.
Operator
And Citi's Mark May has the next question.
<Q - Mark A. May>: Thank you. Wondering if you noticed any change in sign-ups or conversions in the few weeks
here since you've rolled out the Prime price increase for new customers? And if you could maybe comment on what
may have contributed to the deceleration in year-on-year growth in media sales in North America? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of Prime, it's early but we're encouraged with what we see so far. Just over the last
several weeks, our Prime subscribers continue to grow week over week. New trials – the adoption of new trials, again,
post the increase are growing very nicely, so those customers accepting new trials is growing very fast. We only have a
few days of information related to conversion and we're encouraged by what we see there. So, overall, we're very
encouraged and the reason why is that customers, we believe, are responding to just a great service. And so we're
continuously being reminded of customers, in terms of the offering we have on the physical side as well as the
offerings that we have on the digital side as well. So very encouraged there. In terms of the North American Media, we
did see from a growth standpoint it's 13% year-over-year for North American Media, that compares to 14% in Q1 of
last year. It is down a little bit sequentially from Q4.
The Q4, keep in mind, we do have video games and video consoles in that number in Q4. Certainly, a number of
different factors but that's certainly one that's impacting the Q4 numbers, and it's certainly seasonal, as you'd expect.
But there were some great launches of consoles in Q4 that are impacting that number.

We'll now turn to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.

<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Tom, I was just hoping you could give us your view
on units growth and sort of how you think about that going forward. How important of a metrics it is, given that we're
seeing somewhat of a decoupling here as revenue and gross profit reaccelerated, but units obviously deceled as media
came down. Can you talk a little bit about that? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. As you mentioned, unit growth was actually decelerated a little bit from Q4 and also
from last year, it was 23% year-over-year in Q1. One thing to keep in mind is that our Web Services business is
growing at a faster rate. We don't incorporate any units from AWS in that metric. But overall, you're right, we continue
to – from a gross standpoint we had a small acceleration of growth from Q4 to Q1 from a revenue standpoint, again on
a local currency basis, going from 22% to 23%. We're very pleased with a lot of the fundamentals that I talked about
earlier that's impacting that growth rate. So again overall we're pleased, and again we think that we see a nice growth
rate in third-party units. As a percentage of total units it was 40% which was consistent with what we saw last year, so
third-party growth continues to be very strong as well.
Operator
Brian Nowak of SIG has the next question.
<Q - Brian T. Nowak>: Thanks. I have two. The first one is, Tom, if you go back to the unit question, even if we
exclude North America and International, Other from gross profit, gross profit growth held in there pretty steady at
28%. Just kind of curious, is there anything that we should think about of why gross profit growth and unit growth is
decoupling? And is unit growth really a good way to measure the health of the business?
And then the second one is on International Media. One of the factors you guys have flagged in the past holding down
International Media is more limited local language content. Can you just help us better quantify the difference in
English language digital content compared to foreign language, and what steps are you taking to improve that?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of – I'll take the second part of the question first about International Media. The
growth rate was 4% in the quarter. And as I've talked about in prior quarters, certainly one of the things that's
happening is we see a conversion from physical to digital. And for example in North America, we're now selling – in
North America Media, we're now selling more digital units than physical units, so over the past 12 months we saw
more digital units than physical units. We're not at that point yet in International, and so certainly that's an opportunity
for us as we look at growing International Media. And so again, it's certainly something that we're working very hard
on and certainly a good opportunity for us.
In terms of unit growth, it's certainly just one measure that we want to – that we thought has been helpful, and that's
why we've continued to provide it. It is just one metric, we have many different metrics that we're sharing, but there's
not much more I can add to that. But again, it's a metric. Was there another – was there a third part to the question?
<Q - Brian T. Nowak>: No. I guess are there any other puts and takes we should think about in units as we go
throughout the year where there are tough compares or easy compares in units from a digital unit perspective or
anything?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: There's not that I can think of at the minute. But just keep in mind when you think about
our revenue growth, always be thinking about, there's certainly a volume component. We have a third-party
component, we have a mix component, we're continuously trying to lower prices for customers. All those factor into
the revenue growth rates that you see for each of the revenue metrics that we provide to you.
<Q - Brian T. Nowak>: Okay, great. Thanks.

<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Great, thanks. Regarding fulfillment, does it make sense for you to bring some of the components
in-house? We've been hearing talk of your own fulfillment network. Can you make any comments on this? And just to
follow up on you digital units point, can you comment on any impact of recent shifts in music and video consumption
to subscription-based models, from download to own, on your Media business? Is that having any impact? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of fulfillment, there's not a lot I can comment on in terms of your specific
question. What I would say though is we continue to work to be – as we have over the years, to become closer and
closer to customers, and so we've certainly done that in a number of different ways. Just the footprint we have, from a
fulfillment capacity standpoint, enables us to be closer to customers and getting great selection even closer to
customers. So we continue to work. Certainly, Prime was another way to get a faster delivery speed to customers, and
so we'll continue to work on our capabilities there to make it even better over time.
In terms of the digital units question, I apologize there's not a lot I can comment in terms of your specific question
there.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: All right. Thank you.
Operator
And we'll move on to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Justin Post>: Tom, when we look back at your model and when you go back to 2008 and 2009, in the middle of a
pretty bad global recession you were able to put up 7.3% and 7.4% operating margins in Europe – I'm sorry,
International. And now it looks like you're losing money, and maybe for the whole year. Could you talk about some of
the drivers that are driving the losses this quarter internationally? What the company's patience for losses are
internationally? And when you come out of this, how your business will be different? And what your margin outlook is
for the International profits? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of what you're seeing in Q1, and you've been seeing this certainly for a
few-year period here, is we're investing very heavily in International, and we're doing that in a number of different
ways. Certainly, from a geographic standpoint we continue to invest in new geographies, and Italy and Spain were
certainly the most recent, and you should assume that we're investing in those geographies. We continue to invest in
China and, certainly, that's an investment mode. And then also, as we've continued to grow in International, we've
invested in terms of capacity, both fulfillment capacity as well as infrastructure capacity, to support those. So what you
saw, you will see certainly variation over time in the period that you're talking about. We certainly had, particularly
coming out of – going into late 2008 and also 2009, we had extra capacity globally. We still did continue to invest, but
not near the rates that we're investing now and that's why you saw some of the results that you've seen.
But, again, one of the things that you see not only in International, but in our total results is we continue to invest very
heavily into the business because of the opportunities that we see.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thank you.

And we'll now hear from Greg Melich with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi. Thanks. Tom, I wanted to ask a bit on the decision process that you went through when
raising the Prime membership fee. I know you had talked about potentially doing 20 to 40. What factors did you look at
in deciding on the 20? And related to that, with the deleveraging of shipment costs happening little bit, was weather an
impact on that or is that just the business and how it's trending?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: There was a number of different factors that we looked at, in terms of when we looked at
the price increase, but the biggest one is we had built – we think we've built a great service and we saw that the – just

particularly the transportation costs, since inception, have grown dramatically. We just hadn't done any price increase
during that long time period and that's really the big reason why we decided to do that. We launched the program with
over a million items and we have over 20 million items now. Customers are using that service, in addition to having the
transportation costs being higher they're using that service more and that's really what led to it. And beyond that, there's
not a lot I can comment.

<Q - Greg S. Melich>: And just on the [indiscernible] (29:10) the shipment cost deleveraging in the first quarter a little
bit, did weather or something else have an impact? Or is that just the trend of the business, given the growth rate of the
shipments?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: There's many different factors that go into that, and certainly weather would have been one
of those.

We'll move on to Ron Josey with JMP Securities.
<Q>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. This is [ph] Andrew (29:39) on for Ron. A quick question around
streaming volumes in U.K. and Germany now that Lovefilm is bundled was bundled with Prime. Do you guys have any
comment?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Unfortunately, it's probably a good question for future quarters. It's just so early, and again,
what little data we have so far is very encouraging, but it's very early. So I think that's a good question for future
quarters.

We'll move on to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Thanks. Obviously, a lot of focus on pricing in AWS, but you're clearly still seeing
accelerating growth despite those cuts. Could you provide some context on the volume side of that equation, whether
it's just growth in customers or workloads or some way to sort of frame the other side of things outside of just pricing in
AWS?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah. It's a good question and I think that's something we can certainly work on to try to
be helpful. The price change, the most recent price change is certainly recent, and what we're commenting on is
certainly the Q1 results. But that's something that we'll think about and try to be helpful on that as we go forward. But
certainly, usage has been, this is not something recent. Usage has been very, very strong, and as we've continued to
lower prices over time, this is the 42nd price decrease that we've had, and we've had great usage growth over time.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. And just on the AWS side with the sort of nationalistic concerns that we're seeing
around stored data, does that change at all the way that the AWS team is thinking about infrastructure needs for that

business or the way that you might be thinking about CapEx?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: I think the best way to say it is, and hopefully, this answers your question, the team focuses
on many different aspects, but certainly, the operational aspects of being up and running, being a very secure, reliable
set of services, those are something the team is very focused on and spends a lot of time working on. And so beyond
that, I'm not sure we can add to it.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Thanks, Tom.

Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald has the next question.
<Q - Youssef H. Squali>: Yes. Thank you very much. Two quick questions please. First, the HBO deal seems like a
seminal event for Prime video in terms of quality and probably the price bit as well. Is this the first of many potentially
large deals you're intent on getting for the platform? Or was this more of an opportunistic transaction that just came
your way. And second, just on the P&L can you just clarify where that $60 million in investment gains came from,
please?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. The answer to your second question, which is down below in other relates to a gain,
primarily from LivingSocial, they sold their Korean business and that's reflected in that line item. In terms of the
content question, the way I would think about it is this. We've continually, since we've launched the service, we've
continually added, try to add great content, and I think we've been pretty successful in doing that. And this is just
another contract that we've launched into that's multiyear to do that, and we think it's great for customers. We're
extremely excited to offer this to customers and we'll try to keep making the service even better over time.
<Q - Youssef H. Squali>: Is exclusivity an important consideration for you now?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: There's a number of factors. Certainly, we have a number of different arrangements where
we have exclusive content, and we think that's great for customers. And we've also supplemented with other content
that's not exclusive. And obviously, we've worked – obviously as you know, we're working on original content as well
it is exclusive. So those are the things that we're working on. And we see the customer response to all of those, and we
like what we see.
<Q - Youssef H. Squali>: Thanks.
Operator
Ron Tilghman with B. Riley has the next question.
<Q - Ronald Scott Tilghman>: Thanks. Hi Tom, wanted to really ask two related questions. First following up on the
International discussion from before. I was wondering if you could prioritize where the investments are going on the
international side between fulfillment, media buildout, geography buildout, et cetera. And then related, I haven't seen
any discussion on what's happening on the domestic fulfillment buildout this year. I was wondering if you could
comment on that as well?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the priority, I'm not sure what to add there. But I would say that we have, we're
investing heavily in China and we have been for some time. And certainly that's a factor. We're investing in new
geographies, most notably Italy and Spain. We're investing in, as I mentioned, fulfillment centers and infrastructure to
support that growth. So again, not a lot to add there. The other part of your question?
<Q - Ronald Scott Tilghman>: Let me ask it a different way. If you look at pricing, if you look at infrastructure, if
you look at geography, is there one bucket that tends to trump the others?

<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah, and again, we've been pretty consistent on how we have talked about it. Again China
is an issue, China is a big investment. And all of our geographies, not just International, we're investing on behalf of
customers in terms of lowering prices. So that's having an impact. Volume is having an impact. We continue to invest
in our fulfillment capacity, not only for our retail customers but also for third parties on behalf of fulfillment by
Amazon. And so we're making investments there and the others that I mentioned.
<Q - Ronald Scott Tilghman>: Fair enough. And on domestic fulfillment?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: On domestic fulfillment, as we have in past years, we'll continue to update you as we go
throughout the year. I don't have any comments today, given that we're just coming out of Q1. But we will be adding
fulfillment capacity, given the growth rates we're experiencing, and we'll update you as we go.
<Q - Ronald Scott Tilghman>: Okay. Thank you.

We'll hear from Eric Sheridan with UBS.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks for taking the question. A question about your advertising business. There's been a lot
of movement by Google to push PLAs as a product to sellers. I wanted to know longer term as you guys think about
both advertising on Amazon, and also to give out advertising in a way that allow sellers to bring traffic back to their
own websites but might avail themselves of Amazon's advertising data and user data to help enable those sales. Thank
you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah. I can't comment on what we might or might not do in the future, but the team has
done a nice job from an advertising perspective. And you can see those prominently on our various websites. We view
it as another way certainly to help be able to afford lower prices for customers. And again the team's done a very nice
job of monetizing those detail pages to allow us to be able to do that.
Operator
Moving on to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thanks, Tom. Two questions, please. The International Media you talked about I guess the
digitization catchup or whatever of international media. Could you break that down a little bit further? Are there certain
categories, i.e., books versus videos, versus music, that one of those is kind of dragging internationally? And what is it
that needs to happen for that digital shift to occur? Do you need more rights, do you just need more devices in the
market? What is the drag there?
And then in terms of the operating income guidance you're very consistent on how you guided the last couple of years;
it seems like you're guiding for more of a sequential decline in operating income in June quarter than you have the last
two years. Is that just a different type of seasonality to the business, or are there new near-term investments that you're
making in the June quarter? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the second part of the question related to the guidance, what's reflected in the
Q2 guidance is many different factors, but we are investing. I mentioned a number of different investments that we're
making in International related to Q1, also related to Q2. We're investing in content, we're investing in our Web
Services business, both from a new services as well as pricing. So again, we're investing in a lot of different areas
across the company; I'm sure there's a number that I am not mentioning, so again we're investing. So that's really what
you're seeing in the range of guidance that we see in Q2.
In terms of International Media, we continue to make progress there on our conversion from physical to digital, but
we're just not where we are in North America, and it's in many different categories. We'll continue to work on that, and
certainly some of the things that you see related to video in Europe is certainly trying to address that, part of that. So

Deutsche Bank's Ross Sandler has the next question.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Hey, guys. If you don't mind I'll beat the dead horse on the International question. But
specifically around China, can you give us an update on the overall strategy for China? Are the levels of investments
going into the country accelerating or are they just stable? And then what kinds of milestones in terms of market share
or customer adoption do you guys track to identify success or return on that investment? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In China, we're investing a lot in trying to grow the business there. We're certainly
investing in our fulfillment – we haven't been investing in our fulfillment network to get even closer to customers.
We're doing a lot on the retail basics as we've done in other geographies, making sure that we have great in-stock
availability making sure that we have had unique selection. So those are a lot of the things that we've done, making sure
that we have the right pricing in place on behalf of customers, making sure that our service levels are where we need
them to be. So those are the things that we continue to work on in China. It's a very large opportunity, and we continue
to work hard. Is it a large investment? Yes it is, and that investment has certainly increased over the past several years.

We'll now hear from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird & Company.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Thanks. First just one clarification on the AWS question. Given the comments that
customers would see hundreds of millions of dollars of savings in Q2 from the price cuts, I just want to understand or
clarify if we should be expecting moderating growth rate in the other segments, at least temporarily? And then lastly
just Amazon's position on the ability of ISPs to add a toll for fastlane network access. Is this a scenario or situation that
would change the company's approach or strategy with regards to video or is this more of a non-factor for you guys?
Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the – just a clarification. In Jeff's quote, he mentions that customers will be
saving hundreds of millions of dollars over the next several months alone. He didn't say specifically the second quarter.
So certainly that's impacting second quarter and it's reflected in the guidance that you're seeing there. But again, we're
very happy to do that on behalf of our AWS customers. We've done many different price decreases over time, and we
think that's great on behalf of customers and we think our teams – and we're positioned very well in that business and
we'll continue to invest in that, given the large opportunity that we have there.
In terms of the other question, there's not really a lot I can comment there.
Operator
And ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately we only have time for one more question which will come from Kerry Rice
with Needham & Company.
<Q - Kerry Rice>: Thanks a lot. Just a couple of questions. One on customer adds, you didn't add quite as many new
customer accounts as you did in Q1 2013. And so I assume based on your comments that wasn't related to the price
increase around Prime, and so I don't know if you can add any context there. And then the second question is just
around mobile. Obviously, the mobilization throughout the world is an important trend and you guys haven't talked a
lot about it. Wonder if you can give us any context around your strategy there or any metrics.

<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of Prime, Prime, again, year over year is growing very rapidly, and then also week
over week as we look at the metrics over the last several weeks continues to grow week over week. So we're very
encouraged by what we're seeing there. In terms of mobile, it's certainly a tailwind for our business. We have a number
of different things that we're working on in mobile, and we're continuing to make it easier and easier for customers to
shop from a mobile perspective. Our traffic continues to increase from a mobile perspective; we're excited about what
we see there, and we continue trying to find ways to make that even better from an experience standpoint for our
customers.
