and John Dearborn is here from our NGL and Petchem Services operating area. Additionally, our CFO Don Chappel is
available to respond to any questions.
In yesterday's presentation, and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking
statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in
our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong
Great. Good morning, thanks, John.
We are excited to talk here about our second quarter as well as the continued progress on executing our strategy. We
remain very confident that our strategy is well positioned to benefit over the long haul, as we continue to see this
market emerge, and tremendous demand for infrastructure to take advantage of the low-cost natural gas and natural
resources continue to be developed in North America.
Just a level-set before we get into the presentation. I want to run down a few key points that are key to our strategy, and
this is starting here on slide four. First of all, the strategy really does frame our growth investments, our dividend and
distribution growth strategy, as we continue to use that as direction for how we manage the business. So we remain
very disciplined around the strategy, and it really is a very strong compass for us in decisions we make. So it's
important for you to understand it.
First of all, on the competitive advantage, our competitive advantage is created by large-scale and the resulting market
access and low cost that we offer to our customers continue to be a guiding light for us. You won't find us making
investments without those characteristics in our sights. Our Transco System and our West operating areas are great
examples of what that looks like to us. And if you look at the Northeast, the moves we're continuing to make in this
area really are all focused on getting to that scale of number-one or number-two position in that area. And certainly we
are convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that over the long haul this creates great opportunity and value for both our
customers and our investors.
On looking to the growth side, I am not sure it's possible really at this point to overemphasize the growth opportunities
that we have available to us right now. Our Williams Partners Transco System is another great example, as it relates to
the growth opportunities that are in front of us. This is the nation's premier natural-gas pipeline system. It's connected
to the right supply and certainly the right market areas. And the growth opportunities that continue to come at us day
after day on this continue to build our confidence about the growth, not just in the supply side as we've seen around
natural gas, but a strong movement towards the demand side and – as we expect the overall market continue to expand.
The position we're in there is very enviable, and we really are in a position to select not just any growth opportunity,
but the very best growth opportunities available in the industry right now.
Simply put, you'll see us focusing on the top layer of cream in this opportunity set, and with Transco as in other areas,
we are realizing our strategy and we are ensuring these benefits translate into value for our investors.
On the high-dividend-growth side, this is central to our value-creation strategy. We've taken steps to ensure that even
during a period of high investment in all these great growth opportunities, that we are rewarding investors right now.
We are building in the components to see the strategy run full out as we bring on significant growth investments, many
of which come online in 2015 and just beyond our current guidance period. We are investing to connect the best supply
areas with the best markets, but we're also investing in ways that focus on fee-based that is largely resilient to
commodity market fluctuation businesses.
This is the foundation of our strategy to reward our investors with growing cash dividends and distributions, and we
believe those characteristics also will produce high-value growth. It certainly, from our vantage point is the best

opportunity we have to deliver great shareholder value, both now and in the future.
So let's get into the meat of the presentation today. Following a few comments from me as I go through these slides, I
along with the management team that John introduced earlier look forward to hearing from you.
Moving on to slide five here, which covers the key headlines for today's earnings and guidance discussion, the big
stories here. First, the growth in our fee-based business at Williams Partners was a major driver in our second-quarter
results. Keep in mind that strong performance was up against even less favorable NGL margins in this quarter, and the
unexpected impact of our Geismar olefins plants, which was down for about 20% of the period and obviously related to
the tragic incident that we experienced there in June.
Second, we are again reaffirming our strong growth guidance for our cash dividends and distributions. We continue to
expect 20% per year growth in Williams cash dividend in each of the three years in our guidance period. And for
Williams Partners, we continue to expect strong cash distribution growth of about 9% here for 2013, and about 7%
annually in each 2014 and 2015.
Third, we're updating our earnings and DCF guidance with the modest changes to reflect lower NGL margins and our
assumptions related to Geismar, including the projected restart date and insurance proceeds. So we will spend a little
more time on that here in a moment.
And I want to call out how things are developing from an investor perspective with our olefins business at Geismar.
That's where, as you know, we experienced an explosion on June 13. For all of us at Williams, it was a significant, both
personally and professionally, and also from an operations standpoint. During my tenure at the company, we haven't
had to endure or experience anything like that, and I can tell you it was an event that I am very mournful of, on the one
hand. On the other hand, I've been very impressed at how our professionals across this business have pulled together to
respond to it in a way that is keeping with our culture, and now getting back and working hard to overcome from the
incident.
From a financial perspective, we continue to expect that our insurance policies will significantly mitigate the financial
effects of the incident, and we expect to resume operations at Geismar in April and bring – in April of 2014 – and bring
the expansion into operations immediately thereafter. We have updated Williams Partners guidance to reflect our
current assumption about the financial impact of the Geismar incident.
In addition to the Geismar impact, our updated guidance also reflects the expected NGL margin to deteriorate in 2014.
Even though we did – we have lowered our NGL margins for 2013 and 2015 as well, I would tell you that we were –
we've been able to overcome that other positive, so really the only area that we're lowering guidance on is for related
NGL margins, is a little bit of modest reduction for 2014.
Fourth, we expect Williams Partners DCF to increase by 66% between 2013 and 2015 as our large inventory of
projects, and most of these as you know are fee-based, continue to come online, and what's notable here as well as that
we expect the impressive growth to come even as we see continued pressure on the NGL margins as I spoke to earlier.
Finally, we'll quickly touch on a few of the recent operational developments that support our broader strategy. One
that's particularly noteworthy is the progress that we're making on the Bluegrass Pipeline project that is now included in
our guidance.
Before we move to the next slide, I want to make sure that we're clear about Williams support for Williams Partners
distribution during this period of high investment and the extraordinary growth opportunities that we continue to seize.
As you'll recall in May, Williams announced we would support WPZ's cash distribution and coverage ratio at a level of
about 0.9 by waiving the $200 million in incentive distribution rights. Today that $200 million is unused, untapped
because Williams Partners' strong second quarter performance yielded a year-to-date coverage of 0.92. So, great news
there that, due to the strong DCF at Williams Partners in the second quarter, we remain without having to use that IDR
waiver. So we're very excited about that.

Let's move on to slide six here. The major story here is that we're seeing the tangible benefits of our growing fee-based
businesses and what it meant in the second quarter is that we delivered solid results even in an environment of weaker
NGL margins and the significant impact of the downtime at Geismar. At Williams we had our second quarter adjusted
segment profit plus DD&A was up 7% compared with a year ago, and for Williams Partners our second quarter
distributable cash flow was almost one-third higher than year-ago levels.
The primary driver of the DCF increase at PZ of course was the strong contribution that Geismar made in the quarter
prior to the June 13 incident, and of course as you'll recall that asset was dropped down in the fourth quarter of 2012
and as you know it is producing tremendous distributable cash flow, all substantially secured as we've mentioned to
you and we'll provide a little more detail. We know there's been quite a bit of confusion on the insurance coverage and
this package that we sent out, we hope helps to clarify that, but we're glad to say that our business interruption
insurance is helping secure a significant portion of that expected DCF.
Getting this asset back in service with safe and reliable operations and expanded volumes is clearly one of our top
priorities for the company right now and we've got a great team of professionals that have got their hearts and minds
into making that happen and are making great progress on that. For WPZ we are pleased to report that our fee-based
revenue grew 9% over the second quarter of 2012. During the second quarter we saw Western volumes recover from
the earlier winter conditions of the first quarter and we also benefited from the continued volume growth in the
Northeast as well as the startup of some of our new facilities.
Another driver of our improved DCF versus the prior year was lower maintenance CapEx and this is primarily driven
by reductions in our Western segment as various projects wrapped up in 2012.
Additionally, we saw another significant drop in NGL margins of 13% from the prior quarter, so from the first quarter,
which were already pretty low compared with what we've seen in recent year, and in fact the NGL margins for the
second quarter were down a full 44% from the prior year. So I think this is very significant that even despite these
continued declines in NGL margins, you're seeing our business start to ramp out of being affected by that and really
starting to grow from the strong impact of the growth in our fee-based volume. So our strategy is really starting to take
hold in terms of those investments and we think this is really kind of a turning point this quarter as we start to
overcome those declines with the growth in that business.
We continue to be very excited as well about our Access Midstream Partners investments as they reported a strong
second quarter with their adjusted EBITDA increasing about 71% over the prior year second quarter, and for our
second quarter equity earnings we recorded $18 million in our adjusted segment profit plus DD&A column.
In Williams NGL and Petchem Services business we saw higher volumes lead strong growth up nearly 50% in adjusted
segment profit plus DD&A versus the prior year.
So with that good news, let's move on to slide seven and review the Williams Partners guidance. So now we're looking
forward here a bit. In addition to the strong second quarter we remain very optimistic about our business for the balance
of the year, despite the fact that we're lowering the margins on the heavies a little bit because we just haven't been able
to see that increase that we've been hoping to see in the propanes and butanes, and so we did lower that a little bit, but
the fact that our fee-based business has been growing and we've been able to do such a good job around managing our
cost is allowing us to hold guidance on that basis. What really is impacting guidance here in 2013 was the impact of the
Geismar incident.
So the big story here is we continue to expect tremendous growth in the PZ distributable cash flow. In fact we are
expecting DCF to grow by 66% increasing over $1 billion in just this two-year period from end of 2013 to end of 2015.
This growth is driven by WPZ's in-guidance CapEx, which is averaging about $3 billion per year right now, and our
latest guidance for WPZ's DCF includes modest reductions for this year and next year. For 2013 the effect of the
Geismar incident is the key driver and if not for that we would have seen hopefully actually a raised guidance, because
we've been able to reduce cost and continue to grow our volumes at a pace that is even better than we were hoping for.
For 2014 our expectation of NGL frac spreads is remaining very low, and due primarily to the lower assumed values
for the heavy part of the barrels I mentioned earlier, and this really is the key driver in the change here for 2014. There

are a number of other moving parts in there, but – including in some of our projects and first flow dates on some of
these projects that are backing up, but for the most part we're – again we're able to offset that through other
improvements, so it really is just boiling down to the NGL margin reduction there and we think we moved this down to
a fairly conservative level.
I know there is a lot of interest in how we're thinking about the Geismar effect in our financial forecast. We have a slide
in the appendix of this presentation that shows what we've included for business interruption insurance and how it is
recorded in our financials for both GAAP and the non-GAAP measures.
Our 2015 distributable cash flow guidance continues to be strong and importantly does not incorporate any support via
IDR waivers from Williams, and with more than three quarters of our gross margin coming from fee-based business by
2015 we have created a cash flow stream that is more resilient to changes in commodity prices, and our 2015 forecast
does include an expectation of lower commodity margins yet we were able to hold it where it was again due to
improvements in some other piece of our business.
I do want to make one point on guidance within the segments of Williams Partners. You'll note that the Northeast
Gathering and Processing segment profit guidance is lower throughout the guidance period. It's important to understand
that this change is really driven as a result of a reallocation of support cost among our WPZ segments. It's not an actual
increase in WPZ's overall cost structure, again, just an allocation amongst the various regions. So bottom line our
guidance now more accurately reflects support costs that are being increasingly allocated to support the tremendous
growth that we're experiencing in the Northeast and this accounted for about $30 million lower segment profit for 2014
and 2015 and a little less than that for 2013.
So that's a good overview of our guidance changes for WPZ, which of course is a major driver for WMB's earnings and
cash flow.
So let's move on to slide eight to review Williams and Williams Partners CapEx and investment guidance. First, just
focusing on WPZ's capital I'd point out that we did have a number of movements among the three guidance years but in
the aggregate CapEx is consistent with our prior guidance and of course we have lots of additional information about
CapEx guidance at the project and reportable segment levels in our data book which you can find on our website.
Outside of WPZ we have a couple of major developments to discuss. First and most significantly our current guidance
now takes into account the Bluegrass Pipeline project. Our Board recently approved the project and we continue to be
encouraged by the support we're seeing from the shippers. They've recognized tremendous value that Bluegrass has to
offer these very large scale rich gas drilling programs and I can tell you that the producer community out there sees this
as a great resource, but frankly they really are dependent and really extremely interested in making sure that these kind
of a large-scale solutions for clearing these products to advantage markets are going to be in service. And so, I would
just tell you we've been thrilled with the response and the interest in the capacity that we have available for this project
and frankly I suspect that we'll look back in the not too distant future and wish that we had more capacity to have
available for the area.
We are basing our expected investment on a 50% ownership of the pipeline and related frac and storage facilities and
we also included a few notes on how we think about the financing of the project.
We've updated our current guidance to reflect ongoing changes to our Canadian PDH project as well. We've increased
our estimated cost of this project as we've seen similar projects in our sector experiencing some overruns and so we've
always got our ear to the ground and really trying to gain intelligence on what's going on in the space, and we certainly
noticed that some overruns exist out there, and so we are now looking at pushing the in service day into 2017 primarily
to allow for the co-development of the derivative plants that would be designed to take advantage of this geographically
advantaged propylene supply.
We are in the process of negotiating offtake agreements that will dramatically reduce our commodity exposure on the
projects and I'll just tell you the interest that we've seen has been tremendous and we're very excited about this project
and our ability to really convert this into more of a fee-based kind of opportunity for us and at a very minimum really
reducing our commodity exposure on the project. So still extremely excited about the project and, frankly, one of the

advantages we're trying to make sure we capture is to make sure that we get full advantage for the geographic
advantage that producing propylene and propylene derivatives in this area has to offer.
Let's move on to slide nine. As we review the second quarter and the first month of the third quarter it's rewarding to
see how we are executing on our business objectives, bringing new projects into service, setting volume records and
adding new growth projects. These achievements all serve to support our strategy of developing and operating
large-scale energy infrastructure that is connecting the very best producing areas to the very best markets and, as I
mentioned, the growing demand that we're seeing in really all areas that are really positioning themselves to take
advantage of these great low-cost products that we have here in the U.S.
As previously mentioned our Bluegrass pipeline project and the related frac and storage facilities are a major
development. We executed a joint venture agreement with Boardwalk Pipeline Partners to continue to developing this
project and we've designed Bluegrass to transport natural gas liquids from the Marcellus and Utica Shale plays to the
rapidly expanding petrochemical and export complexes on the U.S. Gulf Coast, and as well as the developing petchem
market in the Northeast U.S.
Williams Board approved the project in June and we're now actively engaged in the development work which includes
surveying, environmental studies and permitting activities that are required to really keep this project on schedule. I can
tell you from the shippers' perspective maintaining that schedule is very important and a lot of people really have their
eyes on that; we do have an aggressive schedule out there and as a result we've got to move quickly on the permitting
and environmental stage. Of course the beauty of this project, one of them, is the ability to use the Texas gas line which
greatly reduces the exposure we have to permitting activities along a large portion of the route.
In our Atlantic Gulf business we made significant progress on various fronts during the last three months: as I
mentioned earlier tremendous amount of growth going on on Transco but as well in the deep water. We're pleased to
have reached an agreement in principle settling all issues in our Transco rate case during the second quarter, and the
agreement is in line with the new rates that we started booking in the first quarter of this year, and as you would expect
the new rates are reflected in the current and the most recent guidance that we provided in May. So, in other words,
steady as she goes on that front. The team did a great job of getting that settled quickly and in line with our
expectations. So we're very excited to have that behind us and have that piece of our execution strategy checked off.
In the deepwater Gulf we executed another tieback agreement for our Devils Tower prospect and we believe there is
strong potential for another tieback agreement as well in the area. These tiebacks are very powerful because of the very
limited amount of capital required to bring these tiebacks on and, as you know, they produce a very meaningful amount
of free cash flow and certainly this latest tieback that we've reached agreement on is no exception.
New projects coming into service are key drivers in the strong performance in our Atlantic Gulf operating area. On our
Transco System those expansions largely are in support of growing power generation load. We've recently placed our
mid-South expansion into service, this added about 130,000 decatherms per day of fully contracted long-term capacity
connecting Transco Station 85 to serve power generators in the North Carolina and Alabama markets as well as a local
distribution company in Georgia.
Just to note on that and remind you, last fall we placed the first phase of this which is about 95,000 decatherms per day
into service in same time last year. So we just keep clicking off these base hits that continue to grow the firm revenues
and firm service on Transco.
Another important note for this period, I'm sure there will be a lot of questions around this, because of our, the
Transco's positioning in the Southeastern United States we really are uniquely positioned to help meet the growing
demand in Florida. As a result, we worked with Spectra to develop a winning solution to service this large-scale growth
opportunity as the FPL went out for an RFP for service in the areas you all very well aware of. So as a result of that
Transco will be expanding its system from Station 85 up to an interconnecting point with Sabal Trail near our Station
105 and Sabal Trail Partners will then lease this capacity from Transco's on a long term and cost of service basis. And
in addition Williams Partners has an option to acquire a meaningful but a minority interest in the Sabal Trails project.
The options gives a chance to better understand -because of the timing of the option it gives us a chance to better

understand the construction risk and the volume risk that ultimately will be associated with this bold project.
We also took an important step on pace with our schedule for the Constitution Pipeline. In June we filed an application
with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to seek approval and build and operate this 124-mile pipeline that by
2015 will connect Marcellus gas production around our Susquehanna Supply Hub in Northeast Pennsylvania with key
Northeast markets, and of course these markets are continuing to grow mostly from power generation as well and of
course from the benefits of low-cost natural gas. And that does interconnect into the Iroquois and Tennessee gas
pipeline in upstate New York. The Constitution design supports transportation of about 650,000 decatherms of natural
gas per day.
In the Northeast Gathering and Processing business we are seeing important progress in putting the infrastructure in
place to meet the demand of growth from the Marcellus and Utica Shale plays and we are continuing to steadily
increase gathering volumes in the Northeast. Keep in mind that we have exposure to this terrific growth through both
assets that we operate and those investments for us that are operated by ACMP and our Blue Racer joint venture with
Caiman and Dominion.
Now on our operated assets we set record monthly average volumes for June and where we eclipsed more than 1.8 BCF
per day of gas, not bad considering when we started just a few years ago there, and for the quarter we gathered 76%
more gas on our operated assets in the Northeast than we did in the second quarter of last year, so tremendous growth
pace that we're on there. And I think you'll continue to see tremendous records set there, and in fact here in July our
team in the Northeast there topped their June record by gathering over 2 BCF a day on our operated assets in the area.
So our team just keeps expanding that and so we are very excited to see the kind of volume growth we've got there.
And also on the Susquehanna Supply Hub expansions we are working very hard to keep pace with Cabot's rapid growth
up there. Team's doing a great job of working with Cabot and they are a formidable group to try to keep up with their
very successful drilling program and we are as excited as anyone to see them add their sixth rig coming up here in
August. So a lot going on up there and great example of how infrastructure and drilling programs need to be
coordinated well together.
In our Ohio Valley midstream franchise we added another train there, so this will be the third train to our Fort Beeler
facilities. So continuing to execute on the build-out of our infrastructure there, and as planned we placed into service
three condensate pump stations in the second quarter to maximize liquids to Moundsville and to make sure that we're
getting the liquids, the vast amount of liquids that continue to grow rapidly in that field. And so, as Frank Billings laid
out for you at our Analyst Call, he laid out several milestones that we need to execute on and we are clicking those off
on schedule.
On slide 10, we'll review the array of growth CapEx spending and the timeline for expect these projects to begin
generating revenue. So if you'll look here at the large CapEx platform we're managing on this slide you can see all of
our major projects that will be coming online here extending into 2017 with our Canadian PDH project. Fundamentally
this is the same way we presented our CapEx by project outlook at our Analyst Day in May, and in addition to marking
a couple of projects that are now complete, including the Fort Beeler TXP III project, the most significant updates
relate to the inclusion of the Bluegrass Pipeline project and the Canadian PDH project as we just discussed.
A few things to point out on this as well: first, the investment WMB made in ACMP is above and beyond what you see
listed here and we expect all of their strong growth prospects will be self- funded. Second, with the exception of the
WPZ Geismar expansion and the WMB Canadian projects all the remaining projects are backed by fee-based revenues.
And, finally, I would just highlight that this page concisely summarize what we must execute on in order to achieve
sustainable growth in cash dividends and cash distributions.
These are projects that are well-known and well-understood, many are well into the construction phase. Our growth is
highly dependent on our ability to execute on this vast array of value-creating projects and not so much directly on
NGL margins as has been in the past. It also is obvious from looking at the slide that it will be 2015 before we begin
realizing the full value potential of most of these investments and thus that 66% growth we see in DCF occurring in
2015 from our 2013 expected results.

So, moving it here to the close before we move to the Q&A session, I'll just provide a few closing comments here. First
of all, our fee-based business continues to grow and the second quarter results are strong indication of the success of
that strategy and our fast-growing resilience to commodity market fluctuations. In fact , when you think about it in a
quarter where we lost our single largest commodity margin generator in the name of the Geismar plant for 20% of the
period we still had a very good quarter.
We continue to make significant investments in areas where we can realize large-scale and lower cost of operations,
and we're absolutely committed to focusing on areas where we can achieve our number one or number two position,
not because we want that for bragging rights but because we think that puts us in a position to have sustainable
long-term dividend growth of the kind you've come to expect from us.
We've seen that in our Transco system and the west operating area and we're making similar investments in the
Northeast to drive this additional growth, not just through this guidance period but well beyond this guidance period.
Williams is working to connect the very best supply areas with the very best market areas and we've assembled a very
strong management team in our operating areas and in our E&C areas. And so, we're very committed to helping deliver
this growth in profitability that we know is – we can achieve as we execute against this strategy.
The strategy is providing us with so many great investment opportunities that we are in the envious position of picking
the very best risk-adjusted return projects that the market has to offer and we think over the long haul of course that is
going to provide superior shareholder returns over and above our peers, both in the near term, but especially over the
long haul, and we certainly look forward to sharing our success with our investors as we move forward.
Thank you for your interest in our company. We'll be happy to take questions now.

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Stephen Maresca with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Hey, good morning, everybody.
<A>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Thanks for all the detail. Alan, I want to talk first on Bluegrass, you seem pretty confident
in the project, obviously it's now in guidance. What's your view on what sort of commitments you expect to move
forward on it, what are the next steps we should hear about in terms of permitting, you mentioned getting commercial
agreements later this year, and then finally on that, do you expect to own just 50% of this or more or less if the project
plays out?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, it's kind of hard to speculate on the ownership interest [ph] of course then it'd be up
to Boardwalk and (36:45) their decisions there. But I think as things stand, and we are so confident in the market
demand right now on the asset, that I would expect that they would carry through with their plans just because I think
the returns are going to be very attractive relative to other options in the market.
I would say from a volume commitment standpoint, remember that we have a number of opportunities that came to us
through the Caiman acquisition in terms of the liquids there at that facility as well as we have the dedication that we
receive from Chesapeake, and we also have other parties where we had the processing rights on various gas streams out
there as well that give us a pretty nice base, frankly, of volumes to build off of, and while we wouldn't be going
forward on the project if we thought we could only get to that 200,000 barrels a day or so of production I would just tell
you that we're seeing very strong interest from some of the larger players out there that really recognize how much
value this is going to mean to the acreage out there and perhaps even see it as a strategic advantage in terms of being
able to acquire acreage in the area.

So, I would just tell you the excitement's been pretty big on this from the customer base. These are very long term
commitments that we're looking for, and of course those take some time to gain corporate approval on, but I would just
tell you that I'm not sure we could be asking for any better response than we've received to-date from the shipper
community.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. And do you – just a final on that, in terms of the ownership. Is it something where
you have an option to increase if you want? Or is it again something where you both have to agree to change that
ownership percent?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I am going to have Jim Scheel, who's been right in the thick of that, answer that.
<A - James E. Scheel>: Williams and Boardwalk negotiated an agreement where they have an option to be a 50%
partner; however, if they chose not the exercise that right, Williams has the option to go ahead with the pipeline
unilaterally.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay, that's helpful. Appreciate that. And then moving, Alan you talked about the
opportunities at the Florida market for Transco has on the expansion side, but also you mentioned about potential
ownership of Sabal, would that be something that again at your option you could purchase, would it be from Spectra or
would it be from the NextEra portion of it, or any sort of color on that?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes, sure. It would be from the project as a whole, from the Sabal Trail project as a whole,
is what our option would be on, and it – and again just to make it clear we will be supplying basically the volumes in a
phased approach on the front end of that project [ph] if we get (39:50) Transco. So we are basically the supply source
by expanding to a point that reduce the amount of construction, greenfield construction required for Sabal Trail, so we
are the front end of that and Sabal Trail is going to lease that capacity with a return that's consistent with our cost of
service return, so eliminates our construction and volume risk on that. And so we have that investment which we've
found very attractive, and then in addition to that we have an option down the road to invest in Sabal Trails and of
course we really like that because it gives us a chance to see how the construction costs look like they are going to
come out, and the volumes, we'll have a much better picture on what the volume commitments look like at that point.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Can you say what percent you could potentially own of it?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No, I would just say it's meaningful but it is a minority position.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay, thanks. Final one for me, you mentioned this. I was going to ask you about the
reduction in Northeast G&P at Williams WPZ in terms of segment profit and DD&A, I think you mentioned it was, so
this is just higher cost, that's what brought that down the $55 million in 2014 and $30 million in 2015? I just want to
make sure I am understanding....
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. It's primarily just an allocation. So we have things like our engineering and
construction cost, our technical support for operations, accounting, all those things that we allocate as a corporation out
against our various operating areas, and because we've got so much growth in the area and we're applying so many
resources to it, we studied our cost across those areas and applied those more appropriately to real expenses. So, it's not
really a shift in our overall cost against the company, it's just the reallocation of overhead cost to that area.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. So not a new cost or a higher cost, just taking it from where it was accounted or
allocated before and putting it into this segment?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: That's exactly right.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. Thanks a lot for all the color, guys.
<A>: Yeah, thanks, Steve.

And we'll take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Hi, guys.
<A>: Morning.
<Q - Christine Cho>: CapEx looks like it went up by $2.7 billion across 2013 to 2015. Assuming some sort of
increase over the $1 billion cost number that I think you originally gave us for the PDH facility, is the remaining mostly
tied to Bluegrass or are there other large ticket items in there that were either included or taken out, out of the
three-year guidance?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Christine, this is Don Chappel. It's almost entirely Bluegrass, there's some other moves as
you mentioned, but it's largely Bluegrass.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. And then would you be able to give us I guess some sort of idea on what the cost increase
is looking like for the PDH facility, is it materially over, or like 20%?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No. I would just say again we kind of came at that with an initial estimate that was very
rough and the return was so attractive on it that we decided to proceed, because even at a overrun that would have been
– or an increase in our estimate that would have been much higher which still would make sense, and I would just say
that cost did not go outside of that range.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: It's just higher than what we earlier had in our guidance. But more importantly I think that
the point to be captured there is that as we looked at the project we realized one of the fundamental benefits, and what I
would call industrial logic that underpins the project , is the fact that we have got the ability to transport propylene
derivatives rather than propylene itself into markets that are much closer than transporting the propylene all the way to
the Gulf Coast and then turn around and transporting the propylene derivatives back to the Midwest markets and to,
particularly the Northern Midwest markets. And so by getting the propylene derivative business built there we are
positioning ourselves to be able to capture some of that transport and logistics advantage and so we want to build that
complex in concert with those derivative plant and there may be some optimization opportunity between the propylene
plant and the derivative plant.
Now, having said that don't hear us say that we're going to go into the propylene derivative business, that's not at all
what we're doing here, and in fact we're going to do this in a way that's going to reduce our commodity exposure to
propylene but it does allow us to optimize the construction of the facilities and again to enjoy some of the benefits of
the logistics through the pricing structure.
<Q - Christine Cho>: I see. So net-net would you say that your returns overall look better than when you originally
looked at it, or do they kind of just off – does everything kind of just offset each other?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I would say our returns will be lower than what we originally thought, but I would also tell
you that they are going to be a whole lot lower risk because of our converted to more fee-based business.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay, thanks for that color. And then in your presentation slide when you talk about equity
funding for Bluegrass, you say WPZ investment and then you wrote WMB and/or third parties, can you just clarify,
when you say third parties, do you mean that you are willing to sell a portion of your interest in the Bluegrass project or
sell your interest in some of your other assets like we've seen you do with Constitution, I don't know maybe with some
of your assets in Canada, etcetera, to raise the cash?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Christine, this is Don Chappel. I'd just say we have a lot of options, WPZ is our preferred
funding source, so to the extent that we need equity our preference would be for WPZ to fund that versus Williams, but
there are a number of other sources, we expect that other parties will have interest in equity in Bluegrass. We may not
choose to give any of it up, but it's really what you see there on the slide is just an expression of, we've got quite a few
options, and in the near term, to the balance of this year and into next year at least, early next year, we'll be funding this

with excess cash at Williams and beyond that we'll have some choices to make, but for the next couple of quarters, two
or three quarters, it's really funding with excess cash flow to Williams.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay, great. And then lastly for me. In the Northeast it looks like OVM volumes were slightly
revised down in 2014 and 2015 while Susquehanna was raised. Can you just verify that's the case and can you also
provide a number for what volumes are today at OVM?
<A - Francis E. Billings>: Sure, this is Frank Billings. I would say that we did revise volumes down a little bit. The
majority of that as this we have – we actually have derisked a little bit to the OVM volume forecast because we had a
customer identified in our forecast, and we've actually executed it an agreement to have then become a true customer
versus a forecasted customer, and with that we've got a revised drilling program, drilling schedule from them, and
we've basically included that in our forecast as well as one of our existing customers, revised slightly their drilling
programs for 2013 and 2014. So, that's the main driver for the volume adjustments I would say in OVM.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay, great. And then can you provide a number for what volumes are today at OVM?
<A - Francis E. Billings>: Yeah, right now we're moving around – today kind of we're moving around 250 to 260 but
we do have some volumes that are not moving. We've hit a peak volume in excess of 300 million a day in OVM and
right now what is happening is we have a couple of customers: one is drilling and fracking a new well so they've shut in
some production around that well frac so that they don't – for whatever reason I guess they want to protect or manage
that activity. And then we have another customer that's having some permitting issues on one of their well pads, so
they've to shut in some production as well.
But I can tell you that we're also, we have multiple producers out there that are in the process of completing some wells
and I think – we know, we see the activity that we expected to see from the producers in OVM this summer as they're
trying to get some work done before the fall and winter season hits. So I think we're on the right trajectory and I just
think what we have is, when we lose 30% of our volume, or 10% of our volume, 30 million a day for producer activity
you know, it shows up at this point, but I can tell you that in OVM today we are operating well mechanically. All of
our mechanical and operational issues are few at this time and I think we are in a good position to move the volume
that's behind the system today, and when we complete the work for, that we had talked about in the first quarter call
around the facilities that we're going to get in place, I think we are going to be in great shape for the rest of the year.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay, great. That's it for me. Thank you so much.
<A>: Thank you.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Good morning, everyone. My first question is on Transco and some of the opportunities you're
seeing around that asset. We've seen Leidy pricing and just pricing around the dry gas area, the Marcellus, come under
a lot of pressure. Is that adding to kind of inbound producer demand and maybe even some inbound demand side or
utility demand for capacity on projects to get out of the northern PA and Northern New Jersey markets like Leidy
Southeast and Constitution?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Bradley, this is Rory Miller. Good question. In fact, when we closed out our Leidy Southeast
project, we had very robust demand but we've had a number of producers sort of call back saying if they could get in to
see if it was not too late to open the door and get on the project. So I think we've got over 8 BCF a day of pipeline
interconnects and capacity connected to bring gas into Leidy, and as those new connections see additional wells drilled
behind our system and behind those interconnects, people are finding they need to get a way out. So we think there's an
excellence chance for additional expansion up there somewhere down the road but very much a supply-push situation.
We've talked a lot about the quality of the Cabot reserves, quality of their wells up there. But we're seeing that sweet
spot extend West of there as well. So, even though it's a dry gas area the EORs on those – or EURs on those wells are

so robust that the economics at the current gas prices are very compelling. So, we see a big supply push coming out of
that area and we're looking at a number of opportunities to help satisfy that demand from producers.
Likewise, we talked a lot at Analyst Day about all the power generation opportunities up and down the system. We
continue to see those opportunities roll in the door. So, there's a fantastic opportunity for us to match up demand-pull
with supply-push and we think that's going to keep new projects coming for years into the future.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: But no plans today on the table to expand either the Leidy Southeast or the Constitution project?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Right now we're probably focused on the Leidy opportunity and I would just say we're early
on in that, but something could be coming out here in the near future.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Okay. And on the Bluegrass project, as you look at the pipeline fractionation storage integrated
nature of that project, is the $2.7 billion, give or take, that you discussed as being largely Bluegrass-related in your
CapEx budgeting, does that include an export facility and do you think that you would need to enter into a JV or some
kind of economic sharing agreement with someone who has an existing export facility or existing acreage on the Gulf
Coast in order to get that done?
<A - James E. Scheel>: Bradley, this is Jim Scheel. We are – we have not included in the guidance number the export
facility. We are still defining that at this point. We have seen a great amount of interest from our customers for that,
they do view the international markets as the logical destination for many of the propanes and butanes. We have
identified a site and we're moving forward to acquire that. As it relates to the cost of that we're still defining it and we'll
include that in future guidance.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Okay, great, and just a follow-up on some of the PDH questions from earlier: the PDH as well as
the ethane recovery costs appear to have increased since the Analyst Day, is that indicates that PDH – something
related to kind of overall labor and cost trends in Western Canada or are those two separate issues? And on PDH, you
know, Alan, you mentioned that you would rule out entering the propylene derivative business. Is there any reason
specifically that you ruled out providing your own polypropylene facility just to expedite that process?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, I'll take the last half of that and then I'll ask Fred Pace who runs our engineering and
construction to answer your question on the fundamentals and the construction cost in Alberta.
On the derivative side I would just say that, as you move further and further downstream, that starts to become more
and more knowledge that is outside the base of our operations today and I would just say we have so many
opportunities that are right down our fairway of knowledge that it doesn't really entice us to move outside of the area
that we have strong knowledge in. And so, we're excited to partner with others that have both the marketing expertise
and the operations expertise that can help bring the value to that.
So, said another way we're not really all that motivated to learn some new lessons when we have such great
opportunities in front of us right now. And so that's really driving that decision. And I'll ask Fred to answer the
questions around the cost pressures in Alberta.
<A - Fred E. Pace>: Yes, on the PDH cost outlook, kind of playing on Alan's earlier comment about our observance of
other projects having cost pressure, we've analyzed that and done a much better job of also analyzing all of our other
risks around availability of labor and contract personnel and materials – our entire supply chain around that. So that's
just our best current thinking and guidance around our current risk analysis to come up with our current outlook.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Okay, great. And just one more, and I'll get out of your hair.
The Atlantic Gulf segment, you reduced kind of 2013 and 2014 guidance fairly significantly after the first-quarter call.
Now you've kind of printed two strong quarters in a row in the Atlantic Gulf segment. Really the kind of
Transco-related seasonality really wasn't visible on those results, and so you've kind of printed $300 million of segment
profit in the first half of the year, and you've kind of guided towards a full-year segment profit in the low $500 million
range. Is that – is it correct to imply a decline in the second half of the year, or is that just a segment that has I guess
outperformed since the first-quarter reporting?

<A - Rory Lee Miller>: This is Rory Miller again. I think the guidance that we included in the book showed us
outperforming guidance maybe $30 million on a full-year basis. So I think we're going to be able to hold on to some of
that. About two-thirds of that revision is attributable to lower O&M and G&A, and we've been working hard, I think as
Alan mentioned earlier, to control expenses. And I think a lot of that is – will be sustainable improvements.
We also had some other minor issues that are helping out. We did have an increase on our liquid transportation rates on
Transco for condensate and retrograde. That combined with a little higher DD&A and then a reimbursement for some
engineering cost from Gulfstream accounted for about a third of that $30 million.
So that's a lot of detail. But a number of those are sustainable-type items. Of course, the engineering reimbursement
would be a one-time event.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Okay, great. Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Good morning, guys. You know, you really recovered very well from the tragedy in June, and
congratulations to everybody for keeping their eye on the ball, both personal and professionally.
<A>: Thank you.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Couple of quick questions. Does the business interruption insurance into 2014 – say for the
first quarter – cover the delayed startup of the expansion on Geismar?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Craig, this is Don. I think the answer is yes. Basically, the policy covers our losses. So it's
a comparison to what we would have made, had the event not occurred, to what we did or didn't make as a result of the
loss. And obviously we have a responsibility to minimize the loss, and we would do that with or without insurance.
So we're interested in getting the facility back up and running safely as quickly as possible, including the expansion.
But the repairs are really the critical path item, and the expansion will be complete, along with the recovery and the
turnaround. And we expect that to be covered.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. And, Don, while I have you on the line, there was a little uptick, at least for the quarter,
in the tax rate. But I don't think the full year has changed in terms of guidance. Can you give us some color on that?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: I think the full year is down a little bit because of some additional bonus depreciation we
were able to identify. And then just a function of continuing to refine the numbers. I think the quarterly numbers are –
tend to move around a little bit, depending on the profitability and where that profitability is.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. And then finally, I wonder if you all could just give a little more color, because I think
there were some prepared comments regarding it, and then also just recently some comments about attacking O&M and
G&A that's helping the Atlantic Gulf segment. But could you all discuss in a little more detail the success you seem to
be having with cost containment, especially in 2013, to offset some of the headwinds we're seeing?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, I would just say we've all made a concerted effort on that front. And as you know,
we went through some very significant organizational restructure, post the spinoff of WPX.
And I would just say that we are positioned and we reorganize ourselves in a way that we can really focus and bring
some transparency to our cost structures and understand the areas of opportunity we have to put pressure on that. And
the team's doing a great job of doing that. So I would just say it's kind of the old-fashioned way.
The good news I would tell you is I think it's very sustainable, and I think we have opportunities to continue to improve
even more. So as we kind of explore new opportunities in a much more integrated company – and so for instance, we're
seeing areas of opportunity between gas pipes and midstream, where previously we operated as completely separate

And we'll take our next question from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Thanks, good morning, everybody. Appreciate the time as we're kind of crossing the hour mark
here. But three perhaps clean-up questions. The first actually on – just with respect to the insurance of Geismar.
Obviously the – you've laid out the expectations. And I guess with potentially only a 60-day lag, that kind of implies a
pretty smooth process. Has there been any contention or friction from the insurers at this point that would give you
pause at all, or is this – do you expect to be a pretty smooth process?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Carl, it's too early to tell. We've not yet filed our first claim. But this is something where
we'll be able to – one, we can present our forecast – the forecast we had before the incident, and that was prepared
without any knowledge of the incident coming. So I think that's pure. There's no bias in that forecast. We can present
that to the insurers now.
We would have our first insured loss in the month of August. That would've been after the 60-day waiting period, but
before the planned turnaround. So there's a small period that's insured – just a couple of weeks of operation between
that 60-day waiting period and when the turnaround would have happened. So we'll be able to submit that at the end of
August, early September, and get response from the insurers on that payment, and that really set the stage for the
balance.
And then we'd be in 50-day turnaround, and so then in October, we would have a partial month again, where we would
have another partial month claim. We'd submit that claim at the end of October, and then we would submit a claim
update every month.
So we think that the 60-day lag is reasonable. It's possible we could get paid earlier or somewhat later, but right now
that's our best estimate.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Appreciate the color on that. The second – and not to perhaps beat a dead horse on the PH
facility, but just given all the cost inflation that we have seen in Alberta and seemingly happening in such a quick
period of time, and you look out with the – the major spending on the PDH would actually happen – is there any
possibility of locking something up turnkey with someone, in order to stem any possible future labor inflation?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, again, I think by stretching our schedule out, we give ourselves a lot more
opportunity around that. And as you'll recall – I think we mentioned this in our original announcement of the PDH
facility, that we were going with a little bit different design than some in the industry had because – and a little bit
smaller – so that we can build that business on a more modular basis. And so that allows us to bid out that modular
construction on a fixed-fee. And so the remaining portion would be the in-the-field construction.
The good news about this project, aside from some of the other projects that have seen a lot of cost pressures, is this
work is at Redwater, which is near Edmonton. A lot of the areas we really had a lot of struggle with in terms of low
productivity and cost pressures has been in the Fort McMurray area, where labor is more constrained and particularly
skilled labor is more constrained.
So I would just say we're taking – we're working hard to contract this in a way that really eliminates a lot of that field
construction labor risk and productivity risk, and stretching the schedule out gives us even more opportunity to do that.

<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Fair enough, and then last question if I could just on Bluegrass. And if you could just refresh on –
I think you probably addressed this in prior conversations. But as you look out at sort of this large material investment,
are you expecting – from the feedback you've heard from shippers, are you expecting a return profile in line with other
sort of large – almost call it FERC-allowed type of traditional infrastructure returns? Or is it the uniqueness of the NGL
solution would allow something higher, more indicative of midstream infrastructure?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, I would say a couple of things allow us with – and remember, only a portion of this is
regulated – the frac and storage business downstream of that is not regulated. So we have that opportunity, if you will,
in terms of better-than-FERC returns.
And I would just tell you we have plenty of regulated cost-of-service returns available to us. And so we wouldn't take
any additional risk or development cost like this, if we didn't expect higher returns than that.
So the answer to your question is we do expect higher overall returns on the project. And one of the things that helped
us achieve that obviously is the benefit of the Texas gas line, and which provides us with a better solution than the
market would otherwise had to offer. And gets us in schedule.
Importantly, I can tell you that from the shipper's perspective, this timing issue – probably can't overstate that in terms
of the importance. Because people have all this acreage up there they're very anxious to go drill, but they're seeing
NGL prices continue to collapse up there in a very oversupplied market, their only option is to transport out by rail, and
even that is getting pretty congested. So I would just say that the market's very anxious for this solution, and the return
we're making is – reaps the benefits of some of the things I mentioned.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: All right. I appreciate the time and the color.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Hi, good morning. Just wondering if you could maybe talk about the risk to achieving that April
resumption date for Geismar. Is it really just mainly I guess the pace of the repairs or does the status of the
investigations play a part at all?
<A - John R. Dearborn>: A very insightful question. Thank you. This is John Dearborn on the answer to that.
If you take a look at it, we've got a few investigations under way, one by OSHA and one by CSP, and of course, the
Williams's own investigation. We're collaborating there in a very open and transparent way with OSHA and CSP, and
as a result of that, over time, over the last few weeks, OSHA and CSP have been – I'll say giving back more and more
of the plant. So that the affected plant now that's still under the control of OSHA is a very small area around the
fractionator itself. And so that's allowing us now to begin to – I won't say demolish, but begin to take apart the
impacted part of the plant.
So pretty quickly here we think that the investigation is going to become less of a risk to our path of rebuild. Then the
question becomes how quickly can we get the equipment and the necessary materials to plant and construct it, and that,
in fact, sets our timeline. Though it's not without risk, we feel pretty confident about the April 1 date. That's why we've
been out with it. So thanks again for the question.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay, and just another follow-up. In terms of the business-interruption insurance, does that cover, I
guess, any obligation or contracts with your supply or sales?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: I'll let John take the question on the sales contracts. I don't think we expect to have any
significant losses in that area. But yes, it would cover.

<A - John R. Dearborn>: And again, very insightful because, of course, our customers are a very important
stakeholder base for us, right? And – but we're going out to continue to build our relationships with our customers.
All of our customers essentially are on force majeure at the moment, and will be over time – [ph] would (71:00) want
to continue to preserve those relationships so that they'll be there when the plant comes back up. So all this information
is actually fresh for our customers. In the coming weeks, we're going to be going out and speaking personally with our
important customers out there so that – as if they are with us on the other end of the start-up.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. And this also applies for any supply sources in terms of ethane?
<A - John R. Dearborn>: We really don't have a concern about the ethane. Essentially the ethane goes back into the
market and probably gets used and consumed by others. So it's not really an issue for us in our business.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Thanks. Just want to understand...
<A>: Ted, we're losing you.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Yeah, sorry. Can you hear me?
<A>: Yes, we can hear you fine.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Yeah, sorry about that. I just want to understand, kind of pick up on Sharon's question – sort of
the range of outcomes, if we're plus or minus the April 1 date on financials, relative to kind of where you are with the
insurance and deductible or whatnot. Let's say we push another quarter out – what does that do it in terms of kind of the
financial impact?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Well, Ted, I think as John mentioned, we have a plan that gets us started back up in April.
You know, if we push that back, at some point we would run out of potentially – or hypothetically we would run out of
insurance, business-interruption insurance.
And the coverage is combined $500 million for both business interruption and property damage. We have a current
estimate on the property damage of $102 million, less a $10 million deductible. So that's $92 million of assumed
coverage at this point. And then as you saw, we disclosed an estimate of $384 million on the business-interruption
coverage. So certainly significant delays would expose us.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay, but at that point then, it's just a matter of sort of – let's call it the lost margin of the
downtime, from that perspective. And obviously assuming the repair costs were the same. Is that fair?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Yes. Again, we have no reason to believe that the downtime will extend past April at this
point. But certainly, as you think about risk, I think you understand it well.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Right, okay. And then just in terms of the distribution growth here at WPZ, it looks like you're
still comfortable running a little below 1 times in 2014. You kept the IDR[ waivers the same. But again if there's some
flex here, in terms of what happens with Geismar, we're just wondering how we should think about what you'll target
for coverage, if the IDR waivers get increased from WMB? Or do we lower distribution growth say at WPZ? Kind of
how those all interplay.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Those are I'll say speculative questions at this point, but clearly Williams enjoys about
75% of WPZ's distribution, so we have a big stake in it. WPZ is our primary equity-funding vehicle and funding
vehicle generally. So obviously it's very important to Williams.

We did waive the $200 million of IDRs. We did not see any point to step forward further on that, at this point. But
certainly we'll consider potential waivers, additional waivers, if and when needed.
So I would just say we'll stay tuned here. If we execute as we have put forth in our plan here today, we don't believe
any additional waivers are required. We look at 2014 at getting closer to 1 times coverage again with a lot of fee-based
growth, and by 2015, getting back to that 1 times coverage number.
So we're comfortable running where we are. And Williams will continue to monitor the situation and see if WPZ needs
any additional support and make the decision accordingly.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Great, I'll leave it at that, thanks a lot.
<A>: Thanks.

And we'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Good morning.
<A>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Thanks for all the color this morning. My question's with regards to the western segment, it
seems like, in the west results were better than we anticipated, and going nicely in the first half of the year. I was just
curious as far as in 2014, you have a bit of a step down there, as far as what you're looking for segment profit and
DD&A, it was only marginally increased, I am just wondering, is that a bit of conservatism or what's kind of driving
the year-over-year step down in guidance there?
<A - Allison G. Bridges>: Well, partly because we do have some contracts that change in 2014. So that is some of the
reduction.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Okay, great. And then last one from me, I was just curious, with this guidance revision, I
think some of the recent ones, seems like maintenance CapEx has been ticking down a little bit for 2014, 2015, I was
just wondering if you touch on the drivers for that?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sure. One of the things is we had some – as we mentioned earlier we had some time
pressures on getting some of our asset integrity work done towards the end of 2012. We completed a lot of that work as
we've laid out in the past, so we kind of had an accelerated effort there to complete some of that work. And as well we
are continuing to take advantage where we can of the integrated nature of our business and looking to really invest that
maintenance capital in ways that reduce risk very best for this company overall. And so I would just say we're
continuing to really analyze that.
Obviously, the thing we are going to spend our dollars on first is keeping the systems safe and reliable and we certainly
won't back off on the cost that it takes to do that and we'll continue to do that. But there are other areas that we can find
ways to improve cost, purchasing power across a lot of our assets which we – when we combine our gas pipes and our
midstream efforts we got a lot of purchasing power, and so we are continuing to find ways to improve on that.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: That's helpful. That's it from me. Thank you.

And we'll take our final question from Christine Cho with Barclays.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Hi, sorry, just some follow-ups. On the PDH facility, if it's going to be in service in 2017 is
most of the CapEx going to take place in 2016 with maybe a little bit in 2015, I just wanted to know how we should

<A - Fred E. Pace>: This is Fred Pace responding, that's exactly right, ramping up in 2015 with the majority occurring
in 2016.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. And then this is just an accounting question, but are you going to be consolidating your
50% interest in Gulf Star and your 41% interest in Constitution? I wasn't clear if you guys – how you guys were
accounting for it in your segment profit guidance?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: John's going to take this one.
<A - John D. Porter>: Yeah, this is John Porter. Yeah, those two assets are shown on a consolidated basis with the
non-controlling interest presented below segment profit.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay, perfect. Thank you.
