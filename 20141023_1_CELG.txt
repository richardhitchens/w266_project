Robert J. Hugin
Thank you Patrick, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. We appreciate the opportunity to review the
achievements of the quarter with you. Our team delivered exceptional results, positioning us for sustained high
performance. We're indeed fortunate to have an outstanding team of leaders at Celgene.
I'm joined this morning by Mark Alles, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will provide his perspective on
the key factors contributing to the operating momentum achieved by our businesses and the catalysts propelling us into
2015 and beyond. Peter Kellogg, our CFO, will review the excellent third quarter and our updated outlook for the
remainder of the year. Peter has already been a fantastic contributor to our leadership team. Jackie Fouse, the dynamic
leader of our hematology/oncology franchise, will discuss the results of this franchise which drives our operating
performance. She will also highlight the key components of future growth. Scott Smith, our I&I leader, will update you
on the progress of the OTEZLA launch in the U.S. and the extensive preparations for launch in international markets.
Having just returned from Vienna, he is well armed to review our strategy for GED-301. Following these presentations,
we'll open the call to questions.
It's an exciting time at Celgene. We have strong momentum across our functions and geographies with extraordinary
opportunities to positively impact patient care and deliver outstanding long-term growth.
Let me now turn the call over to Mark.
Mark J. Alles
Thanks very much Bob. Good morning everyone. Around the world and across Celgene, our teams are generating
excellent results and we expect this operating momentum to continue through the end of 2014 into 2015 and beyond.
Our confidence comes from clarity of purpose, shared core values and obsession for science and innovation and great
people and teams focusing on excellence in execution. We operate in a highly complex and competitive industry, but
have built a business model to consistently deliver superior results, one that is focused on patients through dedicated
therapeutic franchises, core functions critically necessary to drive and support commercialization and an organization
constantly working to produce, partner or acquire next-generation research and technology.
Keeping our focus on this strategic framework has produced another quarter and what we expect will be another year of
outstanding results. These results and our exceptional talent provide us with the opportunity to continue to discover,
develop and deliver new and innovative products for the treatment of some of the most serious unmet medical needs.
Importantly, we are successfully leveraging our model to create an expanding set of research partnerships with
academia and industry that have the potential to deliver multiple breakthrough therapies for many years to come.
Consistently strong operating excellence in the profiles of our inline portfolio have positioned REVLIMID and
POMALYST/IMNOVID as global standards of care for all segments of the multiple myeloma market. ABRAXANE is
a global standard of care for pancreatic cancer with the potential to expand its role further in breast and lung cancer and
VIDAZA as the reference treatment for MDS and AML. With more than 100 planned and ongoing studies designed to
expand the opportunity for these agents and deliver new therapies, our hematology and oncology franchise is well
positioned for long-term growth.

The recent FDA approvals for OTEZLA in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis not only offers patients a new and
therapeutic option, but also created the foundation for a new Celgene franchise with tremendous growth potential well
into the future. And we have already successfully leveraged our I&I focus and leadership team to add GED-301 to our
portfolio. The presentation of GED-301 at the UEGW meeting this week was significant for many reasons. For
patients, the Phase II clinical profile suggests that GED-301 has the potential to positively change the Crohn's disease
treatment paradigm. For Celgene, acquiring global rights to this product is a significant demonstration of our strategic
focus on innovation, our intent to build, grow and leverage our I&I franchise.
We are making excellent progress with our internal and external development pipeline, advancing several important
early-stage compounds and adding external opportunities to sustain innovation. For example, this morning we
announced an agreement with our collaboration partner Sutro Biopharma to develop multi-specific antibodies and
antibody drug conjugates. This new agreement follows our earlier agreement with Sutro and broadens our existing
development stage immuno-oncology pipeline, including new IMiDs, anti-CD47, CAR T, TLR8 and others.
This year began with great promise and potential and we're committed to capturing all of it. Our people, clear strategy,
innovative science and products and intense focus on patients makes us very confident in our longer term outlook.
Thank and you please help me welcome Peter to the call.
Peter N. Kellogg
Thank you Mark, and good morning everyone. It's a pleasure to report our third quarter financial results. The operating
and financial momentum that we saw in first half of the year continued through Q3. Our teams are delivering
exceptional execution in each facet of the business. The acceleration in sales and earnings is driven by a combination of
robust growth across the product portfolio and leverage within our global operating infrastructure.
As we produce these quarterly results, we remain focused on making strategic investments for the future. As Mark
mentioned, this morning we announced an exciting new collaboration with Sutro, in which we made an upfront
payment of $95 million. Now in addition to the collaboration to develop targets, this payment includes an agreement to
manufacture preclinical candidates, consideration for an option to purchase the company in addition to a purchase of
additional preferred stock that brings our cumulative position to 15% of Sutro's outstanding equity. We are able to
make these investments while also continuing to return excess capital to shareholders through our share repurchase
program.
I will now address the operating results for the quarter. Total net product sales growth reached 19%, and accelerated
compared to prior year over year comparisons. Contributing to this acceleration were strong sales for REVLIMID, the
global rollout of POMALYST, IMNOVID and ABRAXANE in addition to the introduction of OTEZLA. While we are
still early in the launch, we are excited to have received OTEZLA's U.S. approval for psoriasis in September, which
adds to the initial indication for psoriatic arthritis that was received earlier this year.
Similar to previous quarters, volume accounted for much of our annual sales growth, contributing 15 of the 19
percentage points. Price contributed the remaining 4 points of growth and reflects the full impact of the U.S. price
increases taken earlier this year in addition to a relatively stable international pricing environment.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.97 grew 24%, exceeding total revenue growth of 18% as we continue to drive a
leveraged P&L. We generated this strong level of profit growth while still investing in the commercial capabilities of
our I&I infrastructure, supporting the global launches in our hematology/oncology portfolio and advancing our R&D
programs. Earnings growth was entirely driven by operating income. The favorable impact of our share repurchases
and taxes was largely offset by higher interest expense associated with the $2.5 billion bond offering in May in addition
to increased hedging related expenses related to volatility in the foreign exchange markets.
Now turning to worldwide net product sales. REVLIMID's year over year growth was an impressive 19%, driven by
strong volume trends in all major geographies. In the U.S., sequential sales grew 6% off a very solid Q2 performance.
Favorable demand trends in Europe and a positive impact from distributor buying in Latin America and the Middle

East resulted in sequential international sales growth of 9%.
VIDAZA's year over year decline reflects the full impact of a generic entrant in the U.S. beginning in Q4 last year.
Internationally, annual and sequential growth in Europe was largely offset by buying patterns in other international
markets.
ABRAXANE posted solid performance with year over year growth of 25%. In the U.S., we saw strong demand in
pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancers that was partially offset by a decline in breast cancer. The momentum in
international markets was driven by European approval of pancreatic cancer earlier this year. Sequential growth was
negatively affected by buying patterns in the U.S. that we expect will reverse in Q4.
The growth trajectory for POMALYST/IMNOVID is robust. Global sales grew 13% sequentially and 102% year over
year. POMALYST's growth is driven by a combination of market share and duration gains in the U.S., and
internationally we continue to launch IMNOVID throughout Europe.
In its first full quarter, U.S. OTEZLA sales were $18 million. As the psoriasis approval occurred in September, there
was minimal impact from this during the quarter. We expect this indication to begin contributing to sales later this
quarter due to the titration packs and other non-revenue generating bridging packs provided to patients while their
reimbursement is processed. Early launch performance metrics around patient access, share of patient starts and source
of business are all favorable and Scott will discuss these in more detail in a minute.
Our attention to operational excellence is producing a favorable P&L dynamic. We improved operating margins by 170
basis points year to date while making strategic investments to support our global brands and advance key research and
development programs. On an absolute basis, R&D grew 12% driven primarily by clinical trial activity in support of
our early to mid-stage pipeline.
SG&A grew 16%, and this largely reflects the commercial activity supporting investments in our I&I franchise and the
global launches within our hematology/oncology franchise. We expect the level of operating expenses to increase in Q4
due to the timing of clinical trial activity across our dynamic portfolio, milestone payments based on progress made in
our partnered programs and our investment in the I&I dermatology sales force, which was effectively in place since late
August.
Our cash generation from operations is strong and provides significant flexibility to deploy capital across a variety of
initiatives. During Q3, we made upfront payments of approximately $79 million in new R&D collaborations,
collaborations including the Sutro agreement that we announced this morning.
We were also active with our share repurchase program, albeit at a slower pace than the first half of the year. We
remain opportunistic regarding the timing of our repurchases and we do continue to view this program as the preferred
vehicle to return excess capital to shareholders.
To complete the picture on our financial metrics, we assess our return on invested capital both with and without cash in
the capital base. Our performance here is very strong and the trend reflects continued improvement in ROIC over the
years. Of course it should be noted that any given quarter or short-term period can sometimes be impacted by cash
accumulation or by business development activities. Our goal is to produce sustained improvements in ROIC over time
as one metric to demonstrate the long-term productivity of our R&D and capital investments, the quality of our
operational execution and the soundness of our financial strategy.
Given the strength in our current business trends, we are updating 2014 guidance. We continue to expect total product
sales over $7.5 billion, but the mix will be slightly different. We now expect REVLIMID sales to exceed $4.95 billion
and for ABRAXANE to achieve sales of approximately $850 million. In addition, the adjusted operating margin is now
expected to trend slightly above 50%. These combined changes drive an increase in our adjusted EPS guidance to a
new range of $3.65 to $3.70.
In summary for the quarter, I'm extremely pleased with the strength of the business and the results delivered by our
teams globally. The momentum that we had in the first nine months of the year continues into the early part of Q4,
placing us right on track for a strong finish to the year.

Thank you, and now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague Jackie.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse
Thanks Peter. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call. I'm very happy to cover our hematology
and oncology franchise results with you today. Our global franchise team is delivering superb results. For the quarter,
total franchise product sales were $1.94 billion, growth of 18% for the year over year comparison and 5% sequentially.
As we will see in a moment, our key brands of REVLIMID, POMALYST/IMNOVID and ABRAXANE all performed
well and across the world our growth is volume-driven as our demand metrics are quite strong.
These brands are leading therapies within their segments and are becoming combination products of choice in multiple
treatment paradigms. In the near term, we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us with the ongoing global
launches of POMALYST/IMNOVID in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma and ABRAXANE in metastatic
pancreatic cancer. In addition, we will see a steady flow of scientific data from upcoming medical meetings and
publications that will continue to support our brands. Over the medium to long term, we will expand our franchise
growth opportunities with global approvals for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma with new data for
REVLIMID in lymphoma and MDS and with new projects advancing within our existing pipeline, including a number
of immuno-oncology projects.
REVLIMID sales this quarter were outstanding and the product grew 19% year over year and 7% sequentially to hit
$1.3 billion for Q3. Growth was strong across all major geographies and sequential growth rose to 6% in the U.S. and
9% for international. REVLIMID continues to lead the multiple myeloma market in overall share in the U.S. and in the
second line in greater setting in Europe, and duration of therapy continues to increase across all major geographies.
We are progressing our global submissions for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in both the U.S. and European
submissions are under active review. Our PDUFA date is February 22, 2015 in the U.S., and we are on track for an
estimated CHMP recommendation in the first half of 2015 in Europe. During Q3, REVLIMID data in multiple
myeloma was featured in two publications in the New England Journal of Medicine, the positive results of MM-020,
the first trial, and [ph] GEMEA RV-209 (17:10), both studies conducted in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
patients, were published in September. In multiple myeloma, REVLIMID now has an unprecedented total of eight
publications in the New England Journal of Medicine, a clear statement for the benefit of a drug that has transformed
the treatment of this disease.
We continue to develop REVLIMID for indications beyond multiple myeloma. Last quarter we mentioned that we have
in hand positive data for REVLIMID from the MDS-005 trial for non-deletion 5q MDS and we'll pursue global
regulatory submissions for this indication, which would significantly increase the size of the MDS patient population
for which REVLIMID would be indicated.
We also announced positive data for REVLIMID in mantle cell lymphoma from the MCL-002 randomized Phase II
study for relapsed refractory MCL. This study will form the basis for our European submission for this indication.
Abstracts for both of these trials have been submitted to the American Society of Hematology Meeting in December.
During Q3, we completed enrollment in the 1,000 patient RELEVANCE trial in first-line follicular lymphoma. This
trial is a Phase III open label randomized study comparing REVLIMID plus rituximab versus rituximab plus
chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma. The study completed enrollment ahead of our
expected timing, and we look forward to the results of this important trial.
This past week, Lancet Oncology published the results of a Phase II, 110 patient open label study of REVLIMID plus
rituximab in untreated indolent lymphoma including patients with follicular marginal zone and small lymphocitic
lymphomas.
Finally, we previously announced in August that the Phase II trial of REVLIMID in combination with standard
rituximab CHOP in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

There is an impressive growing body of data sporting REVLIMID's potential across a variety of indications outside of
multiple myeloma.
POMALYST/IMNOVID further solidified its position in relapsed refractory myeloma as a third line in greater standard
of care and globally grew 102% year over year and 13% sequentially, achieving just over $180 million in quarterly
sales. This growth is driven by increasing market share, duration gains and ongoing country launches across Europe as
the product achieves rapid penetration in the different markets upon reimbursement approvals. We believe the brand's
competitive position will be further enhanced by new data expected at ASH, where we anticipate the presentation of
new results for patients with renal impairment, as well as those for POMALYST in combination with chemotherapy.
Turning to ABRAXANE, year over year sales of ABRAXANE grew 25% driven by the brand's uptake in first line
metastatic pancreatic cancer. Market share in the U.S. in the de novo metastatic patient segment, the target segment of
the IMPACT trial, has reached over 40%. International sales rose 62% year over year and 9% sequentially, primarily as
a result of the ongoing launch of the product across Europe in metastatic pancreatic cancer. The launch in Europe is in
its early days and we expect this indication to continue to contribute significantly to growth for sometime to come.
Sequential sales in the U.S. decreased by 5%, primarily as a result of increased competition in the metastatic breast
cancer market.
In terms of regulatory and clinical developments, on the regulatory front, we have filed for regulatory approval for
ABRAXANE in non small-cell lung cell cancer in Europe and forecast a CHMP opinion sometime during the first half
of 2015.
In terms of clinical progress, the TENACITY Phase II trial in metastatic breast cancer and APACT Phase III trial in the
adjuvant pancreatic setting both continue to enroll as do the ABOUND program trials across non small-cell lung cell
cancer.
We're excited about our collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to study ABRAXANE in combination with
nivolumab in non small-cell lung cancer, and we expect initiation of that trial in the coming months. In addition, we're
working on a number of projects across the immuno-oncology space to explore ABRAXANE's potential as the
chemotherapy of choice in a variety of combination regimens for several solid tumor indications.
Finally, we anticipate that data from multiple cooperative group trials studying ABRAXANE in breast cancer could be
presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Meeting in December. The future for the product is very bright.
The Celgene team is working very hard to prepare for the upcoming American Society of Hematology Meeting in San
Francisco in early December and we are excited about both the quantity and quality of submitted abstracts for this
year's meeting. We are aware of over 150 submissions across all of our brands, across many of our pipeline compounds
and across multiple indications. We think these submissions are evidence of the depth and breadth of our offering
across hematology and I would like to highlight a few of them for you here.
Many of this year's presentations will support and further solidify the position of REVLIMID dexamethasone for the
continuous treatment of multiple myeloma. Included will be subgroup analyses of the MM-020 FIRST trial including
age, depth of response and renal data. In addition, we will see detailed data on the first of the REVLIMID triplet
combinations in multiple myeloma. Data will be presented supporting REVLIMID across all settings in multiple
myeloma, MDS and lymphoma. Included will be the MCL-002 and MDS-005 data I mentioned earlier, as well as data
from the Phase II trial DLC-001 in relapsed refractory diffuse large-B cell lymphoma.
Several presentations will solidify and expand POMALYST/IMNOVID's position in relapsed refractory myeloma. In
addition, we expect to see early data on minimal residual disease in discussion of its predictive role for outcomes in not
only myeloma, but also in other hematological malignancies.
Finally at the meeting, we will continue to highlight the progress we are making with our pipeline projects. We hope to
see data from our partner Acceleron for sotatercept, ACE-011 in MDS, and luspatercept, ACE-536 in both MDS and
beta thalassemia, as well as updated data from Agios for AG-221, our IDH2 inhibitor in AML. We are looking forward
to yet another highly successful and impactful ASH meeting for Celgene.

To summarize, our performance across our key brands and priorities in hematology and oncology is excellent, and we
look forward to a strong finish to 2014 with outstanding momentum moving into 2015. Next year will be a year of
significant commercial activity as we continue to expand the launches of both POMALYST/IMNOVID in relapsed
refractory myeloma and ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer globally, and as we anticipate launches in both the U.S. and
Europe of REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma. Our teams are already preparing for this important milestone in
REVLIMID's evolution and they will be ready when we receive our regulatory approvals.
While we deliver in the near term, we are also working hard to ensure our mid- and long-term success as we both
advance our pipeline of new compounds and generate important data in support of our existing brands. I would like to
thank our global franchise team for the stellar results they are producing. We all look forward to seeing you at ASH in
December.
Thank you, and let me now turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Andrew Smith
Thanks Jackie, and good morning to everybody on the call. These are certainly exciting times at Celgene I&I. In the
third quarter of this year, we've received U.S. approval for OTEZLA in psoriasis. We executed a successful launch in
PsA and we advanced our pipeline, moving Phase III development plans forward for GED-301.
I'd like to first talk about the psoriasis approval. Psoriasis is a large and underserved market. In the U.S. alone, there are
close to 2 million patients suffering from moderate to severe psoriasis and its systemic complications. This is about
four times the size of the market of PsA. Despite available therapies, over 60% of patients with moderate to severe
disease receive only topicals or nothing at all. On September 23, the FDA approved OTEZLA for the treatment of
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, making it the first oral therapy approved in the U.S. for psoriasis in nearly 20
years. We were granted a strong and broad label. Unlike biologic competitors in the space, this label has no
requirements for laboratory monitoring and no black box warnings. Within 24 hours of approval, trained
representatives were in dermatology offices making psoriasis calls. The reception thus far has been very positive.
Now I'd like to turn to the PsA launch. As you can see from this graph, we have seen a significant acceleration in
prescriptions in Q3. From a TRx perspective, we are outperforming all other recent launches in the I&I space. Weekly
prescriptions more than doubled through the third quarter and prescription growth continues to build as we move into
the fourth quarter, leveraging the momentum from the PsA launch and the positive Effects of the recent psor approval.
Q3 was the first full quarter of commercialization and we reported $18 million in revenue.
Now if we look specifically at the PsA market based on our most recent data, OTEZLA outperforms all branded
competitors for PsA in terms of new patient initiations, ahead of established brands like Humira and Enbrel and at just
five months post launch. This represents remarkable early performance, and I believe it indicates the transformational
potential OTEZLA can have for the treatment of psoriatic disease. Beyond share of new patient starts, multiple metrics
are tracking positively for an acceleration of OTEZLA prescriptions and revenues.
In the top right graph outlining source of business, you can see that 80% of patients initiating OTEZLA are coming
from non-steroidals, corticosteroids, oral DMARDs, or are naïve to therapy. Only 20% of patients are coming to
OTEZLA from biologics. I believe this data reinforces the idea that there is high unmet medical need for new and
innovative products in the prebiologic space. Formulary coverage remains favorable, with nearly all patients covered
for OTEZLA and the majority of patients not requiring step-through biologics. The number of prescribers is increasing
and once physicians begin to prescribe OTEZLA, they tend to write multiple prescriptions.
In addition to being very excited about the early launch success of OTEZLA, we are also very excited about the
transformational potential of GED-301. Phase II data for GED-301 was presented at UEGW in Vienna two days ago.
The data from this large multi-center Phase II study is striking, with remission rates that are rapid, durable and higher
than those seen with current biologic therapies. It's important to note that the rates of AEs and SAEs was similar across
all groups in the study, including placebo. We are currently in discussions with regulatory authorities in the U.S. and

around the world, and finalizing the Phase III plans which we are working towards initiating by the end of this year.
Additionally, data from the study has been accepted for publication in a major medical journal.
As I said at the beginning, these are exciting times at Celgene I&I. We've made much progress over the last quarter.
There is still much more to do. We're just at the beginning of the OTEZLA launch for psoriasis in the United States,
and we're excited to see the continued growth in PsA and at the same time, we're also working hard to expand the
geographic and therapeutic footprint of OTEZLA. Our team is working passionately to help ensure we can bring
OTEZLA, GED-301 and other potentially transformational treatment options to patients worldwide in the near future.
I'd now like to turn the call back to Bob.
Robert J. Hugin
Thank you Scott, and thank you Mark, Jackie and Peter. These results reflect the great progress achieved over the past
few years. Today's discussions detailed a number of the important drivers of future success. However, it's impossible in
the short time allotted to fully review the scope of the extensive opportunity at Celgene. We have a significant and
growing list of internal and external programs that have the potential to dramatically improve the lives of underserved
patients all around the world and drive long-term growth for Celgene. We have consistently invested in the future and
are continuing to do so. We are committed to delivering on the promise of Celgene.
Thank you for joining us this morning and thank you to the entire Celgene team for your dedication to our mission, and
for delivering outstanding results. Operator, let's now open the call to questions. Thank you.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Raymond of Robert Baird. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Chris J. Raymond>: Thanks for taking the question. And so question on GED-301, so congrats on the Phase II
data. I know you're probably still working out the Phase III trial design details, but could you maybe put some brackets
around the kind of treatment duration you think we'll need to see to be comfortable on safety and specifically this is on
the sort of theoretical issue around potential fibrosis. Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: So thank you for the question. So just first of all, we've seen no fibrosis or fibrotic events in the
preclinical work in Phase I or in Phase II. We are at this point in time actively engaged with the FDA and other
regulatory authorities around the world finalizing the Phase III plans. Likely those studies would be 52 weeks in length,
which would be normal for drugs in this space in order to accumulate the appropriate safety database, and we hope to
again finalize those discussions and get going on Phase III as soon as possible.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Hi, maybe a similar question for Scott on GED-301. Do you have the sort of dosing
information you need to pick a proper dose and schedule for a 52-week endpoint trial and how should we think about
what type of redosing you'd be doing over the course of that study?
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Yes, so two major things. In the study itself and I.G.O.N. 1, clearly that you see dose
response which leads us to a lot of thinking around where we could go with dosing, what the appropriate dosing would
be. Again nice dose response in that study. The results of some data, a little bit longer-term data that we have that helps

inform us on what that dosing schedule would look like as we move forward in Phase III. So there is significant data,
some of which was presented in the presentation and there will be more data as we get into publication of other things.
But we believe we have a lot of hints in where to go in terms of dosing and duration.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And after investigative meetings, there will be more clarity to the actual protocol itself once
that's finalized.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Thank you for taking my question, as I want to break the mold, I want to ask one on
[indiscernible] (33:46) as well. Scott, can you remind us how endoscopy was used in the Phase I and II studies and how
you envisage it as an endpoint in the Phase III study?
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: In the Phase II study, endoscopy was required, endoscopy or MRI to confirm diagnosis of
active Crohn's disease within six to 12 months of the initiation of the study. Endoscopy post dosing was optional for
patients at the four week time point. No patients decided to opt in for that optional endoscopy at four weeks. We
believe that there will be an endoscopic component to the Phase III program in order to match up histologic changes
with changes that we're seeing from a clinical response perspective. That will be a portion of the Phase III program, but
that's to be decided and finalized as we continue discussions with the authorities.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Hey thanks for taking the questions. I'm going to break the mold. Two questions on
REVLIMID if I may. So first, could you just talk about the impact of volume, inventory and price in the quarter and
maybe year to date? And then separately, I know you made some comments about EU and it sounded like there were
some inventory swings. Could you just expand on what happened in the EU and if you'd expect to see some of that
inventory reverse or what kind of one-time nature that was? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thanks for the question. It's Jackie. So just with respect to the first part of the question,
you asked about the quarter and the year to date. And I think you saw the impact in Peter's slides overall of volume and
price. Growth in the product continues to be volume driven. We do get some positive impact from price in the U.S. The
trends outside the U.S. continue to be for modest price pressure on the product. So the volume's pretty much across the
board when you take the numbers globally are volume or demand or the revenues are volume driven.
I don't really quite understand your comment about inventory, sorry. For Europe, what we did say is that we had some
buying by distributors in Latin America and the Middle East in the quarter that caused a bit of a variance, a positive
variance in Q3. Their buying patterns have been a little bit choppy. We saw some of that in Q1 and now seeing some of
that in Q3. But it's not an inventory issue; it's a distributor buying pattern issue that we highlighted, took place in Q3.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: But in fact to be clear, I don't think we've seen any changes in inventory that impacted the
quarter results whatsoever.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: No change in inventory that impacted the quarter results. Inventory levels have been quite
stable.

<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess going back to GED, a couple things that
KOLs were mentioning when we were chatting with them after the data was, you had such a low placebo rate and then
there was some skepticism that the drug was really working the way it's reported because of the long duration of effect
and short dose. I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit about, you've had a lot of due diligence with this
product. What are your thoughts on those two topics?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: I'm sorry, yes.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Yes, so two components to your question, the scientific rationale for Smad7 and then the
low placebo response that was seen in this particular trial. There has been an ongoing long term idea or theory that
Smad7 is overexpressed in Crohn's disease and other diseases of the GI tract. There's been attempts to get at this and
what we're seeing here is we're seeing through the antisense technology here, silencing the mRNA, were leading to a
reduction in Smad7 protein family, which is then allowing TGF-b to exert its biological effect in the cells. And there's
something around this freeing up of TGF-b and normalization of the levels and functions in TGF signaling within the
cells that seems to have a durability of response, which you're not seeing with other agents in the space. And again, this
sort of durability we see in preclinical models. We saw it in Phase I and we saw it in Phase II again, so it's very
consistent throughout.
The comment on the low placebo rate, there was a lower placebo rate at the primary endpoint in this study because it
wasn't a single point primary endpoint as is seen with most other studies. It was a dual point. The patients needed to be
in remission at day 15 and maintain that remission through week 24 and the purpose of that was to make sure that there
was a lower placebo rate and a higher drug rate so we could really see and take a look at the difference between what is
the normal waxing and waning of disease which can show up in placebo and the actual drug effect. And so that's why
you see it here, is because it was a two-time endpoint as opposed to a single spot endpoint.
And one other question that's come up relative to differences, similarities in CRP levels and other things that I've
received questions around what assays were used; and it was HS, the high sensitivity CRP assay was used in this, and
that generally when that's used and given the numbers that we're looking at with the HS CRP, relatively similar or
normal to what you would see in most of the TNF studies, maybe except the last one or two that were focused on
biologic failure type studies. But CRP was relatively normal for the population given the fact that we used an HS or
high sensitivity CRP screening assay.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber of Citi. Your line is now open.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. And I sort of had a related question. I think, Scott,
you just touched on it. When you look at CDAI in your study, it was 240 to 260. Biologics are around 300. Your CRP
was much higher and also your patients were largely steroid dependent, whereas if you look historically, biologics,
they're only about 30% on steroids. So I'm trying to get a sense here, what's the impact on steroids on CDAI versus
CRP and does that account for some of the variability? That's the one outlier that I'm seeing across studies.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Sorry, Yaron. Yes, I think what you see in this study, in the population in general,
whether you take a look at CDAI, whether you look at CRP, whether you just look at the overall demographics of this
patient population, it is a more normal Crohn's set of patients in demographics than you have seen, particularly in more
recent TNF studies that have focused more on biologic recalcitrant, biologic failure type patients. So it is actually a
more normal Crohn's study. It looks more like the early Crohn's study patient populations and we believe it's highly
representative of what is the largest segment of the market, which is not the TNF failure recalcitrant patients but those
patients who are either ahead of or have just touched TNF. So we believe it's quite a broad population that we study.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael See of RBS Capital (sic) [Yee of RBC Capital]. Your
line is now open.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hey, yes, Mike Yee from RBC. My question's actually on ABRAXANE, just to mix it up a
little bit. This is a drug that consensus has doubling over the next few years, but it's been flattish for the last few
quarters. You did make some comments on competition in breast. Just want to understand what was going on there and
how that may be offsetting lung and pancreatic and what that's going to look like going forward. Is that going to
continue or what's going on in pancreatic? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thanks. Hi Mike, it's Jackie. So just a couple things to reiterate. Shares in pancreas and
lung continue to grow. Obviously I think with pancreas, we were out of the gate with very rapid share uptake and it's a
natural thing over time that the growth in share, even in an indication like pancreas where the product's becoming
standard of care, that growth rate will slow down over time. So I think we're seeing a little bit of that. But shares
continue to grow there.
I think many of you watch the space and know that the metastatic breast cancer segment is quite competitive. So we
have seen generic capecitabine share stay a bit higher than maybe we would have otherwise expected. We've seen one
of the competitors put particular promotional emphasis on their product in the second line metastatic setting, I think
focused more in the last couple of quarters. And as you probably know, a share point in this market translate to pretty
significant dollars. So we've seen some of that. We think we have some ways to deal with that in the competitive
marketplace.
In Europe, the pancreatic indication is really in very early days. So we're seeing that same rapid uptake in Europe when
we get reimbursement approvals and, again, we've got, still, major countries to go ahead of us that will come through
with approvals we hope in the first half of 2015. But there we've got a lot of legs to go with the European situation, so
you should see that and you already saw nice growth in the quarter in international, but you'll see more and more of that
as we go forward.
As I mentioned I think in my comments, the ongoing generation of data publications, presentations at medical meetings
around our inline products is so important. We expect to see a couple of cooperative group trials probably present
breast data in San Antonio in December and you know we can't talk any more about that, as that's an ongoing process
for those abstract submissions and acceptances so on and so forth. But watch out for San Antonio breast this year
because we think there will be some interesting data out there for the product specifically in that indication. We're
happy with the enrollment that we're seeing across our programs as I mentioned whether it's TENACITY, APACT or
the ABOUND program for non small-cell lung cancer. So across all indications, we feel like the development program
is going quite, and the current program is going quite well. Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks for taking the question. And could I ask Peter about cash? Could you give us a
sense of how much of your cash is currently offshore versus onshore and of your cash flow and then talk a little bit
about uses of cash. Your return on invested capital including cash has essentially been flat for the last three or four
years and you're now almost in a net cash position with a lot of cash flow, yet your [inaudible] (45:30) scaled back in
Q3. Why is that and how are you thinking about it? Sorry for all the questions, but it hasn't been touched on.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Sure, be glad to. Thanks Geoffrey. First of all, as you see in our 10-Qs, we always point out
how much cash is in the U.S. and of our total cash position, like many companies that are U.S. based in the IP type
industries like biopharma, the majority of the cash is offshore. Now obviously we do generate cash both in the U.S. and
offshore. And so that doesn't mean that we don't have cash available to us for share repurchase and so on. As you've
seen, year to date obviously the company has been very strong in both working with its capital structure, issuing new
debt and repurchasing a very strong amount of shares back, particularly back in the first half of the year when the stock

actually softened up. So that would certainly be, as I mentioned in the call or in my comments rather, that would be a
good example of being very opportunistic and seizing the moment really well.
I think in terms of our priorities for cash, clearly like every company the first priority is to take care of the strategic
needs of the business and to seize the opportunities that will ensure our long-term performance. And this is an industry
that is very fragmented. There's a lot of business development, collaborations and so forth that have to be done. And so
we are very active in that space, as you know, and our first priority is make sure we're satisfying those strategic needs
of the business.
Beyond that, it's a very lean infrastructure. There isn't a lot of capital spending on a lot of other needs. So we actually
then focus on the return on invested capital chart and so forth to make sure that we're being efficient and returning cash
to shareholders when it starts to build up. As you noted in that chart, without the cash position, you can see our return
on invested capital has continued to grow extremely well and that's just great performance across the franchises and a
continued focus on the operational excellence that keeps us efficient and focused on the most important things and
doesn't allow us to in the sense grow unless it's directly impacting the markets. When you include cash, the ROIC has
been I guess over the last couple years relatively flat, but still albeit at a very good level. Now clearly that's a reflection
of the operating business that has great return on invested capital. And then obviously cash on the balance sheet doesn't
get the same kind of returns and so that's an item that we all have to focus on and think about it on regular basis.
So I think that would be very typical characterization across biopharma. We do think about it a lot. And clearly it's
something that will be on our radar as we go forward because we continue to be cash flow positive. But I can assure
you that once the needs of the company strategically are satisfied, and once we assure ourselves of good long term
growth, then we will be very aggressive in making sure that we're returning cash to shareholders.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum of ISI. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey guys. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I accidently disconnected myself, so I
apologize if I ask a question that's already been asked. Just ignore it. I'm sorry about that. I was just wondering if you
could update us on two things. One, I think there has been some Wall Street speculation that the FDA might be
amenable to filings in follicular lymphoma based on response endpoints rather than PFS/OS endpoints. I was
wondering if Celgene has comments on that and how it might affect filing timelines for the R-squared regimen. And
then I'd just love to take Bob's temperature on the REVLIMID activist case, just your willingness to settle. Is that
something you'd consider or are you committed to litigating this? Thanks so much.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hello Mark, it's Jackie. Thank you for the question on follicular. So I think you are
probably referring to the [ph] flash (49:22) meta-analysis and then some of the discussions that are ongoing there.
Celgene is obviously participating in those discussions. We can't make too many comments about where that's going to
go. Obviously it's going to be a regulatory decision. What I would say is when we think about the RELEVANCE trial
in front line follicular lymphoma, we set that trial up to have a coprimary end point of pathological complete response
at 30 months as well as PFS, so we are well set up in the event that the regulatory decision goes with the surrogate
endpoint for pathological CR as a correlate for PFS. So we're very happy with how quickly that trial enrolled. It was a
number of months ahead of our expectation. So I think as compared to maybe where yours and other thinking has been,
there is some potential for upside in terms of the timeline for a readout of that trial with the pathological complete
response endpoint. So let's keep our fingers crossed in that regard.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And on the second question, my position, our position really hasn't changed. We feel very
confident of the intellectual property estate we have. We're very pleased with the course of the strategy that we're
pursuing and the people that are supporting us in the courts. We feel very good about how that's progressing. But of
course we should be people that are open minded and practical about what are the best solutions for the company, and
at the right time we will look at all of our options and make the right judgments. But we feel very good about where we
are today.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Hi, thanks very much for taking my questions. Obviously very exciting results for 301.
When we look at the inclusion criteria for the Phase II, what's the best way we should think about what proportion of
real world Crohn's patients this population study would be applicable to relative to biologics, and what you might study
in the Phase III. And along those lines, how confident are you that regulators will be comfortable with the totality of
safety data, that the totality of safety data is sufficient to move into pivotal studies and maintenance? Thanks.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Thank you very much for the questions. So the second question first, which is the safety
data. Again, discussion with regulatory authorities, actively engaged with them and we believe there is appropriate
safety data there to move into pivotals as quickly as possible.
In terms of the patient population that was studied in Phase II, terminal ileum and right colon patients mainly represent
about 80% of the overall Crohn's population, depends on what you read from a survey perspective. In some it's 15%, in
some it's 25%. Most of the credible sources I ascribe to say it's about 80% of total patient population. And we also
believe after some [indiscernible] (52:36) work and some other things that we've been doing with the molecule, there
may be a release characteristic that would allow us to move into some left colon patients and things as we move into
Phase III. So that's all in the discussion. We believe the drug definitely is suitable for and targeted for the vast majority
of patients with Crohn's disease.

Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter of SunTrust. Your line is open.
<Q - Salveen Kaur Richter>: Thanks for taking my question. Just in regards to emerging data that you have on
minimal residual disease, just wondering if that can be incorporated into the rituxan combination studies that are
ongoing, and if yes, which indications here may be amenable to early filings.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: I would say that it's an evolving area. We're working with regulators on that and with the
physicians obviously and looking for ways to incorporate that into trials and looking at the possibility to pursue a pretty
robust program with respect to some MRD trials that we're thinking about. It's a little bit early. You will hear more
from us at ASH on that as it's emerging. I think one of the things that's interesting is you start to see greater number of
abstract submissions around that across a variety of hematological malignancies, particularly in myeloma. But, so let's
see where it goes and stay tuned for ASH and we'll talk about that a bit more.

<Q - Ying Huang>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First of all, I have a question for Peter. When and
also under what kind of circumstance would you be ready to provide a long-term guidance beyond 2017? And then I
also had a second question around the GED-301 trial. Any of those Phase II trial patients are still being followed up for
the efficacy and the safety beyond that 12-week endpoint? Thanks.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Hi, this is Peter. Thanks for the questions. On the long-term guidance, we always do this in a
fairly systematic manner. We use the summer to think about our long-range plans, really do a full assessment across all
the franchises in the business. And then as we get towards the end of the year, we really sit down and think about the
long-term outlook of the business with all factors considered and obviously our guidance is a very strong direction that

says this is what we expect and hope to be able to perform. So I would think it's more usually at the end of the year
when we have been through that whole process.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And then maybe just let me add a little bit to that. I think that's exactly right. And we look
from time to time to say, when we feel we have clarity on the longer-term future in terms of where we are that will add
something to the discourse in the marketplace and give clarity to those issues, we will certainly feel comfortable giving
longer-term guidance. But if we don't think we're adding something to the marketplace in terms of providing
longer-term guidance, in those years we've offered just the guidance for the specific year. And in fact some years when
we've had major launches, we haven't even given guidance for the year. So we do try and be very sensitive to what
information that we have and outlooks we have and be consistent with what's helpful to the discussion in the
marketplace.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Second part of the question relative to GED-301 and longer term extensions. Ten patients
from I.G.O.N. 1 went into a long-term I.G.O.N. 2 extension that went out to 36 weeks. All those patients have been
followed up on and they will hopefully be part of a publication in the future and because there's some important
information that is in that longer term study.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Ian Somaiya of Nomura Securities. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mayur I. Somaiya>: Thanks, and apologize for all the background noise, just driving. So just a question on the
pipeline. You've put together a fairly comprehensive I would say pipeline, both focused on a set of target agents as well
as increasing in oncology. Can you just give us a sense for how you plan to develop these drugs, standalone as well as
potential combination? Maybe I'd be more interested in the combination strategy. And just a question on ulcerative
colitis as an indication or an opportunity, just decisions around pursuing OTEZLA vis-à-vis GED-301 and the
formulation changes that you might need to make on 301 to be able to pursue it?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Ian, it's Mark. Just very briefly as Jackie pointed out, in the existing immuno-oncology space as
we describe it with drugs like nivolumab, et cetera, we have cornerstone therapies where we think we can do very
active inline combination studies and we have partners and we're working on that very aggressively. So in the shorter
term, it's a very clear inline combination strategy.
With respect to our early pipeline, we're looking at complementarity. We're looking at single agent activity. As we
already talked about, we're looking at surrogate endpoints like MRD. All of that is on the table as we explore. But we
think it's pleiotropic. We think it's many, many shots on goal with respect to activating innate and adaptive immunity in
the setting of cancer or even other diseases. So we're taking a broad but careful very approach. And remember the last
quarter we talked about establishing a therapeutic area of excellence, a Center of Excellence under Rob Hershberg's
leadership. He's doing an excellent job bringing that to some focus and I think we're going to see some meaningful
progress over the next year or so. So stay tuned.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: And relative to ulcerative colitis, we're very interested in that as a disease state, high
unmet medical need, large patient numbers that are very underserved in UC. There's an OTEZLA program, Phase II
proof of concept program that is initiating as we speak. We're also very interested in GED-301 in this indication. We'd
require some modest modification of the external coding delivery system because the pH-based nature of that delivery
system. But we're very interested in the indication and are moving forward right now in OTEZLA and in the near future
hopefully with GED-301, although the initial focus is on getting the Crohn's studies up and moving.

<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I don't think anybody's asked about OTEZLA. So first,
any early metrics on the psoriasis launch? Are you seeing any mix shift toward dermatology prescribers? Would you
characterize that setting as having pent up demand? And then secondly, on persistency trends in PsA, if you look at the
IMS data, it looks like NRx is still a pretty high proportion of the TRx, suggesting there might be a little bit of churn
going on. But we realize that a portion of the NRx can be refills, so it's a little bit unclear. Just wanted to get a sense
from the real world as to what you're seeing in terms of drop offs. Thanks.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Yes, I think we're seeing an inflection and if you take a look at the graph that we
presented today, you seem to be seeing an inflection as you get into Q4. We didn't see much psoriasis in Q3 because
the approval came quite late in the quarter and then you've got the effect of titration and bridging as Peter said. So
there's been a tremendously positive reception and believe we see an inflection in scripts.
Relative to persistency, I have some initial persistency data. It looks good, looks above what we would expect, but it's
really early, so I wouldn't put too much into that. I would need to get at least six months data with a significant number
of patients to really have a position on what that persistency looks like. However the NRx/TRx ratio looks exactly like
what you'd expect for an oral product at this point in its life. So I don't see any issues there at all. It looks exactly
normal relative to other analogs that we've taken a look at.
So we're very, very pleased with the metrics that we see from a prescription and demand perspective for OTEZLA in
this early launch. PsA is a little bit of a thinner indication where patients aren't coming in quite so quickly. Psoriasis, a
much deeper indication, a lot more patients, a lot more churn. And so overall, the initial metrics, particularly that we
see in PsA, look very, very good. A little too early to tell in psoriasis, but you do see a nice little inflection in the first
couple weeks of Q4.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: I see we're getting a little bit past 10 o'clock, so why don't we see if we can take three more
questions and certainly I want to assure everybody if anyone doesn't get their questions asked, we'll be available after
the call to take calls through the IR office and we'll join in on that.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike King of JMP Securities. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mike G. King>: Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. Wanted to ask you about REVLIMID in non 5q MDS data at
ASH. How should we think about your goals for REV in MDS, and if you could also reconcile it with your outlook for
sotatercept and/or luspatercept in that population? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thanks Mike, appreciate the question. So I mean as you know, if we were able to access
the broader MDS market, that opens up the numbers of patients available to us by three or four times versus what it is
today. With respect to the strategy for covering the indication, we have a very complementary portfolio of assets, so
whether it's sotatercept or luspatercept that goes into hematological malignancies, we still need to decide that. But that
would cover one segment of the market whereas the REVLIMID non del 5q would cover a different segment of the
market. We've already got the del 5q as you know.
So I think that's the approach that we're taking and you'll see a little bit more details on the data. You had the headline
already and we'll talk about at ASH, not only for MDS, but for the other indications, how we're covering the different
patient segments between low risk, high risk and across the different lines of therapy and lay that out for you. Thanks.
We do think that MDS as a franchise as well as AML, the [indiscernible] (63:29) myeloma diseases have significant
potential on a go-forward basis to be larger than what they are today.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mara Goldstein of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.

<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Oh, thanks very much for taking the question. I also have an OTEZLA question and it relates
to, I think it's the slide 32, the graphic that has the four different metrics on it. In that bottom right chart, depth of
prescribing, where you have number of TRxs per trialist, can you discuss that in relation to the sampling program and
the cycling off of sample on to actual paying prescriptions? Is that how we should be thinking about that?
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: So I think what you see from a sampling, which is sampling of titration to initiate
patients, mirrors what you saw in that box. In other words, what we're seeing initially here is that people who are
prescribing, the trialists are generally not prescribing once and then moving off it. Those that are prescribing are
prescribing multiple for multiple patients greater than two, greater than the majority, greater than three patients. So I
think it bodes well for once you get the physicians initiated and prescribing, they tend to put more than one patients or
multiple patients on and a great area for growth is to continue to expand that base of physicians who are prescribing.
But the point of that chart was to say that at this point early in launch there are multiple physicians, the majority of
physicians have prescribed multiple times.
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Okay, thanks very much.

Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Howard Liang of Leerink. Your line is now open.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thanks very much. Regarding GED-301, I know you are very careful in your due diligence by
getting all of the case reports and all the patients [indiscernible] (65:21). Can you give us some color what specifically
gave you the confidence about data integrity and can you give sense of how well the placebo was masked?
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: We believe that there was tremendously good internal and external diligence done on this.
We feel very confident in the data and the study design. I think the study design having two points of remission helped
very much in terms of making sure that what we were seeing was not a false positive placebo response. So we feel very
good. There was a lot of diligence done by a lot of people who have a very in-depth knowledge in the space and have
developed all the drugs that are on the market today for Crohn's, and we feel very, very comfortable that the study was
very well conducted and the data is very solid. And again, should be published and it will be published in a very short
timeframe hopefully and then a fuller look at the full study and all the parameters and everything can be seen through
that publication. So we're very excited, not only to get the data at UEGW, but also the publication in people's hands
because it has the fullness of the data from the study.
Mark J. Alles
Well in wrapping things up, I'd like to thank everybody for the questions. Again I'd reiterate, if any other questions
haven't been answered, please don't hesitate to call through the IR office. We'll all be available to talk there. A great
quarter, we're really thrilled with what's been happening. We are really looking forward to the fourth quarter and
getting to ASH and seeing all the exciting data and what's coming through our pipeline, and as well as the information
about our commercial products. Thank you for joining us today and look forward to seeing you at ASH.
