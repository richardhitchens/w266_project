Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics delivered another quarter marked by strong
operating performance. This performance is particularly notable in light of the dynamic environment that the lengthy
fiscal year 2011 Continuing Resolution created.
Revenues in the first quarter were $7.8 billion, up modestly from the first quarter of 2010, due to growth in our Marine
and IS&T businesses. Operating earnings were $929 million, and earnings from continuing operations were $618
million in the quarter, up slightly from the same period last year.
Operating margins improved 10 basis points from the year-ago quarter, to 11.9%, as three of the four groups delivered
improved earnings and margins. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.64 on a fully-diluted basis, up
6.5% when compared with last year.
Free cash flow after capital expenditures totaled $266 million, better than last year's first quarter. Consistent with prior
years, I would expect our cash trajectory to be back-half loaded.
In terms of capital deployment, we repurchased 3.1 million of our shares in the first quarter. And in March, our board
increased the dividend 12%, the 14th increase in as many years.
First quarter orders remained healthy in our Aerospace business as backlog expanded for a second consecutive quarter.
Defense orders, however, were somewhat light. This lower defense order intake is in part a timing issue caused by the
prolonged resolution of this year's Defense Appropriations bill. With its recent passage, we expect healthier order
activity in the coming weeks and months.
At the end of the quarter, backlog totaled $57.6 billion, down from year-end. Timing of Marine orders drove
three-quarters of this reduction in backlog. Total potential contract value, which includes backlog, unexercised options,
and indefinite delivery and definite quantity contracts, totaled $78.2 billion.
Now I'd like to focus on the performance of each of our business segments, starting with Aerospace. Before I address
the quarter, I want to update you on the status of the G650 program. As you know, on April 2nd, a G650 test aircraft
was lost in a tragic accident that took the lives of four dedicated Gulfstream pilots and flight engineers. The National
Transportation Safety Board is in charge of investigating this accident, and Gulfstream is fully cooperating with their
team. A preliminary report was published by the NTSB on April 6th.
As the NTSB investigation continues, Gulfstream is moving forward with all other non-flying certification and
production work on the G650. We are working closely with the FAA in consultation with the NTSB to determine when
it is appropriate to resume test flights. We look forward to continuing the rigorous testing required to achieve type
certification. I remain confident that the G650 will take its place atop a long line of safe, reliable, high-performance
business jets on which Gulfstream has built its superb reputation.
With that said, I understand that all of our stakeholders would like, and deserve, a much more fulsome briefing on what
lies ahead for the G650 program. Given where we are in the investigative process, however, there is really nothing
more that I can add at this time. When we have more clarity and can provide an informed update, rest assured, we will
do so.
Now, let me address the Aerospace group's first quarter. Aerospace delivered another very strong quarter marked by
particularly good operating performance at Gulfstream, and robust demand for new aircraft and aircraft services. The
group's revenues approximated last year's first quarter, at $1.4 billion. This result reflects growth in aircraft service
demand, offset by lower completions work at Jet Aviation and the absence of pre-owned aircraft sales. First quarter
revenues were up nearly 7% over the fourth quarter of last year, due to additional Gulfstream new aircraft volume and
growing global demand for aircraft services. Gulfstream green deliveries in the first quarter included four additional
aircraft when compared to last quarter.
The group's operating earnings were $230 million and margins were 17%, improved when compared with both last
quarter and the prior-year period. The group's better-than-anticipated margins derive from Gulfstream's improved
productivity and from liquidated damages recognized following the cancellation of aircraft options by a fractional
customer. We continue to see improved conditions in the business aviation market, including healthy new order

interest, declining pre-owned inventory levels, and robust aftermarket demand spurred by further improvements in
aircraft utilization. To that last point, Gulfstream flight hours are now approaching 2008 levels.
Gulfstream participated in another quarter of notable order intake with international orders continuing to dominate the
order book. Orders from the Asia Pacific region were particularly strong this quarter, including an order for five large
cabin aircraft that will further expand our footprint in China. First quarter orders favored all three of our large cabin
aircraft models.
Gross new aircraft book-to-bill was 1.2 times on a dollar-denominated basis in the quarter. Orders continued to
significantly outpace defaults, which were at their lowest levels in the quarter since the downturn began. This helped
the group's backlog to grow for a second consecutive quarter. At $17.9 billion, backlog continues to keep us in the 18-
to 24-month window from new aircraft order to delivery for our 450 and 550 large cabin aircraft.
Pre-owned inventory levels across the Aerospace market reflect modest improvement. We took two pre-owned aircraft
in trade this quarter, with one of these aircraft available for sale at the end of the quarter and the other under contract
for April delivery.
Aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul demand was solid in the quarter, with both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation
posting their strongest revenue quarters ever. We are working diligently to expand our global service footprint as our
international installed customer base grows. For example, Jet Aviation has just upgraded its MRO and FBO location in
Singapore. Eventually, this Singapore facility will include a second hangar capable of accommodating numerous
Gulfstream G650s and an engine overhaul shop that will dramatically reduce the cost of shipping engines to the United
States and the United Kingdom.
While Jet Aviation experienced continuing demand at its service business, the completions business remained
challenged, due to lower OEM completions volume following the economic downturn, and throughput delays at its
wide body/narrow body facility. As a result, Jet is taking steps to restructure this business, reduce overhead, and
enhance completions productivity.
For the year, I'm still guiding to 15% to 16% top line growth, and 15.5% to 16% margins at Aerospace.
Now let's move to the defense businesses, starting with Combat Systems. Combat Systems is off to a good start, with
each of the four – Combat businesses contributing to the group's solid operating margin performance in the quarter.
Revenues were nearly $2 billion, essentially flat when compared with last year's first quarter and in line with our plan
for the year.
Revenues in the quarter reflected increased international vehicle volume, including growth on a major LAV export
program and work on a number of wheeled vehicle programs for European customers. This additional international
work helped to mitigate a decline in U.S. vehicle revenues caused by fewer domestic Abrams tanks upgrade – tank
upgrades and less Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle development work. Volume was essentially flat at our weapons and
ordnance businesses.
Combat Systems delivered $277 million of operating earnings in the quarter, up slightly from last year's first quarter.
The group's operating margins were 14.2%, 80 basis points higher than last year. Cost savings and continuous
improvement initiatives across the segment drove margin improvement, with additional benefit from a favorable
program mix that included less vehicle development work.
Combat Systems' backlog declined modestly from year-end, to $11.4 billion. Despite this decline in backlog, there
were several notable awards in the first quarter, including contracts to produce armored personnel carrier hauls for a
foreign government, provide 120-millimeter mortar ammunition for the Marine Corps' Expeditionary Fighter Support
System, and demilitarize several types of munitions including cluster bombs.
We anticipate improved order activity at Combat Systems as the year progresses. Several awards expected before
year-end include funding for the first tranche of an FMS tank upgrade program, additional Stryker double-V vehicles,
and an opportunity to participate in the initial phase of a Ground Combat Vehicle development program.

Several additional award opportunities that may happen this year but are not integral to our 2011 results include
additional MRAP upgrade opportunities, the production award for the Canadian LAV upgrade program, another
tranche of FMS LAVs, the next increments in the Egyptian tank program, and the Spanish 8x8 vehicle program. While
we have not yet seen any international opportunities come off the table, we remain very mindful of the impact that
dynamic political and economic developments can have on the timing of international awards.
For the year, I continue to expect Combat Systems to deliver approximately $9 billion in sales and around 14%
operating margins. My revenue guidance reflects a stable outlook for our weapons and munitions businesses, some
decline in U.S. vehicle programs, and growth in our international vehicle markets. As I previously highlighted, we
expect sales and earnings to grow in each of our four combat businesses every quarter, resulting in a particularly strong
second half.
Next I'll discuss Marine Systems. Marine Systems continued to perform admirably in the first quarter. Group revenues
were $1.7 billion while operating earnings were $167 million, both up slightly compared to a year ago. The earnings
increase is particularly notable in light of mix shift within several of the group's programs. Marine's top line reflects
higher submarine, auxiliary, and repair volume, offset by lower destroyer and commercial work when compared to last
year's first quarter.
The higher submarine volume relates to our work on both the Virginia class, as we move to two boats a year, and the
Ohio class replacement. This program passed a major Pentagon development milestone in the quarter, enabling it to
enter the technology development phase. Lead ship procurement is planned for 2019, and the Navy shipbuilding plan
reflects a significant funding increase over the next several years to support that schedule. Electric Boat is the design
agent for the program and is working closely with our Navy customer as this program moves into the next phase.
Marine Systems' 10% operating margins were a 20 basis point improvement from last year's first quarter. This margin
is driven by NASSCO, and particularly noteworthy performance on the T-AKE auxiliary program. We launched the
12th T-AKE, USNS William McLean, into San Diego Bay two weekends ago and remain on track to deliver the ship
later this year and the remaining two T-AKEs, numbers 13 and 14, next year.
The group's backlog totaled $18.7 billion at the end of the quarter, down from year-end 2010. This decline in backlog is
primarily a timing issue, as we continue to anticipate adding several Navy ships to backlog this year. With the CR
behind us, we expect to receive the contract modification for the second FY '11 Virginia class submarine very shortly,
enabling us to move this submarine from unfunded to funded backlog.
We remain in negotiations with the Navy on the Mobile Landing Platform, MLP, and the two remaining Zumwalt class
destroyers, DDGs 1001 and 1002. While negotiations have been slower than we had anticipated, we continue to expect
to move these ships into our backlog this quarter.
We also expect to finalize the contract for the first of the DDG-51 follow-on ships at Bath later this year.
In addition to our Navy work, we continue to see interest across the range of Jones Act commercial shippers and
believe that we will leverage our product carrier success to win new commercial work as these potential customers start
awarding new contracts.
Marine Systems remains on track to achieve my guidance of relatively flat sales this year. As work begins on several
new ships and we experience further mix shift in our surface combatant workload throughout the year, I continue to
anticipate margin compression that should lead – should result in full-year operating margins in the low 9% range.
Next, IS&T. The Information Systems & Technology group delivered a good first quarter, particularly in the face of the
prolonged CR. Group revenues grew 2%, to $2.8 billion, from the first quarter of 2010, due to higher volume on
several programs in our IT service business.
IS&T's earnings were $276 million, and operating margins were 9.8%. While both earnings and margins were down
from last year's first quarter, this decline was due in part to program mix as this year's first quarter represented a higher
percentage of IT service program volume when compared with the prior year. While IT service work provides an
excellent return on investment, profitability on these types of programs is generally lower than more product-intensive

programs. IT service margins also reflect the competitive dynamics of this marketplace, particularly as IDIQ
multiple-source contracting vehicles have become much more prevalent over the last 18 to 24 months.
IS&T's backlog was $9.7 billion at the end of the quarter, as the group achieved a book- to-bill of 0.9 times. This
indicates continued demand for the group's products and services despite resource constraints and delays in contract
awards imposed by the CR. This quarter's order activity was especially strong at our Tactical Communications and IT
Service businesses, demonstrating continued success in capturing business in faster-growing market segments such as
battlefield communications, cyber, and IT mission services.
We had a number of notable IS&T awards in our Tactical Communications business this quarter, including a contract
for our core Warfighter Information Network Tactical, WIN-T, program. The nearly $300 million WIN-T Increment 2
award in the quarter funds network development to another five brigade combat teams and represents the customer's
dedication to rapidly deploying this significantly enhanced on-the-move broadband capability to the warfighter. WIN-T
provides the network that our JTRS radios will leverage to enhance soldier communications on the battlefield.
Our HMS Rifleman and Manpack radios underwent further successful field testing in the quarter, where they proved
their ability to provide significantly enhanced situational awareness and connectivity to soldiers at the company and
squad level. We anticipate a low rate initial production decision on Rifleman radio soon, and on the Manpack before
year-end.
When combined, backlog and estimated potential contract value under IDIQ contracts totaled $24.8 billion, providing
IS&T ample opportunity for continued growth. IS&T remains well positioned to achieve my guidance of approximately
3% to 5% sales growth, and low to mid 10% margins this year. Although in recent year periods, IS&T margins have
been somewhat consistent throughout the year, we expect them to increase throughout 2011, as contract mix reflects
increased Tactical Communications volume in the second half.
In summary, our first quarter provides a solid foundation for a successful year. As is our custom at this early point in
the year, I am reiterating my full-year guidance of $7 to $7.10. This guidance presumes second half G650 deliveries,
however it does not include or anticipate the results of capital deployment.
As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing on our backlog and continuing to identify new opportunities.
General Dynamics' key programs did very well in the FY '11 budget recently passed by Congress. Program funding
included $1.2 billion for Stryker, $521 million for Abrams, $223 million for EFV, $591 million for WIN-T, $787
million for JTRS, and support for all of our ship programs, including DDG-51, Virginia class submarines, and the
Mobile Landing Platform, which received $500 million for an additional ship beyond what was in the President's
budget. Our programs are also well supported in the FY '12 budget request.
There is clearly significant angst and uncertainty surrounding the level of future defense spending, particularly given
President Obama's recent remarks. We recognize that as the country deals with the urgent requirement to reduce
national debt, previous predictions regarding defense spending are changing. While it is impossible to know what will
come from the administration's roles and missions study and the President's announced intention to find more savings
in the defense budget, there are a few things that remain evident.
First, in this pressured budget environment, it is very likely the case that defense top line spending will begin a slow,
steady decline. I believe the programs most at risk are likely to be the new development programs. As such,
incumbency is particularly salient. While we continue to pursue new development programs, we remain focused on
leveraging our incumbency to help our customer identify solutions that affordably improve the warfighting capability
of existing platforms.
Second, the world remains a dangerous place, and current force structure is sized to this threat environment. Going
forward, our nation's tolerance for risk must continue to acknowledge the global threat. That should mean only modest
adjustments to force structure. Secretary of Defense Gates has already warned that deep defense budget cuts would be
calamitous. His eventual successor will confront the same national security reality.

As General Dynamics plans for the future, we will continue to evaluate the long-term defense spending environment
realistically. GD is well positioned to sustain our business in a declining defense top line environment, given our
current footprint in Army and Navy force structure and the opportunities inherent in our Aerospace business. Our lean,
agile business model, solid balance sheet, and ability to generate earnings and efficiently convert them to cash afford us
great flexibility to deploy capital to further enhance our business.
With that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial highlights. Hugh?
L. Hugh Redd, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to make a few observations about debt, interest expense, taxes,
and pension contributions.
At the end of the quarter, we had just over $430 million of net debt, up slightly from year-end, and this is after
returning over $470 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Our next scheduled debt
maturity is $750 million of notes due in July. As we get closer to July, we will make a decision to either repay that debt
from cash on hand, or to issue new obligations.
Our net interest expense in the quarter was $34 million, down from $44 million a year ago. This resulted from
repayment last year of $700 million of fixed-rate notes. For the full year, we expect interest expense to be around $130
million, that assuming, of course, that we don't refinance the notes that are due in July.
With respect to income taxes, the first quarter effective rate of 31% was consistent with our expectations and with our
current outlook for the full year.
Finally, we remain on track to make a voluntary contribution of $350 million to our pension plans in the third quarter of
this year.
That completes my remarks. Amy, I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A.
Amy Gilliland, Staff Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has an opportunity to

America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Ronald Epstein>: Yeah, good morning.
<A - Jay Johnson>: Good morning, Ron.
<Q - Ronald Epstein>: Just to maybe to start off with a Gulfstream question. The order activity in the quarter, can you
characterize what part of the world it came from, what was going on with the mid-size aircraft, if you're starting to see
a pick-up there, and if there was any impact to Gulfstream due to the instability of the Middle East.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. Be happy to take that question. The order
activity, Ron, was, I would say very well spread across the product line, okay? Large-cabin dominating, yes, but we're
also taking a mid-cabin orders. The demographics of that are very heavily weighted to international, pretty consistent

with what we've been saying in previous quarters, but actually, in this quarter, it was even more so. I mean, like
70-some percent international. A large portion of that came from Asia Pacific. Probably half of that at least came from
Asia Pacific, and as I mentioned, China being a major part of that. So it was a good dispersion, if you will, on the
international space across the product line.
The mid-size activity continues. I would not characterize it as robust, but certainly improving. The pre-owned
inventory that's out there is working its way through the system. There's still more to come, as I think you know. But
for us we are seeing continued mid-cabin activity, and we are taking orders to include our G250.
The Middle East, I would just – I would characterize it as being about 10% of our backlog at Gulfstream, and that's
proceeding. I would say that the order activity has probably slowed somewhat in the Middle East, as you'd probably
expect, but nothing drastic in terms of fall-off or cancellations or what have you there.
<Q - Ronald Epstein>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Campbell with Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Joseph Campbell>: It's actually Carter Copeland and Joseph Campbell. Good morning, Jay, Hugh, and Amy.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Joseph Campbell>: Just a quick question on your comment about the 650. You said you were moving forward
with the non-flying test activities and production. Is there a point, in the NTSB investigation and how long this
stretches out, where you have to change that sort of strategy in terms of production and what's going on? Do you reach
a point where you need to slow that activity down, and when might that be? How are you thinking about that?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I mean I guess the answer would be, there
would be a point, but that's not something that – it is of immediate concern here at all. I mean, it's a very deliberate
process, as both of you know, and the NTSB controls that process.
But rest assured, Gulfstream is working with the NTSB and the FAA, as I said in my remarks, to analyze, to determine,
to move forward as smartly as we can. To put a specific timeline on that right now, it's just not something that I can do.
But I would tell you that – just reaffirm, we are proceeding with all non-flying activity as it applies to the 650 program,
and our other programs, as you'd expect, but specific to the 650. And at this time, reflected in me not changing my
guidance, I don't see any impact to the year. We'll see how that goes, obviously. But I don't want to presuppose
anything from the NTSB. They have a very tough job to do, and we're helping them as best we can, and we'll get to a
resolution here and return to flight at some point. I'm just not going to try to put a timeline on that, except to say that I
believe it's being treated as you would expect it to be treated, very seriously, with great discipline, with great analysis,
on both Gulfstream's part and the other entities. And we'll come as – to a safe decision here as soon as it's practical to
do so.
I realize that probably doesn't satisfy your desire for specifics, but that's about as specific as I can be right now.
<Q - Joseph Campbell>: Well, I think it's less on the conclusions that the NTSB may draw and when they will draw
them, and more internally on how GD is – how Gulfstream is proceeding with production, and how – what your views
on that – that which you do control, outside of the NTSB investigation.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well I've said very consistently that we anticipated
about a dozen green deliveries this year and we're proceeding along that pathway. And that – we are unencumbered on
that pathway at this point, with the exception of, quite obviously, type certification for the aircraft. So at this time, we
continue to proceed, and at such time as we'd have to modify that, we'll make those adjustments and tell you, but that's

Our next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski with SunTrust. Please proceed.
<Q - Peter Skibitski>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning, Peter.
<Q - Peter Skibitski>: Jay, can you talk to us about the pricing realized at Gulfstream during the quarter on new
aircraft, versus the pricing in backlog? And maybe you can give a differential, large versus mid-size?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think the way I'd characterize it, Peter, is that
pricing is very firm on the large-cabin, and a little bit softer in the mid-cabin, which I think is consistent across the
industry right now, just as a function of mid-cabin inventory that's out there. But the large-cabin pricing is very strong
and holding.
<Q - Peter Skibitski>: Okay. Okay. And then can I ask, out – there's a lot of reports about the potential for an Abrams
line break, I think in 2013. Can you talk to us about that? And then also, the outlook for Stryker as well?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: That part of the first question? I'm just kidding,
Peter. I'll take it. I'll take it, because somebody else will ask it. But listen, there is work to be done as it applies to
Abrams, to your point, and we know that, and the customer knows that, and everybody knows that. I mean, if you look
at the Army's laydown of heavy brigade combat teams, with some 24 of them with 60 Abrams apiece, that, and the
industrial base issue that's attendant to that beautiful facility out in Lima, Ohio, we all realize that we've got some work
to do to get from the multi-year that completes next year, to the next phase, which there's – some are saying doesn't
need to start till 2016. So there's – filling that space with valid work is, I would characterize, a work-in-progress right
now. Everybody is realizing that we've got something to do.

Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yeah – yes, thank you very much. So Jay, your R&D was down fairly substantially in the
first quarter, and you delivered two more large biz jets than we'd assumed. On a pace to do 80, and yet you really said
you'd do 78 excluding the G650. So is R&D going to be building as we go through the remainder of the year at
Gulfstream? And can you do more than 78 non 650s? And lastly, if you don't know what the problem is, how can you
still feel you're going to do 12 650s for this year?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: The R&D is net, and we had more launch assistance
in the first quarter, I think, is the first answer.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And as to the incremental production on the
in-production large-cabin, Cai, we do have some opportunity there to add an airplane or two, as we kind of talk about
every year. So there's some maneuver space there.
And look, I'm not going to go into much more than I've already said about the 650, except to reiterate that, at this point,
I said we would deliver approximately 12 green 650s this year, and I'm still in a place in the year where I believe we
can do that. And obviously, the type certification and the FAA restart with the NTSB authorization is elemental to that,
but at this point, I'm quite comfortable suggesting that we carry out the plan.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Terrific. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citigroup. Please proceed, sir.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning, Jason.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: You mentioned that you were having some throughput problems on the completions business.
Can you provide a little bit more detail as to what the issues are there, and the timeframe for kind of completing the
restructuring that's going on there, and the impact that that might have on margins for that business over time?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think the way I'd characterize it, Jason, is it's
a number of things, and I mentioned some of that in my prepared remarks. But you've got an OEM – how do I
characterize it – shortfall, I guess, as a result of completions activity attendant – or resultant from the economic
downturn, the valley of that that we're dealing with, which then when you butt it against the narrow body/wide body
work that's out there, the flow and the rhythm and the volume and the overhead and all of those things kind of comes
together and you'd say, you know what? We may need to retool this business a little bit, given the new scope of activity
that we are seeing. That's probably the easiest way to say it.
The margins, I would anticipate would improve throughout the year. We're working very diligently to do that. And as I
mentioned also, the other parts of Jet Aviation, which really is what we bought Jet Aviation for, the global footprint, the
service, the MRO, is coming along quite handsomely.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: All right. And then the one thing the you haven't mentioned about the G650, and sorry to ask a
second question, but what's the customer feedback been at this point?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: The customer feedback has been very supportive,
very concerned in terms of the losses that we've suffered, and basically reaffirming their desire to get their airplanes.

Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed.
<Q - Richard Safran>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Richard Safran>: Jay, I heard your comment about international vehicle awards, they're not coming off the table.
But some defense companies are noting that some international customers aren't taking deals off the table, but they are
sliding planned purchases to the right. Was wondering if you just might comment on whether you're seeing similar
trends in – for Combat?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We have seen some of that, indeed, Rich, and we
talked about some of that last year, and there was movement to the right. Yes, indeed, we still see that. I mean, the
Spanish 8x8s are probably the most talked-about example of that. We still believe that the Spanish 8x8, based on what
everything the Spanish government is saying, the MOD is saying, will come to a decision this year, but we haven't seen
it yet. And that's why I mentioned, I think, that that's not integral to our sales plan for the year. So yes, we are seeing
some movement to the right.
Having said that, though, we've still got a lot of work ongoing. We're in production on – well development on the
Specialist Vehicle in the United Kingdom. We're doing the first tranche of FMS tank upgrades at Lima right now and
expect a production contract later this year. So we're doing between the FMS LAVs and the FMS tanks, there's lots of
activity still apace, with more to come that perhaps could be delayed, but right now, we've got a lot that's already in

<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning, Noah.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Jay, you started to talk about Gulfstream in China, and I wanted to ask you to elaborate on that,
just because there's obviously a great long-term opportunity there and the debate is timing. And I think most think it's
pretty long-dated and there are some hurdles there. We were just out there, we met with some of your folks actually,
and were surprised with the comments that the Western companies out there were making about how quickly that is
actually turning now. And so – excuse me – wanted to get your kind of personal stance on that topic. And then
strategically, if you feel like you need to do anything there to have a bigger presence than you already do, whether it's
JVing or moving facilities there or whatever.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: To your latter first, I mean, that is a very active
market, and the pacing I think is picking up at a – to a degree that perhaps – I won't use the word surprise, but I mean,
it's accelerating, shall we say.
But as I've said before, we're very mindful of the need to match the product support with the sales. So we're working
very diligently with – and to your last point about JVs and partnerships, that's the way you do business over there right
now. So we're working diligently with partners over there to enhance the product support business as we sell airplanes
into it.
It also – if you heard my remarks, you heard me mention Singapore as a major – basically a major maintenance
overhaul hub in Asia. All of that ties together to be able to capitalize on this growing market in China. We believe it
will be a very robust market, and we just want to make sure that we're measuring ourselves properly into that market so
we don't, as I like to say, overdrive our headlights and risk diminishing the premiere brand that we have in Gulfstream.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

<Q - George Shapiro>: Good morning, Jay.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning, George.
<Q - George Shapiro>: My question is, you had mentioned in Combat that you got like $1.2 billion in Stryker orders,
$500 million in Abrams. But the reality is – I mean your Stryker sales are a lot above the $1.2 billion and Abrams is
two to three times what you got. So how do you not have this sector go down fairly substantially over the next several
years?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Say the last part again? I'm sorry.
<Q - George Shapiro>: The Abrams, you got $500 million in orders, like you said, which is probably, maybe around a
third of what the sales are currently running. So given that Stryker and Abrams are the two biggest programs in this
sector, I mean, how do revenues not go down substantially over the next several years?

numbers. And you've got – in addition to that, as you know, you've got modernization, which is particularly significant
in Stryker land, and also will be in Abrams. You've got reset. You've got combat logistics support, which is ongoing.
So there are more elements to it than just the production, I guess is probably the succinct way to say it.

Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Joseph Nadol III>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning.
<Q - Joseph Nadol III>: I just wanted to follow up actually on that same track. Jay, you gave some good color on
what's in your Combat guidance, the $9 billion for this year, and what's not. And I think you only mentioned one
international order that's significant that is in there, and most of the rest of these things, Canadian LAV, Egyptian,
Spanish, et cetera, seem to be now upside to your guidance? I just wanted to confirm that.
And then secondly, in the back of that, you've said in the past that this is a business that you anticipate growing
modestly from this level in future years. Is it fair to say that you do need these things to hit – that these are really more
important for next year and the year after than they are for this year anyway?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, concur your last, Joe. That's exactly right. I
mean, we've got a pretty good – not pretty good, we've got very good visibility on the year, which is why I'm – I
reaffirm about $9 billion in sales. We're less dependent than we were last year on sales coming into the book. So it's a
better circumstance. But you're exactly right. I mean, the order book for next year is dependent on a lot of these things
– not dependent, but these would have more impact next year than they do this year, I guess is the way I'd say it.
<Q - Joseph Nadol III>: And the one order you need to get this year, you mentioned it was FMS tank. Is that into the
Middle East?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, it is, and we're already working the front-end of
that, if you will, in Lima, and we anticipate a production contract later in the year. And we've got Stryker in the budget.
We think, as I mentioned, we're going to get probably more Stryker. The Army wants more Stryker. We've got the
double-V hull. We've got the reset on the – not reset, sorry, the redo on the other seven brigades that aren't double-Vs.
The other – the only – the comment I'd make – in addition to that, I mentioned in my remarks about Ground Combat
Vehicle. That's one of the new development programs, so I would attach some risk to that, to be pragmatic about it. But
that's in the plan.

<Q - Heidi Wood>: Okay. Great. And then you said the force of size correctly, but actually, some of us have been
talking to folks down in DC, and I want to get an update as to how many Stryker brigades you see likely ahead. I mean,
is there a world, given the FCS cancellation, and again, you admit that GCV could be vulnerable. Could that be filled in
with more Strykers?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, my answer to that would be certainly yes, as
you'd expect me to say. So I guess – I mean honestly, my – you know we're deploying number 8, and we're –
realistically, they're looking at number 9. So I guess my answer would be 9 to 12.

Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard Rubel>: Oh boy, I got butchered on that. Good morning.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning, Howard.
<Q - Howard Rubel>: Thank you. I want to focus on strategy for a minute, Jay. Two things that sort of struck me. One
is that you announced the sale of a small business the other day out of Combat.
And then second, if we look at the environment, it's changing to a more austere world. Can you affect that change
through either coming up with more competitive solutions that exist outside the normal procurement channels? I mean,
the Pentagon seems to want some of that. And could you give us maybe a couple of examples of maybe how you solve
the GCV, as one instance, or maybe what you're doing in submarines as a second instance, that sort of allow you to
kind of take advantage of your incumbency and your technology?
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I mean, the GCV is up for technology
demonstration phase, as you know, within I'd say – within any day, within a month or two. And I think that will be very
telling. We believe that that will be delivered, seen through. And then decisions on GCV would probably be made after
the technology demonstration phase. So that's why it's in our plan. We believe we'll be competitive as one of the three
to be selected. So it's in our plan there. And the risk attached to GCV, in my view, comes later on, at – as TD phase
evolves or completes.
The submarine piece is very dynamic and very strong, in my opinion. In addition to the Virginia class – and we've
talked about this – at 18 boats of at least a 30-boat requirement, okay? Block III, we're on three of eight Block III boats
in the build right now, take us out to 2018.
We are looking for and working with our customer on Block III. We are also, as you know, working the SSBN(X) Ohio
replacement. And in that in particular, I think the word, as you were alluding to, the need for innovative build strategies
and solutions is going to be extremely important, because you know that about 2018 to 2019, as SSBN(X) requirements
build in the next decade, the Virginia class requirement is – does not mitigate. So there's going to be a lot to be done
and the need to be innovative and creative in how you source these, and how you meet the requirement's going to be
ever more important.

<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Bath and NASSCO. Okay. This won't take away
from your question, Doug, but I – Amy is my truth serum here, and I need to go back to Heidi Wood's question just for
one second for all of you.
As it applies to Combat international sales, I stand modestly corrected here, in that the sales actually are going to be
higher than they were last. I think I gave you 23% or 24%. It's actually – the Combat international sales will be about
28% this year. So, just to set the record straight.
Okay. Let's talk about Bath and NASSCO. We are complete – let's take Bath first. At Bath, we anticipate the contracts
for the two DDG-1000s, number two and number three boats – ships, any time. We're working very diligently with the
customer now to bring those to closure. The DDG-1000 itself is well into the build, about 40% complete on the
manufacturing. It's in the ultra hull facility right now and being put together. It's a beautiful, huge ship. So that's coming
together.
We are in the last two builds of DDG-51s there right now, 111 and 112 by hull number. And in the '11 budget should –
will be a contract for another DDG-51. So you're going to see DDG – you're going to see volume up as the 1000s come
in, as the next 51 comes in, and then you're going to see margins compress, as I said, because of trading the maturity of
the DDG-51 program for the impact of the first of the three DDG-1000s at a cost-plus, and then number two and
number three will eventually come in at fixed price and we'll readjust the margins.
By that time, I should also point out, we anticipate more DDG-51s as the Navy puts into reality the ballistic missile
defense block of DDG-51. So that'll be a steady stream of work, albeit there some work to do to smooth the flow of
those ships as I just described, okay? It's probably more than you needed, but that's kind of – that's where we are at
Bath.
In NASSCO, I mentioned the T-AKEs. We do magnificent work at NASSCO building those T-AKEs. We've got the
last two to finish next year. The MLPs are coming in now, okay? And we've got the Navy – we're working with the
Navy right now and they've put them in sequence, which is much more efficient for both the taxpayer and for us on the
build, and everybody likes that. That's in stride now. So you'll see T-AKEs starting out the end of next year. We hope
to start the build on the first MLP in May. We anticipate a contract any day, okay?
And then, the Navy has also pulled forward the requirement for the T-AO(X), which is the next generation of oiler, into
– I think it's about 2014 now. So there's still some work to be done there. But at any rate, on the Navy side, we see,
longer term, good opportunity at NASSCO.
The commercial side is still lagging, as I mentioned, but there's great interest in that market, the Jones Act market. It
just hasn't translated quite into contract reality yet. As a result, and this applies to all our yards, but most specifically at
NASSCO right now, that's why we've put out WARN notices, that's why we've resized that great workforce out there to
continue to manage for profitability, because if we don't have the work, we won't keep the workforce at idle.
So the NASSCO, longer term, is very bullish in my view, but we've got some work to do right now to get MLP into
reality, which will happen, we're confident of that and to return the commercial work.
Remember, too, whenever we talk about NASSCO and the other yards, but particularly here since we're talking
NASSCO, the repair business is a significant part of their book, and – at least a quarter of the top line last year. And
they're the only full-service yard on the West Coast. So the Navy needs their capabilities and uses it a lot. So that will
continue to be a fairly significant part of the business.

<Q - Peter Arment>: Jay, I guess, maybe since no one's asked, I guess, how are you talking about capital deployment,
just in general? When you look at your defense portfolio, you've got stability, some challenges, but a lot of
opportunities, too. How are you thinking about M&A? You've been consistently buying back stock, but just maybe
some broader – and where the investment priorities are. Thank you.
<A - Jay L. Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think it's fair to say, Peter, the operative word for
us is as it as relates to capital deployment is balance, okay? We take a very balanced approach to it. The M&A
opportunities are out there. It's been fairly dormant, shall we say, for the last 18 months, as the economics went south.
But there are opportunities out there. We continue to work some of those opportunities. I don't have something to
announce to you today, but rest assured, we're looking at opportunities in the defense space as well as in aerospace.
I mentioned in my remarks, on the aerospace side, the global opportunity – or the global footprint expansion. We see
great opportunity there and expect to take advantage of it going forward.
So there are M&A opportunities. We don't restrict ourselves in terms of – we're very decentralized, as you've heard me
say before. I got 13 businesses out there, each of which is tasked to continue to grow their business and look for
opportunities inside their core, or in adjacencies, or in dual use, commercial/defense, and that's exactly what they do,
and roll them up to us and then we make our assessments and either go or no-go.
The same is true on divestitures, by the way. So we look to shape our portfolio all the time, which is why you just read
about us making a divestiture. It's – that was a great book of business, but quite frankly, we didn't have the scale, and
it'll work better for somebody else than us. And so, we've – we don't hesitate to do something like that.
We've also increased the dividend, as I mentioned. That's a significant part of our deployment. 14 years in a row, we've
– we're very much committed to dividend growth. And our share repurchase is done tactically, as we say it, and will
continue to be done in that manner.
So we've got pension requirements, as you heard Hugh mention earlier. So it's a very balanced approach to capital
deployment, and we – but we do not believe, even as a declining – flat to declining defense market, we do not believe
there are no opportunities in defense space. Quite the contrary.

<Q - Myles Walton>: Okay, great. And then the actual question was more on how you're looking at the DDG-1001,
1002 contracts. You're – sounds like you're coming to the final Ts&Cs there, and my guess is HII's spin had something
to do with the delay. But I'm curious if there's any sticking points in respect to the Ts&Cs, how you're limiting your
risk, given you're only 40% through the DDG-1000. And we've seen some creative cost – or some creative contract
structures on these new transitions to fixed-price contracts. I'm just curious how you're setting this one up to protect on
the downside.
