Arthur B. Winkleblack
Thanks, Meg. Good morning, everyone. Today, Ed and I will take you through our Q3 results and expectations for the
remainder of the fiscal year. And we'll try to be brief since we'll be seeing all of you next week at CAGNY [Consumer
Analyst Group of New York] Overall, we're very pleased with our results for this quarter highlighted by strong topline
growth and good P&L leverage.
Key facets of the performance for Q3 include strong sales growth, again driven by our emerging markets, global
ketchup, and our top 15 brands. Continuing investments in marketing, processes and systems to drive future growth in
productivity, and a double-digit increase in EPS, reflecting solid growth in operating income and a better than expected
tax rate. In short, we drove both top and bottom line growth, despite a very challenging environment in developed
markets.
Turning to our ex-item's P&L scorecard for the quarter, you can see the currency translation had a negligible effect.
Overall, sales grew by more than 7%, operating income increased better than 4%, and EPS was up 13%. That's a good
result as we continue to increase the investment in our brands, and on Project Keystone, while tightly control other
spending.
EPS got a boost from the favorable tax rate, which was 20% for the quarter. Again, this was better than expected, and
added $0.07 to the year-on-year increase in EPS. The most difficult result for the quarter was gross margin. While this
margin level represents a continuation of sequential improvement in the business, and is our high water mark so far this
fiscal year, it was still 140 basis points below last year. And to put this into perspective, our gross margin performance
for the quarter was the third best in the peer group. We have left off specific company names here, but you can see that
the whole group is working to overcome the harsh commodity inflation buffeting the industry. We're obviously not
satisfied with this, and our expectations are that commodity inflation while not going away will continue to moderate,
easing the pressure on gross margin somewhat. With that said, let's turn back to that top line story.
We are very proud of the fact that we have now driven 27 consecutive quarters of organic growth. And this quarter's
organic growth of 4.6% represents our highest growth rate in nearly 3 years. Importantly, all segments reported positive
organic sales growth in the quarter, led by the Rest of World and Asia-Pacific segments, but also reflecting positive
growth in the difficult developed markets of Europe and North America.
Again this quarter, the formula for growth is based on our trio of growth engines, emerging markets, Global Ketchup,
and our top 15 brands. On our last earnings call, we mentioned that growth in emerging markets would accelerate in
Q3, and that's exactly what happened. For the quarter, emerging markets generated very strong organic growth of 20%.
And on a reported basis, the number was even stronger, up about 40% when you include sales from the Quero business
we bought in Brazil in Q4 last year. Now, on an organic basis, growth was driven by Latin America, China, Russia,

Indonesia, India and African Middle East.
Q3 was another strong quarter for Global Ketchup as well, where we delivered 9% organic growth led by Latin
American, U.S. Foodservice and Russia. Though smaller in scale, we also posted big percentage gains on Heinz
Ketchup in Brazil and in China. And to round out the discussion of our growth engines, the top 15 brands posted 6%
organic growth, led by the Heinz brand, the Master brand of soy sauces in China, and our ABC brand in Indonesia. Our
top 15 brands represent more than 70% of global sales, and continue to grow as a percentage of our total mix.
A key to the continued growth in our portfolio is increasing support of our brands. Over a five-year period ending in
fiscal 2011, Heinz increased marketing spending by almost 60% to help drive organic growth. And we're continuing to
increase our investment level this fiscal year. Through the first nine months of FY12, our spending is up another 10%,
reflecting higher spending in both emerging and developed markets.
Now, let's take a quick look at top and bottom line performance in each of our key segments. First, in North American
consumer products, we posted stable results in a difficult market with a challenged consumer. Organic sales were up
1% offset by a 2% impact from the exit of Boston Market. Organic sales of frozen products were up in the U.S., while
Ore-Ida sales were basically flat. The gains in frozen were partially offset by weaker sales in pasta sauces.
Gross margin was impacted by net commodity inflation and lower margin product mix. We effectively leveraged
SG&A spending, and we are excited to see the new accessible price point products reaching store shelves in Q4. We'll
talk more about that next week at CAGNY.
U.S. foodservice business returned to sales and profit growth in Q3 driven by branded front-of- house products, and
continuing productivity initiatives. Importantly, Dip and Squeeze distribution continues to expand and is now available
at Wendy's. With this addition, Dip & Squeeze already represents about 25% of our total branded portion control
ketchup business in the United States.
The industry saw modest improvement in overall restaurant traffic, particularly in December, driven largely by quick
serve restaurants, though traffic at some of our key customers is still down slightly. Gross margin strengthened
sequentially, but was still below prior year as net pricing has increased and commodity inflation is beginning to
moderate. And finally, we continue to rationalize the factory footprint in order to drive down fixed costs.
Despite the headlines coming out of Europe these days, Heinz Europe posted solid results, with constant currency sales
up over 4%, and operating income about flat. Organic growth for the region was driven by another strong quarter in the
U.K, up 6%, and continuing momentum in Russia, up 19%. Italy on the other hand was impacted by that country's debt
crisis, and incurred a three-day national truck strike at the end of our quarter in late January. We continue to invest in
processes and systems across Europe, and are very pleased with ongoing progress in the rollout of Project Keystone
and the establishment of the European supply chain hub and new innovation center.
Turing to the Asia-Pacific, that region posted nearly 7% constant currency sales growth, and almost 23% operating
income growth, a dramatic improvement from their results last quarter. Each emerging market in the region drove
double-digit sales growth, led by China, Indonesia and India. China is generating particularly good growth in Foodstar,
Western Sauces and Infant Nutrition.
Operating income improvement for the segment was led by excellent growth in China, Japan, and Indonesia. We also
saw sequential improvement in Australia this quarter, driven by new leadership there.
Turing to the Rest of World segment, on a constant-currency basis, both sales and operating income more than doubled.
This growth was driven by a continued strong performance in Latin America. The key element here is the addition of
the Quero brand in Brazil. For the quarter, sales in Brazil exceeded $100 million. Notably, we began distributing Heinz
ketchup in Brazil through the Quero sales force, and have seen ketchup sales almost double. Though still small, we
have high expectations for this ketchup business.
Adding to the growth story in Latin America, we recently launched new baby food and ketchup pouches in Mexico and
Central America. They are off to a great start, and we think this will be an important packaging innovation for
cash-strapped consumers. And finally, Africa-Middle East contributed to the strong sales growth in the quarter as well.

Now, I'd like to turn it over to Ed for a bit deeper insight on the quarter. Ed?
Edward J. McMenamin
Thanks, Art. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through some of the details underlying our financial results, which
reflect strong topline and bottom-line growth.
Let's look first at EPS. Consistent with our previous releases this year, we are reporting our results in fiscal 2012
adjusting for the special charges related to our productivity initiatives. To summarize Q3, going from right to left,
including the $0.07 cost of our productivity initiatives, reported EPS was $0.88, up $0.04, or almost 5% from last year.
Our constant currency EPS, and EPS excluding special charges, were both $0.95, up 13.1%, as foreign exchange
activity this quarter had virtually no impact on the bottom line.
Here, you can see the components of our productivity charges, and where they're reflected in the P&L. In Q3, we
incurred $9 million for severance and employee-benefit costs relating to the reduction of the global workforce, $11
million related to asset write-offs for the closure of six factories so far this year, and we are working towards exiting at
least two more factories by year-end. $14 million of other implementation expenses, primarily professional fees,
contract termination and relocation costs incurred to improve manufacturing efficiencies, most notably affecting our
Australian business. Overall, we recorded charges of $34 million pre-tax, of which $22 million is in cost of goods sold,
and $12 million in SG&A. The after tax impact of these charges was $23 million, or $0.07 per share, and the entire
amount was reported in our non-operating segment.
As a reminder, we currently expect the total cost of these initiatives to be around $215 million pre-tax ,or $0.50 per
share for the full fiscal year, and we continue to look for additional opportunities to drive costs down further.
The rest of our financial discussion will focus on the results excluding these special items, as we believe it provides for
the most useful perspective for evaluating our performance.
Now turning to the P&L. Net sales exceeded $2.9 billion, up almost 8% on a constant-currency basis. Gross profit
dollars were up 4% on a constant-currency basis, as higher pricing and acquisitions were partially offset by higher net
commodity costs. As Art mentioned, gross margin was down, along with all of our peers, as a result of the commodity
cost movements.
Marketing expense increased in line with our strong top line growth, while SG&A increased at only a quarter of the
rate of sales. SG&A was up 2% on both a reported and constant-currency basis reflecting increases from acquisitions,
incremental talent to support growth in our emerging markets, as well as Project Keystone. We continue to prioritize
investment to support the future while balancing overall costs. In fact, SG&A in our developed markets was down
versus the prior year, reflecting our focus on tight cost controls.
Operating income was up around 5% on a constant-currency basis, despite soft results in the U.S. and Italy, as well as
incremental investments for marketing and Keystone. Net interest and other expense increased $5 million, primarily
due to interest expense.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%, compared to 26.1% last year, primarily due to the release of foreign tax
reserves no longer subject to claims, as well as reduced repatriation cost. We're now anticipating a tax rate for the full
year, excluding special charges, in the mid to low 20s. This reflects the reserve I just mentioned, as well as other
foreign tax planning initiatives.
At the bottom line, we delivered an increase in net income of 12%, and EPS of 13% in Q3.
Looking at the key components of sales growth, as Art mentioned, we delivered organic sales growth of 4.6% for the
quarter, the highest growth since fiscal 2009. Price improvements of 4.2%, particularly in the U.S., U.K, and Latin
America, drove this growth, while volume was slightly positive at 0.4%.

The emerging markets delivered balanced organic growth with volume and price both up approximately 10%, and the
developed markets in Europe posted positive volume, with the exception of Italy.
Japan had a strong performance exceeding 10% volume growth this quarter, while we saw declines in Canada and
Australia, as well as a small decline in the U.S. The Quero acquisition net of Boston Market added 2.9% to our top line,
while foreign exchange reduced sales by 40 basis points.
Our gross margin , at 36.4%, declined 140 basis points, as our pricing and productivity initiatives effectively offset
approximately half of the headwinds from the commodity markets. Looking specifically at commodities, we've seen
inflation in most of our key raw materials, particularly, sweeteners, metals, meat, and dairy. The overall result has been
market inflation for the quarter of around 7%, in line with our full-year expectations.
Finally, for the quarter, operating free cash flow was about $250 million, down from last year. This reflects a $34
million outflow for productivity initiatives, increased QOWC, particularly receivables, driven by growth in Asia and
Brazil, while inventory and payables roughly offset each other.
Additionally, increased capital spending reflected further investments in Project Keystone, capacity projects in the
emerging markets, and new productivity initiatives. In total, capital expenditures were 3.4% of sales, up 70 basis points
from the prior year.
Dividends reflect the 6.7% increase that we announced in May. And finally, the increase in treasury stock reflects the
repurchase of about 800,000 shares, at a total cost of $42 million, net of options exercised.
Now let's move to the balance sheet scorecard through nine months. Capital expenditures were 3.2% of sales, up 70
basis points from the prior year, reflecting the investments I just mentioned. We're still anticipating spending of around
4% of sales for the full fiscal year. Our cash conversion cycle at 45 days slipped by one day versus last year, as a
three-day improvement in payables was offset by two days in receivables and inventory.
Operating free cash flow of $476 million was down from last year. We spent $64 million on our productivity initiatives
so far this year, and QOWC has increased primarily due to the timing of payables. Overall, QOWC should be in line
with fiscal 2011 by year-end as a result of our concerted efforts to reduce inventories. Additionally, in line with our
plans, cash taxes are higher this year and capital spending is up on a year-to-date basis.
Net debt-to-EBITDA was up 2.0 times this year versus 1.8 last January. The increase was due to higher net debt,
primarily related to the Brazilian acquisition, but we remain quite pleased with the improvements in net
debt-to-EBITDA from just a few years ago.
ROIC was 18.6%, down 70 basis points from this time last year, but if you adjust for the Brazilian acquisition, the base
business would show an improvement of 20 basis points over the comparable period last year.
In summary, our performance for this quarter reflects solid top line and EPS growth, with substantial incremental
investments back into our business to help support future growth.
With that, I'll now turn it back to Art, to take you through our full-year outlook.
Arthur B. Winkleblack
Thanks, Ed. Now, let's finish it up with a quick look at full-year forecast.
On an ex-items basis, we are confident that we'll deliver on the expectations we established at our Analyst Day last
May. Those goals included constant currency sales growth of 7% to 8%, EPS growth of 6% to 8%, and operating free
cash flow of around $1.15 billion. As discussed last quarter, given the negative changes in the economic environment,
our path is a bit different than we had originally expected.
On a reported ex-items basis, we're narrowing our range, and expect to deliver EPS of between $3.32 and $3.34. This
includes the full-year benefit of approximately $0.05 from foreign currency. Thus this range should equate to constant

currency performance of around $3.27 to $3.29, which is at the middle of our original outlook, $3.24 to $3.32. And this
effectively takes up the bottom of our expected range.
So as we look forward, we expect to continue our top line momentum, further invest in the business, deliver
double-digit EPS growth in Q4, and aggressively reduce inventory levels. As part of this, as Ed mentioned, we now
expect our full year tax rate to be in the mid to low 20s. And finally, we expect to deliver $1 billion in operating free
cash flow on a reported basis, after the impact of spending for special items.
So to summarize, we are posting solid sales and EPS results in a challenging environment, driving the top line,
primarily through growth in emerging markets, global ketchup, and an increase in marketing behind our top 15 brands,
continuing to invest in the business for sustainable long-term growth despite the environment, successfully executing
our productivity initiatives that further build the foundation for the future, and expecting to deliver our original full year
outlook.
So with that, I'll turn it back to Meg, and we'll take your questions. Meg?
Margaret R. Nollen
All right, operator?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question is from the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. You may proceed.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Hi, good morning, everyone.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Hey, guys.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: It seems, at least optically, that you are guiding to a little bit of a drop in performance between
3Q and 4Q. Maybe a little bit more sudden than some people might have expected. So, I guess my question is, first, is
this accurate? And second, if so, maybe you could walk us through some of the drivers of that relative softness?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: No, I think frankly, we're real pleased with the performance in the business, I mean,
you saw the strong growth at the top line, the three growth engines are continuing to bang away. We just got sequential
improvement in Australian food service, we are investing in the business, we are taking out inventory. For the quarter,
our OI was up nicely, and we continue to drive the productivity initiative. So, we are feeling very good about the
business.
I think what you're seeing is some timing in terms of the tax impact. Certainly the tax was better than we expected this
quarter, probably a little bit worse than we expected next quarter, so largely timing there. This allows us flexibility,
frankly. I mean, there – in this tough environment, there is just no reason to be heroic. So, I think we are prudently
balancing the P&L. We're also aggressively taking out inventory in the fourth quarter, and as you know, as you reduce
inventory you take an absorption hit. You're pulling basically fixed cost off the balance sheet into the P&L. And there
is a hit associated with that. But we think that's the right thing to do to pull inventory out and to drive cash flow.
So, no. We feel very good about the business, and feel very good about the fact that we're taking it to the middle range
and taking up the bottom – bottom end of our guidance.

<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Absolutely. The only other thing I would add is, if you take the numbers we've given you
on FX, we're going to take a hit next quarter on FX, and that obviously was not anticipated. So, we are at a positive
$0.08 for the company year-to-date, and our guidance this morning includes a positive $0.05, so that's a $0.03 hit
potentially in the fourth quarter from FX alone.
So you take the FX hit, you take the absorption hit, and a little softness, but it's not – it's not major softness. It's – I
think we are going to have an incredibly strong quarter. If we hit these numbers, we've put out there guys, that's
double-digit OI and EPS, and that is nothing to be – to sneeze at. So, we're hitting on all cylinders, as you saw with all
of our segments at positive organic growth. So -
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: So, in short -
<Q - Ken Goldman>: What does that mean though? Art, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but what does that
mean? Could you add a little bit of color on the inventories? Is it an inventory hit because volumes weren't as strong as
expected, or is this more of a planned hit as you close some of your plants?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: I think we're looking to drive cash flow and drive quality of earnings, that's been a
hallmark I think for Heinz, and so we're aggressively taking inventory out. It's certainly a little harder to project in this
kind of environment in some of the developed markets. But the reality is, if you take a lot of inventory out, which is
what our expectation is, it comes with a P&L impact.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: Typically in the fourth quarter, you would see our inventories drop just due to the
seasonal nature of our business. For this year, we're making a very, very concerted effort to drive that down further than
we normally would.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: To your point, Ken, we have some acquisitions. Their inventory levels are higher than
kind of company average. Company average is high. And there is a little bit of volume softness, but I wouldn't attribute
this wholesale to that at all. This is going to be a big effort for us, and it really sets us up for the long term. It's the right
thing to do.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Is it a one-quarter inventory issue? Is it one quarter and then done?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: I think we're looking to be very aggressive here, but over time we'll continue to always
look to take inventory out. Not – certainly not at the pace of what we're expecting in the fourth quarter, but this is very
much in line with Bill's strategy. I think in this kind of environment, you want to make sure you're driving cash flow to
provide flexibility for the business and for shareholders. So, aggressively taking out inventory, driving out fixed costs,
it's clear that customers these days won't pay for people's overhead. So, we are getting aggressive across the board.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Chris Growe from Stifel Nicolaus. You may proceed.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good morning.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. I wanted to ask you, Art, I guess about like the cost inflation in relation to your
pricing and productivity. If we could just understand kind of the phasing of the cost inflation for this year. I was
surprised to hear that you only had about half of it covered in this quarter. Is that – is that expected to get better in Q4?
Is there any of this lingering into 2013? I don't want to get too ahead of ourselves here, but how do you see those two
lining up?

<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes. As we have projected, we said that inflation was going to hit its high-water mark
in the second quarter, which it did. I think we were around 10% market inflation at that point, it's down to around 7%
market inflation in the third quarter. We do expect that to continue to moderate into the fourth quarter.
And the good news is that over time we've been getting better price realization. If you recall, particularly in U.S. food
service, pricing comes in chunks as national account contracts come up, and things like that. So, our price realization is
getting better, and commodity inflation is moderating. So, we do expect sequential improvement from a gross margin
standpoint, and so we're looking to finish up the year pretty much expected on that front.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: And then, if you go back to our earlier releases, for the earlier quarters we were
seeing commodity inflation higher than the 7%. The 7% we experienced this quarter is in line for the full year. So, you
see that trending down; which is what we said on previous calls, and that still looks to be the truth.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And was there – just to follow up on a point you made to Ken, is there – are you
quantifying the inventory hit for the fourth quarter?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: No, not really. I think we'll see as things come out, and it's all a question of exactly
when the inventory comes down, is it early in the quarter is it late in the quarter, et cetera.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: But it's certainly a factor in why we guided, or put together the outlook that we did.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay, thanks for your time. See you at CAGNY.

Your next question is from the line of David Palmer with UBS. You may proceed?
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Hi, guys.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good morning.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Good morning. Two questions, one on Europe, and then one on Ore-Ida.
The Europe business seems to be hanging in there pretty well, and you had some pretty good top line this quarter,
profits stable against, I guess, little bit tougher margin comparisons. I think a lot of folks are just scared of Europe right
now. You are hanging in there. How are you thinking about how this next year is setting up into fiscal 2013 in Europe?
Folks are obviously more concerned about Southern Europe. You have that baby food business down there. U.K.
business, you seem to be in a very good competitive position. Any color would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes. At this point, I'm probably not going to say a lot about 2013, but let me just give
you a flavor for how we are thinking about Europe, and what's going on there.
Reality is about half of our business in Europe is in the U.K – That business has been going extremely well for us.
We're very, very, pleased with the execution and the strategy that the guys there have from a marketing and a sales
standpoint. So, very good performance there. U.K. soup in the quarter was up dramatically. We're coming out with
great innovation, things like Squeeze & Stir, the talking labels. We've got a lot of PR going on. So, there is lots of good
things going on there. And I just think we are executing extremely well in a tough market; there's no doubt about it.
But I think we are advantaged by the fact that the bulk of our businesses, or certainly roughly half of our business is in
the U.K, but even beyond the U.K, if you look at what else is working there, ketchup in Europe, across Europe is doing
extremely well. Roel van Neerbos has been driving that for us globally, and certainly, across Europe. And we've talked
to you about the performance there in the past, and that performance continues to do extremely well, and in fact,
accelerate. So, ketchup across Europe is doing well.

If you think about Russia, that's a real growth engine for us, organic sales up around 19%, as I recall, in the quarter. So,
that's a combination of sauces, and also, baby food. So, we feel very good about that. I mean, to your point about
Southern Europe, yeah, it's a tough environment. No doubt about it. Italy is a tough place to be doing business. We had
a truck strike at the end of the third quarter that certainly impeded the sale somewhat in Q3. But here again, we're
innovating. We're bringing new products out there. We've just got an aseptic, which is a much higher quality baby food
product that has come out in Italy, and that's in the U.K. as well.
And as we look forward, we're investing in the supply chain hub there, which should bring great manufacturing
efficiencies, we're putting in the Heinz Innovation Center, which should amp up our ability to innovate across Europe,
and finally, Keystone continues to roll out. So net-net, yes, Europe's tough environment, but I think we're doing all the
right things.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: And then Ore-Ida. It seems to – in some period the Nielsen data, it looks like Ore-Ida is over
100% of the volume hit to that – to what you're doing at retail. Can you just talk about what the prospects are there?
What's being done to fix that? I know you obviously have the new packaging coming this quarter, but what should we
be looking for?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes, Yes, good question. I mean, Ore-Ida sales were basically flat for the quarter, with
price up and volume down. And as we said before, we as the leader of that category, we took significant pricing last
fall, or actually before then. So, it's been quite a while. Private label tended to stay down. Result was a bit of a value
gap there. And you know, frankly, we could get that share back tomorrow, but what trying to do is balance really
volume, price, share, and margin. I would say elasticity in that category is probably higher than we'd originally
anticipated. And I think if Bill were here, he would use his old maxim of, fix the problem and market the fix. So, we're
addressing it with – addressing the value gap on our two-pound bag.
We're also, as you know, launching a one-pound bag at $1.99. We have high hopes for what that will do for us. And the
plan basically is, once we've resolved the value gap, then we'll go back on air from a marketing standpoint to market
the fix. But we want to make sure that we've addressed the root issue, and then once we're confident of that, we will
market that fix.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thanks very much.

<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good morning.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Good morning.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Could you give us a little bit of an overview of how you see the U.S. economy right now? You're
about to, or you have started to ship these smaller pack sizes to lower opening price points, and some of your
competitors are talking about volume weaknesses that are hurting their profits. But are these small pack sizes, are they
still needed? Are they coming too late, given that the overall economy seems to be improving when you look at some
of these indicators?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes. I – frankly, I'll say what I've always said about the U.S. economy. I am maybe
more pessimistic than certainly our government is about where this economy goes. I think this is going to continue to
be a tough place to do business, in the U.S. You're not seeing companies doing a lot of hiring, in fact, you are hearing
of more companies announcing layoffs and things like that.

So with that, we are going to hope for the best and plan for the worst. I think you are seeing more perimeter shopping
as people use ingredient cooking within the U.S., some people are shifting to more cheaper meals out, and you're seeing
the benefit of that in some of the QSRs, particularly McDonald's and SUBWAY. But at the end of the day, we are not
going to chase share, we could easily buy volume in this kind of market, but I think we're going to continue to try to do
the right things, recognize the environment for what it is.
I think value means different things to different people, and I believe Bill will expand upon that at CAGNY next week.
For some people value means a lower cost per ounce, for others that are really struggling, it is that entry-level price
point, and so that's what we're trying to address. And at all levels of the socioeconomic ladder we are going to be
innovating to meet those needs. It used to be a little simpler in that you could address just the relatively more affluent.
Now, we need to address, again, all parts of the ladder, and that's what we're doing.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Yes. I think when you look at the economy, it's nice to see some improving statistics, but
unemployment is still over 8%. You have more people on food stamps than ever before. There are a number of factors,
and I don't want to take Bill's fire, so I'll stop [Laughter] before I get in trouble.
But I think small sizes have a place with the American consumer. We're going to get it in the right channels. Alternate
channels are doing very well outside of that retail measured data. And I think that's part of the piece that you guys can't
see right now.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: In addition to the economic stresses, I mean, I think the smaller sizes also address
smaller household sizes, and that's probably here for a while, regardless of a rebound in the economy.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes. So, Thilo, to – short answer to your original point, do we think it's too late on
those smaller sizes? No, absolutely not, we think it's very well timed.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: We'd love [inaudible] (35:45), but it's not too late. [Laughter]
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Right. And this shift won't have any negative impact on your margins?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: No. What we're working to do is make sure that we do this smartly, and we are driving
value engineering to take out non-value added costs that the consumer doesn't want to pay for. So, we don't anticipate
that. We're looking to drive this in a margin-neutral kind of way.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: All right, appreciate that. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Alexia Howard from Sanford Bernstein. You may proceed.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good morning, Alexia.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Good morning.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Hi. Can I ask about the Frozen Entrées segment; there wasn't too much commentary in
the press release or on the call so far. Specifically Smart Ones and T.G.I.F., maybe you could speak to those separately.
It looked, again from the measured channel data, as though the promotional spending was up quite a bit in the Frozen
Entrées area, and I was wondering if that was an indication of just ongoing category weakness and competitive
dynamics in there?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes. Well, as you remember, Alexia, the Frozen Entrée category is very cyclical with
strength of the economy, and so what you're seeing is continued softness in that nutritional Frozen Entrée category.

Having said that, I think we are doing all the right things, and driving innovation and very aggressively going after each
of the day parts very successfully with Smart Ones. So, I think that's proof positive of, hey, you do the right thing, you
got the right kind of innovation, you hit the right kind of value equation, and you can win in this kind of market, and
that's what we're trying to do.
It would be nice if the category would stabilize and go up, but we're not going to hold our breath on that. It's been a
number of years now that that Entrée category has been down. And again, if the economy strengthens, we should be
well-positioned to ride that, but we're going to continue playing our game based on the environment that we're faced
with.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Yes. Smart Ones, I don't think the team's getting enough credit for a lot of great work they
have been doing, diversifying the portfolio, going for the 24/7 platform. Remember, we're very heavily
weight-management focused. And Weight Watchers has been doing well, advertising, celebrity spokespersons, et
cetera, and Smart Ones has been gaining share for the last two years, every quarter. So, there's some really good things
going on there. Your point, the category and the frozen categories is soft, but we've been winning with Smart Ones.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: And then T.G.I.F.?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: T.G.I.F., we feel very good about snacks business. Within T.G.I.F. that's about 70% of
the platform there. So, that part of it, we like. It's been working. I think on the Entrée side, a bit weaker, and that's really
reflecting a very tough category dynamic there. So, we'll continue to take a look at what the environment looks like
there, and what the appropriate actions are.

Your next question is from the line of Eric Katzman from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good morning.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: I guess I want to focus in on M&A a little bit. Can you talk about between Quero and
Foodstar from a EPS perspective, what they either subtracted or added to this past quarter? What it looks like for the
fourth quarter, and then any just at least a quantitative or qualitative sense on what those could mean for F 2013?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes. yes, Eric, we are thrilled with how those businesses are performing. They are just
off to a roaring start. You are seeing just some huge numbers coming out of Foodstar over in China. I think our team
there is managing it very, very well, not trying to bite off more than they can chew. They are building their capacity.
They are going one province at a time, and you are seeing some big numbers coming out of there, and we fully expect
that to continue.
In terms of Brazil, that is tracking right on plan. As I mentioned, we've got ketchup in there now going through the
Quero sales force, big growth coming out of there now. It's off a small base, but we are very excited about that, and
frankly, just excited about all the categories in Brazil, and our ability to take their products through the modern trade, or
upgrading their manufacturing capability, et cetera, et cetera. So, I think frankly, I think that, from a bottom line
standpoint, now I won't quote you specific numbers because I don't have them off the top of my head, but I think, just
moderately positive this year. So, probably a bit of a help, and next year, we certainly have high expectations for them.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Yes. Obviously, the goal for us is to take those earnings and reinvest them back into the
business. So, we just launched television for the first time with the Quero brand this quarter, went on air, seeing

tremendous response from that. We're back on air after many years of being dark with the Master brand, soy brand in
China, and frankly, I think in some cases, we just can't spend it fast enough. So, there are plans to continue to invest
and keep these brands growing. So, I think it's not – I don't think it's substantial, but I think they clearly -
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: In a nutshell, we are driving this for the long haul, and what we're trying to do is really
invest in that brand, and make sure that this thing turns into a very, very, big important business for us over time.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: That's understood and logical. I'm just trying to go back to the Analyst Day last May, and I
think that you had quoted that between Foodstar and Quero, they would be at least, I think it was $0.05 per share
dilutive, and now you are saying that those are going to be moderately positive. So, is some of the performance in the
earnings a function of those actually doing a bit better than you thought on the bottom line?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Eric, I wouldn't be too specific there. I don't recall $0.05 on -
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: [inaudible] (41:02) flat this year.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: – last year's. But you know I do think we are slightly better than plan at the bottom
line, but again, the strategy is to invest in the business as opposed to letting all of the sales upside fall to the bottom
line.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Eric, I'll search the transcript, and give you a call this afternoon.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up on – you've got the cash cost of the restructuring,
the higher CapEx, Project Keystone, et cetera. All of these spending levers, some expense, some cash. How are you
feeling about the company's capability of making a larger acquisition?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: I think, as we've always said, our sweet spot is in that sort of bolt-on kind of arena,
things like Foodstar and Quero, that's our bread and butter. We know how to do it. We do it very well, focused on
emerging markets and things like that. So, that tends to be our sweet spot.
For the right situation that fit well, we'd certainly do a larger deal. We did HP/LP a while back. That was an $850
million deal. So, we've done larger deals in the past, but our sweet spot is really the bolt-on side.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: I think that's a great question for Bill next week.

<Q - Jason English>: I want to go back to this inventory issue, because – sorry, I was a little distracted and maybe I
missed it. It sounds like you plan on taking a lot of inventory out of the system in the fourth quarter. I was just looking
through your balance sheet and noticed that for a couple of years you had great success lowering your finished goods,
or work-in-process inventory, below the rate of sales. And for the last four quarters, it's surprisingly ramped higher. Is
this sort of correctional actions to reverse what's happened in the last few quarters?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: No, no. I mean, if you think about it, you've got the impact of the acquisitions in there
particularly. You've got both Foodstar and Quero that our inventory that obviously we didn't hold before we acquired

them. So, that is a big chunk of the increase.
I think in this kind of environment where the – some of the demand side of things is a little more volatile than it has
been in the past, it's gotten more challenging to constantly stay on top of exactly where demand goes, and exactly what
your production forecasts should look like. So, this is just in recognition of the fact that we want to take this inventory
out. It's the right thing to do for the business. We think we have the opportunity, and let's get after it.
<Q - Jason English>: I understand on the acquisition, but the acquisition is also in the sales growth. So, I guess what
I'm getting at is, is I'm curious if the fact that your finished goods have been ramping ahead of sales, you've kind of had
better utilization rates, has that artificially boosted gross margins the last few quarters?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Not – I wouldn't say materially, that I know of. But keep in mind also that, with the
productivity initiatives that we've got going and the closure of a number of plants, and in certain cases, before you close
the plant you're going to have to build some buffer stock, and things like that. So, that's a bit of the story as well. So, I
think that probably plays in to the equation, and with a lot of that behind us, though, a bit more to come, as you know,
it's time to – it's time to get very focused on inventory and take it out.
<Q - Jason English>: Thanks. One last question, and I'll pass it on. Venezuela there's been a lot of chatter, and I know
Hugo Chavez mentioned Heinz as one company that it's investigating for potential price controls. Is there any update
on that? And if we were to presume that price controls were put in place, how might the abatement of the hyperinflation
impact your emerging market sales growth?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: It's unclear the exact situation in some ways down there, but we've operated in
Venezuela for over 50 years. We have a great team there, we manage that environment extremely effectively. We're
continuing to deal with the vagaries of the market, but at the end of the day, we don't expect a material impact.

Your next question is from the line of Andrew Lazar from Barclays Capital. You may proceed.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good morning.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thanks for the streamlined presentation and earnings release; that was actually helpful. Just I
guess first thing would be, Art, can you just remind us what you've already kind of set out there about how the
incremental sort of productivity actions you are taking, Keystone and such, how do they play out from a benefits
standpoint as we go into fiscal 2013. I know you aren't going to get into 2013 guidance, but what have you said, if you
could remind me, on the benefits, and how they play out in 2013?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes. From a Keystone standpoint, as you recall, that's – it's really kind of a slow build.
We've taken a very, I would say a methodical approach in rolling out Keystone, making sure that we don't bet the farm
and introduce too much risk in to the business, so we continue to knock off the markets one at a time here. And so that
– we probably won't be largely done with Keystone until – I don't know, end of 2014, something like that. FY 2014 is
what we've said, and we're sticking to that. And so I think the bulk of the benefits will be out a ways from Keystone.
Now you are certainly seeing – we've got SAP in the U.K., for instance. U.K. business has been doing extremely well,
and I will chalk most of that up to very very, strong leadership with the right strategy and the right execution, but I got
to tell you, I think we're arming that team with the right tools, and giving them the right visibility of the business, and
we're seeing benefit out of it. But market-by-market you'll start seeing that, but I think the big chunks of benefits out of
Keystone will be more towards FY 2014 and beyond.

<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Great, that's helpful. And then I just want to pick up on the pricing and productivity question
earlier. It's just interesting like from a group perspective over time, the group has typically been able to cover inflation
with pricing, and productivity sort of helped margins. And then I'd say more recently it's really been pricing and
productivity that's generally, for the industry, been needed to sort of cover inflation. And I just – I thought it was
notable this quarter when you mentioned that pricing and productivity covered half of inflation. And again, I don't think
that's necessarily all that dissimilar from some of your peers, but it is a notable difference than what we have seen over
time.
Do you think that's something that has just structurally changed, or are we in just such an anomalous sort of timeframe
from a consumer and sort of input cost perspective that it just wasn't doable this time around? I'm surely curious on
your thoughts there.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes. I think the reality is that the – it is an interesting time here from an economic
standpoint where the unemployment rate went quite high at the same time, that commodity inflation went up
significantly.
I think all this washes out over time, and so you've got an interesting period of time here, and it certainly varies by
market. I mean, in many of our emerging markets we are seeing strong growth in margins, and both at the gross and
operating margin line. But in some of these developed markets, it's a tougher equation. And so, again, I believe it'll
wash out over time, but with the combination of high unemployment, a lot of people de-leveraging in terms of taking
down their personal debt, and commodities going up same time, pretty tough environment. Good. Frankly, good
question to ask Bill, and I think -
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: I think you're going to hear a lot from Bill next week.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes, why don't you talk to him about that next week, and I'm sure he'll have a pretty
strong point of view on that.

Your next question is from the line of Rob Moskow from Credit Suisse. You may proceed.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi, thanks.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Hi, Rob.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Kind of another question on the gross margin. If I look at what the numbers are shaping up for
the year, it looks like you're guiding gross margin down for fourth quarter. Can I assume it's about a 100 basis-point hit
partially – as a result of the inventory absorption?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: I'm not sure I want to get it that specific about it. We do expect gross margin to be
down on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, but sequentially better than what we've been seeing.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: As we said in the earlier quarters going back to the way commodities and pricing are
going, is we expect that comparison to gradually get easier as the year went through, but still a challenge.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes, yes. So – and that's why during this time I think we are doing the right things.
We're very aggressively going after fixed costs and trying to take that out to take pressure off. We're looking to
value-engineer, and again, that we're looking to maintain very strong quality of the products obviously. But there are
often non-value-added costs that you can get out in terms of packaging, or cartons, or whatever.

<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Also taking out the fixed costs associated with some of the plants that frankly, we
didn't need. So, we're working it hard.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Yes. Let me ask you then on SG&A. The last – first two quarters of the year you were up
about $60 million, $50 million, year-over-year, I think the acquisition played a role in that. You are only up $27 million
in third quarter, and you said that you've attacked SG&A costs, you've tightened those. Can you tell us what has been
cut in SG&A? And then also advertising is up, I think about 7% this year. What do you think it's going to be for the full
year? Is it going to be up again in fourth quarter?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes, year-to-date we are up about 10%, and we will – we do anticipate marketing
spending to be up again in the fourth quarter. But from an SG&A standpoint, we continue to invest in the areas where
we feel like we need added capability. So, we've talked about Keystone, supply-chain hub, we've talked about emerging
markets. So, we are continuing to invest in there, but I think good management teams make trade-off decisions. And so
as we invest there, the question is, hey, what are you not going to spend money on? So we are just tightening our belt
across the board. We have taken a look at layers in the organization, spans of control, we have taken a look at just lots
of discretionary spending, and if we don't need to do, we don't do it.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: Rob, also if you look back to last year, phasing of our investments last year were
gradually increased all through the year, versus this year we have probably taken a – as we said before, a more steady
approach throughout the year. So, I think that's part of the comparisons that you talked about, say first half to second
half.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Absolutely.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: All right, well, in the interest of time, I know we've got another peer company with a call
coming up. So, I think we've got time for one more.

And that question will come from the line of David Driscoll from Citi Investment. You may proceed.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Great, thanks a lot for taking the question, I'll make it quick.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Yes.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Nice quarter in a tough environment. I want to just ask a little bit more about the acceleration
in the emerging markets. Certainly growth in Asia-Pac of 6.5% and Rest of World at 30% – by the way, one of these
days you guys got to change the segment name of Rest of World to something more attractive.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Mike Milone agrees with you.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes. Mike Milone would appreciate that.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: The growth in these segments was really terrific. How sustainable are these types of rates of
growth? And can you talk about capacity constraints? Because I know in both the Foodstar acquisition and in the Quero
acquisition, capacity issues were very key in your initial assessment of what those businesses would contribute to
Heinz. So, can you talk about both the growth rates going forward, and then the capacity side?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes, I think this emerging market thing, Bill has been working at for years and years,
and we as a management team have been working on it years and years, because we saw this coming. To be quite
honest, you just have to look at the dynamics in these emerging markets, with the rising middle class, more
discretionary income, fragmented trade environment, fragmented competitive set. I mean, all dynamics in those
markets are very positive. And so we see for a long period of time very strong growth in those kinds – those markets.
And you're seeing – you look over the past, and we've been at that double-digit kind of rate, and we sure expect that

kind of number to continue over the long haul, because this is not a short-term phenomenon. If you look at just some of
the demographics over the next 10 years to 20 years, you will see dramatic growth in those markets that will help
consumer product kind of companies. So, we're very, very, attuned to that. The strategy is all built for it.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Bill will talk more.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes, Bill will talk more next week, but we've got the right kind of talent. We're
investing in those businesses, we're building capabilities in it, and I think we are in good shape there.
From a capacity standpoint, yes, we are going to have to build factories occasionally, and we are in certain places, we
are in the acquisitions, and that's why our capital spending this year, if you look at it, is a little bit higher than our
historic – I don't know, we've been at 2.5%, we're probably up to 3.5% to 4% this year, and a lot of that is around
emerging markets. Good investment, very strong return to the shareholders.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: Yes, on average we've taken that CapEx spending up to 4%, but a disproportionate
share of that CapEx spending relative to sales is going to the emerging markets.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Yes.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Well, maybe just a final follow-up. That 30% in Rest of World, that number is – that's not
just double-digits, that's one of the strongest numbers we've seen from any company. So, that's the number that I find,
from just modeling the future, the toughest number to deal with, because at one sense it looks great, and there's
probably no reason to believe you don't continue in the next couple of quarters. But I always wonder if there's
something out there that you know of that changes it back down to like 15%, or something like that.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: You know – I wouldn't get into conjuncture on particular segments of the business.
But we expect very strong growth there across Latin America, we expect the Quero business to be a great addition to
this portfolio. So, I think we are continuing to look for strong growth there.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Well, and it's provided us additional scale in that whole region, so our – Mexico, Costa
Rica, Colombia, Peru. We have a lot of businesses that now have more scale to leverage, and I think they've really got a
great team there driving those results. So -
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: You'd hope that'd be a very strong platform for us throughout South America.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Absolutely. All right, well just quickly -
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: See you at CAGNY.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes, see you at CAGNY.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Well, see you at CAGNY.
