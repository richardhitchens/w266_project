Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our
2015 second-quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com.
During our call today, we will be talking about results for the second quarter of 2015 and comparing them to the same
period in 2014, unless otherwise stated. A glossary of terms, data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI
for currency and acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations, and adjustments to
earnings per share, or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures, are at the end of today's webcast slides,
which are posted on our website.
Reduced-Risk Products, or RRPs, is the term we use to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and
population harm in comparison to smoking combustible cigarettes.

Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the
forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the
various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.
It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?
Jacek Olczak
Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. Our excellent start to the year was reinforced in the second
quarter. Organic cigarette volume was strong, declining by a modest 1.4% due to lower cigarette industry volume
across all regions, partly offset by market share gains in Asia, EEMA and Latin America & Canada Regions.
On a June year-to-date basis, our organic cigarette volume was essentially flat, or down by approximately 1%,
excluding inventory movements. For 2015, we forecast an organic cigarette volume decline in the range of 1% to 1.5%.
Net revenues and adjusted OCI in the quarter were up by 4.5% and 6.1%, respectively, excluding currency and
acquisitions. This growth was driven by strong pricing across all regions, partially offset by lower volume largely in the
Asia and EU regions. Adjusted diluted EPS excluding currency grew by 9.2% to $1.54. June year-to-date adjusted
diluted EPS grew by 15.8% excluding currency. This growth benefited from a gain in Korea related to inventories built
ahead of the excise tax increase effective January 2015.
As announced in our earnings release this morning, we are reaffirming our 2015 reported diluted EPS guidance, at
prevailing exchange rate, to be in a range of $4.32 to $4.42.
Our guidance includes a full-year unfavorable currency impact of approximately $1.15 per share at prevailing exchange
rates. Excluding currency, our 2015 guidance continues to represent a growth rate of 9% to 11% compared to our
adjusted diluted EPS of $5.02 in 2014. Given our better-than-anticipated volume and market share performance, we
now expect to be towards the upper end of this range.
As previously communicated, our guidance includes incremental investment during the second half of the year to
support the deployment of iQOS in Japan, Italy and additional 2015 launch markets. Our guidance now also includes
accelerated spending in the fourth quarter behind planned iQOS launches in 2016 as well as incremental marketing
investments in the second half to further reinforce the favorable momentum of our combustible business.
As discussed in today's press release, our guidance excludes the potential impact of a motion that is currently before the
Québec Court of Appeal related to a judgment involving the two class actions against our Canadian affiliate, Rothmans,
Benson & Hedges. Should the Court of Appeal deny the motion, PMI expects to incur an after-tax charge of
approximately $0.09 per share in the second quarter, which would have a corresponding impact on our 2015 reported
diluted EPS guidance. Separately, RBH's appeal on the merits of the case is pending before the appellate court.
Although the total estimated unfavorable currency impact on our current guidance remains unchanged versus our April
guidance, there has been a shift since then in its composition. As you can see on this chart, the positive impact of the
euro has been offset notably by the unfavorable impact of the Russian ruble.
Strong pricing [inaudible] (6:05) financial performance. In the second quarter, we recorded a variance of $514 million,
reflecting higher pricing across all four regions. We increased retail prices during the quarter in key markets such as
Argentina, Germany, Indonesia and Russia.
Our June year-to-date pricing variance of $1.1 billion leaves us well-positioned to achieve a full-year pricing broadly in
line with our historical annual average of approximately $1.8 billion. As a reminder, our first-half pricing variance
includes the gain in Korea that I discussed earlier.
Our results in the quarter were underpinned by continued market share gains. Share in our top-30 OCI markets grew by
0.1 points to 37.5%, with our share up or essentially flat in 17 of these markets. Our share performance was supported
by the strength of our leading brand portfolio, which continues to benefit from the rollout of our new commercial

approach. The integration of marketing and sales expertise, increased consumer focus and field sales force
empowerment are proving to be a competitive advantage.
Importantly, Marlboro was a key contributor to our share growth. The brand's international share, excluding China and
the U.S., increased by 0.3 points to 9.5%. This performance was broad-based, with share up in all four regions.
Marlboro's share benefited from the further rollout of the new 2.0 Architecture, which was introduced in some 20
additional markets during the quarter, predominantly in the EEMA region. By year-end, we expect to have rolled out
Marlboro 2.0 in approximately 100 markets.
I will now provide an update on selected geographies, beginning with the EU region. Cigarette industry volume in the
second quarter declined by 3%, or 2.3% excluding trade inventory movements. Consequently, we now expect a decline
of 3% to 3.5% for the full-year versus our previous forecast of approximately 4%.
Our new forecast reflect the improving macroeconomic conditions, a moderation in the level of illicit trade, less
out-switching to fine cut products and the lower prevalence of e-vapor products. The moderation in the level of illicit
trade in the quarter is consistent with the findings of an annual study published by KPMG in May. It concluded that the
consumption of counterfeit and contraband products declined in 2014 across most EU markets, with France and the UK
being notable exceptions.
While our cigarette market share for the EU region was stable at 40.4% in the second quarter, our top three brands –
Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield – all gained share. Marlboro's cigarette share was up in four of the top six largest
markets by industry volume, with particularly strong growth in Germany and Spain. However, Marlboro's share
declined in Italy, following the brand's move above the €5 per pack retail price point during the first quarter. Adjusted
OCI grew by 4.9% in the quarter, excluding currency and acquisitions, driven by strong pricing which more than offset
our cigarette volume decline due to a lower total market.
Turning now to Russia, the decline in cigarette industry volume decelerated to 4.2% in the quarter, resulting in a June
year-to-date decrease of 6.5%. We now expect a full-year decline towards the lower end of our 8% to 10% forecast
range. However, the economic environment remains fragile and we are witnessing some signs of down-trading to the
low-price segment.
Our excellent performance in this important market continued in the quarter. We recorded a May quarter-to-date share
gain of 0.8 points to reach 27.6%, driven notably by above premium Parliament, as well as low-price Bond Street and
super-low Next, both of which also benefited from wider distribution in the eastern part of the country. Our cigarette
volume grew by 5.3% in the quarter. The combination of the volume increase and higher unit margins, driven by
significant retail price increases, resulted in strong double-digit OCI growth in the quarter, excluding currency.
I will now cover selected markets in our Asia region, beginning with Indonesia. Cigarette industry volume declined by
4.6% in the quarter, following strong first quarter growth of 6%. On a June year-to-date basis, industry volume
increased by 0.4%.
The shift in adult smokers' preferences from hand-rolled to machine-made kretek cigarettes continued in the second
quarter, with the expansion of the overall machine-made kretek segment driven by the accelerated share growth of full
flavor products. The segment share of lighter-tasting products declined slightly.
Our market share increased by 0.5 points to 35.2%, despite our relatively high exposure to the declining hand-rolled
kretek segment. This share growth was led by Dji Sam Soe Magnum, which helped drive a 2.5 point increase in our
share of the machine-made full-flavor kretek segment, and Sampoerna A, our leading machine-made lighter-tasting
kretek brand.
During the quarter, we further realigned our production from hand-rolled to machine-made kretek cigarettes. While this
had an adverse impact on the Asia region's costs in the quarter, it should provide an operational foundation better suited
for long-term growth.

Over the mid to long-term, we expect cigarette industry volume to increase within a range of 1% to 3% annually,
driven by the growing adult population and rising income levels. We forecast growth towards the lower end of this
range in 2015, due to the recent softening of the economic environment.
As announced last month, Sampoerna will explore options to comply with the Indonesian Stock Exchange's mandatory
requirement of 7.5% minimum public shareholding by January 30, 2016. These include potential capital market
transactions.
In Japan, cigarette industry volume increased by 11% in the quarter, due to the timing of retail trade inventory
movements related to the April 2014 tax-driven price increases. However, industry volume declined by 1.7%,
excluding this distortion, and by 2.6% on a June year-to-date basis, consistent with our forecast for a full-year decline
of 2.5% to 3%.
Our market share declined by one point in the quarter to 25.4%, though it was down by a more modest 0.4 points after
adjusting for inventory movements. We continue to invest behind our brands and for 2015 expect our share to be
broadly in line with last year's level. We are supporting the Marlboro 2.0 Architecture, which we began rolling out at
the end of March, and are also investing behind our strong pipeline of innovations, as highlighted by the recent launch
of two Lark variants in the rapidly growing new taste menthol segment.
In the Philippines, the competitive environment continued to improve during the quarter, benefiting from the
introduction of tax stamps. Smoking prevalence remained stable in the quarter. However, average daily consumption
declined due to higher retail prices, although it did not deteriorate on a sequential basis compared to the first quarter.
This indicates that adult smokers have largely adjusted to higher prices at the bottom of the market.
While our market share declined due to higher estimated duty-paid volume by our principal local competitor,
Marlboro's share increased by 2.1 points to 20.2%. The brand benefited from improved price gaps, which helped drive
a volume increase of 18.1%.
As a result of the improved competitive environment and the excellent performance of Marlboro, we are increasingly
optimistic about the OCI outlook for the Philippines and are expecting strong growth this year, excluding currency.
Turning now to our RRP portfolio, we will commence the national expansion of iQOS in Japan this September.
Building on the success of our pilot launch in Nagoya, iQOS will be rolled out in key regions at a price of 9,980 yen, or
approximately $80. The roll-out will feature an upgraded version of iQOS in new colors and textures to broaden its
appeal among adult smokers. Our expansion plan for Italy also remains on track, with additional city launches
commencing later this year.
I'm also extremely pleased to announce the launch of iQOS in Switzerland this August. The launch will focus on five
major cities with retail distribution in approximately 250 outlets by the end of October. The iQOS kit will feature the
upgraded version of iQOS, while Marlboro HeatSticks will be available in regular, smooth and menthol variants. On
our ecommerce platform, the kit will have a retail price of 80 Swiss francs, or approximately $85, and HeatSticks will
retail with a premium positioning at eight Swiss francs per pack of twenty.
We generated free cash flow of $2.9 billion in the first half of the year. This was in line with our free cash flow for the
first half of 2014, despite an adverse currency impact of $1.6 billion. Our resilient cash flow performance was
supported by prudent cash flow management, particularly with regard to working capital and capital expenditures.
For 2015, we forecast free cash flow to be broadly in line with last year's level, despite the significant currency
headwind.
In conclusion, our excellent start to the year was reinforced in the second quarter, with a modest organic cigarette
volume decline and a strong currency-neutral financial result driven by robust business fundamentals.
In the combustible business, our superior brand portfolio, supported by a superb commercial organization, is driving
strong pricing and continued market share gains. Meanwhile, our iQOS pilot launches are performing well, we are on
track with further roll-outs in Japan and Italy, and will soon be launching the product in Switzerland.

We remain committed to returning around 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders. As of last Friday's market close,
our dividend yield of 4.9% was significantly above that of our Tobacco Peer Group and the 10-year U.S. Treasury
Notes.
On a currency-neutral basis, our 2015 EPS guidance reflects a growth rate of 9% to 11% versus 2014 adjusted diluted
EPS of $5.02. Given our better-than-anticipated performance, we now expect to be towards the upper end of this range.
Thank you. And now, I will be happy to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you. Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So, first, I guess, if we think about your guidance for the full year, you're thinking the
FX-neutral earnings growth is coming in at the upper end of the range. Obviously, the first half has been pretty strong;
so it sounds like maybe there is some incremental spending that you've kind of called out around the iQOS as well as
the combustibles. So, is there a way to kind of quantify some of that incremental spending beyond what you had
anticipated at the beginning of the year?
And then, what is sort of prompting some of that incremental spending both on the iQOS side and then on the
combustible side?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Look, Judy, clearly as I said in my remarks, there is incremental spending by accelerating some
2016 launches of iQOS towards the beginning of the year; hence we have to ramp up the infrastructure already in
preparations already this year as we're increasing the investment behind the combustible business.
But as you have noted, I mean, it will have a very strong share growth momentum in a number of markets behind
Marlboro and other international brands; so we think it's just the right time to further support the performance of this
brand.
And, frankly speaking, we slowly start looking more already into the 2016. I mean, we've had – since then we'll have a
very strong 2015, so we're trying to maintain that momentum going forward. You have to excuse me, but I would rather
not quantify how much is the next; but clearly it would be above our guidance absent this additional investment.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then just in the second quarter, the margins in Asia came in a little bit softer; and I
think underlying FX-neutral earnings or operating income growth was down a little bit, which I guess is a little bit
surprising given the strong volume performance that you had in Japan. So, I know you cited the Indonesia distribution
expenses.
Can you just talk about kind of the puts and takes in terms of the second-quarter Asia margins? And is the Indonesia
cost increases sort of one-time for the quarter, or is this continuation into the next few quarters?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I mean, in Indonesia specifically, we had extra expenses in Q2 connecting with a reallocating of
the capacity between hand-rolled facilities and the machine-made facilities. So, this is more of the sort of the one-timer.
But, this clearly hits the entire Asia regions, when it comes to the profit margins and overall profitability.
I think for the full year, Asia clearly will have a much better performance than we had last year. But last year, Asia had
a pretty, I could say, a low, a lousy performance, okay? But, Asia is heading towards the mid to – is approaching the
mid- to long-term growth target. I mean, they may miss it by a bit, but I think Asia overall is looking good going

forward for the full year.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then my last question, just the Sampoerna decision that I guess you're looking at in
terms of some of the capital market transaction potentially. Can you just help us, how you're thinking about some of
that decision?
And to the extent that there is additional cash flow that comes in with that transaction, would you think about that
giving you some cushion to raise a dividend and start resuming the share buyback?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, first we need to make the decision which avenue actually we're finally pursuing in
Indonesia. So, I will park for a moment the question how we would distribute the eventual proceeds from the
transaction, if the transactions happen. I will just park that question for later.
As you know, I mean, there is on the one hand the requirement to have a public float of a 7.5%. We're clearly below
that 7.5%. On the other hand, you have squeeze-out rules which are not necessarily the most effective. There is
somehow in between those two parameters we'll have to make our decision. But, I will just – we have to wait some
time until we conclude what is the best option for the company and the shareholders.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Vivien N. Azer>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Vivien.
<Q - Vivien N. Azer>: My first question has to do with your outlook on pricing. Clearly, it's been incredibly robust in
the first half of the year, and you noted the benefit of Korea. But, as I look to the back half, given how much pricing
you've already realized, are there any other callouts in terms of you guys ending up realizing pricing roughly in line
with your historical average? Because, right now, it would look like you would be tracking ahead of that.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: We might come slightly above the historical average; therefore, the language which we use is,
they will be broadly in line. So, don't hold me by a $10 million or $20 million or $30 million. But I think we're looking
into the strong pricing for this year but, overall, pricing environment, with the tax and the volumes, total industry
volumes, I think are playing on our side. So, yes, we're looking for the strong pricing for this year.
<Q - Vivien N. Azer>: That's very helpful. Thank you. My second question has to do with Russia. While it's
encouraging to hear that you think volumes will come in at the better end of the range, I guess the offset being the
down-trading. It feels to me like the down-trading has been at play for a while given the outsized volume gains that
you've seen for your lower-priced brands. So, could you elaborate on that comment a little bit? Are you seeing
down-trading accelerating? Is that coincident with the second price increase having hit? Any other color I think would
be helpful.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I think it's – look, until the Q1, I remember the same question was being asked at that time. I said
that we don't really observe much of a down-trading or down-trading at all in Russia.
As you turned into Q2, yes, there was a pricing which was hitting the market in between. Yes, you could see that the
market somehow consolidates in the middle. I mean, the super-super-low price segments are losing; the low price is
gaining; the premium is slightly losing.
So, yes, you have a down-trading. We always had Russia on the watch-out list due to the underlying macros and the
overall sentiment, et cetera. Good news is that the Russian volumes, I mean, it seems that we are confronted with a bit

better price elasticities which we initially assumed; hence our revision that most likely Russia will end the year with
about 8% or closer to 8% industry volume decline versus the initial range of 8% to 10%.
The volumes for the year-to-date are pretty strong, taking into consideration the overall market situations and the
pricing taken. So yes, the down-trading is – we start seeing. Now, it's not really a big surprise because Russia operates
with a – compared to many matured markets – with pretty wide price gaps. The gap between a premium and a
low-price cigarette are much higher than what you, for example, see in a Western or in the European Union.
So, yes, there is some room for the consumers to at least temporarily mitigate some of the macro headwinds by
hopefully temporarily going to the lower-priced segment. But remember, Russia is one of the markets when you see the
down-trading if macros are a little bit weaker, situations improve we could see the up-trading.
Good news for us is that I think portfolio-wise and I think this was supported by the performance of our two or three
brands. Both Bond Street and Next at the bottom of the market; and above-premium Parliament, which all three brands
are gaining share. So, portfolio-wise, we're okay. We still have to continue watching how Russia unfolds in terms of the
dynamics between price segments.
<Q - Vivien N. Azer>: That's very helpful. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Thanks. Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: I just had two questions. First, within EEMA, results were obviously still quite good on
an overall basis, given all the volatility in the region. But I noticed that price/mix and OCI growth were both a bit
below trend. Typically, we've seen them growing at a double-digit rate. So, what factors could you call out that may
have contributed to the more moderate rate of growth in the quarter?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I think the pricing was coming stronger as plan. I think slightly presumably will have an
impact of some sort of a mix, partially driven by Russia, okay? So, this is what it is. But overall, I think EEMA is – and
Russia in particular – we are expecting a very strong performance this year for the full year, both Russia and the
EEMA.
I mean, the other locations, other geographies in EEMA which have a strong performance, North Africa, I mean a few
others. So, I think we feel positive on the outlook for this year for EEMA.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thanks. And second question, just on iQOS in Switzerland: can you talk a little
bit more about the determination of the price point for the HeatSticks themselves? And just at a broader level, what
have your learnings been from Italy and Japan on relative price points? How does the retail price of eight francs
compared to a comparable pack of Marlboro cigarettes? And do we have any clarity on the tax treatment?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Marlboro HeatSticks for the pack of 20, slightly below the Marlboros Marlboro I think is at 8.50
francs. We decided to go in this market for Marlboro of eight francs. We have a tax clarification. And as in Japan and
Italy, iQOS HeatSticks are not classified as a cigarette product, and hence will enjoy the lower taxation than the
combustible cigarette.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. That's great. Thanks, Jacek.

Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: I guess I was hoping you could drill down a little more on your Marlboro Architecture, since
you've seen such a positive impact from Marlboro 2.0 in several markets. And then could you give us an idea which
particular markets you feel there could be even more upside potential?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Look, we're rolling, as we speak, I mean, it's Marlboro 2.0 in the additional markets. As I said by
year-end we should see the mark of about 100 markets. So that essentially almost covers most of our important
geographies. It's well received. I think if you look at the performance of Marlboro in Germany, I think it clearly is an
impact of Marlboro 2.0.
I think I would say that performance in Germany actually goes above our expectations. And if I look at the
demographics, how we managed to change the demographic behind the Marlboros, it's not just the market share
current, but also how the demographics all goes well for the future of Marlboro. I mean Germany would be one of the
markets that we can see the further upside. But in general, in essentially all geographies Marlboro, the new supports,
also connected with the commercial approach, et cetera, I mean it yields the results.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: No, that's a good point. And you mentioned Germany because clearly it's done very well.
So, how realistic do you think it would be to assume the performance that you've seen there could be replicated in some
of the other key markets?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, it is being replicated. I mean it might be not to that extent as in Germany; but overall if I
look at changing demographics behind the Marlboro, the [indiscernible] (31:37), the values of Marlboro, how Marlboro
resonates more on being dynamic, innovative sort of a brand, I mean this qualitative assessment of the Marlboro is by
far better in essentially all geographies when we launch it. I can't find in my memory a market which we wouldn't move
this way.
Now market share performance in a current period from place to place may also be impacted by the – given the price
situations. I would call out, for example, Mexico, right, when – yes, there is a bit of a down-trading in the market.
There are some pricing pressures at the bottom of the market, so you might have a temporary brand share erosion.
But what we really focus on is to making sure that the underlying demographics behind the brands are getting better.
Because this really – once the pricing is unlocked or solved, that really will support or should support the further
growth of the brand. So, even in the market where Marlboro has a little bit of a share pressure, within a premium
segment Marlboro actually is performing very strongly. It's gaining share.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Jacek, you guys announced the extension of your strategic
framework with Altria Group; so what do you think the biggest benefits will be? For instance, could it be the
acceleration of the pace that you're bringing new products to market and/or increasing the number of new products?
And then maybe could you give us an idea of how much your investments behind Reduced-Risk Products broadly
could increase as a result of this extended framework?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, we've had the existing, as you remember, agreement with Altria on the current generation
of e-cigarette product. And this agreement essentially will focus both companies – will take both companies' focus
behind the new generation of e-cigarette focus.
I think Altria is bringing to the face of the table quite a knowledge of the existing products and other critical
components. We have our own research, our own discoveries, our own fruits of the investment through R&D. And I
think it makes good sense for both companies from the results management to pool their resources together and work
further jointly on the new generation.

I think logically this should result in acceleration of a development of a new generation cigarette product. And, hence
obviously, both of us, both companies could be in their respective markets faster in addressing the consumer needs.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hey, good morning.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Whether or not – regardless of what the Indonesian transaction does or doesn't look like,
could you give a little sense of how you think about resuming buybacks and if there's any metrics you're looking for, or
if you would want to see a turn in currency for maybe even a little bit of time, if you're eager to try to get back to it, or
if you want to be more cautious and have some cushion on the balance sheet? What's the way that you frame that
internally?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, look, if we're looking into a sustainable share buyback program, we clearly have to go back
to what took us out of the share buyback program currently. And that clearly is the big headwind which we get from the
currency. We have made it very clear that underlying business performance, whether you look at the top line, bottom
line, et cetera, and the cash flow generation is coming very – is very strong.
I mean, the currency is essentially sending our credit metrics at the edge of our current credit rating, and therefore we
had to suspend it. So, it's the currency which is the main culprit behind the absence of a share buyback program this
year. So, we'll have to see the improvement on a currency front from this side.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just on iQOS, you've completed some clinical
studies recently. On the national rollouts in Japan, in Italy, and then also in the launch in Switzerland, is there any
health claim associated with those that you're making on the product?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Not a health claim, but I think we're moving slowly into making the reduced exposure claims;
and this is also the result of the six short-term clinical studies, which have been completed as per plan.
And the study results, they show a substantial reduction in the relevant biomarkers of exposure in adult consumers who
switch to iQOS; and this is compared, obviously, to adult consumers who continue to smoke conventional cigarettes.
We have the results of the studies, and I believe part of our communications in this location and other locations which
we have not disclosed yet will have a component of the reduced exposure claims.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: So, just to clarify, maybe my word choice was a little off saying health claim; but you are
making a reduced risk or reduced exposure claim associated with it?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: They are two different things, reduced risk and reduced exposure. Reduced exposure, we base on
the knowledge which we have today, based on the results of the clinical studies, et cetera.
I think we're getting into positions that we can make a reduced exposure claims. Reduced risk claims, I think it's more
of the story of the 2016, and depends on the regulatory framework in the countries in which we will be launching
iQOS.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. Thanks. And then just on Australia, could you give an update on what the pricing
environment is looking like there and if pricing from the latest round is sticking, or if there is any more promotional
intensity?

And I guess specifically, too, in the last quarter's call you said it was looking like less of a drag – if even maybe a drag
at all this year. Is that still your view, or could you give any update on how you're thinking about that market?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I mean, we had the pricing in the beginning of Q2; it somehow sticks. It's not maybe the sort of
the perfections you would like to see, but maybe life is not perfect. So we have to live with what we have.
It's clearly Australia is much less, if at all, the drag this year that it used to be for us last year. And I think that's also the
outlook for the full year. We'll have all the September tax price, hopefully price change as well, and we'll see how this
unfolds.
You have – somehow the down-trading I think in the market is a little bit slightly better; but it's not really something
which I think at this stage would put us into jeopardy in terms of our total PMI performance for the full year. But, it's
vastly better than last year. But, we would like to grow the profitability in this market rather than just on a comp basis
be better than last year.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: No, that's helpful. Thanks. Just one quick last one in the Philippines. Have you seen any
impact from the launch of Chesterfield and L&M? Is that becoming a meaningful part of that portfolio, or is it still
early?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, hopeful – this is still early. I think the early results are good, but that's a bit of the longer
run. We're clearly building a portfolio to reflect the current market reality dynamics, et cetera.
If I can just extrapolate – and I think I have a good reason to extrapolate – of Chesterfield's performance from other
international markets in which we activate, that brand should do properly its designed job in the Philippines market as
well. But, it's too early at this stage to start looking.
Still Marlboro, what is very important, grows very strongly the share and the volumes. And that's great, because this is
what is a good reflection of the strength of the Marlboro and obviously reaction to the lower-price gaps.
Fortune is not doing that bad. It's quite a lot of initiatives about our second brand which we have there, Fortune; and I
think this brand also has a great future going forward.
And I think Chesterfield, L&M are the brands which will maybe initially complement the portfolio, and maybe one day
they're going to play a more significant role in the overall portfolio.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. Yeah, that's great. Thank you very much.

<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi, I just had two questions for you, if I could. A bit of a follow-on to one of Michael's
questions there. In relation to – there is a comment about returning 100% of the cash flow to investors. So, I'm just
curious. You've had some pretty strong operating cash flow performance this year, some working capital
improvements.
As you – what's the – is it a two times debt-to-EBITDA target you're targeting here? And therefore, incremental cash
flow if there is better working capital control, is that just going towards debt reduction in the short run like we saw this
quarter?

<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. I mean, with the credit rating which we're shooting at is about a 2.5, right? Because this is
what is allowed for our credit rating. The cash, if we deliver the free cash flow for this year broadly, we've aligned with
the last year. Last year was about $6.5 billion, slightly above the $6.5 billion. That's a nice cushion to have versus the
dividend commitment which currently stands at about $6.1 billion, $6.2 billion. So, this is how we're looking at that
thing. We want to have a nice cushion above the current dividend at the current level.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And then I have one other question if I could, please. On the facility to make
your Reduced-Risk Products in Italy, is that completed in the third quarter? Is that going to be like fully operational?
And then should we expect around Q3 to hear about more markets in which you're going to begin launching that
product?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I think the structures, et cetera, are completed or about to be completed, and we're now moving to
the installing and equipment, to the machinery. So, I think it all goes as per plan.
As we said the capacity from that unit in addition to the training center, which is producing the initial five billion
capacity, should be available as of 2016. So, very shortly we should have an access to the incremental capacity coming
from this effect.

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Marshall with Barclays.
<Q - William Marshall>: Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - William Marshall>: Just curious, first, I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on the decision to
dissolve the JV with Swedish Match? And looking at that I would imagine that over time your emphasis around that
portfolio of snus and smokeless would come down. Is that an ability to rotate some of those resources back towards
your existing business?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, the mutual decision about dissolving the joint venture with Swedish Match was based on
the fact that, yes, there is some potential for some product in some geographies as we made the progress. But, I guess
by our standards, that progress – under both companies, that progress was slow. So, we just decided that maybe it's
better that both companies will just pursue their own growth opportunities. And this is how we reached a decision of
dissolving. The joint venture with Swedish Match didn't have a material impact on our financials; so I wouldn't count
on any material reallocation of resources from Swedish Match joint venture to PMI.
<Q - William Marshall>: Great. Thank you. And then just also kind of more of a housekeeping item. You laid out
pretty detailed foreign currency impact in each of the individual currencies. In the past, you've talked a little bit about
hedging, particularly on the yen, from a transaction perspective. I was curious, if you could give us an update on any
currencies that you were hedged on, like the yen, and at what levels and for what duration?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, we are above a 60% for this year; but we'd like to remind everyone that our financial
policy is that we constantly look at the 12 months, 18 months ahead. So, it's fair to assume that we already start hedging
our yen cash flows for 2016. When we'll be giving – as was always the practice tradition – the guidance for the 2016 in
February, we will update you on the number what is our current hedge ratio for the 2016. But as I said, we are already
looking into 2016. And, yes, that's it essentially.
<Q - William Marshall>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of James Bushnell with Exane.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Thank you and good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, James.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Good morning. I had a couple of questions. My first one was just a follow-up on the snus
question. Was just interested in whether we should read anything into PMI's philosophy towards snus. Do you see it as
part of the reduced-risk complex and therefore well worth exploring in a number of places? Or is it more do you see it
as a niche for a few select markets? How are you thinking about that product for the moment?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I think from a reduced perspective, snus clearly has a potential. From a consumer acceptance
perspective, based on our experience in a few geographies when the joint venture had launched the products and
commercialized the product, that seems that this is a longer shot that we were thinking, okay? This is how I would look
at this.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Okay. Great. Thank you. My second question was about Poland. I think volumes are down on
the market level about 5%, which might not sound that great, but I think it's the least-bad read you've had there for a
while. I just wondered if there's anything changing there for the better and if you could just generally describe the
dynamics, that would be useful.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, Poland is one of the countries which we should still observe, like in many other European
Union geographies, better or improved situations with regards to illicit trade. As you know, Poland is in between the
East and the West, so it's always more difficult to maybe keep these things under controls there. But I know that the
government is focused on addressing the illicit trade.
It also addresses their budgetary needs. Volumes, you rightly note, is getting better. But compared to many other
markets in the European Union, I still would like to see the Polish total market volumes getting better.
Our share is great. The brands are performing great. So on a business side, we're now seeing great shape in Poland. But
our market still I think has room to improve. But we'll have to see when it's going to happen.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Okay. Thank you. And just one last question on iQOS, how is the retention rate of consumers
who try iQOS progressing in Japan and Italy? And also just as a very small technical point, did I hear you right that
Marlboro cigarettes are priced at CHF8.50 in Switzerland and the HeatSticks are just below that? Or did I get that the
wrong way round? Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes, you're correct; it's slightly priced below Marlboro in Switzerland. In terms of – with regards
to the retention rate, they're broadly the same as we had been in Q1. But frankly speaking, we have spent more of the
Q2 time in the test markets to changing, if you like, some component of our marketing mix, et cetera, in preparations of
the national rollout.
But as I said already in Q1, it's about one-third of those who have purchased, really purchase iQOS device, about
one-third is predominantly using an iQOS. And there is a significant group of the consumer who is somehow in a
transition.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Great. Thank you. Sorry, just one cheeky follow-up. What is the difference in the new iQOS
device versus the old one?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: It's better look, better functionality, better feel and touch. We addressed some of the feedbacks
we received from the consumers with regards to the electronics and operations of the electronics. So, we're being able
to fit it into the new device. It's really a new, better iQOS.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Hi. Good afternoon, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, Erik.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: I thought your comment with respect to the contributions to European volume was
interesting. Is there a way that you could break apart for us the contributions of the reduction in illicit and in e-vapor?
So, in aggregate, are those worth about 1% to European Union volumes? Or is there pricing offsetting some of that
benefit, so the reduction in those is actually a bit greater?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, there is a pricing in Europe, which is ahead of the – or higher than the pricing we used to
have in the first half of the last year. So yes, there is some impact on volumes.
But on the other hand, I think the underlying macros in many European markets or consumer sentiment is somehow
helping us with a better elasticities that we would – which we remember from a 2012, 2013 period.
I mean, there is not the exact math how much is coming from illicit trade, because you will have to go from market to
market. I think a contribution from illicit trade to the German volumes is presumably higher; contribution of illicit trade
in some other places might be the difference. E-vapor products, they didn't contribute that much in Germany because
this was not really any sizable sort of a category. But I think they're more helping France or Spain or other geographies.
One thing which we also have to remember, we observed a very serious slowdown in the dynamics of the fine cut or
other tobacco products, which is also the outcome of a tax and price, and I guess also the better consumer sort of a
sentiment.
And you remember this is a category which used to grow say 2012, 2013 in the tune of 6% to 7% per annum; and these
volumes now are growing, I think, around 1% max. So, you could see the drastic change in the dynamics, which
obviously was pushing or pulling the consumers from the manufactured cigarettes to the fine cut product much stronger
in the past that we see now.
So, I mean, I can't give you the number of how much each of these drivers on a total EU basis contributed. I think we'll
have to go market by market and put some weight, where is more of the weight, where is less of the weight, which
helps the total market performance.
But look, let's enjoy the good total market performance. We know what are the drivers; we've been looking that finally
one day all these things which were the significant headwind for us will unwind, and will start converting into
tailwinds, and hope this is a more sustainable trend for this.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Okay. And then also related to the European vapor market, does the imposition of the
Tobacco Products Directive, does that also then create a bit of a headwind for that particular market? And is it really
something that probably advantages the Marlboro iQOS and HeatSticks system, given that you're already able to bring
the product – it already has a set regulatory environment, whereas the TPD imposition will arguably make things more
difficult for vapor? Is that something that you could expand on, please?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I mean, everything depends obviously how TPD is going to be transposed into the member
states' legislation, and that's the process which started. There are some member states which already are advanced; there
are some member states which still are before the parliamentary et cetera discussion.
The deadline, as we know, is May 2016. So, we'll be in a position to say how individual member states – what sort of a
framework they create for both the novel tobacco product and the e-cigarettes. As you remember, in TPD there is a
distinction between both – group of both categories. Then we'll see how that's going to play out.

<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Okay. And then lastly on the TPD with respect to Philip Morris' litigation against it, can
you give us an update on where things stand and when we may next get the – next set of news flow on that, what the
progress is in terms of challenging TPD2?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, it's not much really of a development which happened, right? I mean, the JT case in Ireland
was retained in Ireland, which I think is a good news because it will otherwise result in a clash of two similar, if you
like, cases at the ECJ level.
I think it's fair to assume that the ECJ, because I think it's the most important part of a challenge against the directive,
that ECJ – which will reach the European Court of Justice, or it will reach the conclusion before the due date for the
transposition implementation of the directive, which I said earlier is May 2016. And that's it, essentially.

Our next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett with Nomura.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Morning, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Morning.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Just a couple of questions, please. Firstly, and just on LatAm, other than the pricing
leverage, I was just wondering what was driving the very strong margins there and how sustainable these are into the
rest of the year?
And then secondly, just on some industry volumes, could you give an update on guidance for South Korea for the year
now? And also possibly if you could comment on how industry volumes are trending in Australia, especially with the
recent price increases? Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Okay. So, on LAC I think we had a strong pricing coming from Argentina, Brazil, Mexico,
Canada; so essentially for all our key geographies there we enjoyed a strong pricing. I think it should continue. So, I
mean, LAC last year and this year, they're really performing very strongly. I think they had a good momentum.
As I mentioned earlier, answering other questions, I mean, there is a bit of a share pressure in Mexico. But on the other
hand, Mexican total industry volumes are doing better; so overall in the financials, we're looking pretty okay.
On South Korea, it looks that our initial guidance for the total market for the year, 20%, 25%, decline is now lower;
total closer to the 20%. It's still significant, but let's remember – I'll let you remember how big the price increase was.
So, I think, overall, it's going better or slightly better than expected. And our share is up. So I think, yes, I mean we
have the tax increase, price increase behind us; let's see how this is going to unfold. But so far it unfolds pretty strong.
And, on Australia, not much really as I mentioned earlier, which would happen there. The prices went up. There
continues some sort of discounting. The down-trading is there maybe to some extent at the lower level. Australian total
market volume is obviously distorted year-on-year due to this tax price changes. And I think on the year-to-date basis,
Australia is 0.7% actually up total market size. But, this doesn't mean that the market grows; I think it's a little bit of a
distortion there.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Okay. Cool. Thanks very much.

Our final question comes from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: Hi. Thank you very much for giving me some airtime. And most of my questions have been
asked, so it's really a question of following up a couple that have already been asked.
In terms of the question on EEMA pricing, you said that – and it was certainly below – the pricing was below my
expectations. And in reply to that, you said, well, there must be some mix factor. But obviously you get pricing per se,
excluding mix. And I was just wondering if for any geographies – and you've had good pricing in Russia we know. So,
are there any geographies where pricing perhaps has gone backwards or has been disappointing within EEMA?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Not really. I mean just one thing to clarify always when we talk about the pricing is the pricing
variance. And when we report the volume/mix, we report the mix with the volume [inaudible] (57:44).
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: Yes. Indeed. Okay.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yeah. But yes, there was some negative mix for EEMA, and I think largely driven by Russia. On
the other hand very encouraging – and I haven't seen these results for the long time; we've had zero mix impact in EU,
okay? So, that's on the total PMI basis, the mix is not that much of a major issue. Obviously, you have the mix in
Australia due to the down-trading, but in a few isolated geographies.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: Okay. So, that's very clear. And just coming onto EU, obviously the volume decline has
returned to its historical – or nearly to its historic average. I was just wondering if you think elasticity is about where it
was before, or whether we have some way to go before we return to where it used to be?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I think many markets have returned to what we would call the standard sort of tobacco
product elasticities: minus 0.3%, minus 0.5%; and I see more and more markets which are squarely fitting into this
range, even maybe some of them in the lower end of this range, so, in a minus 0.3% territory. So that's good.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: And just one final question, following up a question that Bonnie asked. Clearly your market
share is improving and a lot of that is to do with 2.0. But, there's also the new commercial approach, and I was
wondering, really two questions related to that.
Is it possible to say at all which is more important, the new brand architecture or the new commercial approach?
There's obviously a bit of both, but are they equally important? And the second question related to that is, are there any
important geographies where you haven't rolled out the new commercial approach yet?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I will start with the second one, important geographies in which we are in the middle of the
rollout of the commercial approach is Indonesia, from the large OCI market. Coming to how much one could attribute
to the commercial approach and how much to 2.0, I would put like this. Marlboro 2.0 is the concept, right? It's a great
concept; it's a great design; it's a great product lineup; it's a great support materials.
And at the end of the day you need to have a damn skilled organization to properly implement this in a market. So
that's your commercial approach. So, this comes both together. I mean it's a great idea, lousy implementations, no
result. If you have a lousy idea, great sales force, who cares? No impact. So, I think you need to have always the
optimum, the right mix of both. And I guess we're at this stage now.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: Excellent. Okay. And just apart from Indonesia, are there any other markets you'd point to
that perhaps don't currently have big OCI contributions but perhaps you could hope to gain share in, that you haven't
rolled this out? And this will be my final question.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. There are markets which are – no, from a significant market I guess it would be Indonesia,
which pops up to my mind now. I mean in many other markets, we're well advanced. Maybe there are some territories
in some places, but we also don't necessarily aim at covering 100% of any given market territory. It has to have the
economic sense. I mean we're running the details, cost-benefit analysis. And, no, I think Indonesia would still stay on
the list. I would think about Indonesia.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: Thank you very much.
