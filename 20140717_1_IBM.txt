Martin J. Schroeter
Thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter and first half results reflect the stability of our overall business
model as we transform the company. Looking at the dynamics of our portfolio, we're continuing to drive double-digit
growth in the parts of our business that address the emerging trends in enterprise IT. We had stability in our core
franchises where we continue to drive innovation. We're dealing with secular shifts in parts of our hardware business
and as we shift to higher value, we have the impact of a divested business.
Overall, our year-to-year revenue performance improved from last quarter at actual rates, and was fairly consistent at
constant currency. We expanded margins and we grew earnings per share. The profit dynamics also reflect the actions
we've taken to transform our business. I'll get into that shortly.
In the first quarter, you'll remember that we announced a number of initiatives that support the shift to our strategic
areas of data, cloud, and systems of engagement. These included the launch of Bluemix, which is our cloud
platform-as-a service for the enterprise. It included a $1.2 billion investment to globally expand SoftLayer cloud hubs,
and it included a $1 billion investment to bring Watson's cognitive capabilities to the enterprise.
In the second quarter, we made progress to implement these initiatives, including in June, Bluemix became generally
available, we opened new SoftLayer data centers, we started to ship POWER8, and expanded the OpenPOWER
consortium, and we completed substantially all of the divestiture of our customer care business.
More recently, we announced additional actions to continue our shift to higher value. You saw last week that we're
investing $3 billion over the next 5 years in research and in early stage development to create the next generation of
chip technologies. Those will fuel the systems required for cloud, big data and cognitive systems. And just a couple of
days ago IBM and Apple announced a strategic global partnership to provide a new level of business value from
mobility, for enterprise clients.
The underlying theme of all of this from the expansion of our cloud platforms and capacity, to the OpenPOWER
consortium, to the partnership with Apple for enterprise mobility, to next generation chip technologies, is that we're
leveraging our unique strengths in innovation and enterprise capabilities to maintain our differentiation in the emerging
areas of enterprise IT. While some of these actions impact our results in the short term, they better position our business
for the long term.
For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $24.4 billion and operating earnings per share of $4.32. Our revenue was
down 2% or down 1% at constant currency adjusting for the customer care divestiture. We improved gross margin by
10 basis points, the 22nd consecutive quarter of operating gross margin expansion. Our pre-tax and net margins are up
significantly.
Last year's profit base was lower due to a workforce rebalancing charge of about $1 billion. We took a charge of a
similar size in the first quarter of 2014, and so on a six-month basis, the charges are fairly neutral to profit growth. On
the bottom line, we reported operating earnings per share of $4.32 in the second quarter, which is up 34%, and we
generated $3 billion of free cash flow, which is up $300 million over last year.
Let me spend a minute on the first-half performance. The revenue performance for the half is very similar to the second
quarter. Through six months, we had double-digit revenue growth in strategic initiatives, stable performance in our core
franchises and the impact of some secular trends in parts of hardware and from the divested business.
Looking at profit, we expanded gross margin 50 basis points, pre-tax margin by 70 basis points and net margin by 50
basis points, all while shifting investment to key areas. Operating earnings per share for the first half were up 9.5%. We
generated free cash flow of $3.6 billion, which is down $800 million, though up $400 million without the higher level
of cash taxes we paid in the first half.
So now, I'll get into the details of the quarter starting with revenue by geography on a constant currency basis.
Americas' revenue was up 1% year-to-year, a three point sequential improvement from the first quarter rate. From a
regional perspective, the U.S. rate also improved three points and we had another great quarter in our Latin America

region. The improvement in the Americas was driven by the strong System z mainframe performance. EMEA declined
this quarter. Within Western Europe, we had continued growth in Germany and Italy, though the U.K. and France were
down. Eastern Europe also declined.
Our performance in Asia-Pacific was pretty consistent with last quarter. We had another good quarter in Japan, our
seventh consecutive quarter of revenue growth in the country. Asia-Pacific outside of Japan declined at a double-digit
rate.
In total, major markets were down 1% while growth markets were down 4%. Within the growth markets, the BRICs
were up 1% which is a seven-point sequential improvement from the first quarter rate. The improvement was driven by
Brazil, India and China, each up between 9 points and 10 points sequentially. Brazil grew over 20% year-to-year,
driven by large deals in the financial sector, and India returned to growth. Our revenue in China was down 11%,
effectively halving the rate of decline from the last couple of quarters. So this is a change in trajectory in China but we
haven't yet seen improvement in the other Asia-Pacific countries. Put it all together and we had modest sequential
improvement in our growth markets' performance.
Turning to the segment perspective, our Services revenue was up 1% adjusting for the sale of the customer care
business. Global Technology Services performance at constant currency was similar to last quarter with growth in
cloud and a ramp in the large outsourcing contracts we signed last year. Global Business Services once again had very
strong growth in the practices that address the digital front office, however, performance in the globally integrated
enterprise offerings lagged.
In Software, middleware is up 3% while operating systems were down, resulting in modest reported growth for total
software. We're continuing to drive strong results in strategic areas like mobile and security as well as in some of our
core franchises like our app servers and distributed databases. While still down, our hardware year-to-year revenue
performance improved significantly from the first quarter rate, driven by our System z mainframe, System x and
Storage.
Looking at the gross profit, in total, our operating gross margin improved modestly. The increase was driven by margin
improvement in Global Technology Services and an improving mix. This was mitigated by margin declines in Global
Business Services and in Systems & Technology. When you look at gross profit dollars, the year-to-year decline was
driven entirely by our Systems & Technology business. Aside from STG, our gross profit is flat, even after a $70
million impact from the divested customer care business and while we transition to some of the emerging areas where
the profit and margins will benefit from scale.
Our total operating expense and other income was better by 14% year-to-year. Acquisitions over the last 12 months
drove two points of expense growth. And for the last three years, acquisitions have contributed between one points and
three points of expense growth each quarter. Currency drove one point of expense growth. So base expense, which is
total expense less the impact of acquisitions and currency, was down 17 points.
There is one large item that is impacting the year-to-year expense dynamics. As I mentioned earlier on the call, we had
a $1 billion workforce rebalancing charge in the second quarter of last year. This impacted the base performance by 12
points. So without the impact of that item, our base expense would have been better five points year-to-year. This is a
better indication of the productivity in the base.
The other item I'll mention is the gain of over $100 million from the sale of our customer care business associated with
the country closings we completed in the second quarter. This is in other income and expense. Keep in mind, the
divested business removed about $70 million gross profit. Within our base expense, we're also continuing to shift our
spending to drive our strategic imperatives and differentiated offerings. The substantial investments we're making in
cloud, which includes Bluemix and Watson and in chip innovation are examples of this.
Now, let's turn to the segments and we'll start with Services. This quarter, the Services business generated $14 billion in
revenue, which was down 1% at constant currency. This is where we see the impact of the customer care divestiture in
the year-to-year results. So adjusting for that divestiture, total Service revenue was up 1% year-to-year. Services
pre-tax profit was up 26% and margin improved over four points. I'll discuss the profit drivers within the brand details.

Total backlog was $136 billion. We've reduced backlog by nearly $4 billion when we divested the customer care
business in January. Adjusted for the divested business, total backlog was down 1% at spot rates.
Global Technology Services revenue was $9.4 billion, down 1% as reported but up 2% at constant currency adjusted
for the divestiture. SoftLayer contributed about one point to GTS revenue growth in the quarter. We're expanding our
footprint, and in the second quarter, we opened a cloud data center in Hong Kong and followed that with London
earlier this week. We'll continue to roll out additional capacity in the third and fourth quarters.
GTS Outsourcing, one of our core franchises, continued to improve with revenue growth of 2% at constant currency,
adjusted for the divestiture. Revenue growth was driven by the substantial new contracts we brought on in 2013 and we
expanded gross margin.
GTS pre-tax profit was up significantly in the quarter. The profit performance was driven by several key factors. First,
we're continuing to make investments in key growth areas such as mobility, security and cloud. These investments
result in a differentiated set of capabilities that complement our clients' systems of record, and are a good example of
how we continue to evolve our core franchises. Second, profit reflects the gain from the completion of several country
closings in the customer care divestiture, partially offset by the profit lost from the divested business. Finally, we have
the benefit from the past rebalancing actions. The year-to-year growth also reflects the absence of workforce
rebalancing charges compared to last year.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue of $4.5 billion was down 2%. Consulting and Systems Integration grew
1% and flat at constant currency. We had strong double-digit growth in our practices that address the digital front
office, particularly in cloud, analytics and mobile. This was offset by declines in our traditional packaged application
implementations. As our digital front office offerings become a larger part of the portfolio, they will contribute more
meaningfully to top line performance.
Two days ago, we announced a strategic partnership with Apple to deliver a new class of enterprise-ready MobileFirst
business applications for iOS. With this partnership, IBM's consultants and other client-facing specialists will help
expand mobile device productivity, enabling big data and analytics at the point of contact.
Application Outsourcing was down 9%, in line with last quarter's results. Our performance continues to reflect pricing
pressure and client contract renegotiations, as well as a reduction in elective projects. GBS pre-tax profit grew 34%
year-to-year and reflects both year-to-year benefit in workforce rebalancing charges and the impact of lower revenue on
a relatively fixed cost base.
Software revenue of $6.5 billion was up 1% and flat at constant currency. Middleware grew 3%, and within that, the
branded middleware was flat at constant currency on a tough compare from last year. We had good growth in several of
our strategic areas: cloud, big data and analytics, mobile and security. Across our software brands,
software-as-a-service offerings are growing very quickly. This quarter, our SaaS offerings grew by nearly 40%.
Looking at our results by brand, WebSphere had another good quarter, up 5% at constant currency, led by app server,
commerce and mobile solutions. Both on premise and SaaS offerings contributed to WebSphere growth, with the
majority of WebSphere growth coming from on-prem solutions.
Our Application Server business delivered strong growth with an increase in demand for on-premise software that was
driven by mobile and analytics workloads. We continue to have strong growth in MobileFirst, leveraging over 5,000
mobile experts and our expanding capabilities. Supporting our partnership with Apple, our Software Group will
develop unique enterprise cloud services needed for iOS to deliver the full enterprise class mobile experience from
analytics to cloud storage and data security.
Information Management Software was down 2% at constant currency. Once again, relational database grew, though
some product areas in the brand faced tough compares. Tivoli revenue was up 3% at constant currency, driven by
security software. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of growth in security software with most of those quarters up
double digits, so also every quarter since we acquired Q1Labs and built our security division around that acquisition
supplemented by additional analytics capabilities.

Workforce Solutions declined 8% at constant currency as we transition from on-premise Notes to our SaaS offerings.
Across software, we are transitioning our portfolio to capture growth areas and we continue to drive innovation in our
core franchises. We're growing and building capabilities in emerging areas like software-as-a-service, mobile and
security, and also in more traditional areas such as application server and relational database as new growth areas drive
the need for on-premise capabilities. This quarter, we faced a difficult compare. We expect our revenue growth to
accelerate in the second half.
Systems & Technology revenue of $3.3 billion was down 11%. This is a significant improvement in the year-to-year
performance compared to last quarter. The improvement was driven by System z as well as sequential improvements in
System x and Storage. This together with actions to align our structure to the demand profile resulted in progress in
stabilizing our profit.
Looking at our results by brand, System z revenue was down 1% on flat MIPS, which is significant performance in the
seventh quarter following the product announcement. In the quarter, we had large deals in the financial sector in China,
the United States and Brazil. When you compare this cycle to-date versus the prior cycle, we have shipped 25% more
MIPS and the STG revenue and gross profit are each about 98% of the previous cycle net of currency.
The System z platform is one of our core franchises benefiting from IT trends. The value proposition for z becomes
stronger as the scale of data and transactions grow as well as the need for security of that data and those transactions.
Power revenue declined 28%. The year-to-year performance reflects fundamental changes in the business, and as we
have talked about in past calls, we have taken actions to align our structure to the demand profile, while investing to
address where we see opportunity in the future. First, we launched entry-level, or scale-out POWER8 in June, and had
a good start compared to previous cycles. Keep in mind that entry-level is a small portion of the Power business.
POWER8 will be introduced into the mid-range and high-end segments over the remainder of the year.
And second, we expanded our OpenPOWER consortium, doubling the number of alliance members in the second
quarter. At the end of June, we had 36 members across 10 countries including 9 in China, so, globally diverse. The
membership is across the stack, from chip designers, to hardware component OEMs, to system vendors, to middleware
and software providers. With this alliance, members have access to high end technology, as the Power architecture is
available for open development and to integrate new designs into their hardware platforms. For example, alliance
members can design and control their own encryption.
Our System x revenue was down 3%, which is an improvement from last quarter when revenue was down 18%. As you
know, we're in the process of divesting this business to Lenovo and are awaiting regulatory approvals. Storage
Hardware revenue was down 12%, a sequential improvement from the rate in the prior quarter. We saw strong growth
in our Flash Systems as we doubled our revenue over last year, and in our StorWize portfolio, which was up
double-digits. However, this was more than offset by weakness in high-end disk, and the continued wind-down of our
OEM business. We had a number of launches this quarter including the V7000 update to our StorWize portfolio and
Flash-enabled DS8K.
As we have discussed over the last couple of earnings calls, our focus for STG in 2014 is to stabilize the profit base,
and after the first half, we are on track. Within that envelope, we will continue to make investments in this business to
remain the leader in high-performance, high-end systems. Our announcement last week to invest $3 billion over the
next five years to tackle the challenges of the post-silicon era demonstrates our commitment to innovation and to
leading in the new era of enterprise IT.
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter, we generated $3 billion of free cash flow, which was up $300 million
year-to-year. Through the first half, our free cash flow of $3.6 billion was down $800 million year-to-year. This
performance was impacted by the significant increase in cash taxes in 2014, which I talked about earlier this year.
Without the impact of cash tax payments, our free cash flow was up $400 million year-to-year.
Looking at the uses of our cash in the first half, we spent $600 million on acquisitions including Silverpop and Cognea
in the second quarter. We returned $13.9 billion to shareholders. Of that $11.8 billion was in gross share repurchases,

and at the end of June, we had $3.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. In June, we reached a milestone.
We finished the month with fewer than a billion shares outstanding. Let me put this in perspective. We started our share
repurchase program in 1995 when we had more than 2 billion shares outstanding.
So we've reduced our share count by more than 50% and the average price we've paid from the start in 1995 through
June 30 of this year is less than $100 per share. We took our dividend up 16% in April and through June we paid out
$2.1 billion this year. This is the 19th consecutive year that we raised our dividend and 11th year in a row of
double-digit increases. With our cash flow performance in the first half, we are on track to generate $16 billion of free
cash flow for the year.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $9.7 billion. Total debt was $46.5 billion,
which includes over $29 billion to support our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at
seven to one. Our non-financing debt was $17.1 billion and our non-financing debt to capital was 56%. As I mentioned
last quarter given the skew of free cash flow, we expect our debt to cap to be in the 50%s through the third quarter and
roughly flat year-to-year at the end of the year. We continue to have the financial flexibility to support our business
over the long-term as we transition to the new areas of enterprise IT.
So now let me wrap up the discussion of the first-half results and put it in the context of what we discussed at our
investor day in May. We have a set of offerings that address the strategic areas of data, cloud and the way our clients
are engaging. We said that the model was to deliver double-digit revenue growth for these areas with high software
content. Our first-half results were consistent with that part of the model. Our business analytics revenue was up 7% on
a large base and cloud revenue was up over 50%, with our as-a-service business doubling once again. Our security
revenue was up over 20% and we more than doubled our revenue in mobile. Together, the revenue in our strategic
imperatives was up double digits, and about half of the content was in software.
At the same time in May, we discussed our core franchises where we continue to innovate. These include our
longer-term services business, our recurring software business and mainframe business with our large-capacity clients.
The model has a stable revenue base and we are on track here too. Finally, we have transactional businesses that are
shifting to higher value. We're continuing to evolve the portfolio, investing in capabilities in some areas while divesting
businesses that don't support our shift to high-value. In the first half, we completed the sale of our customer care
business and announced the sale of our industry-standard server business to Lenovo. These impact our top line
performance but are clearly the right moves for us for the long term.
We continue to drive the shifts. Let me summarize what we've gotten done in the first half of this year. We took
Bluemix live, we're adding new SoftLayer cloud hubs and we're ramping our investment to commercialize Watson.
We've introduced POWER8 for big data and cloud at the entry-level and are expanding our OpenPOWER consortium.
And we've committed $3 billion to drive chip innovation while launching an important new partnership with Apple to
extend IBM's position in the enterprise mobile space.
When you put all of this together, for the half, revenue was relatively flat at constant currency, adjusting for the
divestiture. Pre-tax margin expanded by 70 basis points and net margin by 50 basis points, and operating earnings per
share were up 9.5%. As we look to the full year of 2014, we expect to deliver at least $18 of operating earnings per
share, and we still expect to deliver at least $20 of operating earnings per share in 2015. These are points along the way
to delivering performance and shareholder value over the long-term.
Now Patricia and I will now take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts
at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information. And second as always, I'd ask you to refrain from
multi-part questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your
question.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Great. Thanks. Can you comment on how you're currently thinking about the potential for
stabilization and perhaps even growth in the Asia Pac ex-Japan region? Obviously, you saw some improvement in
China, but in terms of the overall region, how should we think about the revenue and profit trajectory from here? And
then, I guess related to that on the profit side, can you walk us through some of the permanent changes you're making
to your cost structure in that region specifically?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, Bill. Good afternoon. I guess I'd say a couple of things. As you noted, we did see a
pretty good sequential improvement in China and in India as well in the second quarter. But as we noted in the prepared
remarks, we did not see that sequential improvement in AP. And notably within that, I would say we saw degradation
in both Australia and Korea within that AP geography. Now when we look forward in China, we still see a continued
improvement in the sequential performance out of China.
Now, it's important to note I think, it's important to note in China even though we were still down year-to-year,
sequentially not only did we see a year-over-year improvement but our business in China was about an $800 million
business in the first quarter, and in the second quarter, it was over $1 billion. So we see a very typical sequential skew
in China which is growth in the second. So again, as we see that year-to-year sequential improvement in China that we
expect, this is still a substantial business for us.
Now, we did not see and we do not see yet a material change in the trajectory in the rest of Asia Pacific. As I noted,
Australia and Korea were slow in the second and we don't see that. Outside that area, I'll comment also on some of the
other growth markets. Latin America as an example, as you heard in our prepared remarks, had another strong quarter
again led by Brazil, which was up double-digit. And although they're going to wrap on a strong second-half from last
year, we still see good performance coming out of Latin America.
From an investment perspective, we have made substantial commitments to those growth markets, and we see good
opportunity to deploy the IBM platform and we would – and we continue to invest in those growth markets to get that
IBM platform deployed across the growth markets.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Bill. Let's go to the next question, please.
Operator
The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes. Good afternoon, Martin. I appreciate all the investments and the pace of change that
IBM is undertaking and accomplished so far in the first half. I guess the question that I hear a lot from investors is, is
that change big enough to offset what appears to be deterioration or secular pressures in the core franchise? So very
specifically coming out of last quarter, you did not have a good Software quarter. You were optimistic that Software
would be notably better this quarter. It was worse. It was flat at constant currency. Similarly when I look at Services,
which is really the other big core part of your franchise, Services signings are now down 33% for the first half. The
signings this quarter were the lowest in more than six years in absolute term and you've gone nine straight quarters with
negative revenue growth in services.
So very specifically, can you address what was the shortfall in software this quarter relative to much more positive
expectations you had coming in? And secondly, when you look at services given the preponderance of data I just

offered to you and given the leading indicator of signings being so weak, what secularly is going on there and how does
the business get better from here?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure. Thanks, Toni. There's a lot there so let me try to talk a bit about Software first and
talk a bit about Services next. So first on Software, my view 90 days ago was that Software would get – would
accelerate through the remainder of the year and I still feel like in second half, we will see Software acceleration back
to mid-single-digit growth.
Now in the second quarter, we saw a couple of things. One, the headwind that we have in that total Software segment
from the operating system content was three points and that's kind of the high point, if you will, of the headwind in –
that we expect from that operating system content. So that headwind diminishes a bit. And then secondly, we continue
to see very good Software performance coming from our kind of typical enterprise license agreements as we go through
the second half again to drive that mid-single-digit revenue.
On Services, Services we said 90 days ago that we would see revenue performance kind of consistent with what we
saw in the first quarter and we still feel that way. Services was, when you adjust for the divestiture, Services was up a
point and we continue to see that. Now as you noted, we had a weak signings quarter in the second. Now that was on
the back of first quarter last year of – signings growth first and second quarter of last year of north of 30%. So we had a
difficult compare. We knew that in the first half, but we do see getting that signings content growing again in the third.
And so when we look at the revenue streams for Services, again we expect them to be consistent with what we have
seen to date. I think we feel as though the yield we're getting out of the in-period revenue is a bit better than what you
would normally do if you just ran it mathematically, we're getting a better yield. Two, we have outside of the backlog,
you see we have content – the transactional content like our cloud business, which continues to grow. And then third,
we will, as I mentioned, get additional third quarter signings growth that will deliver the rest of that pretty modest 1%
growth on an adjusted basis without the divestiture going forward.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Toni. Let's go to the next question, please.

The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Thanks. As a follow up to the last question on the weaker software and signings numbers,
did you in fact see deal push-outs in the quarter? And if so, what do you think caused that? And have you been able to
close the business in the third quarter?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: There were deals, Katy – good afternoon, by the way – there were deals that come in. I
don't know. I would not characterize it as a deal push-out. There are a few phenomenon though that I think are worth
noting. In our key branded-middleware business, it's a mix of both transactional content as well as subscription and
support, which comes in over time. So it's a mix of transactional content and subscription support, but very heavily
transaction content. In our total middleware business, so in the other middleware that comprises that total middleware
business, we have a mix as well, some transactional content and some subscription content but the mix is kind of
flipped in that case. So there's a lot more subscription content.
What we see in any given quarter, you can see this kind of mix shift. We saw much higher transactional content in that
total middleware line and then the key branded middleware quarter-to-quarter behaved very similarly as what we saw
in the first quarter. So last year in key branded middleware, first to second quarter we grew that content just under $800
million quarter-to-quarter. And that delivered 10% growth by the way. This year, we grew that same key branded
middleware a bit over $800 million, so a bit more than last year, but because of the strong compare, that drove a flat
year-to-year performance. So we have a phenomenon of different mixes between transactional and subscription support
and we have quite frankly a tough compare in key branded middleware.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thank you, Katy. Can we go to the next question, please?

The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus. You may ask your question.
<Q - David M. Grossman>: Thanks. Martin, I think you had mentioned that free cash flow is down $800 million
year-over-year for the first six months and I think the math suggests that about $1.2 billion of that $2 billion cash tax
headwind is reflected in that figure. So assuming that $18 in earnings is a good number, how much visibility do you
have on the change in working capital at this point in the year and your ability to hit that $16 billion free cash flow
target for the year?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure. Thanks, David. Good afternoon. I'd say there are a couple of phenomenon that are
going to drive that free cash flow. First, as you pointed out, when we make earnings – I guess I'd say it this way, when
we make earnings, we'll make the free cash flow number. And I think that phenomenon that drives that, obviously
there's profitability skew in the second half here that drives, on an absolute basis, that drives that. And secondly, within
the sales cycle working capital component, the other phenomenon is our enterprise license agreement cycle we're in.
That software content drives a substantial amount of free cash flow as well. So between again the profit and the mix
toward the second half as well as the phenomenon of the cash structure, if you will, of our ELA cycle, I think we have a
very strong statement to say when we make profit, we'll make cash flow.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks David. Can we go to the next question, please?

The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Ben, we can't hear you. Are you on mute?
Operator
Please check your mute button.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Can you hear me now?
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Yes, we can.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Great. I'm sorry about that. Thank you. How about I wanted to ask about hardware and, sorry, a
two parter but Mainframe down only 1% was a very big improvement from last quarter. So what happened there? And
is that sustainable? And then, there are some reports out there and I know you're aware of them about what you might
do with your chip making capabilities and you announced a very large investment commitment to your chip making
R&D during the quarter or during this month, so can you just reconcile that? I think you understand what we're hearing
out there and what is the commitment to the chip making business as well? Thanks so much.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, Ben. A couple things. First on Mainframe, we did have a very strong Mainframe
quarter, as you noted, just down 1%. And in the seventh quarter of a cycle, down 1% is quite good. Now in the first
half, we were kind of down in the mid-teens, right. In the first quarter, we were down pretty healthy double-digit, down
one in this quarter gets us to a down mid-teens, and that's very typical. That performance, that mid-teens is very typical
of where we would expect the next couple of quarters to be, again, given the cycle.
Now, I think the reason that the mainframe continues to do so well and we had in the prepared remarks that in this
cycle, the revenue and the GP is roughly 98% of where it was in the prior cycle. This continues to be not only a core
franchise for us, but it is a critical infrastructure that drives still 70% of the world's enterprise data. And as our clients
are moving toward new systems of engagement and mobility and they what the most secure platform, the Mainframe
remains the premier platform on which to drive a world-class enterprise structure. So I don't expect that we're going to
see a minus one going forward, but I think that first-half performance is consistent with what we would expect.

And then on the semiconductors, as you said, we did announce a $3 billion investment in semiconductor research and
development. And as we've said a number of times, it was in our chairman's letters to shareholders, we've been very,
very vocal about our goal to remain the leader, the absolute leader, in high-performance and high-end systems. We're
the leader today and we would expect with this kind of investment, we can continue to maintain that leadership. Now
this R&D investment is clearly focused on the distant future where we have to figure out how to scale semiconductors
to 7 nanometers, that's a big challenge, and then obviously we're also thinking about, as we indicated, what the
post-silicon world looks like. So we remain committed to being the leader of high-performance and high-end systems
and we have not changed our view on that at all. We've been very vocal about it and will stay on that path.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Ben. Let's go to the next question, please.

The next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. You may ask your question.
<Q - Louis R. Miscioscia>: Okay. Maybe if I could link something about China and also your x86 business. I guess
the question is, I continuously hear that the Chinese government is pushing away from big U.S. tech companies, but
obviously the x86 business bounced back and it sounded like China bounced back. Is the sale of that helping the
situation there? I guess I'll leave it at that.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Thanks, Lou. I guess, again, we saw a sequential improvement, as I noted earlier, in China
quarter-to-quarter. And as I also noted, we would expect that sequential improvement to continue. Now interestingly, I
would not characterize that sequential improvement as driven solely by x86 or any other of the single brands. In fact, it
was across all of our segments, Global Technology Service, GBS, Software Group, STG, all showed sequential
improvement in China and, in fact, when we look at our strategic imperatives content that sits in China, that was up a
very solid double digit as well, which is consistent with the overall performance in our strategic imperatives, so really
no difference from what we're seeing in our success in China from what we're seeing anywhere else in the world.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thank you, Lou. Can we go to the next question, please?

The next question comes from Steven Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thanks. A couple of odds and ends, Martin. First of all on the share repurchase, you did
I think $11.8 billion through the first half. Does that mean you have roughly $3 billion to do in the second half? And
then second on emerging markets, I think in the annual report, that you guys suggested you would see emerging market
revenue growth in the second half. Is that correct and does that still stand?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Good afternoon, Steve. On share repurchase, we have about $3 billion left in our
authorization, and as we said in the past, we would expect to spend about what we did last year, maybe a little bit less. I
don't think – I haven't changed my view on that capital allocation, but we do have about $3 billion left in our
authorization. On growth markets, as I mentioned earlier, I would say that we would see a continued sequential
improvement in growth markets, and as I noted earlier, LA is going to ramp on a strong second-half but continues to do
quite well. AP, we do not see that sequential improvement yet.
And I guess the other thing I'd point out that's worth noting particularly in the growth markets, we are in the process, as
you know, of divesting our industry standard server business and that's going to have an impact on our revenue growth,
and that's a profound impact in the emerging markets as well. So when we sell that content, that's going to be a pretty
big headwind to growth for the emerging markets notwithstanding the sequential improvements that we see in the
business.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Steve. Let's go to the next question, please.

The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Great. Thanks, Patricia. Thanks, Martin. Just wanted to ask about the GBS portion of
services. I saw revenue accelerated and margins contracted a bit. Curious how much of this is cyclical versus secular? I
heard pricing pressure and [ph] package limitation (41:14) weakness, did you adjust your workforce last quarter to
address these themes? Just trying to sketch out what the second half might look like given this trend.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Yeah, sure. Thanks very much. So a couple of things on GBS. So there are secular shifts
going on in this space and we've been talking about our – how we're shifting toward, we refer to it as the digital front
office or to talk about it as our cloud and our analytics and our mobile. That was – when we see that flow in our clients
and we're obviously shifting both our resources, our skills, our training to that. We see very solid double-digit growth.
We saw that in the second quarter.
And in fact, we look at our pipeline going forward and over half of it is that kind of content. So there is absolutely a
secular shift going on in that GBS space and we are in the middle of it and we are very competitive in that space. On
the ERP implementations and some of some of the custom development work, I guess that what we are seeing is kind
of fewer of those large rollouts and that combined with the large rollouts that do occur, we're seeing them being broken
up into small pieces so they're not as large as they used to be.
So I don't know if I would consider that secular or cyclical. Within that, our clients – where those back-office
workloads are stable, our clients are still looking for additional productivity. And so obviously, we are in a bit of a
battle to win there but they're looking for productivity and so we're still competitive. But other than the absolute secular
shift toward cloud and analytics and mobile, which we're playing in and which we have very solid double-digit growth
in, we'll have to wait to see if the rest is secular or cyclical.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Can we go to the next question, please?

The next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.
<Q - Sherri A. Scribner>: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to dig a little bit into what you're hearing in terms of global
demand and thinking about the second half of the year. Are you hearing that businesses are starting to get a little more
confident? I think you made some comments about the developed markets being a little bit better. And then thinking
about that in terms of how it translates into the second half of the year, do you think you could start to see some flat or
potentially some growth in revenue? Thanks.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure. So if we look at our major – we'll start with our major markets performance since
I've talked a bit about the growth markets already. In major markets, we were flat year-to-year when we exclude our
customer care business, which was an improvement sequentially in North America. And we also did quite well in North
America in our Mainframe business and we saw sequential improvements in some of our other platforms as well
including Power and Storage and x.
So there is a sequential improvement story, if you will, in our North America business that we certainly benefited from
in the second. In Europe, we saw a decline at constant currency, but we did see within that growth in our Services
business. And so I would say that Europe is – I would expect Europe to see sequential improvement going forward, but
it is a challenged environment from our experience.
And then in Japan, we had a very solid performance again in Japan. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of growth
in Japan as we noted in the remarks. Our Japan team does quite well and I think it's more than just macro. I think our
Japan team is doing quite well. And then as I mentioned in the growth markets, we do expect to see sequential

improvement going forward. And then again, all of this is in context from our own headwinds here in IBM. We do have
– we have closed on our customer care divestiture, which is a headwind for the rest of us for the year for a bit over a
point. And then as I noted earlier in my growth markets commentary, if we're able to close our industry-standard
server, our xSeries divestiture, that'll also have a pretty substantial headwind for us as well.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thank you, Sherri. Can we please take one last question?

The last question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.
<Q - Brian J. White>: Great. Martin, when we think about the Systems & Technology business, the profitability has
swung from looks like $1.6 billion in 2011 to negative $300 million in 2013. Could you just delve into what was the
biggest driver of that decline? And I also just want some clarity, do you think this business will be profitable in 2014?
Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: We're still focused, as we talked about in the beginning of the year, we're still focused on
stabilizing the STG profit base for the year, right, the Systems & Technology Group profit base for the year. And I
believe we are absolutely, absolutely on track to do that, to stabilize that profit base. The impacts against that profit
base, when we look at last year and what we're trying to stabilize, there are, one, some cyclical issues. We have
certainly seen this downturn in the emerging markets, which has an impact on hardware. And we've talked about that
on prior calls, the mix of our STG business in the growth markets is higher than other places and therefore that
emerging market slowdown had a more pronounced effect on STG. And so there is some cyclical issues there, and then
we've talked about the mainframe cycle already a number of times.
But in addition to that, we've had this secular issue around Power and trying to reposition that. And we've taken action
pretty aggressively to make that platform the most viable for the future, including we just released POWER8, as an
example, which is a Power platform built for the world of big data and analytics, and quite frankly built for the world of
cloud. And then, we've also had a lot of success with our OpenPOWER initiative, which we've been able to expand
again the alliance of those who will use and build on top of that.
So a mix of cyclical and secular within that STG performance. But as we said at the beginning of the year, and we are
confident with the actions we've taken both to address the secular and also we've taken a fair bit of cost out of that
business to better suit the demand profile. We still see that business stabilizing and profit on a full-year basis.
<Q - Brian J. White>: Thank you.
Martin J. Schroeter
Okay. So I'm going to wrap up the call. And I guess, first, I'll start with what we saw in the first half. We had very
strong performance in the strategic imperatives, a lot of software content within that. And as we talked about at investor
day, that's very important for our business model. The core franchises were relatively stable and that's also, as we said
at investor day, important for our business model and we made some progress in addressing some of those secular
issues in Power. I talked a little bit about that in the answer to a question.
In the second half, we see, as I noted on an earlier question, we see our Software revenue growth accelerating to
mid-single digit and we see our Services profit growth of mid-single digit driven by productivity in the base. And then
on STG, as I just noted, we see that profit stabilization still.
So when I think about the second half and how that plays out, as we did 90 days ago, I said that I think EPS in the
second half will be a bit faster in the fourth than in the third. So kind of a double-digit fourth quarter EPS and a
single-digit third quarter EPS. And bear in mind that that single-digit EPS growth even in the third because of
seasonality kind of translates to no more absolute EPS than what we get in the second. So we still see that same mix

hits and helps our margin in Services and we get that transactional benefit from STG.
