Cynthia L. Walker
Thank you Chris, and good morning everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us on our call today. During my
comments, I'll reference several slides in the conference call materials that as Chris mentioned are available on our
website.
Overall in the second quarter, we continued the trend of solid execution seen in the first quarter. We produced 772,000
barrels per day, essentially in line with our expectation adjusting for certain events during the quarter. Our operating
costs and capital efficiency programs remain on track. We had core earnings of $1.3 billion or $1.58 per diluted share.
For the six months of 2013, we generated $6.4 billion of cash flow from operations before changes in working capital,
and we ended the quarter with $3.1 billion of cash on our balance sheet.
If you turn to slide three, you'll see a summary of our earnings for the quarter. As I just mentioned, core income was
slightly under $1.3 billion or $1.58 per diluted share. Compared to the first quarter of 2013, the current quarter reflected
improved Oil and Gas results driven by higher oil volumes offset by lower earnings in the marketing and trading
businesses, largely due to commodity price movements during the quarter and higher equity compensation expense
resulting from an improved stock price.
I'll now discuss the segment performance for the Oil and Gas business and begin with earnings on slide four. Oil and
Gas earnings for the second quarter of 2013 were $2.1 billion, and as you can see, this was an increase over both the
first quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2012. On a sequential quarter over quarter basis, improvements came
from higher oil volumes, in particular in the Middle East and North Africa business, following the resumption of
production after facility turnarounds in Qatar and Dolphin. We also experienced better realized domestic oil and gas
prices, although they were offset by lower realized international oil prices. Improvement in domestic realized prices is
mainly attributable to the easing of oversupply in the Permian. This significantly improved differentials for our
Permian oil production. There was also a modest increase in exploration expense.
Moving to slide five, you'll see a breakdown of production changes during the quarter. As I mentioned, production was
772,000 barrels per day. This was an increase of 9,000 barrels over the first quarter and 6,000 barrels over the year-ago
quarter. On a sequential quarterly basis, these results reflect the resumption of production in Qatar and Dolphin and
growth in our California business as a result of our drilling program.
Elsewhere domestically, we saw the impact of natural decline due to our reduced natural gas drilling activity. Also
reflected are the impacts of weather and planned gas plant turnarounds in our Permian business as well as insurgent
activity in Colombia. These events combined to reduce production by about 7,000 barrels per day during the quarter.
Also on a year over year basis, full cost recovery and other adjustments under our production sharing and similar
contracts reduced production by about 8,000 barrels per day. The impact on a sequential quarterly basis was not
significant.
Overall, while there were a number of events that impacted production this quarter, we see the underlying business as
performing essentially as we expected. If you turn to slide six, we'll discuss our domestic production in a bit more
detail. Our domestic production was 470,000 barrels per day, a decrease of 8,000 barrels per day from the first quarter
of 2013 driven by the factors illustrated on the previous slide. And this was an increase of 8,000 barrels per day from
the second quarter of 2012.

Focusing on our commodity composition, our oil production was essentially flat versus the first quarter, adjusting for
the effects of the severe weather in the Permian. Our natural gas and NGL volumes were 5,000 barrels per day lower
than the first quarter, excluding the impact of planned gas plant turnarounds. This reduction primarily reflects natural
decline in the Mid-Continent due to lower drilling activity and third party processing bottlenecks in the Permian.
In total, sales volumes were 764,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2013 compared to 746,000 barrels per day
in the first quarter. Middle East/North Africa sales volumes were 31,000 barrels per day higher, mostly due to the
timing of liftings as well as the effects of the first quarter maintenance turnarounds. Our overall sales volumes were
lower than production volumes during the quarter due to the timing of liftings. The pickup in insurgent activity in
Colombia caused a delay in two large liftings scheduled around the end of June. In total, delayed liftings reduced the
second quarter pre-tax earnings by approximately $75 million, or about $0.06 per diluted share on an after-tax basis.
We expect the third quarter liftings in Colombia to be at their normalized level barring any pickup in insurgent activity
in the third quarter.
Our realized prices for the quarter and the comparison to benchmark prices are summarized on slide 7. Compared to the
first quarter, our worldwide crude oil realized price was almost flat. As you can see, the reduction in Brent was offset
by improved realizations for our Permian production. We continue to experience weakness in NGL pricing
domestically which contributed to a 4% decrease in worldwide NGL realized prices, while domestic natural gas
realized prices experienced a 24% increase driven by improvement in the benchmark. You'll also note we that updated
our price sensitivities.
Next I will cover production costs on slide 8. Oil and Gas production costs were $13.40 per barrel in the second
quarter. For the first six months of 2013, production costs were $13.66 per barrel compared to $14.99 per barrel for the
full year of 2012. The largest improvement was seen in our domestic operations, where production costs were $3.26 per
barrel lower in the first six months of 2013 from the full year of 2012. This represents annualized cost savings of over
$500 million, exceeding our previously stated goals.
International production costs have remained fairly consistent with 2012 levels, excluding the impact of facility
turnarounds in Qatar and Dolphin which affected the first quarter.
Taxes other than on income, which generally relate to product prices, were $2.66 per barrel for the first six months of
2013 compared with $2.39 per barrel for the full year of 2012. Second quarter exploration expense was $78 million.
We expect third quarter exploration expense to be about $90 million for seismic and drilling in our exploration
programs.
Now turning to the Chemical segment core earnings on slide nine. Second quarter earnings were $15 million lower than
the first quarter. This is primarily the result of lower caustic soda export volumes due to weak economic conditions in
Europe, slowing demand in Asia and reduced demand for alumina in South America. We expect third quarter 2013
earnings to improve to approximately $170 million, benefiting from the higher seasonal demand and continued strong
PVC sales into construction markets.
On slide 10 is a summary of the Midstream segment earnings. They were $48 million for the second quarter of 2013
compared to $215 million in the first quarter of 2013 and $77 million in the second quarter of 2012. The sequential
quarterly and year over year decrease in earnings resulted mainly from lower marketing and trading performance,
driven by commodity price movements during the quarter.
Our worldwide effective tax rate on core income was 41% for the second quarter of 2013, and we would expect that our
combined worldwide tax rate in the third quarter will remain about the 41% level.
And finally on slide 11, I'll discuss our year to date cash flow performance. For the first six months, we generated $6.4
billion of cash flow from operations before changes in working capital. This amount includes an approximate $380
million cash inflow from the collection of a tax receivable. Working capital changes decreased our cash flow from
operations by about $200 million to $6.4 billion.

Net capital expenditures for the first six months of 2013 were $4.2 billion, of which $2.2 billion was spent in the
second quarter. We generated approximately $270 million with the sale of our investment in Carbocloro in the quarter,
and we used $225 million for acquisitions of domestic oil and gas assets, of which about $125 million was during the
quarter.
After paying dividends and other net outflows, our cash balance was about $3.1 billion as of June 30. The debt balance
remains unchanged and our debt to capitalization ratio was 15% at the end of the quarter. Our annualized return on
equity for the first six months of 2013 was 13% and our return on capital employed was 11%.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen to discuss other aspects of our operations and provide some additional
guidance for the third quarter.
Stephen I. Chazen
Thank you, Cynthia. Occidental's domestic Oil and Gas segment continued to execute in our liquids production growth
strategy. Our first half domestic oil production of 262,000 barrels a day was an increase of about 7% from the first half
of 2012 production of 246,000 barrels a day. Second quarter domestic production of 470,000 barrel equivalents per day
consisted of 338,000 barrels of liquids and 792 million cubic feet of gas, a decrease of about 8,000 barrel equivalents
per day compared to the first quarter.
Liquids production decreased slightly due to planned gas maintenance turnarounds in the Permian which impacted
natural gas liquids production. Plant turnarounds also impacted our gas production which coupled with lower drilling
on gas properties, natural decline comprised the bulk of the total domestic production decline. A number of severe
storms affecting the Permian region also lowered our domestic production. Second quarter domestic production was
generally in line with our expectations except for the impact of storms.
We're executing a focused drilling program in our core areas and to date we're running ahead of our full year objectives
to improve domestic operational and capital efficiencies. For example, we have reduced our domestic well costs by
21% and our operating costs by about 19% relative to 2012. This is ahead of our previously stated targets of 15% well
cost improvement and total oil and gas operating costs below $14 a barrel for 2013.
We believe we can sustain the benefits realized to date, achieve additional savings in our drilling costs, and reach our
2011 operating cost levels over time without a loss in production or sacrificing safety. The purpose of these initiatives
is to improve our return on capital.
I will now turn the discussion over to Vicki Hollub, our Executive Vice President in charge of our California
Operations. Prior to her current role, she ran our Permian enhanced oil recovery or CO2 business. She will provide
details of our strategies for the next couple of years, considering the current California operating environment. She will
also discuss the results of our capital and operational efficiency improvement programs. Vicki?
Vicki Hollub
Thank you, Steve. We are a California company and we are committed to being a responsible partner in the numerous
communities in which we operate, spanning from north of Sacramento to south of Long Beach. We're the state's largest
producer of natural gas and the largest oil and gas producer on a gross operated barrels of oil equivalent basis. We
provide locally sourced energy to help Californians cool their homes and drive their cars. Since 2010, we have created
3,000 new jobs, invested over $8.5 billion in the state and paid $900 million in state and local taxes.
We're also the largest oil and gas mineral acreage holder in California, with more than 2.1 million net acres in some of
the most prolific hydrocarbon producing areas of the state. Our vast acreage position has diverse geologic
characteristics and numerous reservoir targets, providing us with development opportunities that range from
conventional to steam and water floods, and unconventional. We plan to continue investing and providing energy for
the state for decades to come.

This morning, I would like to give you a look at the progress we've made in California this year. When we started the
year, our overall objective was to position our portfolio for a long term profitable growth while achieving immediate
wins to have a successful year. Our specific goals were deliver a predictable outcome for this year given the constraints
of working in California; advanced projects with solid returns, low execution risk and long term growth; reduce our
drilling and completion costs to improve our finding and development cost and our project economics; reduce our
operating costs without affecting production to improve our current earnings and free cash flow; build a growing and
highly predictable lower declined base of production; test out various exploration development concepts both from a
cost improvement and execution predictability perspective.
In 2012, we restructured our business units to create teams organized around the unique characteristics of each of our
asset groups, resulting in a fifth business unit dedicated to managing our heavy oil properties. This heavy oil team has
added the expertise necessary to accelerate the development of our existing steam floods and to evaluate new
opportunities. In addition, we created three technical teams to better manage the complex geology of the reservoirs in
California.
One team is dedicated to the design of new water floods or the optimization of existing floods. Another will look
exclusively at the aggressive application of EOR technologies including steam floods where they're technically and
economically feasible. The third team will focus on unconventional development opportunities to optimize recoveries
from the Monterey and other key shale plays in California. We believe this structure gives us the ability to grow our
California operations more efficiently, maximize the benefits from the improvement and operating and capital costs
that we've already achieved and drive additional improvements in our cost structure.
As you know, we're engaged in a company-wide effort to reduce our operating costs and improve capital efficiency in
order to improve our returns. In California, we have significantly reduced operating as well as drilling costs, exceeding
our targets, and we expect to save at least $175 million this year in operating costs through these efforts.
On the last call, we provided a thorough breakdown of the efforts being made in all domestic assets and we have
achieved similar success in California. We've reduced our overall operating expenses by $3.50 per BOE, from $23.20
in 2012 to an expected average of $19.70 for all of 2013. Almost half of these reductions have been in well servicing as
a result of high grading our well service rigs and eliminating less efficient ones, better planning scheduling of jobs,
reducing lower value adding jobs, and adding Oxy supervision through reduction of contract well site operators.
Improvements in innovations in surface operations account for another 35% of the reduction. Activities contributing to
these reductions include optimization of the use of chemicals, improved water handling, fuel and power cost reductions
and lower rental equipment use.
In capital efficiency, we've also improved by about 15% year to date compared to the full year 2012. This success was
achieved by focusing on four key elements of our capital program. First we have locked in our drilling programs for a
minimum of two months and in some areas up to nine months. This reduced our non-productive times associated with
rig moves and third party services and helped to reduce our equipment rental costs. Second, we have revised well
designs to more appropriately fit the well bore characteristics and production expectations for each well. Third, we
have optimized drilling equipment and fluids to reduce the time required to drill wells. Finally, we have improved our
contracting strategies to incentivize our service providers to optimize overall performance through integrated service
applications while reducing unit costs.
In many instances such as in the Rose Field, we have been able to generate significant savings through the application
of one or more of these concepts I just mentioned, and then apply those same concepts to other wells across the state
which has allowed us to duplicate the savings.
Many innovative ideas are being generated and implemented by our California teams across the state. As we have
stated several times before, many of these ideas are being generated by our people at the grassroots level, which tend to
generate individually modest cost improvements that accumulate to significant amounts across all of our projects as
successes are replicated. Our people have embraced this effort and are committed to improve operations of our assets at
every level by reducing costs and continuing to improve safety everywhere we operate. While the results we have seen

so far are very positive and impressive, we believe that we can achieve even more improvements in both operating and
capital costs going forward.
After reviewing our California assets as a whole and taking into consideration market conditions, we adjusted our
capital strategy at the start of the year to allocate a higher percentage of our annual budget to lower decline projects
such as our water floods and steam floods. For this year, we plan to spend almost 65% of our capital program on water
and steam floods or approximately $625 million on water floods, $370 million on steam floods out of the total $1.5
billion capital. We will spend about 25% of the capital on unconventional projects and the remaining 10% on primary
drilling projects. Further, given the market conditions, we have increased the portion of our capital on oil and gas
liquids development, which represent about 99% of our California capital for this year.
California has unique opportunities with diverse and complex geology. This geologic complexity leads to a broad
spectrum of hydrocarbon fields and reservoir types. The depth, quality and drive mechanisms of the reservoirs vary
across many of the producing basins then within individual basins as well. Those very characteristics along with
product prices, cost and returns, determine the mix of the type of projects to be included in our program each year.
The significant strides we have made in reducing our capital and operating costs that I described have given us the
flexibility to include a large number of potential projects in our development pipeline. For example, depending on the
type of project and location, our drilling costs in California, including completion and hookup costs, range from
$250,000 to $7 million, with expected ultimate recoveries of 30,000 BOE to 550,000 BOE per well, giving us a wide
range of opportunities and variability.
Given our diverse portfolio of opportunities in California, we have sufficient inventory to sustain the strategy in the
future for at least another five years and probably even for 10 years or more, while adjusting the liquids versus gas mix
as conditions warrant. We believe this approach will provide the best opportunity for growth of the California
operations and make it a significant growth engine for Oxy.
Now I would like to share some highlights about each of those project types, beginning with water floods. Water floods
are among our core competencies. We have several new water flood projects in progress this year at various stages
from screening to implementation, in addition to a number of floods where we are engaged in redevelopment,
expansion or optimization activities.
We will spend most of our water flood capital to further optimize our most developed project, the giant Wilmington
field where our Long Beach business unit is continuing to have success in reserves recovery. Wilmington is a
long-standing water flood where the keys to redevelopment success are effective reservoir characterization,
performance surveillance, reservoir modeling and advances in directional drilling technology. This year we will drill
135 new wells, including 35 horizontal wells targeting attic oil and fault isolated zones within this multi-play reservoir.
In Wilmington, we have used a combination of vertical and horizontal wells depending on the location. Vertical or slant
wells can be cost-effective in certain locations, and in others, horizontal wells are drilled to target specific sand
intervals within the larger water flood zones which have not been effectively swept by the injected water. These wells
have an average initial production or IP rates of over three times higher than similar vertical wells at a cost of just 20%
more than comparable wells.
We believe there's still significant potential to be realized in the Wilmington Field. For example, since we acquired this
asset in 2000, proven reserves have steadily grown. In fact, year-end 2012 proved reserves remain slightly higher than
2000 levels, despite 12 years of production, resulting in more than a twofold proved reserve increase during this period.
We currently have an inventory of over 1,000 future well locations in the Wilmington field. We believe that a
successful development program focused on these wells over the next seven years will delivery reserves of up to 100
million BOE.
Just south of Wilmington, we're starting the redevelopment of the Huntington Beach Field with two new fit-for-purpose
rigs, an onshore rig which has an enclosure specifically designed for drilling in urban areas and an offshore rig. We
expect both of those rigs to arrive and start drilling toward the end of the year. So far we have identified 128 well
locations to drill, which will take four to five years using the two rigs we currently have committed. We expect to add

more well locations as we learn more through our reservoir modeling and surveillance as we have done in the analogue
Wilmington field. We believe that we can increase our production from this field by 10,000 BOE per day and develop
reserves of at least 50 million BOE.
Another significant project for us is the water flood expansion at Buena Vista Field where we expect to drill more than
150 wells over the next five years. We believe we can increase the Buena Vista production by 4,000 BOE per day and
deliver reserves of 28 million BOE.
In addition, our Vintage unit, which is the team that manages our San Joaquin Valley and Ventura County water floods,
gas properties in the Sacramento Valley and unconventional projects outside of Elk Hills, they have several water
floods in the pilot phase this year, several under evaluation for redevelopment and a long list of potential projects going
through the water flood screening process.
In total, we will spend around 40% of our 2013 California capital on water flood projects that are expected to generate
returns exceeding 20% on average.
In addition to water floods, our steam flood activities have also been a sizable focus for us this year. Our steam floods
in California are highly profitable, taking advantage of the gas versus oil price spread, allowing us to use cheap gas to
generate steam, which is then used to inject into the reservoir to produce oil. We believe these projects can deliver
attractive returns with a combination of gas prices as high as $6 per Mcf and oil prices as low as $80 per barrel. Typical
rates of return for these projects are expected to be 25% or better.
The two largest steam flood projects for 2013 are in the Kern Front and Lost Hills fields, being managed by our newly
formed heavy oil team. These two fields contain over 1 billion barrels of oil, original oil in place on a combined basis
with an estimated 870 million barrels remaining in place. We're in the process of expanding our steam generation
capacity in both fields and these projects are progressing as expected. We have drilled 100 wells in these two areas year
to date, and with the recent addition of two rigs, we expect to drill an additional 200 wells the second half of this year.
As a result of our activity in these projects, production from our heavy oil business unit is expected to increase by
around 3,000 BOE per day by the end of this year over our 2013 entry rate. Full development of these steam floods is a
multi-year endeavor, and we believe that over time we can increase our heavy oil production by 15 BOE per day,
developing reserves of 120 million BOE.
We're also preparing to pilot two smaller steam floods in Oxnard and the Midway-Sunset area by the beginning of next
year. With the success of these projects, we expect to be able to develop an additional 45 million BOE of reserves. Our
total steam flood spending will constitute about 25% of our total California capital in 2013. Over the next five years,
we expect to drill 1,500 steam flood wells.
As we shift capital to greater water and steam flood opportunities, we expect a lag of about six to nine months before
we see sustained production growth as the flow of new projects reaches a steady level. We're in this transition period
but are now beginning to see the initial phases of growth from these projects.
In addition to shale plays, our unconventional opportunities include those reservoirs that have low permeability and
require special recovery process flow. Currently about one-third of our California production is from unconventional
reservoirs. This year we plan to drill more than 70 unconventional wells. We have more than 1 million prospective
acres for unconventional resources which we believe contain up to 7 billion BOE of recoverable reserves. We've drilled
approximately 1,300 unconventional wells in California since 1998. More than 1,000 of these have been in and around
Elk Hills, including the Monterey and other key shale plays.
Our current plan includes 53 unconventional wells from multiple shale plays around Elk Hills with varying costs and
expected performance depending on the well's location and its particular structure. All of these 53 wells are part of a
continuing development programs that are delivering a better than 20% rate of return. Our ongoing program around Elk
Hills is expected to increase our ultimate recovery by about 150 million BOE.
An example of unconventional opportunities we are pursuing outside of Elk Hills includes drilling and development at
the Rose Field. We purchased this field in late 2009 and drilled one appraisal well in 2011, eight development wells in

2012, and six horizontal wells this year with plans to continue drilling. Results have been very good with average IP
rates exceeding our expectations and estimated ultimate recoveries of approximately 155,000 BOE per well on average.
We believe our returns from this field will be around 25% over the course of the development program.
We also plan to drill an additional unconventional wells in South Belridge and the Buena Vista areas this year. Success
in these areas could ultimately provide more than 100 well locations and up to 35 million BOEs of net reserves.
A discussion of the future potential of California would not be complete without a separate discussion of Elk Hills,
which we acquired in 1998. At that time, Elk Hills had gross proved reserves of 545 million BOE or 24.5 million BOE
net to Oxy. Our cumulative production since our acquisition in 1998 combined with our current proved reserves is
almost double the proved reserves for Elk Hills at the time of the acquisition, which shows that we continue to generate
ways to get more out of these reservoirs, and we're not done with Elk Hills.
In recent years, our growth in California has come from projects outside of Elk Hills. This is due to our big challenge at
Elk Hills where the underlying base decline without any capital expenditures would be around 25%. However, we are
now looking at additional opportunities which we expect will further increase the reserves at Elk Hills and help to
mitigate the decline rate, possibly reducing it by as much as 50%. These opportunities include water floods, steam
floods, as well as potential polymer and CO2 floods that could be implemented over the next three to 10 years.
These significant operating and capital efficiency improvements made by the Elk Hills team will improve the
profitability of these water floods and EOR opportunities. I would also like to point out that our plant operations team
at Elk Hills has done a great job of optimizing run time and reliability from our new cryogenic gas plant. Currently the
team is operating the plant at greater than 90% up time and they have extracted record volumes of NGLs from the gas
streams this year.
Elk Hills still has more than 900 million BOE of remaining reserves and resources that can be recovered through water
flooding and current proven EOR technologies in which we have considerable expertise, so we're going to continue our
development efforts at Elk Hills.
Our California exploration program has delivered solid results over the last five years since we ramped it up. From
2007 through 2012, we have drilled over 100 exploration wells across the California basins in both conventional and
unconventional plays. A full two-thirds of our wells have found hydrocarbons and a large portion of these successful
wells resulted in commercial production.
We have been busy over the last few years acquiring 3D seismic over a significant portion of our acreage and this has
contributed to our high rate of success. Access to this new seismic data and working closely with our operating groups
has allowed our exploration staff to build creative and innovative programs.
Last year for instance, we made a significant unconventional discovery in the San Joaquin Basin, continue the appraisal
and drilling and testing of this year established reserves and resources of approximately 50 million BOE. The full
development of this discovery is expected to require drilling 100 wells. In addition to the 50 million BOE we've
established, we are testing and are planning wells in late 2013 and 2014 that if successful will double this volume.
Further, this concept has repeatability and we plan to extend this play through much of our California acreage. Our
2013 exploration program, which includes 15 wells, is on track to deliver results consistent with prior years, and we've
continued to build inventory to ensure we have a robust exploration program going forward into 2014 and beyond.
Finally, I would like to briefly touch on our gas development prospects in the state. In the Sacramento Basin of
Northern California, we have established a sizeable natural gas position with over 318,000 net acres and 66 million
cubic feet a day of dry gas production. We estimate that we operate through our Vintage business over 80% of all
production in the region. Our current focus in the area is to optimize our current production mostly with inexpensive
workovers and a modest drilling program of eight new wells in 2013 and 14 wells in 2014.
We believe that the range of possible projects that are available in our acreage gives us the ability to ramp up our
development efforts with attractive returns at prices around $5 per Mcf. Currently we have identified total reserves and
continued resources of about 300 Bcf. We believe that our acreage held about 10 Tcf of original gas in place with about

2 Tcf currently remaining.
As you can see, we have a large inventory of water floods, steam floods and EOR opportunities in California in and
outside of Elk Hills, as well as significant upside in unconventional opportunities. All of these opportunities will
continue to be an important part of our California development plans for the future, and will make California a
significant growth asset for Oxy. The mix of projects in the next couple of years will be similar to this year as we
continue to commit a larger portion of our capital to lower decline projects to manage our capital program more
effectively and control the escalation in spending while achieving healthy production growth.
In closing, I would like to summarize the progress we've made against the goals we established at the beginning of the
year. We are executing a $1.5 billion capital program this year, which takes into account the constraints of working in
California. We expect to generate free cash flow after capital in excess of $1 billion.
Our program incorporates opportunities resulting from improvements we are already seeing regarding permitting in the
state. We shifted our development program towards a higher percentage of low decline projects such as our water and
steam floods. With continued improvements in permitting, we should be able to grow our capital spend to around $2
billion in 2014 with further increases beyond that reaching around $2.5 billion annually on a sustainable basis.
With this program, we expect to grow at least within the corporate target rates of 5% to 8% annually over the next 10
years, while earning returns of better than 20%. We've improved our capital efficiency by about 15% year to date
compared to the full year 2012. We expect to further improve on these results going forward, which will improve our
finding and development cost and returns. We have reduced our overall operating expenses by $3.50 a BOE from
$23.20 in 2012 to an expected average of $19.70 for all of 2013. This reduction translates to cost savings of over $175
million for the year, contributing to our earnings and cash flow.
We have identified at least 5,500 well locations and will add more as we continue to evaluate additional acreage and
project opportunities. We're working on several new water flood projects in addition to a number of floods where we
are engaged in redevelopment, expansion or optimization activities. We're taking advantage of the gas versus oil price
differences in expanding our steam flood opportunities, giving us a highly profitable set of projects to work with going
forward. We are continuing our focus on a number of unconventional opportunities across the state, including the
Monterey Shale, to give us further growth prospects. And finally, we are continuing our focused exploration and 3D
seismic acquisition program which has delivered a high percentage of commercially successful projects, the most
recent example being our significant unconventional discovery in the San Joaquin Basin.
We have a large and diverse portfolio of opportunities available to us across the state. We're very excited about the
future of our California operations and the role it will play in contributing to the company's overall growth.
I will now turn the call back to Steve Chazen.
Stephen I. Chazen
[indiscernible] (36:49) Thank you, Vicki. I'll now turn to our third quarter outlook. Domestically, we continue to expect
solid growth in our oil production for the year. Based on nature and timing of our drilling programs this year, the steam
floods in California, the timing of several gas plant maintenance turnarounds in the Permian, we expect the production
growth to occur in the second half of the year.
We have achieved the drilling targets we set in the first half of the year. As a result, we expect our second half average
domestic oil production will be about 6,000 to 8,000 barrels a day higher than the first half average, the increase
coming mainly from the Permian and California. We expect modest declines in our domestic gas and NGL production
that we have seen in the second quarter to continue as a result of our reduced drilling on gas properties in natural
decline, as well as additional gas plant turnarounds scheduled in our Permian business the rest of the year.
Internationally, we expect more cost pool depletions in our contracts in Qatar and Yemen, which will result in less cost
recovery barrels from those location. However we expect total international production to be about flat in the second

half of the year compared to the second quarter volumes, assuming no renewed pickup in insurgent activity in
Colombia and stable spending in Iraq. We expect international sales volumes to increase the second half of the year and
recoup well over half the underlift we've expected in the first half.
In the first six months, capital spending was $4.2 billion with $2.2 billion spent in the second quarter. We expect
second half of the year spending rate to be higher. Our annual spending level expect to be generally in line with the
$9.6 billion program we had previously discussed. The positive effect of our capital efficiency efforts have started to
become noticeable in our spending patterns. As a result, we believe there's a reasonable possibility our total spending
may be somewhat lower than the program amount I just mentioned, while still drilling the number of wells we set out
as a goal in the beginning of the year. As you can see, the business is doing well and we're continuing to make progress
on our operational goals.
With regard to our strategic business review, we have presented various options to our Board of Directors. A review of
these operations is progressing well, although it is not yet complete, so the board will continue to evaluate the
alternatives. We expect to have additional information regarding our plans towards the end of the year.
Finally, an affiliate of Plains All American filed a registration statement yesterday with the SEC for a public offering of
interest in Plains' general partner. We own 35% of the general partner's interest, and we expect to monetize a portion as
a part of our proposed offering.
Now we're ready to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Leo Mariani from RBC.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Hey, guys. Just a quick question overall on production. It looks like, just kind of looking at
overall company, is going to be flattish in 2013 versus 2012. Obviously you've got a lot of new initiatives in California
going here. Looks like that's going to accelerate next year. I know you guys also increased your Permian rig count
earlier in the year. Should we expect much better growth on production overall for Oxy in 2014 and maybe any kind of
ballpark number we could look for for growth next year?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well of course, I think the oil production will continue to do well in the back half of the
year and into next year, because almost all of the drilling is focused on oil. California will do much better as the year
progresses and into next year. International production, Iraq aside, sort of flattish because of the cost recovery issues.
So if you look at just the oil, I think you'll see reasonable growth and better growth next year. Some of the turnaround,
we won't have the turnarounds we had this year in the plants, so we should do better that way. Gas is a different issue.
Gas production, it's hard to justify spending a lot of money on gas production so on a BOE basis, you might, I think
you won't see much out of the gas, probably some decline. But I don't think spending money on gas is money well
spent at this point.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Any price out there you think you need to spend money on gas?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Vicki talked about $5 in California. California is probably the – California, maybe South
Texas and maybe a little bit in the Piceance are the highest return, but I think you probably need around $5 to excite us.
I mean the margins are pretty good in oil right now. I think if you look at sort of $100 oil, you make these huge
margins, and so trying to squeeze a few more bucks out of gas just to make some BOEs strike me as not money well
spent.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Okay, and I guess how about the Bakken? Is that an area where you guys have started to pick up
at all given the strength in oil?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think Bill can answer that.

<A - William E. Albrecht>: Yes, right now we're running five rigs in the Bakken and adding another rig in August, so
we'll go up to six. But I don't see much of an increase beyond six rigs for the rest of the year.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Okay. And I guess then how about Al Hosn, is that still on track for production kind of late 2014?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Sandy can answer that.
<A - Edward A. Lowe>: Yes, the Shah Field gas will come on at the end of 2014. We expect to see pretty much full
production in 2015.

Your next question comes from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Hi, good morning everyone.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Steve, the comment you made on the strategic business review seems to indicate that – well
directly currently indicates that we won't get the plans until later, much later this year. I was thinking we would have
more of an update on for example the Middle Eastern sales process. Potentially it seems to be that you're teeing up for a
California spin here, and then ultimately I thought there was some fairly clear plans about your intentions for the
RemainCo. Can you just sort of go back through how we've ended up here with you saying there's now a number of
different options and where things may be different from the way I perceive them to be potentially? Thanks.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, one of the things that was easiest was the Plains partial sale and then ultimately full
sale. So there's a fairly large number in that. We didn't say anything had changed. I think as you enter in discussions
with people about various things, I think it's best that those discussions not be the public domain and rather be handled
privately. And so when we have a definitive thing to talk about in the Middle East, we'll talk about that when it's
definitive. As far as the rest of it goes, you can make your own judgments about California based on what Vicki said.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yes, so I guess we could continue to consider that that will become a separate standalone
company. That seems to be the way [ph] that's going (44:30).
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, it's certainly one of the options. I didn't mean to imply that there were now 400
options. We're just considering various options. The board has really just been exposed to this in detail at one meeting,
and so it will take a little while. And we want to consult fully with them and weigh all the alternatives for them, but
clearly some things are going ahead quickly.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: And then I guess we still assume that the overall process needs to be complete before you close
your career at Oxy at the end of 2014?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, would be my hope, so.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Okay. And just my final question on this would be the towards the end of the year timing, I
guess that's conservative. It's just it seems that you don't have a huge amount of time to complete this process, and
[indiscernible] (45:28).
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, it doesn't mean that the process wouldn't proceed without an announcement. I mean,
so some things we could do without – I prefer to announce things that are not ideas but well along in the process. So
you could move ahead on any of this without some formal announcement.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Right. And my understanding is that things, you visited the Middle East, things went well, you
may be selling more of the Middle East business than previously. I think it had been the idea of 20% to 30% sales for

not less than $25 billion total value. Are those reasonable?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, I don't want to comment on discussions we might have with those, over there. The
trip went well and they were very pleased with our people and our operations, and they want us to stay in the region
and want to do things to help us to stay in the region.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Right. And then my final question is just as regards California, it feels a little bit like the movie
that we saw in 2010. You described a lot of upside and potential in California at that Analyst Meeting. It didn't really
deliver. We've seen volumes down here sequentially in California. How can we get conviction that this enormous
upside potential will be delivered when the recent track record has been that we've been disappointed?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think actually we're up sequentially this quarter, but you'll just have to see the production
as it goes.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Yes, good morning and thanks for all the additional information around California. I
guess my first question is just on breakeven. So you gave some numbers for the steam floods, but just on sort of oil
price.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Steam floods, you should use that as a ratio.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Yes, yes.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Rather than exactly those numbers.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Yes, yes, but on -
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: That wasn't breakeven, that was economically work. So that's different than breakeven. I
don't know what the breakeven number, so basically what we're saying in California is that, that ratio works and we
would continue to exploit at that ratio.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Right. And then what about the non-conventional wells and the water flood, any sort of
rough range for sort of economically working oil prices?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Vicki?
<A - Vicki Hollub>: I would say that for the water floods, certainly those were some of our better margin productions
and projects, so our breakeven prices on the water floods could go down as oil prices down to probably the $60 to $65
range.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Right. And then just on the non-conventional side, I mean obviously 7 billion barrels of
reserves sounds like a great number. I mean at the current rate, probably takes about 200 years to drill that. So when
you're looking at that -
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: 199, I thought.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Sorry, okay great. But when you're looking at the types of fields that that's contained, I
mean is it fields like Rose, North Shafter, that area, is it in-fill drilling around Elk Hills or is it the deep basin? Just
trying to get an understanding of what the technical breakthroughs are to actually unlock that at an oil price that works?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: First before Vicki answers, I think you need to understand that we've couched this entire
discussion around in the current environment, and those are things other than just oil and gas prices. So Vicki can

answer now.
<A - Vicki Hollub>: Currently we only drilled and developed on less than 5% of our unconventional prospective acres,
so we're still learning a lot about the Monterey Shale. We're in the what I would still say is even though we've drilled
1,300 wells, we're learning a lot about the Elk Hills area and the Rose and North Shafter areas. We're taking those
learnings and applying those to our evaluations of the remaining potential, and the creation of this technical team that
we have in working with our [indiscernible] (49:42) we expect to be able to start expanding out beyond those areas and
expect to see some variability. But we'll be able to apply a lot of what we've learned thus far.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Right.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think the short answer is that for the next year or two, you'll see the areas that she's pointed
out. And then as this thing – we're looking for high predictability. And so what you'll see is is this thing will build out
over time rather than sort of leap over time, because again we're looking for predictability in outcome here, so their
cash flows would be predictable going forward.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Thanks very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Thank you and apologies if I'm simply repeating the questions here, but you do talk
about 7 billion barrels of opportunity in California, but I guess it sounds like there's still a lot to study over such a large
acreage position. How do we think about how risked that 7 billion is? Is the issue in the pace? And I now the regulatory
constraints is one of them, but just that sort of an unrisked number and you just have to do a lot more work on it? It's
just kind of putting these things together here.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Vicki?
<A - Vicki Hollub>: That number is based pretty much on what we've seen in the areas that we've been developing
thus far. So that number is taken from the actual performance we've seen in the Elk Hills area with respect to our shale
play there and also taking into account what we've learned in the Rose and North Shafter area, so we feel comfortable
about that number. What we are trying to do is work on techniques to actually improve the percent recovery of the oil
in place, and there's some techniques that we think that we can start to apply and we're starting to see some success on
things that we're implementing thus far and those are results that we hope to be able to share with you in the next, in the
coming quarters.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: That's great.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think her answer is that it's a risked number.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Yes, no, I got that. So then I guess the pace on the one hand, there can be regulatory
constraints. On the other hand, you're still trying to learn more. I don't know how you can weight between these two
things, but I think there's just this ongoing question of why not go faster in these areas?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Neither, we want to make sure that the California company has stable, solid cash flow going
forward and the regulatory environment will take a while to develop. This is not North Dakota.
<Q - Arjun Narayana Murti>: Yes. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on the strategic business review. I think
you said it, Steve, but a lot of companies, when they announce these things, do present basically ideas of what they then
want to accomplish. It sounds like whether it's before year-end or some other timeframe, it will be much more
conclusionary for you or perhaps much more concrete in terms of what you'll actually be announcing at that time,
perhaps actual sales action.

<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: If you look at the PAA action, we could have said something about that a year ago or six
months ago or something like that. We said it when it was concrete. And the problem with ideas is that you telegraph
your intentions to other parties, and without, and I don't think that's necessarily the right thing to do.

Your next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, Steve. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Steve, back to California, so it sounds like what you're saying by you want the California
business to have stable cash flows is you go drill a bunch of wells.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Stable and growing cash flows.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Right. But if you go drill a bunch of wells and then you don't have the permitting let's assume, is
that really what's holding you back from stepping up that program, is it still permitting?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's a combination of permitting and technical evaluation. We could certainly, if we had a
different permitting environment, we could spend a lot more money. Probably not enough to satisfy you, but certainly
spend more money. And so I think that this is still a very difficult environment. There are bills in the legislature that
will have a negative impact on us, and so I think we want to be cautious about what we promise.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So looking at your slide presentation, you're indicating like a $500 million step up in spending,
maybe going all the way up to -
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Next year.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Yeah, and maybe going all the way up to spending your cash flow. So where is that -
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Hopefully the money we invest will generate more cash flow so it really won't spend the
cash flow.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Right, but where is that incremental activity? Is it water flood, steam flood or is it
unconventional?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's probably going to be mostly unconventional.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. Thanks. Final one on California, the rates of return, 25%, 20%, 25%, I think that's what
you said in the slide pack. Considering you have the royalty and given the numbers you've given to us before, like
350,000 barrels a day, or sorry 350,000 barrels a day with a 350,000 UR, and the cost that you gave us, those returns
sound a little conservative. Am I reading something wrong there or are those numbers – has something changed on
those?

<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think first of all, it's not IRRs. It's basically accounting returns. So it's the – it'll what show
up in our financial statements about what's, as opposed to what shows up in our imagination as IRRs. The IRRs are a
lot higher because you get your money back real quick, so probably not exactly comparable. We didn't write those
numbers to be exact. We just said, well those are what we have, we're pretty confident they'll deliver.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: I see. So it's more like a return on capital type of number?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: That's right.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. Very last one from me. I know you don't want to elaborate probably on the restructuring
at this point, but can you help us with frame on order of magnitude for how you see share buybacks when you do get to
the point where you're going to do a Dutch auction? And you know, order of magnitude would be great. Thank you.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, it just depends on how much is raised, but clearly as we raise money as a sizable
share buyback is in order. I don't think, I think under 10% wouldn't be viewed as sizable.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: All right. I'll leave it there. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Just following up on California, given the commentary about spending in terms of the I guess
call it more of the convention, the water flood, the EOR side, focusing on lower decline rates, yet the incremental
spending will be on the unconventional side. I mean, how exactly does that reconcile in terms of production growth and
expectation?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, you build the base from your steam floods and your water floods. That's what the $1.5
billion area does. Once you get the base, you can afford to step up the higher decline drilling.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. So that's how California ultimately is going to fund itself?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: That's how you would expect California to fund itself.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: And would California, if put as a separate unit however it does occur, would it take a
percentage of the debt? Would it take on new debt and that would be a way to raise cash for the parent corporation?
Any kind of light you can shine on that?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think it's premature to speculate about what we might do there.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. And then -
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: That's something that you roll out near the end rather than you start with.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. I was just trying to get kind of a feeling for where it could all come from.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: But, it isn't going to – I mean, if it were separated, it would have a capital structure similar
to E&Ps, not a capital structure similar to ours.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. And then my final question, as you've made progress on lowering the OpEx, is there any
help you can give us in terms of understanding how much of that is a function of maybe not spending on the natural gas
side and NGLs as opposed to spending on the crude side, just given that the overall investment in drilling is clearly
continuing to grow on the crude oil here in the US?

<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yes, well I mean gas workovers are cheaper, so it's more of a struggle to lower it than given
how oily we are, than say somebody who's real gassy. So I think that on a BOE basis, gas would clearly be cheaper. So
I think it's more of a structural. I mean even this quarter, the increase is almost entirely due to energy price increases,
electricity and that sort of thing. So I mean to do this in a very oily company is much more a struggle than it is say a gas
company. If we look at our pure gas production, the areas that are almost pure gas, they're doing great on this. They got
really low numbers, but they still don't make a lot of money because the gas price is low, so I mean their operating
costs are really nothing. But it's the oil stuff where you struggle because you got electricity and other costs that make it
really out of your control. So I think given the oily nature of the company, I think the people in the field have done a
great job.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. And then how much more progress do you expect at this point on the cost reduction
front?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well we show you the targets in one of the slides.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: So it will be – it can always be lumpy in any quarter. You can have a few more workovers,
or you can have a field problem, so operating costs can be lumpy in any one quarter, and again there's electricity costs
really out of our control. But you can see it in the slide.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: That's kind of what I was trying to get to. If you've got some of the items that are out of your
control, with what's within your control, how does that line up with the target?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We continue to do better on the items in our control. If we broke out the stuff in our control,
you'd see even a more sharp improvement.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Thank you. Thank you for the detail on California. I just have a few follow-up questions. On
slide 31, you guys talk about the significant discovery in the San Joaquin Basin. I just want to understand the full
development that you guys talked about, 100 wells, what would be the cost of each one of these wells, just the sort of
$250,000 per well or is it the $7 million per well sort of cost that you guys talked about?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's probably neither. Vicki?
<A - Vicki Hollub>: Yes, it's more in the $2.5 million to $3 million range for that development. And we're starting to
drill, toward the end of this year, we'll be drilling more appraisal wells.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. And if you could help me a little bit understand how the permitting process kind of
works for all these different play types you've discussed in California as opposed that when you're drilling in areas
you're already producing from, those are sort of easier permits to get. But then as you move out of these areas, it's more
difficult to get sort of those permits, so I guess for this particular discovery, is it pretty easy to get the permits you need
to drill up this inventory and realize this discovery or how does that work from play to play?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Vicki, why don't you tell him where you are in the permitting process there.
<A - Vicki Hollub>: Yes, for that particular area, because it is a new area, we are in the permitting process. And you're
correct, for new areas it takes longer, a little more difficult and that's why our current appraisal program has not already
begun. However, we're in that process now. We've submitted our permit applications and expect to have the approvals
of those by the end of Q3, and worst case we're thinking Q4, so we should be able to proceed as we expect. But you're
right, it's in the new areas that we have the longer delays.

<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: But you know, we started this a year ago, Vicki?
<A - Vicki Hollub>: Yes.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: So it gives you a feel, so we got a permit to drill a well or two, and so once we decided we
needed to expand it, it's been more than a year.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: So to give it kind of a general sort of rule of thumb, is it from discovery to production of, or
realization of the discovery to production, it's kind of like a year or two to?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: A year before you can start.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. And then another year before you get to full production?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, no. You got a year of doing nothing.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Or very little, testing the wells that you've got. Then you hopefully get your permit in a year
or a little more than a year, and even that isn't necessarily the full field development, but it might be close to where you
are. You have maybe some air quality issues that you have to deal with, depending on the size of the facilities you want
to build. This can stretch on for a while.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. So it sounds like the incubation period is like two to three years from [indiscernible]
(64:11)?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yes, I think from when you start, and as you – as the field – if you're unlucky enough in
some ways to find more than you thought, you need to go back for more permits because your production facilities
aren't big enough.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Sure.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: And that will start another period of study by the state. I think the state is doing the best it
can given the environment in the state, the political environment in the state. I think the state government is doing what
it can, but no one should underestimate, even when you're successful, how long it takes to convert it into production.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, understood. Thank you for the time.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Sure.

Our next question comes from John Herrlin of Société Générale.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yes, just some quick ones. How much were the well costs at Rose?
<A - Vicki Hollub>: The well cost at Rose was $3.9 million.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. With respect to your water floods, why are you not doing polymer at Wilmington or
Huntington Beach? Or you didn't mention it, anyway.
<A - Vicki Hollub>: Yes, no, that's under consideration. Our EOR technical team is looking at the possibility of
polymer flooding not only at Wilmington but also at Elk Hills.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: The answer is, the plain water field at Wilmington is working great, and there's no real – I
mean, this is a true technological victory here over the years. And so I think it's before you do heroic things, you ought

to do stuff that's sort of simple.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. That's fine, Steve. With respect to response times, you said six to nine months. I assume
water is more, is later, is more protracted than the steam or is that incorrect?
<A - Vicki Hollub>: It depends on the type of water flood. Some are quicker responders than others, but based on what
we're trying to develop now, it's looking like six to nine months. But in some areas, we're seeing responses already.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay, great.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: His question really is about water versus steam, is there any difference.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Right, exactly.
<A - Vicki Hollub>: No, the steam, there is a lag there too, because you've got to heat up the reservoir, so that does
take a while.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Correct. Correct. All right, last one from me, Steve, acquisitions. You haven't spent that much
this year versus the not too recent past. Is it issue of price or dearth of properties or just your current strategic review?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think all three. There have been not a lot of properties for sale. You've got a curve, price,
oil price curve. I think the average oil price in the curve is like $85 for the next three years, meanwhile the current price
is $105 or $104 or whatever it is. So that doesn't actually lead to a lot of deals, because as you look forward, you're
talking about at least the market's expecting $85. The seller is looking at checks for $105. So that doesn't actually lead
to a lot of closure. There's really not a lot of oil properties or properties that we would be interested in for sale, and
given where we are in the overall process, I'm building, we're building cash for other uses.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay, that's great. Thank you.
