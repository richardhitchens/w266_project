statements in light of new information or future events.
Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra.
Safra Ada Catz
Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review guidance for Q4, and turn the call
over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
This quarter, currency was a 1% headwind to new software license, and a 2% headwind to hardware and total revenue.
In addition, EPS this year was reduced by $0.02 due to a currency remeasurement non-operating loss for Venezuela
that obviously had not been included in my guidance. In Q3 of last year, Venezuela's devaluation had a $0.01 impact.
Q3 for us was a solid quarter and, overall, we're pleased with our results. Core businesses were within guidance, and
areas of investor focus, including Cloud, Engineered Systems and hardware, all delivered strong results. My comments
today are generally going to reflect constant dollar growth rates, unless I mention it otherwise.
Total software revenues were nearly $7 billion, up 6% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues
drove nearly half the total company revenue at $4.6 billion, up 7% from last year. Q3 renewal rates were at a 4-year
high, as our installed base of 400,000 customers continues to power earnings and cash flow.
New software license revenues were $2.4 billion, up 5%. Looking at GAAP results by region, the Americas grew 9%,
with Latin America particularly strong, and EMEA grew 3%. Asia-Pacific, though, declined, with Australia and India
both down.
Within software, Cloud subscriptions were $292 million, up 24% from last year. As our Cloud business continues to
ramp, bookings growth was again much higher than Cloud subscription revenue growth. We've been using Fusion
accounting for our own financial reporting for two years, and revenues for all portfolios of Fusion, including financials,
supply chain, HCM and customer experience, grew triple digits.
Now, as our Cloud business becomes more material, I want to share how Cloud subscriptions affect our financials.
Most obvious is that revenue is initially lower as subscription license revenue is recognized over the life of the
agreement as opposed to license revenue being taken upfront.
Over time, since we're providing much more than just the software and the updates, the revenue is higher. The
additional value we are providing is the hardware, including our Engineered Systems, the hosting, and the expertise that
only Oracle can provide while leveraging the economies of scale that we have. So while customers are paying over
time, they're using and paying for more Oracle products through Cloud subscription.
They're paying less in total because they too can benefit from our operating synergies. Net-net, the Cloud operating
business is attractive for both customers and for Oracle but especially so given the integration of Oracle hardware,
software, and expertise.
For software, database continues to do very well, with Exadata, Exalytics and business intelligence software products
all up more than 30%. Also strong was Customer Experience or CRM, both on-premise and SaaS, as well as our
communications and project management verticals.
The quarter was not dependent on any one large deal. Hardware system product revenue was $725 million, up 10%
from last year. Obviously, we're pleased to have exceeded our guidance, but it's also nice to report growth.
Engineered Systems grew more than 30%, and this spectacular growth is reflected not only in our hardware growth but
also in the very long list of customer wins we had against IBM. Engineered Systems now account for nearly a third of
all hardware product sales.
Hardware gross margins are down about 2 points because we are packing the newest systems with more memory
without raising prices. Hardware support was $600 million, up 7% from last year, but down sequentially, our normal

seasonal pattern. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 6% from last year; non-GAAP
operating income grew $188 million, to $4.4 billion, up 6% over last year; and the operating margin was 47% again.
We believe we can invest for growth and make money as we continue to see leverage in our business model. As I
mentioned earlier, included in our non-operating expense is a foreign currency remeasurement loss of $110 million
related to our Venezuelan subsidiary. Were it not for this loss, EPS would have been $0.02 higher.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23%. The non-GAAP EPS was $0.68, in U.S. dollars, growing 7% in
constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 21%, and GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.56 in U.S. dollars, up 10% in
constant currency.
Free cash flow increased 11% to $14.4 billion over the last four quarters. We now have more than $37 billion in cash
and marketable securities. Net of debt our cash position is approximately $13 billion.
As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through earnings growth, stock
repurchases and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 55.4 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12
months, we've repurchased nearly 360 million shares, for a total of $10.7 billion, and reduced our share count by 5%.
We've also paid out more than $1.6 billion in dividends this fiscal year so far.
Stock repurchases and dividends have totaled more than 85% of free cash flow over the last 12 months, and the Board
of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. Now to the guidance.
And if currency were to stay where it is today, then the impact of currency would be minimal. Of course, this could
change quickly. New software license and Cloud subscription revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to 10%.
Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from 0 to 10%.
As a result, total revenue growth on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 3% to 7%, in recorded
dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.92 and $0.99 in constant dollars, and in reported
dollars.
GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.79 cents to $0.86. Now, I want to remind you that last year, we recognized an
acquisition related benefit of $269 million in connection with the Pillar Data Systems earn-out. Excluding that benefit,
GAAP EPS last Q4 would have been $0.74.
This guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 21.5%, and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%. And, of course, it may end up
being different.
Finally, my guidance does not take into account any additional non-operating remeasurement losses as a result of
exchange rate changes in Venezuela.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.
Lawrence J. Ellison
Thank you, Safra. Oracle's Engineered Systems including Exadata and SPARC SuperClusters, achieved a 30% constant
currency growth rate in the quarter, while throughout the industry traditional high-end server product lines are in steep
decline. Our Engineered Systems business is growing rapidly for the same fundamental reason that our Cloud
Applications business is growing rapidly.
In both cases, customers want us to integrate the hardware and software and make it work together, so they don't have
to. As customers shift to pre-integrated hardware and Cloud computing, in search of lower costs and more rapid
implementations, Oracle is presented with new opportunities for leadership in a number of market categories.
5 years ago, we delivered our first Exadata machine. In the next few months, we will deliver our 10,000th engineered
system. We believe Oracle's Engineered Systems are well on their way to replacing IBM pSeries as the leader in

high-end computing.
8 years ago, we started to rewrite all of our applications for the Cloud. Now those Fusion ERP, HCM, and CRM Cloud
Applications are competing effectively with SaaS product specialists, like Salesforce and Workday. SAP has not yet
begun to rewrite their ERP, HCM and CRM applications for the Cloud. This gives us the opportunity to become the
leader in Cloud Applications and replace SAP as the leader in the overall applications marketplace.
Strong sales of our Cloud Applications, Engineered Systems and 12C database demonstrate that Oracle is successfully
exploiting the transition to the new generation of Cloud computing and Big Data.
Mark?
Mark V. Hurd
Sure, just a couple of comments. Solid results for us in Europe and North America. Latin America was very strong for
us, while Asia-Pac was mixed. Japan had a solid quarter.
In Cloud, this was our best quarter ever. Excellent bookings growth, more than 60%. The booking growth more than
doubled the revenue growth, as we're just winning in the Cloud across all portfolios.
Contract sizes are growing: more than 65 seven- or eight-figure deals, with many driven by Fusion HCM and Sales
Cloud. We're seeing good growth from acquired Cloud offerings and Fusion Cloud growth was even better with HCM,
sales force automation, and ERP all up triple digits.
In HCM we added 250 customers or roughly four to five times the number reported by Workday. We're seeing
excellent growth across all solutions, core HR, payroll, and Talent Cloud. Double digit growth in Taleo and triple digit
growth in Fusion HCM. In ERP triple digit growth with a bigger customer base than Workday and we're growing
faster, period.
In Customer Experience, we added more than 260 new customers with strong growth across all our solutions,
marketing, sales, service, and social clouds. Our 60%-plus Cloud booking growth is considerably higher than
Salesforce.com.
Our Fusion products are now in release 8, with 1,000 new features in that release, with improvements coming with
release 9 again this summer will be a similar number of new features, so release 8, 1,000 new features. Release 9 this
summer, with roughly the same number of features.
Along with Responsys and BlueKai soon, we continue to gain momentum on the product side, the customer side and
you will see this in our financial performance.
In hardware, 10% overall growth, we grew in every single region. We're growing while our competitors are declining.
We're taking share, and we created a new category in high-end computing: Engineered Systems. As Larry mentioned,
soon, we will have sold more than 10,000 Engineered Systems, and our 32% growth rate this quarter is against a
meaningful comparison. In fact, Q3 last year was the all-time record, at that time, for systems sold.
All major Engineered Systems products grew double-digits, SPARC SuperCluster saw triple-digit growth again this
quarter. Both the T-server and NAS storage saw good growth and, combined with Engineered Systems, these products
now make up nearly two-thirds of all product revenue and grow roughly 20%. Database continues to show strong
performance and we've not yet begun to see the coming benefits of 12C, which will help drive license growth.
Middleware was very strong as well, with double-digit growth, led by excellent performance in data analytics.
Cloud and Engineered Systems are two hypergrowth businesses inside the largest cash flow company in enterprise
technology and, with that, we'll take whatever questions you've got.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] We'll go first to Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: Thank you. My question is for Mark. I guess the stronger momentum in Oracle's Cloud
software bookings and revenue growth really jump out at me among the data points in the release. I know you gave
some good color by product. Wondering if you might add a little bit more depth, help us understand what the broader
drivers were. Was it Oracle doing a better job cross-selling on acquisitions? Was it the better functionality in Fusion
version 7? Maybe any other factors that you think are worth highlighting. Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: The good news I'd tell you is that we're just better at almost every part of this. I really don't
know how I can say it to you. We thought we knew a lot a year ago or a couple years ago. We just know a lot more
now. We're better from a product perspective. I talked to you a little bit about what we've got in release 8. It's 1,000
new features across the entire release. So big, big jump from a product perspective.
We obviously have more feet on the street than we had. Certainly, not just more feet on the street, but they've been in
place longer. They've been now trained multiple times and, clearly, the perception in the market now has improved
about our Cloud position. I think last quarter, our 35% growth was good news and, clearly, this 60% growth is even
better news. So I think that will help us as well.
But it is broad-based, Karl, so there's no one deal in here. There's no one product line that drove it. It's really across all
of our product lines and, as I mentioned, our Fusion products, our organic Fusion products, really had a fantastic
quarter. Fusion HCM, Fusion Sales Automation and Fusion ERP were all three very strong. It's really true across most
regions as well. I don't have a region story that would be unique to the growth rate. It was fairly consistent across all
regions.
So I hope that's helpful.
<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: Okay, good, thank you.
Operator
We'll move next to Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. The other area that stood out this quarter was hardware
and it's a bit puzzling because, if I look at the IBM numbers, they're declining quite significantly, and you mentioned
some of the drivers there already. Can you just kind of go a little bit deeper in there and, also, how you see the – we've
been waiting for a turnaround in hardware for a while. Now all the things that you're talking are coming true. Is that
something sustainable? How do you see that playing out against the competition going forward?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: It's absolutely sustainable because Engineered Systems has been growing rapidly for a
long time. We keep talking about it. Now, the problem a couple years ago was Engineered Systems was a small
percentage of the total. Now, Engineered Systems has grown up to be over 30% of the total. So, and soon, it's going to
be half of the total. So that's very, very positive. The x86 commodity business, which used to be a big business when
we bought Sun, has now shrunk to almost nothing.
So our hardware business has gone through the transition where we've gotten out of the commodity storage business,
we've gotten out of the commodity server business, and replaced it with computing systems with a lot of our own
intellectual property. These businesses are growing rapidly and have very good margins. The reason – we compete with
IBM pSeries all the time, head to head, and it's not uncommon for our systems to be several times faster than IBM.

Let me give you one example, without saying who the competitor was. We replaced a system in the world's largest
Cloud company. You guys can figure out who that is. World's largest Cloud company. We delivered an Exadata system
to them. They moved their application and got it live in 3 weeks and experienced 10 times better performance at a
fraction of the cost.
This is not uncommon when we install an Exadata machine or a SPARC SuperCluster to have a very rapid
implementation, deliver terrific performance and at a dramatically lower overall cost, because all of the complexity of
integration is done by us not by them.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I'd add to your comment. You asked if it was sustainable. What I hoped you'd be encouraged by
was, if you looked at our performance over the past several quarters, you've seen the reflection of our execution of our
strategy in hardware support. You've seen hardware support continue to incline year-over-year and sequentially in
terms of its performance. We grew now 7% in Q3, which is a reflection of what Larry described. The fact that there is
higher Oracle IP directly relates to our attach rates, and eventually what turns into hardware support.
So we now have our core businesses that have all been refreshed. That's why I mentioned it. Our T-systems, our
network attached storage, or ZFS Storage, and our Engineered Systems are now almost 70% of our revenue, and all
three of those are growing and they are gaining share.
So is it sustainable? I can't predict the macro, but I can predict we will continue to gain share. And to add to Larry's
point, we just don't compete with the server vendors. We actually do a lot of other things than just compete with an
IBM. We compete with EMC, frankly, when we get into those environments because we radically change our
customers' storage requirements.
If our customer's got a petabyte of storage, we know how to compress that data with Exadata, to where they may only
need to use 100 terabytes. And so this opportunity for us to now change the game and the way people think about how
they use their infrastructure is, in my opinion, long-term, a very sustainable strategy, and we've got differentiation, and
that's what we're using.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator
We'll hear now Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: Hey, good afternoon. I had a two-parter question for you. The first part is, Larry, maybe
talk a little bit about 12C and how you think it influences the hardware business next year. I know there's the "C can
stand for Cloud," but I'd be curious to get your take on the consolidation opportunity.
And then, as part of that, Safra made a quick comment about, I think, the renewal rates in your largest revenue line
around license update and support, and I'd love to get a little more color from there and how you're seeing 12C
influence maintenance renewals and customers subscribing for support. Thank you.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Okay, I'll start with 12C, in terms of its rate of uptake there. There are two key aspects of
12C, one that came out with the initial release, which is the multi-tenant feature, that is why it's called 12C for the
Cloud. It literally takes any application that you've got, any Oracle application you've got, and makes it a multi-tenant
application.
Even companies like Salesforce.com, who we are both a supplier to Salesforce.com and a competitor with
Salesforce.com. I just recently got a note from Marc Benioff, who is excited about bringing in Exadata and 12C and
making that the basis of Salesforce.com's cloud computing infrastructure that they put their application on.
So we're seeing adopters with very, very high standards in terms of having to supply millions of users, reliably and cost
effectively in the Cloud, talk about moving their entire business to 12C and Exadata. That's just the tip of the iceberg,
these hyper scale-companies. We think virtually all of our customers are on their way to moving to 12C.

Some that are the early adopters and then there's the rest of the guys who come down the road a bit later but we think
it's very attractive to our conventional customers and to hyper-scale customers like Salesforce, and others.
I'll let – the second piece is the in-memory piece, and we think that it comes out this summer, comes out in June
basically, June, July, August, something like that. And we think that's going to accelerate the adoption of 12C a lot. I
think the performance gains there are so dramatic. We think people will – even the people who like to wait, wait a
while for the new features and maybe wait 6 months or a year before they try it out, there are people trying it out now,
hundreds of people trying it out now before it's even released so we think this is a unique feature in terms of being able
to have a huge payoff right away and we think 12C will be the most rapidly adopted new release in many, many years,
for those two reasons: In-memory and multi-tenancy features.
I'll let Safra comment about the renewal rates
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Well, the renewal rates in database are always extremely strong. Folks make really long-term
bets on our database, and because we just continue to provide the kind of innovation Larry is talking about, they always
renew. I mean, it doesn't make sense not to. They get just so much enormous value. We continue to invest in the
database, as Larry just mentioned, and as a result, renewal rates remain extremely, extremely high for the database, for
all our products, to be frank, but database is always great, and it remained again that way this quarter, and all year.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?
Operator
We'll hear now from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Thank you and good afternoon. Mark, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit
more on the comments you made about modern middleware and data analytics. If you could help highlight your
strategy for us, as well as go over with us your competitive positioning?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Sure, yeah. I mean, I think, yeah, as I mentioned, the middleware growth was strong.
Underneath it, data analytics was very, very strong. Our growth in data analytics was – in the tech part of data
analytics, was greater than 40%. So it was a big number.
Now, we've done several things. One, we've seen a couple of shifts. First we've added a lot of salespeople. Second, with
the addition of our Endeca product line, with our addition of Exalytics, we've brought a lot of new technology to the
space. We've also seen the competitors that we compete with shift. Traditionally, Oracle would see Business Objects
and Cognos and we actually see Tableau a lot more than we see those two, at this point. And frankly, I think the
integration work we've done with Endeca, with Exalytics has paid off, the salespeople we've brought have paid off and
you see it show up in our results. There are other things in middleware, Heather, that performed very well as well, but
of materiality that's probably the one to call out, which is data analytics.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: If I could just add one thing to that. With the release of Oracle in-memory database with
12C, our data analytics performance is going to increase by more than a factor of 10. Some cases, in fact, more than a
factor of 100. So, we think this summer, with 12C, our data analytics business is going to take off. And of course the
intention is to sell a lot of those data analytics products in the Cloud, as opposed to on premise. We will give customers
a choice, but we'll offer that the data analytics in the Cloud, data analytics on premise, it's a big push for us. As Mark
said, we've seen new competitors and an opportunity, once again, to move to the front of the pack, to become the
number one data analytics company in the world.
We think, you know, the new competitors are small and innovative. The old competitors have a lot of market share, and
we think that market share is there for the taking, as long as we can deliver high-quality technology and that's what
we'll do this summer

<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I should have mentioned that too. Larry triggered that thought. We did announce some BI
offerings in the Cloud in the quarter. And so, while not yet a material part of our revenue, an awful exciting offering to
add to everything else that I and Larry mentioned in terms of what we're bringing to the market. So, we're excited about
the space. We think there's opportunity for us to gain material share here.

Operator
And Rick Sherlund with Nomura has our next question.
<Q - Rick G. Sherlund>: Thanks. For Larry, can you update us on your progress in delivering your infrastructure
stack in the Cloud delivered as platform-as-a-service? And are there any metrics you can give us on the traction that
you're seeing there?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Yeah, well, it's available on a limited basis right now. It's going to be available in both
infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service. We've done all the pricing, the infrastructure-as-a-service will be
priced pretty much equivalent to Amazon, but really we think that's a commodity business, and not in any way in a bad
sense.
To play that game, you have to be – we're going to have a compute service and a storage service. The storage service is
already out. The compute service is going to be released en masse shortly. And that will be very competitive, we think,
with Amazon or anybody else in this business.
The big differentiator for us is, along with infrastructure-as-a-service, we have a very strong platform-as-a-service
offering coming out with our infrastructure, and that's, of course, our two major platform plays. In middleware, it's Java
and the database, of course, is Oracle.
We think that gives us a unique pair of differentiators if the infrastructure or platform-as-a-service is taken together.
And we think that's what our customers are going to do. Customers are going to come to us and buy our platform in the
Cloud and buy infrastructure in the Cloud, and move a lot of their existing applications out of their own data centers
into our Cloud, and they suddenly can do that without having to change their applications at all.
So they can move their applications intact to our Cloud and get all of the cost benefits, all of the efficiencies of scale,
and they don't have to change the apps at all. We think that's a unique proposition we offer our customers. And again,
delivery time is all this summer.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.

That will be from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Hi. Thanks, guys. Just want to build on that last question on the Cloud. At OpenWorld, you
guys talked about some metrics in terms of Fusion applications in the Cloud and the percentage of customers that were
choosing Cloud-based deployment of Fusion. I wonder if you could comment on just what you've been seeing over the
past few quarters there? And then also, just competitively, with Fusion in the Cloud, what are you seeing out there
versus Workday, versus salesforce.com? And now that Fusion apps and Fusion apps in the Cloud have been out there
for, obviously, multiple quarters.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I think what you asked was the deployment of Fusion on-premise versus Cloud. I think that's
what you asked, and it's Cloud, Cloud, Cloud. So let me go through that one more time. Cloud, Cloud, Cloud, is
generally where Fusion is deployed.

So we've had great success with it. We've had great adoption. I think one of the things that's important. I've seen some
opinions, I won't credit a source, that our growth rates, these exciting growth rates we're describing, are coming from
acquired properties as opposed to Fusion activities. And I want to make sure I'm clear, Phil, to refute that.
Now, it doesn't mean – I love acquired properties too. So I love them all, but I just want to make sure that it's clear in
the numbers that our Fusion products are growing very fast, faster than our overall growth rate.
Now, as it relates to your conversation about Workday. I tried to be as transparent as I could be. We've got the good
fortune that they're transparent in most cases. Although, I didn't get to see their customer list this quarter. In previous
quarters, I hear their numbers, and we just have more new customers than they do. So, that seems like a good metric to
me, and we'll continue to see as we move going forward, but we're very comfortable competing with them. We felt very
good about release 7. As I told you, we're now on release 8. We're very comfortable with that product. We've gotten
our sales organization trained and we're very comfortable competing with them and, of course, we're growing off a
bigger base than that.
With salesforce, we do what all of Larry described. We compete with them. They're a customer at the same time, but in
sales automation, we're competing with them. We had very strong growth in Fusion sales auto in the quarter, and we're
very comfortable with also our position in service Cloud. That's right now acquired product, but we feel very good
about both. But we've added now, also, the capability in marketing.
So we bought a B2B – a leading marketing automation company, in Eloqua. We supplemented that with the leading
B2C company in Responsys, and we've now announced our intention to acquire BlueKai. So we believe we have a
leadership position in marketing automation, leadership position in service automation. We're on the attack in sales
automation, although clearly number two to salesforce at that point. But we believe the ecosystem we've now laid out is
second to no one and the leading position in the marketplace. And I think it's showing up in our results.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.
Operator
That will be from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kash Gopalan Rangan>: Hi. Thank you very much. First, Mark, any tweaks. What are the things that are
working successfully from a sales execution go-to-market standpoint that you plan on emphasizing as you look at your
business next year?
And one for you, Safra. Deferred revenue is down sequentially. Can you expand on what might have contributed to
that? Thank you very much.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I'll start and let Safra finish. We've obviously added a lot of capacity. We feel very good about
the capacity we've added. We're very focused on those people being very productive, so what you see us invest in a lot
now is training. I probably mentioned training three times during this call.
And so, as our product set continues – just continues to get better and better and better, and our salespeople now have
more time in-seat, training is a big deal. Now we will add people next year, and Larry talked about some exciting stuff
we now have in platform and infrastructure. So you'll see us add salespeople and, as we start to compete with, again, a
new competitor, as it relates to platform and infrastructure, you'll see us do some supplemental adding in some other
places. But a real keen focus, Kash, on productivity, and making these people – because you can imagine, against the
size of our sales force, we have billions of dollars of revenue associated with the productivity gains we can make with
the capacity we now have in this company, from a sales perspective.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: If I can add one thing, just to scale it. As we roll out platform-as-a-service and
infrastructure-as-a-service, we will have specialists selling nothing but platform-as-a-service, and nothing but

infrastructure-as-a-service. And we'll have someplace between 500 and 1,000 of them that we're going to add next
fiscal year. Starting with the class. This is around the world.
So, again, we go back to this thing that, we have a new set of competitors and we need specialist sales teams that are
used to competing with Amazon, other specialist sales teams that are used to competing with IBM pSeries. It's a
different sale to a different customer, quite often. But we're lining up against all of our new competitors and making
sure we have sales capacity, as well as a competitive product.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay, Kash, the Q3 deferred revenues are following the exact same seasonal pattern that they
always follow, including last year. So though they're sequentially down, that's really because Q4 is the peak for support
renewals, et cetera, and it always goes down from Q2 to Q3, sequentially. I do want to remind you, of course, that it's
up over $200 million over the same quarter last year. And that's really what you should be looking at.
There's nothing going on, as far as burning down or whatever. It's simply the same thing we have every Q3, where it's
just as it burns down the big Q4 renewals and it shows up right there in that line. That's it.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.
Operator
That will come from Macquarie's Brad Zelnick.
<Q - Brad Zelnick>: Thank you very much. Larry, big data is obviously a huge opportunity for Oracle, given your
strength in database and traction with engineered systems. But from an apps perspective, can you talk about the
opportunity to differentiate and drive growth by leveraging big data within the apps themselves? And do you see big
data as more of its own category, or a feature of next-generation applications?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: I think it's an underlying tech category. For example, there's no doubt that in-memory
databases allow us to analyze large amounts of data more quickly. The fact that our Exadata machines have multiple
tiers of caching, we now not only have DRAM and rotating storage, we have a lot of flash memory that we have to
manage. It allows us to manage huge amounts of data – huge databases. Multi-petabyte databases and deliver very high
performance. We think of big data as an underlying set of technologies.
For batch, if you want a big data batch process, the open-source product Hadoop is a very good product, if you're doing
batch processing. If you're doing big data real-time processing, then we think the Oracle database is, by far and away,
the best technology for managing real-time processing of big data.
We think this is a category where we're already the leader, and in fact, we're gaining on our competitors. If you look at
all of our database competitors, both relational and non-relational databases, we're taking share both on the SQL area
and we're growing a lot faster than the no-SQL area. So, we're very comfortable that the improvements we've made to
our database will allow us to prosper in the big data era. But again we think – and of course, any application then
written on top of Oracle can exploit that data, and that application becomes enriched.
So our telecommunications billing system, which has to manage huge amounts of transactions with millions and
millions of customers, be able to figure out whether to cut off a phone call when someone – when someone exceeds
their bill, and do all of that real-time. That's real-time processing of huge amounts of data by a phone company. Those
are the kind of applications we provide that almost no one else can provide.
<Q - Brad Zelnick>: Thank you.

<Q - Brad R. Reback>: Great. Thanks very much. Safra, year to date CapEx spending is down about 9%. I know, in
the past, you've been fairly adamant about not needing to really ramp up CapEx, like a lot of your competitors have
had. But, given the really strong 60% bookings growth in Cloud, has any of the thinking changed there?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Remember, we have enormous scale that we've not fully tapped. We've been making
investments this whole time, and so there will be – we will continue to invest as we do now. We have, obviously, some
visibility into our contracts that we've signed, but we have so much scale that we've been investing in for years, much
of it, you know, still available, and so we're very comfortable where we're at right now. And we budgeted to it, and I
don't think you'll be seeing any massive gapping, just because our size is so large, and because we have our own
hardware, we have our own systems, we can really thoroughly optimize for our applications with compression and all
these other things that other folks just don't have the benefit and luxury that we have.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Yeah, we the think, with our Engineered Systems and our data compression technology,
we can deliver the same storage and the same compute capacity of our competitors for a lot less money. I mean, that's
where we're selling – we're selling this technology to our customers, that's our pitch and we think we can build our own
data centers just as efficiently, and that's why I don't think you'll ever see our CapEx approach our infrastructure
competitors in the Cloud.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: No.
<Q - Brad R. Reback>: Thanks very much.
