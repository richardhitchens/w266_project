Thanks, Trevor, and good morning, everybody.
Hey, look, the company had a good fourth quarter in a generally improving environment. Orders grew by 8% and our
backlog is an all-time high at $244 billion. Growth market orders grew by 13% and the U.S. expanded by 8% and
Europe grew by 3%, so pretty broad-based growth. And Industrial organic growth was up 5% for the quarter.
We earned $0.53 per share in the quarter, up 20%. Our Industrial earnings growth was up 12% with six of seven
segments growing. Capital earned $2.5 billion including some tax-efficient gains, as we exited global platforms. And
we're able to pull forward $0.05 of Industrial restructuring, partially offset by $0.03 of gains. So this is more than we
expected and will give us some more cost-out in 2014.
We continue to run the company well. Margins grew by 100 basis points in the quarter and 60 basis points for the year.
This actually reflects 66 basis points before the impact of acquisitions. Our value gap was exceptionally strong and we
reduced structural cost by $1.6 billion for the year. We generated $17.4 billion of CFOA and ended the year with $89
billion of consolidated cash.
We allocated the cash in a value-creating way. We returned $18.2 billion through dividends and buyback. We
completed $9 billion of M&A, primarily in Oil & Gas and Aviation, and these businesses are delivering for investors.
So overall, this was a good quarter for GE and positions us to deliver in 2014 and beyond.
Our orders for the quarter were about $31 billion, a record. We also ended the year with a record high backlog of $244
billion. We had growth in both equipment and services. There was real strength in Power & Water. We ended the year
with 125 orders for heavy-duty gas turbines. Power gen services grew by 9%, which was actually 16% excluding
Europe.
And regionally, our gains were broad-based. The U.S. continued to rebound, growing 8%. And for the total year, orders
grew by 8% and backlog grew by $34 billion. Aviation orders reflect our record backlog for equipment, but at the same
time Aviation services continues to be very strong.
Orders for Oil & Gas equipment are always lumpy, but orders, year-to-date, are up 8% and we're encouraged by the
orders price performance in Oil & Gas. We've built a big backlog in Energy Management, which should help in 2014
and Transportation is being impacted by a weak mining market.
Orders pricing was in line with our expectations. We saw pricing pressure in heavy-duty gas turbines mainly based on
regional mix. But on balance, we expect to continue to drive a positive value gap in 2014.
Our growth initiatives continued to deliver results. Growth market revenue was up 10% in the quarter. Growth was
pretty broad-based, six of nine regions were up by double-digits and we continue to build out our growth market
presence.
For service, 6% revenue growth was the best quarterly result in 2013. Highlights include 54 advanced gas paths.
Aviation spares grew by 17%, Oil & Gas services grew by 17%. And we launched another 14 predictivity offerings in
the fourth quarter and our dollars per installed base grew by 5% in the quarter.
We continue to win in the market. The Dubai Airshow resulted in $40 billion of wins. The Revolution CT is rapidly
becoming the industry standard. We're the only locomotive competitor with both the Tier-4 Diesel and LNG offering in
tests and we continue to build out service technology around our Oil & Gas installed base. At our Outlook Meeting, we
set a target of 4% to 7% organic growth for 2014. And with the huge backlog and strong growth initiatives, that looks
achievable.
Now for margins, we have a pretty good story on margins, growing 100 basis points in the quarter. Now, we've finished
the year up 66 basis points on an organic basis. We had an internal plan that was well above 70 basis points, but we're
impacted by supply chain quality issues in wind and some Energy Management project delays.
By business, we had positive operating leverage year over year and margin expansion in six of seven businesses. Big
drivers of our margin expansion were simplification and value gap. And in 2013, we achieved $1.6 billion of

simplification benefits and our value gap was about $900 million.
In addition, we were able to do more fourth quarter restructuring, which will fortify our margin goals in 2014. One
other note, we had no gains in the fourth quarter of 2013 versus some gains in the fourth quarter of 2012. So this really
was a solid performance. We're getting fairly consistent margin performance across the company, and with margins
expanding 110 basis points in the second half, we really feel like we have good momentum going into 2014.
So on to 2014, we plan to grow margins in 2014 in line with our goal to exceed 17% by 2016 and we pulled forward
more restructuring in 2013 than we originally planned. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we executed $0.05 per share of
projects that have an 18-month payback. This was partially offset by $0.03 of gains. We finished 2013 with $1.6 billion
of structural cost-out. Because of our fourth quarter restructuring, we're increasing our cost-out goals for 2014.
At the Outlook Meeting, we said we would achieve about $1 billion of cost-out. We're now targeting to get more than
$1 billion. And we expect our SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be about 14% in 2014.
Key margin drivers will, again, be value gap and simplification. We expect our R&D to be better and mix will be
negative as our product sales are growing faster than service. But our margin plans have been fortified and this should
be a tailwind for GE going into 2014.
Look, we ended the quarter with significant balance sheet strength. Our total CFOA was about $17.5 billion for the
year, consistent with expectations. We had a good quarter in capital efficiency and working capital.
On the GE Capital side, we have substantial liquidity. Our commercial paper fell below $30 billion for the first time in
many, many years. And we ended the year with $89 billion of consolidated cash and about $14 billion at the parent.
We're implementing our plans of value creation and opportunistic and balanced capital allocation.
In 2013, we returned $18.2 billion to investors through dividends and buyback. And we announced a 16% increase in
our dividend at year-end. And like I said earlier, we completed $9 billion of acquisitions. As I said at the Outlook
Meeting, we plan to work capital efficiency hard in 2014 and our capital allocation will create value for our investors.
So with that, let me turn it over to Jeff to talk about really the operations and performance of the businesses. Jeff?
Jeffrey S. Bornstein
Great, thank you.
So I'll start with consolidated results. We had continuing operations revenue of $40.4 billion reported up 3% in the
quarter. Industrial sales of $28.8 billion were up 6%. GE Capital revenues were $11.1 billion, down 5%. Operating
earnings of $5.4 billion were up 16%. The operating earnings per share of $0.53 were up 20%. Continuing EPS of
$0.49, which includes the impact of non-operating pension and net earnings per share of $0.41, includes the impact of
discontinued operations, which I'll cover on the next page.
As Jeff said, total year CFOA was $14.3 billion. When you add back the $3.2 billion of NBCU tax impact, you get to
$17.5 billion. We had solid Industrial performance here with the variance of 2012 driven by the NBCU related taxes as
I mentioned. We received $2 billion of dividends from GE Capital in the quarter.
The GE tax rate for the quarter was 19%, which was in line with the framework we provided earlier in the year, and the
total year rate was also 19%. The GE Capital tax rate was significantly negative in the fourth quarter, primarily driven
by the tax efficient sale of our Swiss platform, which resulted in about $1 billion of tax benefits in the quarter. This
drove a negative 77% tax rate in the quarter, and for the year GE Capital's tax rate was a negative 14%.
On the right side, you can see the segment results, with total Industrial segment profit up 12% and six of seven
businesses contributing to our earnings growth. GE Capital earnings also grew in the quarter, up 38%.
Now I'll take you through the dynamics of each of the segments on the following pages, but overall a reasonably strong
quarter. On the other items page, first we had $0.03 of gains related to Industrial transactions. We disposed of Air

Filtration within our Power & Water business, the Vital Signs business within Healthcare, and Advanced Sensors
business within Oil & Gas. All three of these gains were booked in Corporate.
We had $0.05 of charges in the quarter related to restructuring and other items. This was about $0.02 higher than we
had planned, as we continue to invest in restructuring to right-size the Industrial cost structure and position the
company for 2014 and beyond.
In discontinued operations, we had $787 million after-tax impact in the quarter, really driven by four items. First, we
booked $442 million of additional reserves on Grey Zone. While we saw claims decline in the third quarter, claims in
the fourth quarter were above our model expectations. So we revised our assumptions to reflect a further slowing in
overall claims reduction rate. We ended the quarter with $859 million in reserves.
On WMC, pending claims declined from $6.3 billion in the third quarter to $5.6 billion at the end of the year, as the
team settled about $1 billion of pending claims. That was partially offset by new pending claims of $281 million. We
recorded a $116 million charge, resulting in a total reserve balance at the end of the year of $800 million, and that's flat
with where we ended the third quarter.
Also in the quarter, we signed an agreement to sell our consumer bank in Russia, resulting in a $170 million loss in
discontinued ops that are principally FX related. And we expect to complete the transaction in the first quarter, and this
will lower our ENI [Ending Net Investment] by almost $1 billion. Lastly, we had a disc-op tax adjustment related to
Plastics of $65 million on the disallowment of interest deductions from years previous.
So on an operating basis, we had $0.02 higher Industrial restructuring versus gains, which is about $300 million on a
pre-tax basis. It is the main driver of our higher corporate expense in the quarter.
Now I'll go through each of the segments, starting with Power & Water. Orders of $10.3 billion were up 44%, our
largest orders quarter in the last five years. Excluding Europe, orders were actually up 56%. Equipment orders of $6.4
billion were up 81%, driven by Thermal & Wind. Thermal orders were up three times, driven by the Algerian deal and
strength in Saudi and Latin America. Excluding Algeria, Thermal orders were still up over 100%. We had orders for 65
gas turbines in the fourth quarter versus 26 last year, and that brought the total year to 124 units on order. Backlog for
Thermal was up 70% for the year.
Wind orders were up 63%. We had orders for 779 wind turbines versus 412 in the fourth quarter 2012, principally
driven by U.S. demand, and Wind backlog was up 43% for the year.
Service orders of $3.9 billion were up 8%, primarily driven by PGS up 9% and up 16% ex-Europe. And we were very
strong in AGPs. We did 25 AGPs in the quarter versus six in the previous year. Total orders pricing was lower, as Jeff
said, at 3%, with Thermal down 4% and Wind down 5%.
Revenue in the quarter was $7.7 billion. That was flat with last year. Thermal revenue was down 11%, as we shipped
28 gas turbines versus 32 in the fourth quarter 2012. That was partly offset by Wind, up 6%, with shipment of 875
turbines versus 722 a year ago.
We recognized revenue on 200 fewer wind turbines than we planned, primarily due to a supply chain quality issue and
project delays and customer delays. The impact on the quarter was approximately $500 million of revenue and
including the reserves for the quality issues, about $100 million of margin.
As we worked through the quarter here, we had some blade issues in November, and the team was all over it. We spent
an enormous amount of time within the supply chain understanding the blade issue. We spent most of December
understanding what the fleet impact would be and what the manufacturing anomaly it was associated with, and it was
really not until around Christmastime that we realized that we probably weren't going to rev-rec a lot of these turbines
that potentially could have an issue with the blade.
Service revenues of $3.8 billion were up 3%, up 8% ex-Europe.

On segment profit, $1.9 billion was up 9%, driven primarily by value gap. The Power & Water team has also done an
exceptional job on costs, with SG&A in the quarter down 18% and down 13% for the year. Margins improved 190
basis points year over year in the fourth quarter.
Overall, based on 2013 orders, we're seeing a gradual improvement in heavy-duty gas turbine, and Wind will also have
a stronger year in 2014. With these higher deliveries coupled with simplification benefits, we expect Power & Water to
grow earnings in 2014. Based on our backlog, we do expect deliveries to ramp through the year similar to 2013.
Additionally, we're continuing to work through the blade supply issues in Wind. And it could have a minor impact on
the first quarter, but it no way changes our outlook for 2014 for the business or the Wind business.
Next is Oil & Gas. Orders of $5.5 billion were down 2%, with equipment orders down 8%. Subsea orders were down
10% and Drilling & Surface was down 20% on tough comparisons to last year. That was partly offset by M&C, up 8%.
For the year, equipment orders were up 12% and backlog grew 27%.
Service orders were up 6%, led by global service up 8%, partially offset by M&C down 3%. Service backlog grew 27%
in services as well. Orders pricing was strong in the quarter, up 1.8%. Operation of the business had a solid quarter.
Revenue of $5.3 billion was up 17%. That's up 9% ex-acquisitions. Equipment revenues of $2.8 billion were higher by
16%, driven by strong execution in Subsea up 70%, Drilling & Surface up 20%, partly offset by M&C down 18% on
continued market softness. Service revenues of $2.5 billion were up 17%, with strength in global services up 9%,
Drilling & Surface up 20%, and Subsea up 45%.
Segment profit grew 24% to $800 million, up 18% ex-acquisitions, driven by strong value gap and higher volume.
Margins were up 80 basis points year over year, and they were up 120 basis points year over year excluding
acquisitions.
Next I'll walk through Aviation and Healthcare. Aviation orders of $7 billion were down 5%, driven by equipment
orders down 15%. Commercial engine orders were $3.2 billion, down 12%, primarily driven by the huge ramp of CFM
LEAP orders starting in the fourth quarter of 2012. CFM orders were down 23% in the quarter to $1.5 billion. GEnx
orders of $1 billion were up 21%, and GE90 orders were up 43% in the quarter. Commercial engines backlog grew
28% to $21.6 billion, despite not yet booking the vast majority of the $23 billion-plus of engine commitments from the
Dubai Air Show. Military engine orders were down 43%, as we expected. So as we look ahead into 2014 for the
military business, we're expecting profits to be down mid-single digits year-over-year.
Service orders of $3 billion were up 11%, driven by commercial spares, up 16% to $26 million a day. Military service
orders were down 3%, driven by sequestration and lower flying hours, which are down 15% to 20% over the last 12
months. Service backlog ended the year at $97 billion, 22% higher than year-end 2012. Orders pricing was strong, with
positive 1.8%.
Revenue in the quarter of $6.2 billion was up 13%, up 7% ex-Avio. The commercial equipment revenue was 17%
higher, with 627 unit deliveries versus 589 in 4Q of 2012 and a greater mix of higher value GEnx and GE90 engines.
We shipped 80 GEnx engines in the quarter. The military revenues were up 16% on lower units, 239 versus 258, but
the value was higher, driven by favorable mix of tankers and fighter engines.
Service revenues were up 10%, driven by strong spares revenue, up 17% to $26.4 million a day. And military service
was down 17%, driven in part by sequestration and the lower flying hours, in addition to the wind down of some
upgrade programs.
Operating profit of $1.25 billion was up 20%, up 13% ex Avio, on strong volume and value gap. Margin rates
improved 130 basis points, 100 basis points ex Avio. Strong cost productivity more than offset GEnx mix and higher
R&D spend, and also if you exclude the Duarte disposition from the fourth quarter of 2012, margins would have been
up 310 basis points in the quarter; so overall, a very strong quarter and a strong year for the Aviation team.
Healthcare orders of $5.4 billion were up 1%, driven by emerging markets up 4%, with Latin America up 15% and
China up 8%, partially offset by Russia, down 19%. From a developed markets perspective, the U.S. was flat, Europe
was up 2%, Japan was down 10%, but actually up 11% excluding the impact of FX.

Equipment orders of $3.4 billion were down 1%. CT was down 16%, MR was up 1%, Ultrasound was down 2%, and
Molecular Imaging was up 6%. Service orders of $2.1 billion were up 3%, driven by healthcare IT, up 6%. Healthcare
IT growth has picked up as new product launches are gaining traction. And as Jeff said at the December outlook
meeting, we expect healthcare IT to be up 10% organically in 2014. Revenue of $5.1 billion was down 1%. That's flat
excluding the effects of FX. And fourth quarter profit of $1.1 billion was up 4%, as the benefits of simplification more
than offset the impact of lower price and foreign exchange.
SG&A was down 13% in the quarter and down 6% for the year. Margin rates were up 110 basis points. Excluding the
impact of the Thomas Medical disposition in the fourth quarter of 2012, our profit would have been up 13% with
margins expanding 230 basis points.
Next I'll cover Transportation. Orders of $1.2 billion were down 9%. Equipment orders were down 2% and we had
orders for 149 locos versus 88 in the fourth quarter of 2012. But mining orders continue to be soft, down 60%. Service
orders were down 15%, driven by flat service contracts, but offset by fewer modifications and weak demand for mining
parts.
Revenues of $1.5 billion were up 7% year-over-year. Strong equipment growth of 22% was offset by service revenue
down 8%, again driven by soft mining parts. Locomotive shipments were higher with fourth quarter deliveries of 171
units compared with 117 a year ago.
Operating profit of $280 million was up 11% with margins better by 70 basis points. And the improvement was
principally driven by positive value gap. In 2013, Transportation executed well in a difficult environment, expanding
margins 140 basis points. Looking into 2014, we expect a continuing soft mining industry with OHV shipments down
50% for the year. And the first quarter will be weaker than that, probably down closer to 80%. We expect a slow
recovery for North American coal offset somewhat by strong international pipeline for locos.
Energy Management , performance in our Energy Management business has been disappointing this year. Although
results were modestly better sequentially, they were still well below the business' potential. Orders continue to be a
good story, up 6% in the quarter to $2.3 billion, a record for the business. This was driven by Power Conversion, up
18% on strong renewables industry volume, offset partially by Industrial Solutions, down 6%.
2013 backlog was up 20%, with every single platform in the business being higher. Revenues were up 4%, principally
driven by Industrial Solutions and Intelligent Platforms. Operating profit of $46 million was down 28%, driven by
Power Conversion. This business has continued to deal with backlog conversion challenges and higher start-up costs as
they began production of our new marine platform. Over the last few years, the marine business has more than doubled
its backlog and total power conversion has grown backlog by 35%. We expect to see steady progress in power
conversion throughout 2014 as their volume ramps and they focus on converting this backlog.
Despite the poor performance in Energy Management this quarter, we do think we are making progress in our
restructuring efforts and our execution issues. For instance, our Industrial Solutions business that we started
restructuring two years ago was up 71% in op profit in the quarter. It was up 38% for the year on op profit, on almost
flat volume; so more work to do here, but also some good execution within our Industrial Solutions business.
Appliances & Lighting had a good quarter, primarily driven by Appliances. Overall, the appliance domestic industry
was up 10% on units, with strength in both retail, up 10%, and contract, up 12%. Housing starts continue to be positive.
They were up 16%, with single family better by 13% and multifamily up 22%. Revenues of $2.2 billion were higher by
6% led by a 9% increase in Appliances. Lighting revenues were up 1% with strong global LED sales, which were up
50% offset by continued decline in our incandescent product lines.
Segment profit of $142 million was up 23%. Appliances op profit was up 51% driven by positive value gap and
productivity and Lighting op profit was higher by 5%. Margins improved 90 basis points in the quarter for the segment.
Next I'm going to go through GE Capital. Before I go through the standard operating page, I thought I'd take you
through a layout of some of the major items in the quarter, similar to the way Keith did it in the November meeting. So
if you start on the left here, GE Capital earned $2.5 billion, up 38% from a year ago. On the right side, you can see we

had $1.6 billion of tax benefits and gains from the Switzerland and the BAY transactions as we discussed. We sold
68.5% share in the Swiss consumer bank via an IPO, resulting in $1.2 billion of tax benefits and gains. In addition, we
completed the sale of our remaining stake in BAY Bank, resulting in a $400 million gain.
As the team continues to reposition the portfolio, we did have $1 billion of charges related to dispositions and
restructuring of non-core consumer and real estate assets as well as impairments in CLL and GECAS. And I'll cover
some of the principal drivers here.
In the Consumer segment, we exited $700 million of mortgage assets in the Netherlands at a loss of $75 million. And
we recorded an impairment charge of $90 million on an investment in a Taiwanese bank that positions us to exit that
non-core asset in 2014.
In Real Estate, we had a $75 million charge related to the sell down of the equity book in our Swedish portfolio. In
CLL, we recorded an after-tax impairment of $290 million related to two specific investments as well as a small
write-down in our corporate asset book.
And in GECAS, we recorded impairments of $270 million, primarily related to certain older aircraft types that are more
susceptible to changes in technology and operator preferences, which reduces our exposure to these less desirable
assets and creates additional portfolio flexibility. And I'll cover more of these items as I go through each of the
segments on the following page.
Finally, we had adjustments to reserving models, primarily in North American Retail Finance and Consumer
International, resulting in $200 million in higher after-tax credit costs in the quarter. In Retail, we increased our loss
reserve coverage from 12 months to 12.5 months of forecasted charge-offs. And after adjusting for all these items, GE
Capital's net income in the quarter was $2.1 billion.
Now to cover operations in the segments, revenue of $11.1 billion was down 5%, with assets down 4% or $22 billion
year-over-year. Net income of $2.5 billion was up 38% from prior year as the tax benefits and gains, as I mentioned,
from the Swiss and BAY transactions, more than offset portfolio actions, higher losses and impairments, and lower
assets.
We ended the quarter with $380 billion of ENI. That's down $36 billion or 9% from last year, and down $3 billion
sequentially. Non-core ENI was down 22% to $53 billion. Net interest margins in the quarter increased 16 basis points
to 5% and flat with the third quarter. Volume was up 5% in the quarter with new business ROIs over 2% as we
continue to stay disciplined on pricing and risk hurdles.
Tier 1 common on a Basel I basis improved by 10 basis points sequentially and 120 basis points year-over-year to
11.4%, driven by the reduction in assets and after paying $2 billion of dividends in the quarter. For total year 2013, GE
Capital paid $6 billion in dividends at the Parent and will pay an additional $130 million in the first quarter to reflect
the higher fourth quarter earnings.
On the right side of the page, asset quality trends continue to be strong, with delinquency rates improving across the
portfolio. We ended the quarter with $29 billion of commercial paper, ahead of our plans, and liquidity was very
strong, ending the quarter at $75 billion.
Now I'll walk through each of the segments. The Commercial Lending and Leasing business ended the fourth quarter
with $174 billion of assets, that's down 4% from last year including a reduction in non-core assets of $3 billion.
On-book core volume was $13 billion, down 8%, due to the elevated level of customer activity we saw last year from
the U.S. fiscal cliff concerns. But we did see strong volume growth in the U.S. direct mid-market businesses, which
were up 32% in the quarter versus 2012. Overall, new business returns remained attractive at about 2% ROIs, despite
continued excess liquidity. These are positive growth indicators as we think about our core CLL business going into
next year.
Earnings of $263 million were down 52%, driven by lower assets and impairments. After adjusting for impairments
that I covered on the prior page, earnings would have been up 1% with assets down 4%. Asset quality was stable in the
portfolio. In 2013, the CLL business earned $2 billion and going into 2014, we expect it to be up double-digits.

The Consumer segment ended the quarter with $132 billion of assets. That's down 4% from last year. The Swiss and
BAY deals we exited reduced assets by $5 billion. Net income of $2.1 billion was up almost three times, again driven
by these two transactions, partially offset by higher credit costs and charges related to the portfolio actions that I talked
about on the prior page.
North American Retail Finance earned $466 million in the fourth quarter that's down 2% as higher core net income was
offset by reserve adjustments and continued marketing investments. Asset growth in the business was strong at 10%
driven by volume up 11%. Overall, consumer asset quality remained stable.
And Real Estate had another decent quarter. Assets ended the quarter at $39 billion. That's down 16%, down $1 billion
sequentially. The equity book is down 32% from a year ago to $14 billion. Net income of $128 million was down 59%
versus 2012, but in line with where we expected them to be. That was driven by non-repeat of last year's gain from the
sale of our business properties portfolio of about $82 million and our Sweden equity sell-down at about $75 million.
In the quarter we sold 341 properties with a book value of about $2.4 billion for $145 million in gains. The debt
business earned over $100 million in the quarter and originated $4.7 billion of volume at attractive returns including the
purchase of a $1.8 billion UK portfolio from Deutsche Postbank.
Asset quality continues to improve, with 30-day delinquencies at 124 basis points. And that's the lowest level we've
seen since the crisis. The Real Estate team earned $1.7 billion in 2013 and continues to execute well as they shrink the
equity book and invest in a profitable debt business. In 2014, we expect the business to have lower earnings, as we've
shared with you, with the debt business performing well, offset by lower gains and tax benefits.
Within the verticals, GECAS earned $71 million. That's down 79%, driven by impairments of $270 million, which
were up roughly $230 million from prior year. As I mentioned on the prior page, we revised our expectations for
certain older aircraft types in our portfolio. We lowered our estimate of future cash flows on these aircraft to reflect a
shorter useful life and lower residual values.
As a result, we had impairments related to old and narrow bodies of about $130 million, cargo aircraft of $50 million,
and $32 million on 50-seat regional jets. The average age of the aircraft we impaired in the quarter was 15 years
compared to our fleet average of about seven years. GECAS did end the quarter with zero delinquencies and no aircraft
on the ground. For the total year 2013, GECAS earned $900 million, and in 2014 we expect them to be up
double-digits.
EFS earnings were up 9% in the quarter to $117 million, driven largely by lower margin impairments year-over-year.
We had several large items in the quarter. As we continue to reposition the portfolio, the Capital team continues to
execute well and deliver strong operating results. In 2013, the business earned $8.3 billion, up 12%, on $36 billion
lower ENI.
Capital, liquidity and funding are all very strong and we continue to be disciplined around the volume that we're
originating. In 2014, we expect GE Capital to earn roughly $7 billion on core growth offset by lower gains, tax
benefits, and the impact of our anticipated Retail Finance IPO.
So with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Great, Jeff. Thanks. Again, just to recap on 2013, we had a good year in 2013. Industrially, our segment profits grew by
12% in the second half and then we had five of seven segments that had strong growth for the year. We grew margins
by 66 basis points organically, close to our 70 basis point goal.
Organic growth was flat but up 5% ex Power & Water. Capital had a solid year, with earnings up 12% while shrinking
ENI by 9%. And they paid a dividend of $6 billion to the Parent. Per our plan, we returned $18.2 billion of cash to
investors through dividends and buybacks.

So we hit really most of our goals for 2013. And then looking forward, on the 2014 framework, we have no change for
the 2014 operating framework. We expect double-digit industrial earnings growth similar to the second half of 2013.
We expect 4% to 7% organic growth with expanded margins.
GE Capital had about $7 billion of earnings reflecting an improving origination environment, the North American
Retail transaction and lower real estate gains. Corporate should be slightly more positive as we pulled forward
restructuring into 2013. And there's no change in our outlook for cash or revenue.
So we end the year with momentum. I think we presented this framework to you in December, and I would say, based
on the way we closed the year, we're quite confident in this operating framework for 2014. So we feel good about the
momentum of the company.
So Trevor, with that, let's turn it back to you and let's take some questions.
Trevor A. Schauenberg
Thanks, Jeff and Jeff. Frances, let's open up the phone lines for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Early in the call, Jeff, you mentioned having greater confidence in the structural cost-out. Can
you talk about your confidence in value gap? Price looked a little light, particularly in Power & Water. Do you have a
greater confidence in value gap in 2014, or the same, or lower?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: What I would say, Scott, is the value gap was about $900 million in 2013. Our expectation is
that it's not that strong. It's probably more in the couple of hundred million dollar range. When we look at the backlog
and where we've gone from a sourcing standpoint, we feel confident in the value gap still being a tailwind in 2014.
If you just go a layer lower and you look at gas turbine equipment margin, operating profit, it's going to be positive in
2014 versus 2013. That's the one that's probably had the most intense pricing pressure. But we've had a very active plan
to get about 10% of the cost out of our heavy-duty gas turbine product, and that's going to bleed through. So we see
earnings – just to pick the one where we've had the most intense competition, Scott, we see positive earnings growth
year over year 2014 versus 2013 on heavy-duty gas turbine equipment margin – operating profit dollars.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, that's helpful. And then Energy Management continues to be a bit of a tough spot. Where
can that business go? Can it ever be a double-digit margin business? Is this something that – is there an endgame of
some substance? I'm just trying to figure out what we can expect out of these guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Scott, I think it's a very fair question. I think what Jeff said earlier is we're going to do a lot
of restructuring this year. Every time we sit and review the business, we compare it directly with their industrial peers,
all of whom have double-digit operating profit rates. That's our expectation for this business. And investors and me
should expect substantial improvement in 2014 versus 2013.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, good luck. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Thanks. Thanks, Scott.

And the next question will come from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. You may begin.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Good morning.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: You guys in the last several quarters have given the year-over-year change in Services margins. I
didn't see it in the slides. Can you maybe just give us a little extra color on that, year over year?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes, so service margins year over year were up 190 basis points fourth quarter to fourth
quarter. Total year we were up about 90 basis points, full year 2013 versus 2012.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay, and then just a couple of follow-ups. On the Oil & Gas side, what is your visibility on the
orders there? There have just been a lot of moving parts and mix dynamics at your peers and the orders have obviously
run very hot. Everybody is full from a capacity perspective. How do you see the orders in drilling and surface and
subsea playing out over the next year?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Scott (sic) [Steve], there was one big order for these guys that pushed probably into the first
quarter that's big enough to be a meaningful swinger year over year that should lead to a positive first quarter from an
orders standpoint. But to your point, particularly in subsea, we've got a strong backlog, pretty high visibility. And so as
you know, these things are lumpy. So our expectation is that these guys continue to have good solid orders growth next
year, but a push of one big project is meaningful from an orders standpoint.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay, It's Steve by the way.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I'm sorry.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: That's okay. And then just on the Distributed Power, the aeroderiv shipments, I think you had a
target this year for 200-something. What do you expect for next year and where did you finish this year on the
aeroderivs?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes, so on aeroderivatives next year, we're going to be more or less in the range of this
year. We expect to see potentially a little bit of growth, but it's not going to be enormous growth. We had a big year this
year on aeroderivatives, particularly trailer-mounted. So we're hoping for a small amount of growth, but it's not going
to be enormous.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: We had a boomer this year, Steve, and I think next year we're kind of in the flattish range.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay, thanks. And I don't want to get all choked up, but I want to say thanks to Trevor for all the
years of help and best of luck in his – I'm choking back the tears here; best of luck in his new role.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Steve, that is huge of you.
<A - Trevor A. Schauenberg>: I'll miss you too, Steve.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Maybe there's an upgrade there.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: I'm not sure about that, but we'll talk after. Thanks.

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Hi, how are you? As we look at the composition of the margins on slide six, various puts and
takes, what is the big drag in 2014 versus 66 basis points that we did in 2013, just thinking about it?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: So, Andrew, why don't I start and then I'll turn it over to Jeff. I think the way we've tried to
build 2014 is to drive the things we can really control in the environment. So we're going to have another year that's
going to be very aggressive on the structural cost-out. And you guys saw us do well this year. We're going to have
another year of real focus there. We're going to have a positive value gap, not as strong as we had this year, but still
positive, and I think that's realistic. So I think simplification is in our control. Value gap, we've got pretty good
visibility. That's going to be positive. I think R&D, we were able to do a little bit more R&D this year. I think that
creates a little bit more headroom for us to make sure that R&D is a positive next year for us.
And then the toughest thing always to call here, Andrew, is mix, in terms of where – so what we've tried to do is create
a buffer with the things we can control to be able to better balance the mix impact as we go through the year. So we're
not taking our focus off anything. If anything, our structural cost is going to be aggressive. Our restructuring is going to
be aggressive. And what we've tried to do is create a little bit of buffer vis-à-vis how mix shakes out in the year.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Andrew, I would just add on mix, we think Equipment is going to be ahead of Service
next year. We've got a real ramp in GEnx, we've got a real ramp in Wind. And that's most of what that mix is driving.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Got you, that's helpful. And just maybe I missed it, but could you just comment on the order
patterns in December, any big positive or negative surprises versus your expectations other than what happened in
Wind, obviously?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I don't know. Jeff, I think Power & Water was a little bit stronger than – I'm talking on
orders now standpoint, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yes, that's fine.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think Power & Water we expected a strong fourth quarter, but it was probably even a little
bit stronger than what we thought. I think Oil & Gas, like I said, tends to be a little bit lumpy. Aviation, we've got such
a big backlog in Aviation. I would say the spares number and the service orders are what we watch closely in Aviation.
I think those were positive. Healthcare, really no difference in terms of what we thought we were going to see. And I'd
say in Transportation, we just saw weakness around mining, and we expect that to play over into next year. And then
the one thing that was really very late-breaking, and I don't know, Jeff...
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes, I think, Andrew, we had one big Oil & Gas project in Southeast Asia, almost $700
million, that we were reasonably confident was going to land in the quarter that actually pushed to the first half of next
year. Other than that, not a lot of major surprise. As Jeff said, Parts and Aviation were strong. We expected them to be
strong. We knew Aviation year over year, based on the CFM launch in the fourth quarter last year, was going to show a
little weaker. So I think most everything else was more or less as expected, I think.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: And Wind was really not an orders issue.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: No, we had good Wind orders.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Thank you very much, Trevor, and thank you for all the help.
<A - Trevor A. Schauenberg>: Good. Thanks, Andrew.

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey. And Trevor, I will just say it at the beginning, thanks for all your hard efforts to this
point and good luck. I would like to push that Oil & Gas question a little further. The majors and Petrobras have all
stopped expanding CapEx. They've got numerous projects that are being deferred, given cost blowouts. And that's
likely leading to a decline in subsea equipment, at least as we see it, as customers digest their prior orders here. And
then we've got nominally high crude prices. But despite that, cost inflation seems to be eroding some of these returns
offshore for these guys. So maybe help us understand this in a little more depth, how you're going to buck some of that
trend, or do you just disagree with my assertions there?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Steve, again, I would say that if you look at most of the big industry contextual comments,
even with some of the, I would say, concern about CapEx costs and things like that, the forecast is for CapEx to be
positive growth in 2014, maybe not as great as it was in years gone by but still pretty great. If you look at the national
oil companies versus the integrated oil companies, our view is that the NOCs really haven't backed off at all, and that's
where we see a ton of activity. I'd say the place that we still think is reasonably weak is maybe around North America,
some of the drilling and surface stuff. We're watching that and then Measurement and Control stuff, we're watching
that.
But the last thing I would say, Steve, when I get up in the morning, around Oil & Gas, if you asked me what I worry
about first, it's shipping our late backlog. In other words, we have such a traffic jam around the volume we've got in our
factories. I'd say we've got extremely good visibility, certainly in the short term. So again, it's something we all watch,
but I think there are always going to be big puts and takes in this business. But I'd leave you the thought of NOCs
versus IOCs, the backlog we have today and getting it executed, and a long-term notion that says if you pick up any of
the big reports that your banks tend to write, they basically say that the long-term health of the industry is still pretty
strong.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, all right. And we're not a bank, but I get it; and that's helpful. Now since you
mentioned what you think about first thing in the morning, the blade issue for Wind; can you identify a little bit more
why we shouldn't have to worry about this happening again from just an operational standpoint?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Maybe I'll start and then pass over to Jeff. I think this is stuff that comes out of the supply
chain. We look at it, we've been looking at it for a period of time. I think our teams really feel like we've got it isolated
and reflected. We've got teams that are good at this stuff, Steve, and I think we know kind of exactly where we are. It
may impact a little bit timing, but it's not – our read is it's not going to impact the year at all from the standpoint of
either Power & Water or kind of the Power & Water segment growth that we've got planned for the year, or the Wind
business revenue growth for the year. So we're good at this stuff, we use an abundance of caution whenever it relates to
our customers and things like that, and I think that's what we've exercised here.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. I think that – yes, go ahead. Sorry, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I was just going to add, Steve, that the population we think we're talking about, it's one
manufacturing batch of blades that we think we've isolated it to when we're doing inspections on non-destructive
testing, et cetera. So the percentage of the fleet we're talking about is very, very small. And so we're just trying to
isolate this down and we wanted to be very careful at year-end about how we dealt with it. And we think we've got our
arms around the issue, and as Jeff said, it will play out here in the first quarter or second quarter of 2014.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. The $1.6 billion provision number in GE Cap was bigger than I expected, trending
from what, $821 million or something last quarter, and then bigger than last year. And it looks like, as you said, the
30-day delinquencies are getting better. So is this all credit model changes and do you expect it to stay elevated? Or
how should we think about modeling this or anticipate it?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well, it might help if I kind of explain how it moved. Year-over-year, Steve, last year we
were at about $1.1 billion, about a $230 million increase in Consumer. Now, almost half that increase is associated with
selling that Dutch mortgage business in the quarter. Part of the economics of the loss in that actually ran through the

provision and then directly to write-offs. So that year-over-year skews half of it. And then I mentioned booking up
coverage in the North American Retail business from 12 to 12.5 months. And then we had a book up on some
restructured consumer accounts in Asia year-over-year. That's the bulk of it. On the Commercial side, we're up $175
million year-over-year in provisions, about half of that in Real Estate and half of that in CLL. And some of that was
specific reserves around a couple of accounts, but some of it was just hitting reserve floors.
So we've said we're not going to go below certain levels of reserve coverage. The portfolio quality of both Real Estate
and CLL would naturally push us below those floors, because things have improved so quickly. And we're kind of
booking back to those floors, which is not going to go through there, and that's resulting in reprovisioning up with not
necessarily direct correlation to what's happening for me from a portfolio and quality perspective. And that's most of
the change year-over-year.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, got it. And before I hand it off, I just might have missed this. Did you guys say
what the equivalent to that 66 basis point number would be in your rough expectations for this year, when you put it all
together?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: No, we didn't say.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Nice try, Steve.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: We've talked about by the end of 2016 being at 17%-plus operating margins and that's
how we're defining success and that's what we're targeting.

Your next question will come from the line of Deane Dray from Citi Research. You may begin.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Deane.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just to follow up on Steve's question on that, the 66 basis
point margin year over year, could you help bridge where you came short on the 70 basis point target? I know that the
blade issue you sized at $100 million on the margin line. But you also included Energy Management as one of the
margin pressures. So if you could just bridge for us those two items.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes, the Wind issue in Power would have been diluted to the rate that they printed in the
quarter, but it would have been accretive to the overall industrial segment. So that's a couple of basis points on the total
year rate. And combined with Energy Management, if they had delivered the framework that we expected them to
deliver on, we would have been above 71 basis points or 72 basis points for the year. So we're counting basis points
here. The difference between 66 basis points and 70 basis points at this level is $40 million of op profit for the year.
Okay. So we're really counting small increments here. But ex those two items, we would have been above 70 basis
points.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Good, that is exactly what I was looking for, and then just a couple of other items. The
Commercial spares being up 16%, that's well above global flying hours. How do you – what do you attribute the upside
to? Is there a restocking going on? Is it easier comp? But that looks above expectations.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: A couple of things. Flying hours are improving pretty dramatically. We've been globally
north of 5% and that has a dramatic impact. You also have a little bit of restocking going on. The orders rate is

And then the fleet has continued to grow, and the fleet is aging, and we're seeing more instances of overhauls. So the
overhaul rate, if you will, on the installed base, is going up. And that's driving demand for spare parts. So I think most
of it – I think it all fits together.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Good, just last question for me. I know you have had uncovered restructuring in the quarter
here. What's the expectation for uncovered restructuring? You said $0.10 for 2014. And then specifically, do you have
a line of sight on uncovered restructuring in the first quarter?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes, so I think what we said was we expected to invest $1 billion to $1.5 billion in 2014.
We did, as Jeff mentioned, we did end up accelerating a little bit of that investment into the fourth quarter largely
because the projects were ready to go and we didn't want to wait to start on execution on those items. Overall, that's
money that would have been spent in 2014 that won't now, but I still think our range is $1 billion to $1.5 billion. I think
there will be other ideas. We talked about doing some restructuring in 2015. So I'm not sure that range is really
changing much. I would expect the benefits, as Jeff said, would be slightly better in 2014 than they otherwise would
have been, because we got a little bit of a head-start.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think that's the way I'd think about it, Deane. We've really fortified the benefits in 2014 and
those should be greater.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: In terms of the timing on the restructuring, earlier is better than later. And I would expect
the bulk of this to happen in the first quarter or certainly the first half of the year.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Great, thank you.

And your next question will come from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. You may begin.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Hey. Good morning, Jeff, and thank you.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: How are you? Good.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Doing great, a couple questions. Just on GECAS, did you change the useful life on 737s at all;
and if not, why not?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Here's what we did, Jeff. We go through this annual review; you're very familiar with it, in
the third quarter. We use third-party data on useful life, residual values, lease rates, et cetera. We always have some
cleanup in the fourth quarter. It usually doesn't amount to much. This year, coming out of the third quarter, the team
took a deeper dive on some of our older aircraft, principally narrow body. We're in a situation now where we've got an
enormous amount of technology being introduced over the next five years to ten years. When you've got this level of
oil and Jet-A price, the differences in efficiency economically are enormous versus what they might have been
historically.
And we just decided on both older, narrow body Boeing and older narrow body Airbus that our views of useful lives
and residual values were less than what third-parties had given us as appraisals in the third quarter. And it gives us
flexibility to deal with these aircraft and we think we're on the right side. We'll be in the market with some of these
aircraft. In 2014, we'll have an idea of just where we are vis-à-vis the portfolio, so.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Yeah. I just understand like you'd obviously mark down the older ones first, but if a 37 used to
have a useful life of 40 years and now you're using 35, I'm just making up numbers, that actually impacts the whole
fleet regardless of how old the aircraft are in the book, right? They always have...

<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, this is very specific to 50-seat regional jets, older – the average age was 15 years to
Airbus A318s, very old 737s, some of the 737s were in cargo format, et cetera, et cetera. So it's very much narrow body
and deep-into-their-lives aircraft. So I don't think there's a broader implication across the fleet. I think we like the fleet
we have. It's got an average age of seven years. It's priced well.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. And just on tax on the GE Capital, do you need to start off the year accruing higher,
because the sub-part assets not yet kind of have been fixed or how do we actually think about that into the new year?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Given our fiscal year ends within GE Capital, et cetera, we're – the impact for us is really
not until the very end of the year. We're good through the end of November. So the rate we accrue through the year will
reflect the fact that we're in good shape relative to AFE through November and we'll assume that in December AFE
may not be there and that's the rate we'll accrue to.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: So for a placeholder then for 2014, what kind of rate should we be using for capital?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So we expect capital to be single-digit tax rate.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right. And then just one other one from me, just kind of back to the margin question and kind
of less the bridge from 66 basis points to 70 basis points, but more kind of the bridge from, at the beginning of the year,
I think you saw a line of sight of something like 120 basis points or 130 basis points, which has given you confidence
in the 70s basis points. Obviously, revenues came in a little lighter. There's a couple of things that are identifiable in
what you've put in front of us. But is there anything else that we should be thinking about there that was a problem in
2013 that doesn't repeat in 2014? And along those lines, can you give us an idea of what kind of hedge is in that kind of
implicit 40 basis points or so that we're looking for, for 2014?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I'd say, Jeff, the one thing I would say is that R&D with the way the funding ran for
Aviation and I would say Oil & Gas, R&D was a little heavier in 2013 than I had expected. And I'm – again, this is in
our control. We're reasonably confident that R&D is going to be tailwind in 2014 versus 2013. So other than that, Jeff, I
think it's all the puts and takes around mix. But I think that's – I think we're pretty confident on that.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And is there a way to frame kind of an internal hedge on 2014?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Probably, again, I think we've got some momentum now, right? So we've got a pretty good
framework, a pretty good flow, and I think that's going to carry us over into 2014.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay, all right, great. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Okay. Thanks, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Yeah.

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Hi, guys.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Hey. Jeff Bornstein, just want to go back to your comments around the fact that you think the
bulk of the kind of range of restructuring, the naked restructuring is first half. Should we just by inference then be
expecting – because GE, obviously, traditionally has – you have your first three quarters and then you have a typically
a pretty big fourth quarter. Should we be expecting then a down EPS first and second quarter or first half versus 2013?

<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: John, we don't give guidance at that level. I think you're correct in assuming that the bulk
of what we will invest in simplification next year will be in the first quarter and first half. But we don't give quarterly
earnings guidance.
<Q - John G. Inch>: I understand that, so I'm not looking for specifics. I'm just more – I'm not off base in my thinking,
am I, or is there something else that we should think about the first half?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I wouldn't read into it so much, John. Again, I don't think there's a specific profile, and we
expect a number of our businesses to be able to come out of the year and perform well in the first quarter.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Listen, I'll give you this much. I think we certainly expect Industrial segment earnings to
grow in the first half. That's about as much as I can give you, but we're not giving quarterly guidance.
<Q - John G. Inch>: No, I understand. That's helpful. I want to ask you about the simplification. So we sold the three
Industrial businesses in the quarter. Jeff Bornstein, as you've gotten into this with your team, how would you frame the
outlook for further cleanup within the Industrial segments? I'm not talking about maybe larger scale portfolio
simplification down the road, more just what have you been uncovering and how best maybe dovetails into some of the
restructuring that you guys have been taking and your outlook there?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: John, I think we'll continue to prune the portfolio where it makes sense. There will be
more transactions in 2014. I don't know that they will be, certainly excluding NBCU, on the same order of magnitude
economically as it was in 2013. But this is an ongoing process and the businesses are going to continue to go through
their portfolio, and we'll continue to clean up where it doesn't make sense. So we're not willing to invest where we don't
see the growth there. So that process will continue as we move through 2014.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Maybe one last one for me, just on back to Oil & Gas on the Surface or the Drilling side, the
land-based side. There's a fairly widely held view that WTI prices or certainly U.S. oil prices could be actually heading
lower. How does GE – one, I'm wondering have you seen any of this say reflected in Lufkin's backlog, your recent
acquisition, just because the prices of the oilfield service companies, the share prices are down? And how do you guys
maybe think about that, because obviously, you're building a long-term business? Does this present opportunities
actually for M&A, if in fact, some of the public company share prices were well off, you could continue to consolidate
some of these properties?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: What I would say, John, when I look globally in the various segments in the Oil & Gas
business, the drilling piece in North America probably has been the weakest as time goes on. And if we see
opportunities to do more work there, we're certainly going to do it, because we think over the long term that's a good
place for us.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yes, perfect. Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Great, John.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Hi, good morning, everyone, so a quick question on organic growth. You're exiting the year
with a good clip at 5%. Orders were up 8% year to date. But if you take a look at your guidance for 2013, it looks like
organic growth ended negative. Your guidance was closer to 2%. So my question is really around, as you look into
2014, what kind of confidence do you have in that 4% to 7% number based on what you already have in backlog? And
what are the puts and takes to those numbers to the high end versus the low end of the range?

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Again, I think when – I don't know, Jeff. You went through the unit shipments year over
year that we basically have in backlog. Joe, if you just look at that big win backlog shipping more heavy-duty gas
turbines, the jet engine backlog, et cetera, et cetera, it takes you to the 4% to 7% range. I don't know, Jeff, do you want
to go through them again?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes, sure. The one thing I'd give thematically here is, we have a couple of unique things to
GE or at least in the same company, which is the GEnx story and the Wind story are fairly unique to GE, and that's a
big part of pushing the range from 4% to 7%. Ex-that, we're somewhere around 3% to 5%, which I don't think is off
color.
I'll give you a sense of where we expect units for 2014. Wind, we think, is going to be about 3,000 units versus 2,100
units in 2013; gas turbines somewhere between 85 and 90 versus 81 in 2013. Locomotives will be between 550 and
600, that will be down slightly. Jet engines will be up, as I just said, around GEnx will be up 2,500 units – up to 2,500
units versus about 2,378 in 2013. And as I mentioned, GEnx would be somewhere between 250 and 300, most of that
growth, versus 180.
Military is going to be a mix as it relates to Aviation. So that gives you a sense of kind of what we're thinking in units. I
did mention earlier in the script that we do have a few areas of softness, Mining being one of them. In our Locomotive
business, Mining is going to be we expect very soft on OHV in 2014.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: And I would say, Joe, on the services side, we ended the year with the best velocity we had
during the year, so that's the other piece of the equation.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay, great. That's really good color. I think one question on the gas turbine pricing
pressure. It just looks like Power & Water pricing has been down now for two quarters in a row. Can you just provide
some color where you're seeing that regionally? So where are you seeing most of the pricing pressure today?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: So the region mix is always a relatively big swing on the gas turbine side, so there are a
couple of big deals in Saudi that have been price-competitive. And it's going to be a competitive market show, I think,
but we're doing a good job on the cost side. And like I said, I think when we look out over 2014 and into the future, we
still see heavy-duty gas turbine equipment operating profit dollar growth in this time period.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Joe, I would just add to that. If you look at quoting activity in the space around gas
turbines, the fourth quarter – definitely the level of activity has picked up. We're up like 96% versus fourth quarter
2012, and 26 more projects quoting real-time in the fourth quarter than a year ago. And the bulk of that strength has
really been in the U.S., surprisingly, and China. So there's a lot of activity here. I don't know that we're necessarily
calling a significant turn on gas turbine, but there's definitely the activity. And you saw the order performance was 65
units in the quarter, 124 for the year, and there's quoting activity where we're hopeful.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay, great, and then just one last question. You quantified the impact from the blade issue
at $100 million for this quarter. Have you quantified the potential impact on the margins for 2014?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I think what we said was, we are not anticipating this being an issue for our framework for
the entirety of 2014.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay, great. Thank you very much for taking my questions.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Thanks, Joe.

<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Hey, good morning; first a clarification, then a question in response to John Inch's
question or the answer to it, where you expect Industrial earnings to grow in the first half. Was that at the segment level
or post the eliminations line, that comment?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: No, I was talking about segment earnings.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Okay, great. And then just looking back at how 2013 transpired, operating profit at the
Industrial segment level was up a little over $700 million, but we have the $900 million value gap and the significant
cost-out. So I'm just wondering what pieces plug that difference.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: If you go back to the value walk – the op margin walk that Jeff did for the total year, we
spent a bit more in R&D, which partially offset that, and then base inflation, foreign exchange, and other items. We had
volume down somewhat. And we didn't repeat the two deals, the two big deals I talked about in the fourth quarter year
over year, the Duarte deal in Aviation the Thomas deal in Medical, which on a year-over-year walk are material
differences. But we feel great about what the team is delivering around simplification and SG&A cost-out. Value gap is
real positive. We expect it to be positive again. Not at the same levels, but we expect it to contribute to margins in
2014.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Okay, thanks. That helps.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Thanks, Chris.

And your next question will come from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura. You may begin.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys. Hey, so real estate, the non-earnings jumped up like 6x this
quarter. Can you talk about what's going on there and where are we in terms of unrealized loss and what it means for
the equity book in 2014?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, so we had a – we're executing a re-class in the quarter between our non-earnings
calculation and the traditional industry calculation of non-accrual. And so there's – it's really just that. When you go
through the supplemental, there's a really detailed note that walks exactly on what the trade off is between cash basis
and cost recovery of assets deemed non-accrual and within non-accrual, non-earning.
And so you have a bump up in non-earning, you have a big bump down in non-accrual roughly $3 billion and it walks
you through the pieces of it. There's no change whatsoever in terms of portfolio quality. It's just how we're
characterizing between non-earning and non-accrual and that's just to get us closer to an industry basis.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Second is on the real estate, I think we ended the year at roughly about $2.1 billion
embedded loss, which is basically flat year-over-year. The biggest change year-over-year is we're I think $1.1 billion
roughly at the end of 2013 is the 30 Rock transaction we did in the first quarter of 2013, which was more than $1
billion pre-tax bumped that up a little bit.
Now having said that, we sold things throughout the year as both in gains and losses, et cetera, and we kind of find
ourselves back in $2 billion. But I think we feel great about where we are in that $14 billion portfolio and we'll
continue to liquidate it down, and so far, anyway, we've outperformed the embedded loss numbers we've been sharing
with you for the last five years.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay, thanks. That helps. And then on pension, where are you going to end up for 2014
in terms of operating and non-operating pension and funded status?

Page 19 of 20
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes, so we ended 2013 at about 91% on the funded status. The deficit in the principal
pension plan was down just under $9 billion year-over-year, driven by portfolio performance were up 14.3% in terms
of the earnings on pension assets and the discount rate was up to 485 basis points. So that took the deficit down fairly
substantially.
In terms of pension next year, we expect pension in total, as I've shared with you guys, to be down roughly $900
million next year. Most of that will be – or a significant percentage of that will be in non-op pension. The operating
pension benefit will be something south of $400 million, but about in that range. We need to kind of finalize exactly
where all these year-end ending points are going to – how are they going to play out in pension expense, but – so we
expect to be down about $900 million in total and with a little less than 50% of that being – 40% of that being
associated with operating pension.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay, thanks a lot. It's helpful.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Thanks, Shannon.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think we have one more, Frances.
Operator
Yes. The last question we have will come from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. You may begin.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Julian.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hey. Good morning. Yes, I had one question on – in Oil & Gas again. Measurement and
Control, I think, was the one piece of that, that you had high hopes for a year ago. It fell short of those and it sounded
like you thought it would come back in 2014 and now it sounds like you're a bit more circumspect. So maybe if you
could talk a little bit about Measurement and Control; what are your current expectations there for this year?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Julian, I think we're expecting flattish, maybe up marginally, but nothing really substantial.
But I think we showed you guys at the Outlooks Meeting that we still expect strong top-line and bottom-line growth in
Oil & Gas and that's reflective of Measurement and Control in the flattish range, so that's kind of where we are. I think
it's pretty consistent with what other people in the industry say as well.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Okay, got it. But you don't anticipate a large wave of kind of downstream projects in the
U.S. that push up orders there any time soon?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Look, we're hopeful, but that's not the base plan. The base plan is, I would say, kind of liked
it at the bottom and that we'll see flattish kind of growth in 2014 and we're taking costs out and stuff like that.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Got it. And then just within Healthcare, most industrial markets and emerging markets
have slowed. Over the last two years, Healthcare has been an exception. I guess your Q4 emerging markets growth
numbers were not great, or certainly were lower than what you've seen in the last 12 months. Is that anything you think
to be concerned about in terms of is that maybe reflecting a lag versus broader economic slowdowns, or do you think
it's a blip and healthcare and emerging markets should remain where they are right now?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Julian, there's one – we had a real strong fourth quarter in Russia last year and it was down
substantially this year, and net of that, the Healthcare growth markets were still pretty good. China was a little bit
slower, but not concerning and the other growth markets were pretty good.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Okay, thanks.
