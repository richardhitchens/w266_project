As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our
financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP
financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which
is posted on our IR website you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including
reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of
2012.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow
increased 41% to $4.53 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 76% to $265 million. Trailing 12-month
capital expenditures were $4.27 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased
corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle,
Washington, which we purchased in the fourth quarter of 2012.
The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consistent
of investment in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our
fulfillment operations.
Return on invested capital was 2%, down from 11%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets
minus current facilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of
common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 474 million shares compared with 468 million shares.
Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $15.7 billion or 25% excluding the $392 million unfavorable impact from
year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rate. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our
low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $4.4 billion, up 7% or 11% excluding foreign
exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.42 billion, up 28% or 30% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM
increased to 66% of worldwide sales, up from 64%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 29%. Active customer accounts
exceeded 215 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid
units.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $11.21 billion or 71.4% of
revenue compared with 73.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $4.09 billion, or 26%
of sales, up approximately 275 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.76 billion or 11.2% of revenue
compared with 10.1%. Tech and content was $1.43 billion or 9.1% of revenue compared with 7.6%. Marketing was
$651 million or 4.1% of revenue consistent with the prior period.
Now I'll talk about our segment results in consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based
compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 30% to $9.49 billion.
Media revenue grew 16% to $2.17 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $6.48 billion representing 68% of North
America revenues, up from 67%. North America segment operating income increased 19% to $409 million, a 4.3%
operating margin.
In the international segment revenue grew 13% to $6.21 billion. Adjusting for the $391 million year-over-year
unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 20%. Media revenue decreased 1% to $2.22 billion or grew
7% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 22% to $3.94 billion or 29% excluding foreign exchange.
EGM now represents 63% of international revenues up from 59%. International segment operating income was zero
down from $16 million in the prior year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange international
segment operating income increased 11%.

CSOI increased 14% to $409 million or 2.6% of revenue, down approximately 20 basis points year-over-year.
Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange CSOI increased 19%. Unlike CSOI our GAAP operating
income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased
26% to $79 million or 0.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $13 million. GAAP net loss was $7 million or
$0.02 per diluted share, compared with net income of $7 million and $0.01 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.49 billion year-over-year to $7.46 billion.
Inventory increased 24% to $5.42 billion and inventory turns were 9.4 turns, down from 10.1 turns a year ago as we
expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 27%
to $8.99 billion and accounts payable days increased to 73 from 68 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've
seen today in what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently
unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding
exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict
demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign
currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can
all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business
acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation
estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q3, 2013 we expect net sales of between $15.45 billion and $17.15 billion, a growth between 12% and 24%. This
guidance anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP
operating loss to be between $440 million and $65 million compared to $28 million in third quarter 2012. This includes
approximately $340 million of stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate
consolidated segment operating income or loss which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense
to be between a $100 million loss and $275 million in the income, compared to $232 million of income in third quarter
2012. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and
convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks, and with that, Sean, let's go into questions.
Sean Boyle
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how
to initiate a question.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Thanks, guys. Just had one question on shipping. It looks like the unit efficiency in shipping
continues to improve. What are you guys doing to drive the cost of shipping each unit lower and are there more costs
that can be taken out on a per-unit basis? And as you start looking at same-day delivery in some of these markets,
including new grocery program, what incremental costs you see around doing same-day fulfillment? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the economics, we have a great team – operations team that's working on how
do we serve customers reliably and faster. And so certainly that's reflected in our transportation cost. Also from a
productivity standpoint, which is as we add capacity, we're just getting closer and closer to customers with larger

selection which certainly help from a productivity standpoint. So those are some of the dynamics that you need think
about, when you think about our transportation costs and the team's done a great job over the years of becoming even
more reliable and faster and more productive and again they'll be working on ways to make that even better over time.
Operator
And we'll move to Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more just on
the profitability of the grocery business and how you'll know when it's the right time to expand to more markets beyond
Seattle and L.A.? And then also if you could comment on the European macro environment just given the growth that
you saw in the international business just decelerating a little bit from last quarter? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the Fresh business, we started doing a pilot several years ago in Seattle. We did
a number of – the team's done a great job inventing on behalf of customers. It's a very good customer experience. The
challenge that we've had over the past several years is how to make it economically viable. So the team's done a lot of
different experiments and invented well on behalf of customers to see what works. And we took a lot of that
knowledge, which enabled us to launch Fresh in L.A. and it's very early there. We're still in the trial period. It's a good
customer experience and we like what we see so far, but it's very, very early. And so it's something that we'll continue
to work on and both from a customer experience and from an economic standpoint. And there's not much more I can
add to that right now. So you have to stay tuned and see where that ends up.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Miller from William Blair.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Hi. Good afternoon. Could you help us understand the third-party unit growth? I think this is
the first quarter in about three years that third-party unit penetration hasn't increased. And then additionally I'm
wondering if you could comment at all on potential to expand Prime membership options, potentially to something like
a Super Prime offering for expanded video content and fulfillment options?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the third-party unit growth, it was 40% this quarter, which compares to 40%
last year in Q2. So again it is flat as a percentage of total units. One thing to keep in mind though is our digital units are
growing at a faster rate than physical and those digital units are primarily first party units. So if you take out digital
units out in both periods, we're actually up approximately 300 basis points. So our physical seller businesses is growing
very nicely. It's growing at a faster rate than retail and it's doing very well. And so very pleased to see that.
Operator
And we'll move now to Brian Pitz from Jefferies.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Great. Thanks. Quick question on fulfillment centers. Any color on your current plan for the year
in terms of locations, U.S. versus international, timing, et cetera? And then separately any comments on the weaker
growth in international media? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of FCs, we've announced to date five net new facilities in the U.S. We've also
announced some in international. It's still early. As we did in prior – the last few years, we gave you updates as we
went along and so we can update you a little bit later in the year to see how that progresses. But we certainly are adding
the capacity and that's reflected in the guidance that you see in Q3 as we get ready for Q4 of seasonal quarter.
In terms of growth in international media, what you're seeing there is on a local currency growth basis you see the 7%
growth. That's consistent what you've seen in the last couple quarters. We're at the very early stages. We're excited

about we're seeing so far in digital, but we're in that early stage of transformation from digital – from physical to digital
within international. And so you see from the release that we've launched a lot of new things related to digital over the
past 90 days and even prior to that. So we're very excited about those launches and excited about the transformation.
We're also excited if you look at our total international business we've got a lot of opportunities to invest in. I talked
about the conversion from physical to digital. We also have selection still to add within existing categories – new
categories, new geographies. So we're very excited about the opportunity that we have there.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Thank you.
Operator
And now we'll go to Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Hi. Thanks. I guess the international topic again, but it's been asked a few times so maybe
specifically in China, Tom, in terms of what the company hypothesis is in terms of the way that market plays out over
time and how you think about investment spend in that market? And then secondly as it relates to AWS it's nice – the
annual event and the quarterly events that happened. I was wondering when you think it makes sense to start talking
more about it in releases and on calls? Is it just the 10% revenue threshold or something else that would lead to more
discussions on that on calls like this? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of China, we are investing heavily in China and we have been for some number of
years. We have a good customer experience there. We continue to look at ways to make that even better. We're adding
selection across many categories right now. It's in a very interesting geography and so we'll continue to work on that
experience for customers. You should expect us to be in investment mode for some time and – but it's a very sizable
segment a very interesting long-term growth opportunity and will continue to work on making that better for customers
and for investors over time.
In terms of AWS the business is growing very, very strongly. We've got a great team that's innovating on behalf of
customers, launching new services, becoming more productive, which allows us to be able to lower prices. We've had
many price reductions since we started with AWS, and we share that very visibly. And so we're very excited about that
business and even though we were off to a very good start. It's a very big opportunity and we continue to invest in that
business and we're very excited to do it. We think it's a great long-term opportunity and we have great team that
working on it.
Operator
Thanks. Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Great. Thanks. Tom, just one question related to consumer packaged goods. Any comments
there and whether you're seeing broader purchases by the Amazon customers of more traditional consumer staples than
you've seen in the past and is that something that you're trying to promote? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yes. Just to make sure have your question, we're seeing, when you look at our – for
example our North America growth, particularly EGM, we're seeing very good growth across many different
categories, but a few call outs: we are seeing very good growth in apparel specifically and also consumables. And so
the team's done a very nice job, both teams have done a very nice job from a customer experience standpoint and
they're growing very nicely and that is something that we're seeing and it does help with frequency to the site as well.

<Q - Mark A. May>: Thanks for taking my question. Another one on international and the media segment there. I
believe that you now have a more comprehensive localized international strategy for the Kindle and I wonder if you
could talk about what if any impact that you think that, that might have over the next few quarters in terms of its impact
on the international media segment and also on international, the AWS. I think one of the contributors of growth and
we suspect margins in the U.S. has been the success of AWS here. I wonder if you could talk about any plans for AWS
outside the U.S.?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of Kindle, you're right, we now have Kindle stores if you will, established in
all of the Amazon domains that we have around the world and recently we announced Kindle Fire HD is available to
customers in over 170 countries. We introduced Kindle Paperweight and Kindle Fire HD in China. That's both online
on our website and also in a number of offline retail locations. So again there's a lot of advancement in terms of the
Kindle, but again it's very early. Very encouraged by the opportunity that we have there for customers and our ability to
try to capitalize on that from a digital content standpoint.
In terms of AWS the business is expanding and it's an incredible opportunity globally. We'd recognize that. The team
recognizes that, and it'll continue to work on that on behalf of customers.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thank you. The company and the business is going through a lot of transitions with digital media,
AWS, obviously Prime and potentially same-day delivery. A long time ago you used to give us a margin outlook for
the company. As you think about these businesses, do you think that there are better for Amazon in that you can have
greater share of retail as these evolutions happen? And then also, what are the implications on Amazon's long-term
margins as you go these transitions over time? Any help on that could help. Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of the way we're looking at them certainly is based on the free cash flow
potential and we have a – we're in some really interesting great businesses that have a lot of potential from a free cash
flow generation standpoint with good and high ROICs, which is exciting. From a margin standpoint always challenging
to predict where that will come out in terms of absolute numbers, but what we will do is we want to make sure that we
try to maximize free cash flow. That's something that we've always said. So our strategy hasn't changed, our outlook
hasn't changed in that regard. Frequently we'd be asked historically is double-digit operating margins possible?
And I still think it's possible, but also if it means – if a good high single digit operating margin gets us to better, higher
free cash flow over time that's fine too. So again our goal is to – we don't focus on individual margins. Our goal is to
make sure that we generate free cash flow – large amounts of free cash flow and use that capital efficiently. And so
those are goals that we have and we certainly think that, the opportunity is there in each of the business that we operate
in.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ben Schachter from Macquarie.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: Two quick questions on revenue recognition. Over the past some quarters I believe that the
certain digital media at least has moved around between agency and wholesale model. Can you help us quantify how
this is actually impacted the reported media revenue rates? In other words, would 2Q revenue rates have been
meaningfully different if the model had been the same? And then the second question just quickly on Prime, can you
remind us how you recognize revenue from the Prime membership fee over the course of the year? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of the Prime, we recognize it over the life of the subscription and then in
terms of third-party versus first-party, certainly we have had some shift within digital media. But again digital media is
primarily a first-party business and happens to be one portion of our business. But you're absolutely right. In terms of

our third-party business, which from a unit perspective is 40% of our total units this quarter, we recognized the share of
that revenue – the rev share if you will – as revenue whereas the other parts of our business largely were recognizing
that as first-party revenue and so we're recognizing the full amount of the revenue in the current period.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Rohan from Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Jordan E. Rohan>: Thank you so much. I'm curious about your expansion efforts in Spain, since it's a relatively
new territory for you how well situated you are and how ready you are for the fourth quarter there. Then also, there've
been a lot of stories about Amazon heading into Brazil, but I don't believe we've identified any fulfillment centers and
things like that. Can you discuss the extent and breadth of your offering in Brazil, whether it's Kindle devices, digital
media or something beyond that? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of Spain, we're very excited about what we see. It's growing very fast, we're in
investment mode and it's an exciting geography for us and we're very optimistic over time it'll be a great geography for
us. So we're very happy to serve customers in Spain and we continue to, as we've done in other geographies that we'll
continue to serve customers and continue to do expand selection and get service levels even better over time and so
we're very excited about that. In terms of Brazil, we do have a Kindle Store and we have devices at physical retailers.
So from a Kindle perspective that's what we're doing in Brazil.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ron Josey from JMP Securities.
<Q - Ron Victor Josey>: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about
North America EGM. Just given the strength you saw in the business and continued reacceleration, have you seen any
impact, I'm assuming no, but from price matching programs from offline retailers? And also on sales tax? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of North America total growth, we saw an acceleration from last quarter from
26% to 30%. We saw an acceleration in both North America Media as well as North America EGM. Within EGM, it
was very broad in terms of growth. We saw very strong growth across many different categories and so very pleased
with that. I called out a couple that were notable in terms of apparel as well as in consumables. Certainly those are
getting a larger and still growing very fast which is why I called those out.
In terms of competitiveness, it's been – it's very competitive. It is today, it has been since our inception. We have many
different competitors online, we have many competitors offline. As you go to your home or office you pass our
competitors every day. That's an environment we're used to dealing in. It's something that's not new. It's something that
we see in all of our geographies across many different categories.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heath Patrick Terry>: Great. Thanks. Tom, as you get closer to customers with more FCs and more efficient
shipping, what kind of impact is that having on conversion rates within customers in those areas as shipping times
shorten or delivery times shorten? And then as you look at the early adopters for Fresh in L.A., any sense you could
share with us of what kind of cross shopping you're seeing among new Fresh customers? Are they bundling media and
EGM in those other orders? Or to any degree are these new to Amazon customers that have been brought in purely
because of Fresh?

<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: If you take a look at L.A., it's just again very excited and it's very early. So I think on that
one, you'll just have to stay tuned. But in terms of as we get closer and closer to customers with fulfillment, we have
seen growth due to that and it's manifested its way in a few different ways, but most notably you see it in Prime. We've
– because of our fulfillment logistics capability we've been able to offer Prime broadly and we just have a selection
that's just closer and closer to customers. And if you look back over the last several years there's been different reasons
why we've grown the way we've grown in terms of adding new selection and making sure that we have really sharp
pricing. But certainly, Prime, which includes speeded delivery, has certainly been a notable – has had a notable impact.
And we're very pleased with the Prime program, customers like it, we're adding, we see very strong growth in Prime
subscribers, we see very good retention of Prime members, so it's a great program for us and certainly, again delivery
speed is certainly impacting that program our overall growth.
Operator
Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thank you. On the topic of media just wondering, Tom, if there are any callouts in terms
of categories of strength or weakness within physical or digital media that you could callout. And along those lines just
wondering, if you could comment on your media device rollout strategy from here. If there's anything you could tell
us? And then quickly, is there any reason Prime Instant Video isn't available for Android devices? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of media growth not a lot of callouts except probably the obvious is digital units
growing very fast relative to physical units. And we're excited to see that and because of where we are we're further
penetrated in North America, you're seeing a bigger impact on our growth rate than you are in International and we
certainly see that. But not a lot of other callouts there, but again we're very pleased and certainly customers responding
to many things, including selection and great prices and everything else within those digital offerings. But also they're
responding to unique selection that we have and if you take a look at our release you'll see the specific numbers related
to some of the exclusives we have and certainly that's having an impact.
So there's many, many different things that are working for us in that space as part of our overall ecosystem for digital
that we're pleased with. In terms of our device plan we're very pleased with the devices we have and to offer our
customers. We think we have a great offering both in terms of Kindle and Kindle Fire and in terms of our future
roadmap. We have a long-standing practice of not talking about what that will be prior to announcement.

Our next question comes from Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald.
<Q - Youssef H. Squali>: Thank you very much. Two quick questions, please. Tech and content was up to 9% of
revenues. I think that's the highest it's ever been. How much of that is actually streaming content related? And how do
we look at it going forward? Does it stay at that elevated level? And then on Fresh, is that business profitable for you in
the Seattle area? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of tech and content, we're spending in a number of different areas. But there's a
few that I'd like to highlight. One is certainly keep in mind that the infrastructure related to our very fast growing Web
Services business is included in tech and content, so certainly as we ramp up that business and it's becoming more
sizable and growing very fast you're seeing that impacting that line item. We're also investing very heavily in digital
and that's across many different parts of our digital offerings there. That's also included. Any of the tech teams that are
working on customer experience across Amazon as we grow.
So as we support both our seller businesses and our retail businesses, they're included in that line item. So certainly
that's what you're seeing there. In terms of Fresh, we're not breaking out the financials but keep in mind that Fresh was
designed as a pilot and certainly the economics have improved over time through invention on behalf of the team there

And we'll now go to Colin Sebastian from Robert Baird.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Thanks very much. I guess, a quick follow-up on the device strategy and given the fairly
quick pace of innovation in the tablet market overall. I wonder if you can contrast the benefits of that for Amazon given
the popularity of shopping and media apps with the costs and complexity of maintaining your own line of hardware?
And related to this it seems as if the pace of new content acquisition and licensing has picked up a bit and so I wonder
if that reflects any changes in either the competitive dynamics or pricing or some sort of other strategy shift on your
part? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of some of the dynamics, we're very excited about our digital business. We're
inventing – you see a lot of different inventions both on the hardware side as well as on the software side from a device
standpoint. You'll also see a lot of invention around the content side and we think for example Prime Instant Video,
which combines video in our Prime membership is very compelling and we're investing heavily in content. It's still very
early there, but we're finding that customers – certainly existing Prime members are more and more streaming content.
We're having new Prime members come to Amazon largely because of video in terms of one segment of that
population that's coming from new Prime members; it's because of Prime Instant Video. And we can see that based on
the free trials and the conversion of those free trials from related to Prime Instant Video.
And so that's certainly one portion of our growth in Prime membership which we find exciting. For us to be able to
offer exclusive content on the book side is very interesting. So again, we're inventing a lot of different – across a lot of
different areas and yes, there are a lot of different dynamics, but we think, we're well-suited for both the device
software and content side of those businesses.

Our next question comes from Matt Nemer from Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matt Nemer>: Afternoon. Just two questions. One, given your comments that international will be in investment
mode for some time, can you just remind us what the priorities are there from either a geography or a product
standpoint? And then secondly, following the management changes at Quidsi, would love an update on the plans for
that business and maybe just a sense for how integrated it is to Amazon retail? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah. In terms of the international piece, what I was referring to was, was in investment
mode for some time, I was referring to China specifically. And we have a lot of opportunity to grow, we'll still continue
to invest in international, but my comment was specifically around China. And then your question around Quidsi? I
missed that.
Operator
And we'll go to Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Stephen Ju>: Tom, is there...
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Hello? Just to follow up. I think on the Quidsi question I think was around the founders
leaving and are we well-positioned with them leaving? I missed the last part of that. But no, we did fortunate to have
the founders with us for number of years. They did a great job while they were here and we have great team at Quidsi.
And we're pleased that business and the team – our retail team works very closely with the Quidsi business and excited
to have it as part of the Amazon team.

<Q - Stephen Ju>: Hey, Tom. Hey, Tom. Is there anything you can share in terms of the situation in Germany with the
workers strike? Are you able to fulfill from unaffected fulfillment centers or is it causing some hindrance to your
operations there? And also if you could update us on what you've been doing with Kiva since you've acquired it? Are
you focusing more on internal integration or are you selling more aggressively to external clients? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of Germany, there's not a lot I can add to there. We're certainly serving customers.
Those results are reflected in our overall total results that you see today for Q2 as well as our international results. In
terms of Kiva, we certainly, we have a great team there, love the technology. We don't have any announcements in
terms of rollouts, but we're ahead of schedule from what we had set out at the time of purchase, which we're happy
about, so have to stay tuned on the actual rollout, but we're very encouraged by what we see there.

And our final question comes from Ken Sena from Evercore Partners.
<Q - Ken Sena>: Hi. Thank you. Just going back to your comments on unit acceleration. Has the shift from agency to
wholesale in terms of the DoJ ebook settlement, has that completed or are you still working your way through many of
the U.S. publishers? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: We're working through it. I wouldn't say that, that's complete, but we're working through
it.
