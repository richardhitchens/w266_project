MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Today's
conference is being recorded.
At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations and
Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.
David S. Rosenthal
Good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is
ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the second quarter. I will refer to the slides that are available through
the Investors section of our website.
Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement, shown on slide two.
Moving to slide three, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic
growth improved modestly in the second quarter. U.S. economic activity recovered after contracting in the first quarter.
China's growth rate strengthened due to increased exports and government stimulus, while Europe's economic recovery
remained moderate.
Energy markets delivered mixed results. WTI prices increased by more than $4 a barrel, narrowing the discount to
Brent, while Western Canadian Select prices also strengthened. U.S. natural gas prices decreased compared to the first
quarter. Global industry refining margins strengthened, while strong chemical commodity margins were offset by
weaker specialty margins.

Turning now to the financial results as shown on slide four, ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings were $8.8 billion, or
$2.05 per share. The corporation distributed $6 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and our share
repurchase program. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were $3 billion. CapEx was $9.8 billion in the
quarter and $18.2 billion year to date, down 17% from the first half of 2013. Cash flow from operations and asset sales
was $12.8 billion, including proceeds associated with asset sales of $2.6 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled
$6.3 billion and debt was $21.8 billion.
The next slide provides additional detail on second quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash increased
by about $500 million, from $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and
other items, and our ongoing asset management program yielded $12.8 billion of cash flow from operations and asset
sales. Uses included net investments in the business of $6.7 billion and shareholder distributions of $6 billion. Other
financing activities increased cash by $400 million. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $3
billion in the third quarter of 2014.
Moving on to slide six and a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings of $8.8 billion
increased by $1.9 billion from the second quarter of 2013, primarily reflecting gains on asset sales and higher earnings
across all business segments.
In the sequential quarter comparison, shown on slide seven, earnings decreased by $320 million, as lower downstream
and chemical earnings and higher corporate and financing expenses were partly offset by higher upstream earnings.
Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million a quarter.
Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results and starting on slide eight, upstream earnings in the second
quarter were $7.9 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion versus the second quarter of 2013.
Realizations increased earnings by $580 million, primarily driven by higher liquids realizations. On a worldwide basis,
crude oil realizations increased by $4.48 per barrel. Worldwide natural gas realizations decreased $0.39 per 1,000 cubic
feet, as higher U.S. gas prices were offset by lower international realizations.
Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $200 million due to a net underlift, primarily in West Africa, and lower
gas values. Excluding the underlift impact, volume/mix was a positive factor of about $50 million, reflecting
higher-margin production growth, primarily from North America and Papua New Guinea. All other items increased
earnings by $1.2 billion, mainly due to gains on asset sales in Hong Kong.
Moving to slide nine, excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, oil equivalent production
decreased by 2.3% compared to the second quarter of last year. Liquids production was up 8,000 barrels per day.
Increased U.S. liquids production and Kearl volumes were mostly offset by scheduled maintenance in Canada and
Kazakhstan, base decline, and unfavorable entitlement and divestment impacts. Natural gas production was down 604
million cubic feet per day, as lower weather-related demand in Europe and expected field decline were partly offset by
new production from PNG LNG.
Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on slide 10, upstream earnings increased $98 million versus the first
quarter. Realizations reduced earnings by $200 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $620 million,
reflecting expected lower seasonal demand in Europe, scheduled maintenance, and underlift impacts, primarily in West
Africa. All other items had a positive impact of $920 million, primarily driven by net gains on asset sales. Upstream
after-tax earnings per barrel were $23.07 excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes.
Moving to slide 11, excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, volumes were down 288,000 oil
equivalent barrels per day or about 6.9% sequentially. Liquids production was down 77,000 barrels per day, mainly due
to scheduled maintenance in Canada, Kazakhstan, and the North Sea, along with unfavorable entitlement impacts.
Increased U.S. liquids production provided a partial offset. Natural gas volumes were down 1.3 billion cubic feet per
day, reflecting lower seasonal demand in Europe and Qatar downtime, partly offset by the addition of PNG LNG
volumes.

Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results, starting on slide 12, downstream earnings for the first
quarter were $711 million, up $315 million from the second quarter of 2013. Margins decreased earnings by $330
million, driven by lower non-U.S. refining margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $280 million,
reflecting reduced planned maintenance activities. Other items increased earnings by $370 million, primarily due to the
absence of Dartmouth [Nova Scotia] refinery conversion costs and lower maintenance expenses.
Turning to slide 13, sequentially, second quarter downstream earnings decreased by $102 million, primarily due to
unfavorable volume/mix effects and higher maintenance activities, partially offset by higher margins.
Moving now to the chemical financial and operating results and starting on slide 14, second quarter chemical earnings
were $841 million, up $85 million versus the prior-year quarter, mainly due to favorable volume/mix and ForEx
effects. Stronger commodity margins were offset by weaker specialties margins.
Moving to slide 15, sequentially, chemical earnings decreased by $206 million, primarily due to lower specialty
margins and higher planned maintenance activities.
Moving now to an update on year-to-date cash flow growth, as shown on slide 16, strong free cash flow of $14.8 billion
represented an increase of $12.1 billion compared to the first half of 2013. Cash flow from operations and asset sales of
$29 billion more than covered the $14.2 billion invested in the business and $11.7 billion distributed to shareholders,
with the remaining cash used for other financing activities and addition to our cash balance. This year-to-date free cash
flow growth reflects our strong operational performance, ongoing asset management program, and a disciplined capital
allocation approach.
As highlighted in our March analyst meeting, we are starting up a number of major projects that will add significant
profitable volume growth. Our world-class project execution capabilities are enabling us to make significant progress
and achieve key milestones. One of these milestones was the PNG LNG project startup in April, which was months
ahead of schedule. We have now ramped up to full production through both LNG trains, and are currently producing
close to 1 billion cubic feet of gas per day. Through July, we have already loaded 15 cargoes for delivery to customers
in Asia. The project was completed below the $19 billion budget announced in 2012 and produces LNG at a unit cost
that is one of the lowest in the region. This achievement is a good example of how ExxonMobil creates value through
technology applications and leading project execution capabilities. Learnings will be applied to other LNG projects that
we plan to progress.
In Angola, the CLOV project, of which ExxonMobil owns a 20% interest, started operations in June. Production is now
ramping up and expected to reach 160,000 barrels per day.
Offshore Sakhalin Island, the topside of the Berkut platform has been installed onto the gravity-based structure at the
Arkutun-Dagi field. The operation set a world record for installation of the heaviest integrated topside structure,
weighing over 42,000 tons, and using the world's largest ocean-going barge to carry and then set the structure. Berkut is
now the largest offshore oil and gas production platform in Russia. The facility will start up later this year and will add
up to 90,000 barrels per day to Sakhalin-1 oil production.
Let me now provide a quick update on Kashagan. The project partners have agreed to work towards a progressive
transition from the current venture model to a consolidated joint venture company operating under a single corporate
management system, integrating existing processes and tools from the venture entities. An experienced ExxonMobil
executive has been appointed as the managing director of the operating company. Regarding the pipeline issues, the
current assessment is that both oil and gas pipelines need to be replaced. The North Caspian operating company is now
developing a full replacement plan.
Turning now to slide 18 for an update on our exploration activities, in Argentina we drilled and successfully completed
two ExxonMobil-operated horizontal wells in the Vaca Muerta formation. The Bajo del Choique X-2 well flowed at an
average rate of 770 barrels of oil per day, while the La Invernada X-3 well will be flow-tested during the third quarter.
Our active program continues with additional wells planned to be drilled in the second half of the year.

In Tanzania, Statoil and ExxonMobil made an additional discovery in Block 2. The Piri-1 well discovered gas in a
high-quality reservoir, confirming an additional 2 TCF to 3 TCF of gas in place. Six gas discoveries in Block 2 have
been made to date, with total resource in place estimated at 20 TCF. ExxonMobil, Statoil, BG, and Ophir completed an
evaluation of potential sites for a common onshore LNG plant and made a location recommendation to the government
of Tanzania.
Drilling operations are also currently underway on two blocks in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. At Pirmam, we have
successfully drilled to target depth and are preparing to test the wells in the third quarter. At Alqosh, we are drilling
ahead and anticipate reaching target depth in the third quarter.
In Romania, we have spud the Domino-2 well in the Neptune block in the Black Sea. Data collected from the well will
aid in the development planning for the gas field discovered in 2012 by the Domino-1 well. We will then move on to
additional exploration drilling in the block.
Turning now to slide 19 and an update on our downstream business, during the quarter we achieved notable investment
milestones to increase high-value product sales. We commissioned the Clean Fuels project at the Saudi Aramco Mobil
refinery in Saudi Arabia. The project reduces sulfur levels in gasoline and diesel by more than 98% to meet more
stringent fuel standards in the kingdom. The project included new hydrotreating and sulfur recovery facilities and
started up successfully and on budget.
In China, we completed the expansion of the Tianjin lubricants plant to increase the supply of high-value
Mobil-branded lubricants. Work is also underway to significantly increase the blending capacity at the Taichung
lubricant plant, with expected completion by the end of 2015. Together, these two projects will increase our local
capacity by 75% and help meet the growing demand for high-quality lubricants in China.
We also recently approved a project to install a new 50,000 barrels per day delayed coker unit at our Antwerp refinery
in Belgium. The unit will convert low-value residual oil from our Northwest Europe refineries into higher-value fuel
transportation fuel products such as diesel. This is another example of selective investments we are making at our
competitively advantaged sites, further strengthening our industry-leading portfolio. Startup is planned for 2017.
Turning now to slide 20 and an update on our chemical business, where we are also progressing several projects to
grow high-value product sales; we received all final regulatory approvals and started construction of a multibillion
dollar ethane cracker at our existing fully-integrated Baytown, Texas complex and associated premium product
facilities in nearby Mont Belvieu. The steam cracker will have a capacity of up to 1.5 million tons per year and provide
ethylene feedstock for further chemical processing at two new 650,000 tons per year high-performance polyethylene
lines. This project is made possible in large part by abundant affordable supplies of U.S. natural gas for energy and
chemical feedstock. The expansion will enable us to economically supply rapidly growing demand for high-value
polyethylene products used in a variety of consumer and industrial applications. Startup is planned in 2017.
We also recently approved expansions of our specialty hydrocarbon fluid facilities in Antwerp and Singapore. These
projects will upgrade refinery streams and higher-value specialty chemical products to serve rapidly growing demand
in extended reach drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and other industrial applications. These investments underscore the
benefits of our business integration and technology advantage to capture advantaged feedstocks and increase high-value
product sales. Startups are planned in 2015 and 2016.
I would like to conclude today's presentation with a summary of our year-to-date performance. ExxonMobil's strong
financial and operating results reflect our ability to grow cash flow and provide robust shareholder returns, as we
presented during the analyst meeting in March. Total earnings year to date are $17.9 billion, reflecting solid operating
performance across all of our businesses and our ongoing asset management program.
In the upstream, production of 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day is right in line with our plans. Actions we took to
improve upstream profitability and grow higher-margin production increased unit earnings to $22.19 per barrel, up
from $18.03 a barrel in 2013.

In the downstream and chemical businesses, we progressed attractive investments to strengthen the portfolio and
continue to leverage integration benefits.
Our strong operating results combined with our disciplined capital allocation approach generated robust free cash flow
of $14.8 billion, an increase of $12.1 billion compared to the first half of 2013. This strong performance enabled us to
maintain industry-leading shareholder distributions.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Rosenthal. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Hello, David. Can you hear me?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning. I hear you fine, Paul. How are you?
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Very good, David, thank you. David, what has the impact of sanctions been on your operations in
Russia?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Look, Paul, I know our activities in Russia are a matter of great interest to you and
everybody else on the call and rightfully so. But what I can tell you as of this morning is that we are waiting for further
details on the sanctions in order to better understand how we need to comply. But I have to tell you, given that we
simply don't have sufficient information, I'm just not in a position this morning to comment any further on the impact
of the sanctions.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Okay. The CapEx in Russia, is that financed from within Russia? I was thinking given the scale of
operations on Sakhalin, maybe it was an internal Russian financing operation.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I really don't have the details of that. We finance our operations in a number of different
ways, and I don't really have a specific comment on Sakhalin or the rest of our activities.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: So essentially the status is that you're waiting for more clarification on any limits that may be
placed on, I guess, investment in operations.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: As you know, what's been in the press has been people's thoughts and expectations, but we
really just haven't seen the detailed written sanctions. And so until we have those and have a chance to assess them and
evaluate them, again, it puts me in a position this morning where I really can't make any specific comments.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Understood, and then my follow-up is totally separate. The construction started at Baytown, you
highlighted. That I think is advanced against schedule, isn't it? Is that fully permitted and, obviously, final investment
decision and everything else? What is the expected completion date? Thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: That project is right on our plan. We do have all of our permits in place; construction has
started. We put that picture in the slides this morning to show we're digging dirt and the project is underway. Even
throughout the permitting process, we were well underway getting all the engineering lined up, all the contractors, all
the supply chain, so that once we had the permits we were ready to go. So no change to what we told you at the analyst
meeting; we're on schedule so far, and we do expect to have that project up and running sometime in 2017.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Thank you, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: All right. Thank you, Paul.

We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Hi, David. Good morning, how are you?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So a couple of questions, please. The promise of improving operating cash flow has always been
a big thing from your Analyst Day. We don't really see any substantial margin change this quarter with the startup of
PNG and I guess Kearl ramping up. So I'm just wondering if you can frame for us how you see the – what the drivers
are of that change in cash flow are in terms perhaps of how the margin could change for your new portfolio of assets,
which I guess will be about a quarter of the company in 2017. Any color you can give, qualitatively if necessary, just to
give some comfort that that turn is coming, and I've got a follow-up, please.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, Doug. Let's talk about that a little bit as we look at how things have really evolved
over the last, say, 12 months. We have seen some pretty significant increase in our unit profitability and our ability to
capture changes in the realizations as they come along. If I look at where we are so far in the first half of 2014 on
upstream profitability relative to 2013, we're up over $4.00 a barrel on unit profitability. And if I go back and I take out
all of the asset management, asset sales, related gains in all the periods, unit profitability is up right at $2.00.
So I think you're starting to see the impact of the trend that we talked about in the analyst meeting of reducing our
exposure to lower-margin barrels and barrels where we don't have quite the upside potential. And you're just now
starting to see some of the projects that we've talked extensively about coming online. Papua New Guinea LNG is an
example. It just started up. It's one of several projects to come on in the next couple years, as we talked about at the
analyst meeting, all of which is accretive to average unit profitability and average unit cash flow. So I think in our
production volumes, we're starting to see the benefit of that. Again, it's early. We just started up the project. We have a
number of projects yet to come over the course of the year. Of course, Papua New Guinea will be ramping up.
We have the Lucius project coming up later in the year, and I might give you an update on that. As you know, at the
time of the analyst meeting and when we put out our F&O review, we had a 15% interest in the Lucius project. That
interest is now up to 23%, a little over 23% through a normal redetermination exercise as well as our exercising our
preemptive rights on the Apache sale. So that project will be starting up later this year. And again, we'll have about
23% of those barrels. Hadrian South will also start up at the same time. So again, the projects we talked about are on
schedule and they're coming online and they will be accretive to the unit profitability we talked about.
There are a number of other things that you see as we progress through in looking at the year-to-date cash flow,
including an active asset management program, and you saw the impact of that. So as I look back really at the first half
and staying away from the first quarter versus the second quarter and looking at the six months, we are spot-on. The
outlook we gave you on production in the analyst meeting, as you've seen in our supplement, U.S. liquids production is
up fairly significantly, and we continue to grow that production, as we said we would. That will also add to the
improving margins. So cash flow is good. Free cash flow is dramatically better than last year. We're continuing to
provide the shareholder with strong returns. We raised the dividend again, as you know, almost 10% in the second
quarter.
So as we sit back and we look at the first half results and compare to what our plans were and compare to last year,
we're very encouraged and very confident that we'll continue to deliver the growth that we had talked about and
continue to trend up on unit profitability and the cash flow. So from our perspective, everything is right on track, and
we look forward to continuing to deliver the commitments we've made to the shareholder.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks for the full answer, David. I'll make the follow-up a very quick one hopefully. So
assuming the spending level does hold around the $37 billion number, all things equal, it's the age-old question for you
guys. You're going to have a lot of free cash flow. How are you thinking about the dividend nowadays as opposed to
stepping up the buyback? When you traveled recently, I think your message was that cash will go back to shareholders.
So if you could help frame the importance of one over the other as you stabilize the underlying production base, that

would be helpful. And I'll leave it there, thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. Thanks, Doug. As you mentioned, at constant prices, yes, as we deliver the plan that
we outlined at the analyst meeting, we do expect to see continued increase in our cash flow generation. And keeping
the CapEx at the levels we discussed would by definition improve free cash flow, again, just as we've seen dramatically
here in the first half.
In terms of the capital allocation, no change to our prior approach; we're going to stay disciplined on the capital. We're
going to fund our best projects. I think as we've talked about in the analyst meeting and folks are beginning to
recognize, our opportunity portfolio is quite extensive at this point, and that's going to allow us to be selective. So we'll
continue to be disciplined on the capital side. We will continue to pay a very consistent and increasing dividend over
time, and I think you've certainly seen evidence of that over the last few years.
And after you accomplish those two things, the rest of the cash will flow back to the shareholder through the share
buyback program, so no change in approach, no change in how we're doing our capital allocation. But again, we are
certainly looking forward to continued success in our project ramp-up, continued success in upgrading the value of our
molecules in the downstream and chemicals, and delivering that profitable growth that we talked about a lot in the
analyst meeting. So thank you.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks, David.

We will go next to Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Good morning, David, a very small question first. Just asset sale gains in the quarter, if
you'd shout out the actual number in this quarter if you have that.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. In total, the gains from asset sales on an absolute basis were about $1.7 billion, $1.6
billion of that in the upstream and the other $100 million in the downstream in chemical.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Okay, thanks. That's helpful always. Let's talk bigger picture about the Permian.
Obviously, at the Analyst Day, you spoke about 1.5 million acres. Do you have a breakdown of how much of that is
CBP [Central Basin Platform], how much of that is middle, and how much might be in the Delaware Basin for more the
application of horizontal drilling?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. I'll start out by saying, if you look at that whole 1.5 million acres, it is spread through
the Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin. We're in a number of different areas, and that really gives us the
opportunity to do a number of things to grow our production there, including a lot of things in the conventional fields,
waterfloods, CO2 floods. We've got 65 workover rigs still running in the Permian in addition to the other rigs that we
have drilling exploration wells. So we have a lot of exposure to both conventional and unconventional, again, broadly
across the basin in Texas and in New Mexico.
As we look at the various areas that I know people are interested in, we certainly have some very good acreage in the
prime areas for the Wolfcamp, and we're just getting started in there. Bone Springs is another one that we're working
on. So when you look at this ramp-up in growth that we've seen to date, and you've seen the numbers of the significant
growth in liquids in the U.S. year over year, we are just now beginning to scratch the unconventional plays and getting
some of those wells down and see what we've got going on.
We've got about five rigs drilling horizontal wells today in, again, the Wolfcamp, the Bone Springs, and a number of
areas. We have brought 93 wells online this year. That's up almost 70% from last year about this time, so a lot of
activity, a lot of growth, but just scratching the surface of the potential in that area. So we're excited to have the
opportunities that we have across the basin, across the platform, and in particular the wide variety of things we have to
work on in that play. So it's not just unconventional. It's a number of resource opportunities. And you'll continue to see
us ramp up activity there and see that production. Again, as we talked about at the analyst meeting, that is a big-time

focus area for us, as is the Bakken, where we're having tremendous success as well, and the Woodford Ardmore area.
So I can tell you sitting here midyear, the opportunity is there. We're developing it, and we're seeing that production
increase right in line with our expectations.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: If I can be very sneaky, is it fee acreage or is it more recently sold in the Permian? I'm
thinking about the royalty position. Some are starting to disclose where they are on that.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Now we've got – most of our acreage is fee acreage. And as you know, that's a big help on
the royalties.

We'll go next to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Good morning, David. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hi, Blake.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: I had a question for you on the production profile. I know you confirmed that you're on
track to meet your full-year target. 2Q came in a bit light compared to what we were looking for. I know you referenced
some maintenance and European nominations were weak. Is it fair as we move into second half to think that 2Q is a
low point? I know you'll have CLOV ramping up and maybe some of that maintenance coming back online, or any
color you can give us on how to think about second half of the year.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, sure. If we look at the first half in particular, if we look sequentially where the
volumes came down quite a bit, just on the liquids side, downtime was worth 66,000 barrels a day for us from first
quarter to second quarter. So we had a very heavy maintenance load up in Canada, in Kazakhstan, at Tengiz, and a
number of other places, the North Sea, for example. So while we did see the benefit from projects at PNG and Kearl,
they were masked by, again, this planned maintenance, seasonal maintenance, but it did have quite an impact on us. As
we typically do going forward into the second half, that maintenance gets done and those things come back.
The other impact we had sequentially again was a sharp reduction in gas sales. I think our demand in Europe was
probably worth over 150,000 oil equivalent barrels a day on the gas side. And then we also had some downtime.
So I'd characterize if you're looking at the second quarter, characterize by an extremely heavy maintenance load and
your typical seasonal decline in Europe volume coming off a low base because of the low winter. So the offset of that,
of course, is PNG LNG starting up, the increase you've seen in the higher-margin U.S. liquids volumes, they just
weren't enough to offset these other factors.
As we head into the second half of the year, you will see these maintenance items come back up, as they typically do,
and then the project startups that I talked about, full ramp-up of PNG LNG, and then the other projects that I
mentioned, Lucius and some of the other ones. So we would certainly expect to see the benefit of both of those factors
coming out of the second quarter.
And that's why I really wanted to focus a little bit of time this morning on how we're doing year to date because I think
the real key measure of our performance and whether or not we're delivering on the targets that we established at the
March analyst meeting is we are right on plan. In fact, we're a little ahead in some areas like U.S. liquids production,
for example, PNG LNG a little ahead. Some other things are a little behind, European demand for example on the gas
side. We continue to ramp up Kearl and that progress is also looking good as we head into the second half of the year.
So again, if we look past the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and focus on where we're at year to date and what we're
expecting in the second half, I can assure you that we are spot-on to deliver the outlook that we gave you.

<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: That's great. That's helpful; thank you. The second question: one of your European
counterparts has just announced I guess the initial steps to form an MLP, and it seems like Exxon is flush with assets
that would probably fit very nicely into one and really highlight the underlying value that's probably not reflected in the
stock. I'm just curious if that is even on the radar screen.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I'd say generically, everything's on the radar screen. We are just constantly looking at all of
the things that are out there, all the options we have to realize full value from all of our assets, including our midstream
assets. The one thing I'd remind you, if you recall back in the 2011 and 2012 timeframe, we actually sold a number of
our midstream assets and realized extensive value for those, and those were reflected in the very strong gains on asset
sales and cash flow we generated.
Now if you step back and look at MLPs, most companies are using those as a means to raise cash and finance growth or
reduce their ownership costs or exposure. Those aren't strategic drivers for us. In our case, when we look at our
midstream portfolio, these are strategic assets to us. We think we are monetizing the value of those. Whether or not you
would assert that they are adequately reflected in our share price yet, we are certainly monetizing those and maximizing
the value in the integration of our full value chain, and also as part of our logistics and integration between the
upstream, downstream, and chemicals.
So you probably won't be surprised to know that we've taken a hard look at this and looked at the assets and the
opportunities, but we like what we have. We like the integration benefit. And in fact, if you've seen some of our recent
announcements, we're actually investing more dollars in that part of the business. We mentioned the Edmonton rail
project and a few other ones. So midstream assets are strategic to us. We think we're getting full value for them as part
of the integrated business model that we have. But I wouldn't want you to ever think that we're not aware of and
looking at everything that's out there that others are doing and some things others may not have thought about yet.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Great. Thank you, David.

Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Hi, good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Morning, Roger.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Guess maybe come back a little on the Permian question just because we did see the – I believe
it was an asset swap that you did during the quarter. And since in general we're seeing a lot more activity heading in
that direction, maybe could you give us an idea a little bit of relative size? I know you don't like to get into a lot of
details, but relative size, and as we think about growth opportunities maybe in the Permian relative to the identified
projects in the Gulf of Mexico, if there's any additional detail, clarity, something there you can offer us.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: We did sign an agreement in the second quarter to do a swap that basically added about an
additional 26,000 net acres in the Permian. Virtually all of it was in the Midland Basin, which of course, as you know,
is prospective for the horizontal drilling that we've talked about. If you add that to the acreage we talked about that we
picked up earlier this year, we have now added 50,000 – 60,000 prime acres right in the sweet spot of where we want to
be. So that's good, and that's one of the reasons why we've increased rigs in that area. I mentioned the 65 workover rigs
that we're running. I think we've got 11 rigs running on the exploration and delineation and evaluation side, so certainly
ramping up activity there and very encouraged by the results we're seeing. It's a very, very active area for us.
Now in terms of activity relative to other areas, I have to also say the Bakken is an area where we're also ramping up
production quite significantly, and you see that in our results. We've got a lot of activity there. We've got 12 rigs
running. That's up from where we've been in the past. Operated production was up 26% in the second quarter. So again,
we're continuing to ramp up.

Page 10 of 16
The other play we've talked about is the Ardmore, and we've got higher rigs running there as well. One of the things if I
just think about adding it up and looking at liquids plays, production across the Permian, Bakken, and Woodward
Ardmore in the second quarter was over 200,000 barrels a day, and that was up over 25% from a year ago and up
quarter to quarter. So we're continuing to work that.
Comparing those opportunities to the Gulf of Mexico, we're fortunate that we've got opportunities in both of those
areas. We do have major projects coming on and starting up. I mentioned Lucius, which is the oil development there,
starting up before the end of the year. The gas piece of that project for us, Hadrian South, will also start up and bring on
additional volumes. We continue to work on Julia, and that's progressing well. And then there are a couple other
projects that we also have an interest in. So that's coming through.
We've also picked up some additional very attractive exploration acreage. Recently we were awarded the three blocks
that we were the high bidder on right over there on the Transboundary area bordering up against Mexico. So we've got
those three blocks awarded to us there in the Gulf, and we're hoping that will lead to some opportunities down the road
beyond that, so both of those areas are looking good. The Gulf of Mexico never delivers 100% success rate to anybody,
and we've drilled a couple of dry holes ourselves. But if we step back and look across the last several years and what
we've got on the plate going forward, we like what we have and we're looking forward to getting these high-margin
volumes up and running here later in the year.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay, that's great. That's great, thanks. And then that segues into what my other question was
going to be. Mexico, clearly they've made progress on the legislative side. We still need to see what the actual rules are
going to be and get a good feel for timing. Can you talk a little bit about what Exxon sees as the possibilities in Mexico
over the next, I don't know, three to five years as this develops?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: We're certainly encouraged by what we've seen to date, and we're certainly respectful of
the process of deliberation that's going on. And as they work through their legislative process, we're monitoring that
closely. We have a long history in Mexico, and we are certainly anxious to see how all this comes out and what
opportunities might be available for us along those lines.
Again, as I mentioned a minute ago, we do have those three blocks awarded to us right there on the boundary of the
Mexican blocks in the deepwater Gulf, and so we'll see if that can help generate opportunities. But we're encouraged to
date, anxiously awaiting how all that finalizes and all the details come out over time, and then we'll pursue any
opportunities that are attractive to us. But we certainly like our position.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay, thank you.

Our next question comes from Doug Terreson of ISI.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: So for clarification, how does the $1.6 billion of upstream asset sales that you mentioned a
minute ago reconcile with the $1.2 billion other figure that you highlighted on slide eight? And do you have any
geographical segmentation for either of those results?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. So if you're looking at the $1.2 billion that we mentioned, that was the delta quarter
on quarter.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Sure.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Because we had a number of asset gains last quarter and then last year. So if you're looking
at the total picture there, and again, there are other items in the earnings rec [reconciliation]. But just to be clear, in the

upstream, the total value of the asset sales in earnings was $1.6 billion in the quarter.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Right.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: And then if you look quarter over quarter, that's about $1.5 billion, with an offset of a
couple hundred million dollars in some other things like startup expenses and that sort of thing. If you're looking at the
sequential comparison, we had about $400 million of gains on asset sales in the first quarter of this year. So the delta
there is about $1.2 billion in earnings.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: So I hope that sorts it out for you, and then we talked separately in the call about the
impact on the cash flows.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. And then secondly, over the years ExxonMobil and its peers have employed fairly
substantial portfolio management programs to support returns on capital. And with the decline in returns across the
sector over the past four or five years, the pace has accelerated for some companies, and with positive effect on returns
and their values in the market. So my question is, with ExxonMobil's returns falling with the industry's over the last
several years, why wouldn't the company be using portfolio management more rather than the same or less to enhance
its returns profile; that is, if you think that it's not? So really any updated thinking on portfolio management strategy in
light of the industry context is appreciated, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, thanks, Doug. I would say there are really two items to talk about in regard to the
return performance here over the last couple years. First with regard to asset sales, they're not linear. We had a number
of asset sales in 2011 and 2012, and I think the combination of those two years yielded about $20 billion in cash flow,
very strong. Last year was less of a year. This year we're off to a pretty solid start between the first quarter and the
second quarter, and in particular what we've generated here with our asset sales.
So the program is ongoing. We don't make an announcement in advance of what we're going to do. We find that gives
us a little better negotiating strategy when we do actually sit down and talk about selling assets. So we don't have any
stated objective; we don't have any target that we feel we must make. But we're certainly able to take advantage of
anything in the market that gives us a chance to realize value for our shareholders. Fortunately for us, we don't have to
sell assets in order to make a dividend payment or another distribution because of the cash flow we generate. And
again, reference back to that chart I showed you.
I think one of the other things to keep in mind when you look at upstream ROCE over the last few years, particularly in
our case and I can't speak for others, but one of the aspects of these very large legacy, plateau volume, non-declining
volume projects, however you want to call them, is all the CapEx is up front.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Sure.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: And so there, as you're building these projects, and particularly in our case, we talk about
bringing on 1 million barrels of oil equivalent a day of production between 2013 and 2017. By definition, you've got a
lot of steel in the ground to produce 1 million barrel oil equivalent a day. And until that capital starts up, that's
non-productive capital.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: So that I think, at least for us, has been a big driver in terms of ROCE. And as you know,
as those projects crank up, Papua New Guinea being a perfect example, you go from non-productive capital in the
ground to productive capital, and in this case highly productive capital. So again, part of bringing all these projects
online, part of ramping up the production is the earnings, the cash flow, and the ROCE that comes along with that. And
then on the downstream side, of course, we continue to have industry-leading returns and continue to make incremental
investments there to at least maintain, if not increase, that advantage.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. Thanks a lot, David.

Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Dave, on Kearl Phase 1, the ramp-up has been I think probably slower than what the investor
has been expecting. From you guys' standpoint internally, when do you think all the startup issues will be fixed and
you'll be running at a sustainable rate until you get to full capacity? Is it going to take another year, six months, any
kind of rough timeline internally that you guys are forecasting?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Paul, let me give you a quick update on Kearl because we have seen a continued ramp-up
in the production. I mentioned that in the second quarter, although on the surface it looks like production was flat at
about 66,000 barrels a day first quarter and second quarter, but recall, we did have some planned maintenance there in
April that took us way below that number. I can tell you, as we came out of that April downtime for maintenance,
production picked up quite well. And in fact, we achieved record production in the month of June of almost 80,000
barrels a day. So we've not quite reached the lined-out production and our expectations, but we are making progress. A
number of the issues that you are aware of are being resolved, and we're working on that.
Again, I have to stress that although we're certainly a little disappointed in the ramp-up over the last year from what our
original expectation was, the technology is working fine. We've actually been able to run each of the three froth
treatment trains above their design capacity. That's very encouraging. And so the objective for us now is to get all three
of them running simultaneously on a consistent basis at or above their design capacity; and when we achieve that, that's
when you really see that volume change. So we're encouraged at the capability of the assets that we've put in place.
We're encouraged with how the technology is working. We are working on the ramp-up and look to improve that. I
can't give you a specific date on which we'll achieve 110,000 barrels a day or some number greater than that, but we are
making progress and we're looking forward to continue that progress.
I can also say, on the other side of the Kearl initial development, the expansion project is going very well. I'm pleased
to say for another quarter that the project is on schedule and on budget, which on the backs of the Papua New Guinea
LNG project, very unusual in our industry for somebody in my position to sit here on an earnings call and tell you the
projects are on budget and on schedule. So I acknowledge that the ramp-up in Kearl first phase hasn't been quite what
we were expecting, but again, I want to confirm that we're making progress and we're encouraged with the results we
have seen so far this year.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Dave, you guys have had some decent success on shale oil. Do you have a number you can
share? What is your total shale oil production in the second quarter average and comparing to the full year 2013, and
whether you can break it down between frac oil, condensate, NGL, and gas?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I can't break down the split between oil, NGL, and gas. But the numbers I gave just a
minute ago on the call across the Permian, the Bakken, and the Ardmore are pretty indicative of what we're doing,
although not all of it in the Permian, as I mentioned, is unconventional oil. I think without a specific number, again,
when you look at the numbers that we had in the supplement to the press release, you see the 38,000 barrels a day
increase in U.S. liquids year over year. And we look at how things are going again in the big three, the Bakken, the
Woodford Ardmore, and the Permian, we're ramping up to that level that we talked about in the analyst meeting and
continue to move forward, and I'll continue to give you an update on a quarterly basis.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Can I just sneak in a quick question, a final one?

<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: There's a article I think out there talking about Exxon evaluating to have a major expansion in
one of your Texas refinery. That seems to be very uncharacteristic or quite different than what Exxon historically has
been building or the refining strategy in the U.S. Want to see whether you can comment on that.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Paul, the first thing I'd say is I'm not going to make a specific comment on any rumors or
speculation that are out there in the press. We are regularly looking at our portfolio around the world. I mentioned the
investment we're putting into the Antwerp plant, which you might say why would you be putting money into Europe
given its current weak spot on the margin side. But again, that's consistent with our strategy of upgrading molecules;
very nice project, to take what is currently a low-value resid [residual] stream and upgrade it into very high-value diesel
and other products. So when we look at the U.S., when we look at Europe, when we look at Asia-Pacific, we're always
looking at opportunities and what we can do to either upgrade any molecule that's flowing through our system, how we
can take advantage of already advantaged assets like our refining circuit and improve that. So for us to be looking at
many different things should not come as a surprise.
But rather than mention anything specifically and coming back to the strategy that we've articulated, I think I can really
go back to what we said at the analyst meeting. If you look at our downstream strategy, it's all about expanding
feedstock flexibility, increasing high-value product yields, reducing operating costs, taking advantage of logistics, like
we're doing in Europe that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, or pressing even more the value we get from
integration. So I would say there's no change in that strategy per se, but wouldn't comment on any specific item that
you might have read in the press somewhere.

Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Thanks for taking this question, guys. On Russia, I appreciate the point that the sanctions
have not yet been fully clarified. But can you confirm whether the Arctic exploration prospect with Rosneft is still set
to spud in August?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Pavel, again, I can understand the interest in the question, but I really have to come back to
what I said at the opening. Until we have a chance to look at the sanctions, read them, assess them, evaluate them, it
just wouldn't be appropriate for me at this point this morning really to make any comments specifically on any of our
activities.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Okay, understood. And then you guys recently applied for approval for the Gulf Coast
LNG export terminal with Qatar; any sense of when you're expecting that approval to be given?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I don't have a specific expectation. I think one of the things that's helpful for us is we went
in a pre-FERC filing process for a while. We've been working on this, so this isn't brand new for us. I don't know
exactly what the expectation is in terms of approvals or a number you have to get from the FERC, of course from the
DOE, et cetera. But I think if we look across how this thing might progress through the approval process and if we can
get to a position where we can FID this, you might be looking at some timeframe for production around 2019. Again,
without breaking it into its components, but a nice opportunity for us, and we are certainly looking forward to an
efficient process in terms of getting everything approved and getting our DOE approval for export to non-FTA
countries and moving on with that project. But it's just one of many LNG opportunities we have in the portfolio. We're
fortunate to have a number of things we can be working on around the world in various points of development, and this
one is certainly one that we're working on real closely.

Our next question comes from John Herrlin with Société Générale.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Hi, thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hi, John.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Just a couple quick ones, Dave. With the PNG gas, is that all contracted sales at this stage
because you had some spot cargoes initially?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, we've been basically selling – because the project has started up months early, the
current cargoes that I talked about, they're basically by definition going in on a spot basis. And we're pleased with our
ability to place those cargoes at attractive prices. As we get down to later on and the contracts all kick in, about 95% of
the production is contracted on long-term contracts tied to the price of oil. And that is certainly part of, if you'll recall
back at the analyst meeting when we said we would take the percentage of our total upstream portfolio production from
about 63% or 64% liquids or liquids-linked up to about 69%, this is just an example of that.
But yeah, the cargoes that we're placing now are basically spot, but into the market. But again, we've been able to place
them and pleased with how that went. And then really looking forward to getting this project continuing on; and again,
just very pleased with the startup and very pleased that we were able to bring that project in under a budget that was
two years old. The industry has gotten used to those annual updates of budgets on LNG projects and costs going up
annually. Again, we're very pleased to bring this thing in early and under our budget.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Thanks. Last one for me is on your tax rate; your effective tax rate was low. Maybe you said
something, but I missed it.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Let me give you a little more color on that. You did see an effective tax rate around 41% or
42% or so. That is down from last year and also a little bit down from what we saw in the first quarter.
The real impact you're seeing there is just a combination of the mix of our businesses, upstream, downstream,
chemical, geographic, some of our portfolio management activities, the expiry of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession of
course, as is typical. Asset sales tend to have a lower tax rate than earnings from your operations, so all of that drove us
a little low here in the second quarter. I can tell you without giving specific guidance and a specific number, but a
normalized tax rate going forward ought to be somewhere in the mid-40%s compared to upper 40%s of prior history,
somewhere on that order or magnitude, just to give you a feel for how that impact might roll through going forward.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Great, thanks very much, Dave.

clarification. But I wanted to ask about the U.S. liquids performance relative to your internal expectations. That's an
area that has outperformed our model. You've given us some great detail on the call, so thanks for that. But I wasn't
sure if you had said that the U.S. liquids production was tracking in line with the internal plan or it was outperforming.
So I just wanted to clarify there, as we try to think through the ultimate potential of your LRS [Liquids Rich Shale]
portfolio in light of some of the longer-term guidance you gave at the Analyst Day previously.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Guy, thanks for the opportunity to clarify that a little bit. We are slightly ahead of our
internal expectations for the year in the U.S. on liquids. I mentioned in total relative to what we talked about at the
analyst meeting, we're spot-on. So with the puts and takes, think about it as still maybe a little bit behind on the Kearl

ramp-up, but I addressed that earlier, but slightly ahead in the Lower 48. We are very encouraged with the results we're
seeing. We're very pleased with the additional opportunities. We are adding rigs. We are putting some additional
resources into those areas. But bottom line, to answer your question, we're a little bit ahead of where we even thought
we'd be internally so far this year.
<Q - Guy A. Baber>: Okay, great. I just wanted to confirm that. Thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you.

And our last question comes from Allen Good with Morningstar.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Allen.
<Q - Allen Good>: Good morning, Dave. Thanks for getting me in here. I'm sorry if I missed it, but on the U.S. natural
gas production, it looks like declines have been slowing over the past few quarters. This quarter we actually saw
sequential growth. Can you talk a little bit behind the moves there and what we may expect for the rest of the year and
maybe into next year as well?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: If we look at the gas business, we're sequentially up just a hair, but really about flat; down
year on year, which is also consistent with what we talked about at the analyst meeting, so you are seeing that
year-on-year decline as we move those resources more into the liquids side. If we're looking sequentially, I wouldn't
read too much into that. We are about flat. It's probably just timing of fracking and completions and bringing wells onto
sale.
I would say as a follow-up to the prior question, everything we're doing on the gas side is per the plan. That's a broad
statement as well as in the U.S. So the second quarter, we had some good performance. But again, I wouldn't want to
give an indication that our full-year outlook on the gas side is any different than what we might have said at the analyst
meeting. We are seeing the bump up, of course, from the early startup of PNG. But then on the other hand, we came out
of a very warm winter in Europe, and those volumes were down fairly significantly.
So I think what I would just say to wrap up your question and the call, think about all the things we laid out for you at
the analyst meeting, both strategically and the strategic choices we're making and upgrading our portfolio, high value,
higher margin, higher unit profit products into the market. That's across all of our businesses; selective investments to
continue to press those strategic advantages, and then zeroing in on upstream production volumes right on what we had
expected and maybe a little better in a couple areas. And again, if you look at that year-to-date free cash flow chart and
you look at the progress we've made in a number of areas, again, we're very pleased with how our first half is turning
out so far this year.
<Q - Allen Good>: Okay, great. Thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: All right, thank you.
