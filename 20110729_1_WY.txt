Joining me this morning our Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer.
This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported Q2 2011 net earnings of $10 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, on net sales of
$1.8 billion. Second quarter earnings include after-tax charges of $22 million for special items, $16 million for loss on
the early extinguishment of debt and an impairment charge of $6 million for the expected sale of the Hardwoods
business. The company's cash balance decreased $582 million, primarily due to debt repayment. At the end of the
second quarter, Weyerhaeuser's cash and cash equivalent was $181 million (sic) [$881 million].
Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. This package includes the GAAP
reconciliation of special items. In our discussion of the business segments, we will refer to Charts 4 through 10.

Chart 4, changes in contribution to earnings by segment before special items: this chart illustrates the change in
contribution by business segments from first quarter 2011 to second quarter 2011. My comments reviewing the second
quarter refer to changes from first quarter unless otherwise noted.
We begin our business segment discussion of the second quarter with Timberlands, Chart 5 and 6. In the second
quarter, Timberlands contributed $112 million to pre-tax earnings, $23 million more than first quarter. Pre-tax earnings
were $89 million in first quarter before special items. Average third party price realizations rose 9% in the West driven
by Chinese demand. Southern third party price realizations were flat in the quarter. Fee harvest volumes increased 8%.
This increase was in part due to Chinese demand for logs. Export volume increased 31% from first quarter. Costs were
higher in the West due to roads and diesel. Higher diesel cost also affected the South. Non-strategic land dispositions
were $34 million in second quarter.
Wood Products, Chart 7 and 8: excluding a $9 million charge for the expected sale of the Hardwoods business, the
Wood Products loss widened by $16 million in the second quarter to a loss of $52 million. In Q1, Wood Products lost
$36 million. Lumber price realizations declined 5%, or $14 per thousand board. Oriented strand board prices fell 7%, or
$14 per thousand square feet. TJI sales realizations were 1% lower than last quarter, and solid section realizations were
3% higher. Sales volumes increased across all product lines except plywood, partially offsetting lower selling prices
and higher costs.
Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9: Cellulose Fibers contributed $80 million to pre-tax earnings in Q2. This was $6 million less
than Q1 pre-tax earnings of $86 million. There were four scheduled maintenance outages in the quarter, compared with
two in the first quarter. The annual mill maintenance schedule has been completed for the year. Maintenance costs were
$18 million higher due to the annual outages, and pulp production was 6% lower. Pulp price realizations increased $48
per air dried metric ton, or 5%. Pulp sales volume decreased 2% due to weakening demand from China.
Real Estate, Chart 10: second quarter pre-tax earnings for WRECO was $8 million, a $9 million increase in the
contribution to earnings. In the first quarter, WRECO had a pre-tax loss of $1 million. Closings of single-family homes
seasonally increased 26% from 363 units in the first quarter to 459 units in the second quarter. However, closings
declined 27% from the year-ago quarter. Last year's second quarter benefited from the housing tax credit. Average
single family prices declined 7% from $419,000 to $391,000 due to mix. Gross margins increased to 22.4% from
21.7% in the first quarter. The backlog of single family homes sold, but not closed increased to 673 homes.
And finally, corporate and other: before special items, corporate and other contributed $19 million more to earnings in
Q2. Corporate and other includes net pre-tax charges of $11 million related to discontinued operations. This includes
operating earnings of $2 million for Westwood Shipping Lines and charges of $13 million for other discontinued
operations, primarily an environmental remediation reserve for a previously divested facility.
I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Fulton.
Patricia M. Bedient
Dan, before you start, this is Patty. I just want to make one clarification to Kathy's comments on the cash balance. It
sounded like she said $181 million. She meant to say $881 million. The cash decrease of $582 million for the quarter
was correct. The cash balance at the end of the quarter is $881 million. Okay, Dan?
Daniel S. Fulton
Thanks for that correction. Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.
Despite continued weakness in U.S. housing, and the overall U.S. economy, we continue to make progress against our
goal with delivering superior, sustainable returns for our shareholders. In addition to focusing on improving operating
performance, we took steps in the quarter that strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity and announced two
divestments of non-strategic assets. Our overall financial performance is not where it needs to be, and we remain

focused on those variables we can control to improve performance in today's difficult markets.
In my remarks this morning, I want to provide some context related to broader macroeconomic conditions that affect
our results, in particular, U.S. housing conditions and demand from China. Then, I'll discuss highlights of our quarterly
progress in each business segment and key strategic goals before turning to Patty, who will cover our outlook for the
third quarter plus financial comments.
Conditions in the U.S. housing market continue to be weak. Growth in GDP, employment, and consumer confidence
are all necessary for a housing recovery; and unfortunately, we saw little progress during the quarter on any of those
indicators. GDP growth was less than 2% for the quarter, slightly worse than the first quarter and weaker than expected.
Employment growth is stalled as evidenced by the recent June figures of over 9% unemployment. Consumer
confidence remains weak, affected by high unemployment, increasing gas and food prices, and the budget deficit
debate.
Facing these headwinds, we find ourselves in a housing market that is no better than last year's very weak market. In
light of continued sluggish conditions, 2011 estimates for single family starts have decreased to fewer than 500,000 and
forecasters are now pushing the beginning of the housing recovery out to 2012.
Although we faced challenging near-term market conditions, we continue to be bullish on housing demand over the
longer term as the U.S. returns to trend demand levels. We're well-positioned to take full advantage of the housing
recovery in the U.S., as well as to build on our unique strengths to participate in the growth of global markets.
As I've discussed before, Asia has long been an important market for Weyerhaeuser's Timberlands, Cellulose Fibers,
and Wood Products businesses. China's recent dramatic growth makes this market even more attractive to us. Last
quarter, we discussed the positive effect of strong Chinese demand on our first quarter results, particularly in our
Timberlands and Cellulose Fibers segments. Demand from China continued to be an important force in the markets
early in the second quarter, but late in the quarter, there was a noticeable reduction in both price and volume. Some of
this change shows up in our second quarter results, and will affect our outlook for the third quarter. Despite this recent
pullback, overall demand is still higher than a year ago, and we believe China will continue to be an important,
growing, long-term market for our products.
Let me now turn to a discussion of business and company highlights for the quarter. Earnings from our Timberlands
segment were stronger than anticipated, as we took full advantage of the opportunity presented by strong demand from
Asia. Harvest volume and prices were up from Q1 in response to strong export markets off the West Coast. Our
logistically advantaged Western Timberlands allowed us to capitalize on these strong market conditions resulting in a
31% increase in export volume from Q1.
During the quarter, the Chinese share of our export volume increased to 26%, compared to 15% one year ago. Although
we are now seeing somewhat of a retreat in demand from China from the first quarter high, our Japan markets continue
strong even after the tragic earthquake and tsunami earlier this year. Our Japanese export business continues to benefit
from our close, long-term customer relationships, our premium Douglas Fir logs and a highly efficient supply chain.
Despite continued operating improvements in our Wood Products business, our financial results were weaker than we
expected, largely caused by continued softness in U.S. housing, which translated into overall declining product prices.
Sales volumes increased versus the first quarter across all major product lines, even with a weak seasonal increase in
housing starts. This allowed us to reduce inventory as we produced less than we sold in the quarter. Sales volume
increases were offset by lower realizations in all products except engineered solid sections. In addition, log costs
increased in the west.
Though performance in this business is still below our expectations, we generated $23 million in cash as we began to
work down the seasonal first quarter build up in working capital. We continue to pull all levers to improve performance
in today's low level of housing starts, including expanding our customer base into new geographies and markets outside
of U.S. housing while continuing a relentless focus on improving costs and utilization of our operating facilities. We
remain focused on the goal of being cash positive in this business for the full year, but it will be challenging in these
difficult markets.

In WRECO, our homebuilding business, our performance in the quarter exceeded our expectations. Although traffic
was down 15% year-over-year, our conversion rates have increased and we continue to realize strong margins relative
to our competitors. Four of our five homebuilders increased sales year-over-year, and the business earned $8 million
for the quarter. WRECO remains focused on the basics: cost, cash flow and delivering homes to highly satisfied
customers. Our customer satisfaction scores measured by willingness to refer are among the highest in the industry at
over 95%, compared to industry averages of 86% to 90%.
The primary story for the quarter in our Cellulose Fibers business is that we safely completed four planned annual
maintenance shutdowns with zero recordable incidents. With our scheduled annual maintenance now complete, we're
positioned to run full for the balance of the year. Increased price of realizations for the quarter were anticipated as were
the expenses related to our planned maintenance. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw some price softening due to a
decline in demand from China, which resulted in financial results slightly less than expected. The decline in Chinese
demand was especially evident in decreasing pricing relating to dissolving pulps and NBSK. This decline affected sales
of our Pearl product, which is being used as a dissolving wood pulp extender.
Finally, I want to address progress that we continued to make during the quarter to implement our strategic direction.
During the quarter, we reached agreement to sell two non-strategic businesses, our Hardwoods business and our
Westwood Shipping Line. We have owned and operated these business for several decades, and as we assessed our
future direction, we determined that neither were core to our ongoing strategy. By selling them to new owners, we will
better be able to sharpen our own management focus on our long-term strategic direction. Both transactions are
scheduled to close in the third quarter, so Patty will discuss more specifics in her outlook comments. Although we are
selling these businesses, I'm pleased that we will continue our relationship with our long-term associates as the
Hardwoods organization will continue to be a customer for our log, and we will continue to ship products to our Asian
customers on Westwood Shipping Lines.
The final element of forward progress during the quarter was continued actions we took to strengthen our balance sheet
and liquidity position by refinancing our credit facility, repaying our 2012 maturity notes and ending the quarter with a
strong cash position.
And now I'll ask Patty to discuss our outlook and provide a financial summary, and then I'll provide a quick recap
before we invite your questions. Patty?
Patricia M. Bedient
Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the third quarter by business segment is summarized on
Chart 11. I'll begin the outlook discussion with Timberlands. Slowing export demand from China is expected to result
in lower sales realizations and volumes in our western operations. In addition, we expect domestic markets will
continue to soften as sawmills take increased down time in response to weakening lumber markets, also contributing to
the fall-off in volumes and prices. In the south, realizations for logs are expected to moderate only slightly as those
markets did not experience the run up in pricing during the second quarter that we saw in the West. Volumes may
increase seasonally. We anticipate seasonal increases in costs for silviculture and road spending in the third quarter,
compared to the second. Earnings from non-strategic land sales are anticipated to be much lower in the third quarter.
Overall, we expect that earnings in the Timberlands segment will be significantly lower in the third quarter, compared
to the second.
Average sales realizations in Wood Products are expected to be 3% to 4% lower for both lumber and OSB, compared
to the average for the second quarter as market trends reflect soft demand in most geographies. Realizations in
engineered wood products are estimated to increase around 1% to 2% reflecting a July 1 announced price increase.
Sales volumes are expected to decrease across most product lines, although OSB volumes may increase somewhat. Log
costs should decrease, especially in the west, and we expect to take more downtime in the third quarter in lumber due to
weak market conditions as we continue to focus on matching supply with demand. We've already taken six weeks
downtime in July, compared to three weeks in Q2. Excluding the results of the Hardwood business, we expect overall

operating results in our Wood Products segment to be comparable to the second quarter.
In Cellulose Fibers, pulp sales realizations are expected to decrease as the pullback in demand from China continues.
However, this should be partially offset by somewhat higher shipment volumes. We had completed all of our planned
annual maintenance outages for 2011 by the end of the second quarter. As a result, we will have a significant
improvement to maintenance costs and productivity. In addition, we expect lower costs for operating supplies and
contract services primarily related to the reduction in maintenance outages. We also anticipate slightly lower seasonal
energy costs. Although market conditions have softened, we expect that earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will
increase significantly, compared to the second quarter.
Markets in our Real Estate segment continue be very weak. While we do believe that markets have reached their
bottom, we don't see any near-term catalyst that would overcome the continued lackluster job growth and low
consumer confidence. Despite these market challenges, we expect closings to increase seasonally in the third quarter.
We anticipate closings of over 500 in this quarter, compared to 459 in the second quarter. Prices are expected to be flat
to slightly lower due to mix and margins should remain relatively strong at 20% to 22%. We expect slightly improved
earnings in our Real Estate segment, compared to the second quarter and we have not assumed any land transactions in
our third quarter outlook.
Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. During the second quarter we used $551 million to retire debt,
which was originally due in March of next year. This amount includes principal, interest, and the premium paid on
early extinguishment. While this was a significant use of cash in the quarter, we anticipate an overall interest savings in
excess of the premium by executing the May cold call. In addition, we paid $30 million of regularly scheduled debt
maturities in the quarter. We ended the second quarter with cash of over $880 million. Debt maturities for the next five
years total just over $600 million, with $200 million due in 2012.
Also, in the second quarter, we replaced our bank credit facility, which was set to expire at the end of this year. The
new facility has a four-year term and retains the $1 billion of credit availability. We have no borrowings outstanding
under this agreement, and so we have substantial liquidity and a strong balance sheet despite challenging market
conditions.
Capital expenditures for the first six months totaled just under $100 million dollars, and we still estimate expenditures
for the full year to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million. As we have previously disclosed, we estimate
pension contributions this year for our Canadian plants of approximately $80 million and most of this will be paid in
the third quarter.
As Dan discussed, we are scheduled to close the sales of our Hardwoods and Shipping businesses in the third quarter.
We expect to receive total proceeds of approximately $160 million-plus transfer of long-term lease obligations. Total
proceeds for the Hardwoods business will be approximately $108 million, of which $25 million is a note receivable,
and the remainder in cash. In the third quarter, we will recognize a non-cash pension charge of approximately $10
million to recognize amortization of previously deferred costs. Upon the sale of our Shipping business, we anticipate
cash proceeds of approximately $53 million, and we will book a pre-tax gain of approximately $45 million.
Now I'll turn the call back to Dan for some closing comments, and I looked forward to your questions. Dan?
Daniel S. Fulton
Thanks, Patty. Before we turn to your questions, I want to make a few comments about the current demand for
timberland since we often get questions from you about what we're seeing in the market. After several years of
relatively quiet market conditions, we have seen increased interest from a wide range of investors in the south, as well
as the Pacific Northwest. Recent interest has come from what I consider to be traditional Timberland investors,
including other forest products companies, TMOs, and high net worth family interests. This year, we've also seen
interest from a variety of conservation-oriented investment funds. We are routinely engaged in smaller timberland
transactions, normally structured as exchanges, through which we are working to improve our overall returns by

blocking up land adjacent to existing ownership where we can benefit from management efficiencies. In the case of the
Pacific Northwest, we're continuing a long-term strategy of shifting our ownership to land best suited for Douglas Fir.
Our sales of non-strategic coastal properties over the last few years as a result of our strategy in the northwest of
moving out of land that was primarily Hemlock and expanding our Douglas Fir ownership. As an example, earlier this
month, we completed the acquisition of approximately 6,300 acres of prime Douglas Fir timberland in Washington that
is adjacent to our own logistically advantaged holdings using exchange proceeds from the sale of non-strategic acreage
in Arkansas that closed in the second quarter. We have described our long-term strategy to target profitable growth in
our timberland holdings, and we will continue to explore opportunities to leverage our timberlands management
expertise to add shareholder value.
And now, we welcome your questions.
Kathryn F. McAuley
Sylvia, would you please open the floor for questions?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Hey, Mark.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Patty, can you just help us to size the kind of quarter-to-quarter impact from no maintenance in
the pulp business?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure, Mark. I think as we talked about on the second quarter call, maintenance costs run
about $1 million a day, and we had just over 50 days of downtime in the quarter related to maintenance. So, and we had
prepaid some of that maintenance in the first quarter. So, the effect is, of the maintenance cost itself, would be
somewhere just a little under the $50 million number. And then you have increased productivity because we will be
running those days instead of paying the maintenance costs. And as I said, we also have a little bit less cost in the way
of operating supplies and contract services because of the maintenance. So, I think that will give you a delta.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Really, that's a – net-net, that's a number that's going to be north of $50 million, maybe well north
of $50 million?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, I wouldn't want to put a point on it any finer than what I just gave you.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Okay. All right. That's fine. Dan, just a question about your building products business, especially
the distribution business over at iLevel.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Yeah.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: I'm just curious about how you think about that business, whether it's just a channel market for
Weyerhaeuser products or a little bit more? I had heard that you'd moved away from selling non-Weyerhaeuser
products and have now moved back to selling some of those. So, maybe you can just walk us through how you think
about that business?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Before we moved into our iLevel strategy, the distribution business had a much broader range
of products, and as we set up our iLevel strategy and brought all of the businesses under that brand, we turned it into
more of a channel, Mark, as you note. And fundamentally, it's been a channel for our engineered wood products

business. As we've evaluated that business over the last 12 to 18 months, especially in this continued downturn in
housing, we have decided to take on some additional third party distribution and sale of products that are related to new
home construction where we can improve our efficiencies and logistics in selling those products out of those yards
were we can put them on a truck that's already going to a job site with our engineered wood products, and it will make
it a contribution against our fixed costs and help to improve the margins in that business.
And so what you observed is an evolution where we used to distribute a number of third party products, and as you
observed, we moved away from that. And now we are taking on some strategic third party products, not of the scale
that it used to be, but those that are complementary to our own.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Okay. And then my last question, any thoughts on whether we may see significant further
non-strategic asset sales over the next 12 months?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We have nothing to announce. We had earlier talked about our Shipping business, and the
Hardwoods business. We're pleased that we found good buyers for those businesses, and we'll be closing those
transactions, as we said, in the third quarter, but we have nothing else planned at this point in time.
<Q - Mark Wilde>: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, Dan.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Next question?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from CLSA.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly MBA>: Thank you. Dan, two things, I'm trying to get a handle on the difference between the
fee harvest volume growth, and the price movement in the West versus the South. I mean, obviously, it's not quite
apples-to-apples, I realize that. But the prices in the West have moved up nicely. Prices in the South are going
absolutely nowhere. Are we really just looking at a Southern market that's super-badly oversupplied? Or is there more
going on in your price realizations – and understanding there's mix in there too?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: The most significant difference between the West and the South is the fact that in the West we
have a strong export market. And so that has driven volumes in the West, but more importantly it's driven price, Mark.
So, the demand – and it's not just China. It is the steady demand from Japan. China has been on the margin, the most
significant factor, but in our export business, we also saw on a quarter-over-quarter basis a doubling in the percentage
of exports to Korea. So, that has caused price movement on the West Coast. In the South, the South is truly more
dependent upon U.S. housing and so, Mark -
<Q - Mark W. Connelly MBA>: But, Dan, when I look at the data, more broadly, I'm seeing, granted, stronger
volume growth in the West, but volumes in the South are up pretty good, too -
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Yes.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly MBA>: – and that's what surprises me.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Our volume was up. You see in the charts that accompanied our release, our volume is up in
the South, both on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but also on a year-over-year basis. So, we've had opportunities to
expand third party sales at stable prices and we've taken advantage of that.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly MBA>: Okay. One more question and I'll be done. Just a sort of a theoretical question, how
much more fiber do you think you have in your system in aggregate as the result of the reduced harvest since 2008?
Dick always used to remind us that, you know, if you don't cut the trees down, you know, they grow every year. So, I'm
just trying to gauge how much more fiber you've been able to accumulate over this period relative to where you might
have been otherwise?

<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I can't give you that number just because I don't have it available to me right now, Mark. I
mean, clearly, we had significant deferrals in '09 and '10 because of the slow market. As you've observed, our volumes
have picked up. And as you note, the trees do continue to grow, and so the fiber volumes in large part have increased
during the period of deferral, but I don't have a number that I can provide to you.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly MBA>: Okay. I'll let it go. Thank you.

You next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Yes, and good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Hi, Chip.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Just a quick follow-up to the question about the swing in the Cellulose business. Could you give
us, Patty, an idea of what the maintenance costs were last year in the second quarter 2010?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah, I don't have that in front of me, Chip, but we also – quarter-over-quarter you really
have to look at how many maintenance days we've had, and how many mills were down, and then what the nature of
the maintenance was. And just by way of illustration, as we talked about in the second quarter last call, we had four
mills down, but we had an extended maintenance at our New Bern mill because we were actually putting in a capital
project.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Gotcha.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: So they're really – they're not quarter-over-quarter exactly the same and year-over-year,
that's way I tried to give you sort of the amount of maintenance days and to give you some information that would help
you with that. But we don't have any maintenance left for the rest of this year.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Gotcha. Okay. And secondly, you mentioned you had $34 million in strategic land sales in the
quarter. What should we – and I know they're very lumpy, but what should we at this point consider to be kind of a
normal rate and you could either give us an annualized number because it is lumpy or what you think it could be per
quarter?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, we don't have a set budget for those because they are non-strategic land sales. As we
look forward to the third quarter, I wouldn't anticipate we would have any significant level of land sales, or at least at
this point. But as Dan said in his comments, we are in the market all the time to be opportunistic up to – as we find
places where we can upgrade our portfolio. And to the extent that we can transact those, we will act on them. That's
why they are lumpy, and why they're hard to forecast. But probably as you look back over time, excluding the large
land sales like the 80,000-some acres we transacted in the first quarter, they're probably in that ballpark of $80 million
to $100 million as an annual basis.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Gotcha. And then just lastly, Patty, on the two transactions you all announced for the third
quarter, can you give us the magnitude of the lease assumption you're giving – the obligation you're giving up, as well
as, sort of, the maturity date of the note for the Hardwoods business?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah. The lease obligations have to do with the shifts. They're operating lease obligations,
and they go over a number of years. So, I don't have that number for you, Chip. Your second question was, I think, the

Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Merrill Lynch.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Hi, everyone. Good morning. I mean, quick -
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, George.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Quick question first, back on maintenance, as we think to next year within Cellulose Fibers,
should there be any material difference between the amount of maintenance and downtime you take next year versus
2011 as we think longer term? Obviously, you've got this change in maintenance scheduled that you're planning. But as
I recall, that will tend to start helping your earnings in '13 and '14. So, any details and confirmation, that would be
appreciated.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: George, you're correct. When we met in May, we talked about our longer term initiative of
stretching out the normal planned maintenance schedules from 12 months to every 18 months, and it will take several
years for us to be implementing that. That will start to show up really late 2012, but in terms of showing up in the P&L,
it'll be 2013, 2014. As we take our normal annual shutdowns today, we are making some incremental improvement that
help to move us along the path that will allow us to implement that change. But, as you note, it's going to be several
years before we see the results of that.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Okay. Dan, you mentioned a couple times that China had slowed in its purchases of your
products, whether it's timber or cellulose fiber, towards the end of the quarter. Is there a way to put a figure on what the
change or rate of change was at the end of the quarter?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I don't have a specific number that I can give you for that. Let me just talk about how it
showed up in each of our businesses. In the case of our export log business, we were able to make most of our
shipments during the quarter, and so it's more of a prospective change both in volume and anticipated price. So, we've
seen some price drops for logs that are being exported. Most of that will start to be evident in the third quarter. In our
Cellulose Fibers business, the most dramatic change occurred with our Pearl product. That is small tonnage for us, but
has been very high margin. And what happened there, it was really early June that the Chinese government
fundamentally started to tighten credit for businesses in China, they cut back purchases. We think that's a shorter term
phenomenon, but it's playing out in the third quarter forecast that Patty provided.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Okay.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: And the good news, let me, just talking about Pearl a little bit, that's a product that we make
by swinging production from our normal fluff production. And so, it's not a dedicated facility to the extent that prices
fall back. There's still an attractive margin, but we can swing that volume back to fluff, which is a big advantage for us.
So, we are opportunistically taking advantage of pricing opportunities in that product, but we have plenty of demand
for our fluff production.

<Q - George L. Staphos>: Okay. Last question and I'll turn over. Your cash flow in the quarter was actually better
than I initially thought. Congratulations on that. Nonetheless, the markets that you're in obviously are not giving you
any favors in terms of your ability to improve return. So, if we think about the next 12 to 18 months, Dan, what do you
think will be the source of the most meaningful return improvement within your business? Will it be addressing capital
structure? Will it be potential return of value? Will it be further portfolio moves or do you think it will be on improving
your operation to cost position? What do you think are the most likely source of return improvement? Thanks, and
good luck in the quarter.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Thank you. So, we are focused on improving cash flow generation from our Wood Products
business. As we noted, we are in challenging markets. We had targeted that we would be cash breakeven for the year.
Our focus is to continue to reach that goal. But in the market that we find ourselves, that will be very challenging. But
in our Wood Products business, the focus is to generate cash and to improve margins and to improve revenues.
In our Home Building business, our focus has been to generate cash through normal operations of building homes, plus
we are an opportunistic seller of land and lots to other builders. We've had some success in doing so, and we expect
that activity to continue as the housing market starts to recover and many builders will find themselves being land
short, and they will need to purchase lots and we'll have some to sell them.
In our Timberlands business, we do generate significant cash there, and what we would be looking at in our
Timberlands business is some market recovery, especially in the South. In the West, we benefited in cash flow because
of the run-up in prices coming from the export markets. As we mentioned, that's softer now, but we would expect that
to recover. China will continue to be a strong buyer of products off the West Coast, and we'll be ready to supply them.
And then our Cellulose Fibers business, we have been on a relatively steady capital spend where we're improving our
facilities. Those spending initiatives have been bringing down our cash production costs. They have been reducing
longer term our maintenance costs, so we will be better positioned to generate cash in the future because of those.
So to your question, what is our focus? It's all of those.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Thanks, Dan.

Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman from UBS.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Hi, Gail.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Good morning, Gail.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Dan, can you talk a little bit about, I guess, what you're seeing in WRECO market by
market? And also, Dan, your comments about improvement in 2012. Can you maybe – I know it's early, but give a little
bit of color how you might see 2012 playing out at this point?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Sure. Let's talk about individual markets within WRECO. Strongest markets within WRECO
have been Washington, D.C. and Houston. And it's no secret why that is. It's because they have relatively strong
employment. Washington, D.C. went into the downturn earlier. It's come out ahead of some of the other markets.
There's not a significant overbuild of inventory. Volumes are not what they used to be, but prices are recovering and
we're actually seeing some incremental improvement in price. Houston is an energy economy, and so they've come
through this market in relatively good shape.
We're seeing improved activity in our Trendmaker operation, both from our routine activity with our Trendmaker
homes plus we have some products enhancements and extensions that have helped us to increase market share and

increase volume.
Phoenix is a market that's actually showing some growth now. And it, once again, it's an employment story, relatively
strong employment. Our activity is up in Phoenix, and we're starting to see some improvement in margins in that
market.
In Southern California, we've enjoyed during the downturn relatively steady demand in San Diego, and we've had high
margins in San Diego because of our historic land position. That continues to be the case. Market's a little bit softer
than it was six months ago in San Diego, but that's more of a relative comment.
We're seeing some improvement in the Pacific Northwest, which had been soft for a period of time. And that's, once
again, related to job growth. Relatively more improved job picture in the Pacific Northwest related to the Boeing
Airplane Company, and their ramp up in production, plus other new employment.
And in Las Vegas, we're still struggling. It's a tough market, but the inventory is being worked down and we are
starting to see some improvement in that market.
And then the last – the submarket is the LA, and the Inland Empire. We're doing better than others in the Inland
Empire, and we're expecting that market to pick-up a bit.
So it is it is a slower recovery than we had anticipated, Gail, but we're seeing some positive movement. As we talked
and mentioned in my comments, we had four of our five home builders had greater sales in the quarter than they did a
year ago, and one year ago we had to have the housing tax credit. And so that's good news. The market where we did
not see improvement was Southern California and Las Vegas, and so that's the one that is our big engine and we need
to see some improvement in order to see a real significant pick-up in the WRECO activity. But we've been pleased at
WRECO that we're profitable. Our results generally are better than those of our peers. And as Patty mentioned, we're
expecting a bit of improvement in the third quarter.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And just two things. One, just any thought, early thoughts on how 2012 plays out?
And then and a quick question on fluff pulp.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: At this point, we look at a number of housing forecasts. We prepare our own, but we look at
others. Just to give you a range, Gail, in 2012, we have outside forecasts that range from total housing starts of 630,000
to over 1 million. So, there is a wide range of uncertainty related to 2012. We're planning conservatively on the low
side and sizing our operation for a slower market. But because of our land position, we're able to respond relatively
quickly if we have market opportunity. So, we're focused on maintaining margin, not chasing volume. But all the
forecasts that I see would suggest that we are expecting to see recovery to start in 2012. Clearly, it didn't happen in
2011. And when we went into the year, we were expecting 2011 to be somewhat of a mirror image of 2010. So, 2010
had a strong first half, a very weak second half. We were expecting a weak first half of 2011 with improvement in the
second half of the year. At this point, we're not expecting to see significant improvement in the back half, and so we're
planning for that and we're focused on recovery starting to take shape in 2012.
We do need to see improved consumer confidence. We need to see improved employment and longer term, we need to
have a resolution of the mortgage securities market, in particular, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And just a quick question. You talked about the
dissolving pulp and a little bit about NBSK. A competitor yesterday was talking about seeing spot pricing in fluff off
pretty significantly, as much as $100 a ton. And I'm just wondering what you're seeing specifically in fluff and kind of
what your outlook will be over the next quarter or two?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: The fluff market has been certainly more stable. The reason I talked about dissolving pulp and
NBSK is I was trying to focus on the impact of China because those products were going into China really as
substitutes for cotton. And because of the steps that the Chinese government took to tighten credit, prices dropped
significantly. In terms of fluff prices, Patty provided our forecast for the third quarter in terms of what we're seeing
directionally. There's been some additional supply that's come on with Domtar at Plymouth, and the Alabama Pine
facility. That's had some impact in putting more product on the market.

On the other hand, the fluff market continues to grow globally and all of our large customers are concerned about
maintaining supply because they have ambitious growth plans. And so longer term, we're really positive about fluff.
And then we have some fluff capacity that's been shifted to dissolving pulp, and so we see the market stabilizing.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber from Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Hi. Good morning. You had in your comments about the Cellulose Fiber outlook especially
given the weakening in China, your comments mostly in late June and into the third quarter. Could you remind us how
much or what percentage of that division's sales actually comes from China?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: We have about, as you think about our sale of fibers business broadly, our pulp business,
we have about a third of our production is sold domestically, about a third to Europe and about a third to Asia.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: And the Asia would be split somewhat evenly between Japan and China or there would be a
much bigger China focus?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: It would be there is a significant focus on Japan, and China would also be an important
market. But Japan, overall, is a very important market to us.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Okay. So, China is just going to be the biggest market for Pearl basically?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: China has been the market for Pearl. When we look – and Pearl is a very, very small
percentage of our production. But on the margin, it has been a significant contributor. Once again, at the margin, our
Asian sales are pulp, both NBSK and fluff. But also Asia is a major market for our liquid packaging board, which
comes out of our Longview facility so and that is primarily going into Japan. So, Japan's our largest market by far in
Asia. We talked about Japan on the last call because it was right after the earthquake and tsunami and we had had some
disruption. For the most part, all of our customers' operations have stabilized. They've shifted production between their
own facilities and Japan remains very stable for us.
It's also an important consideration, not just in Cellulose Fibers, but as we talk about our export log business, once
again, to make the point, China has been terrific for us, as well as the rest of the industry because it's been new demand
from the West Coast. But our large, long-term export market has been and will continue to be Japan.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: That's helpful. Thanks. But following up on Japan, have you seen any pick-up there lately
just as a result of some earthquake rebuilding start? Or do you think that's still going to be pushed out another six to
nine months, maybe more?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We have not seen a pick-up yet. Initially, the focus in Japan was on emergency housing. We
saw some initial disruption in our log shipments. Those have all recovered. We would be expecting longer term to see a
pick-up in lumber exports, but lumber would be primarily going into new construction. We think new construction will
be delayed another three to six months before we start to see that impact because they are still dealing with
infrastructure. They're completing their temporary housing initiative, and they will shift now to longer term production
of permanent housing and that should benefit the West Coast markets for lumber, perhaps some panels for those that
are equipped to deal with metric sizes, as well as logs.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Okay. And last question regarding WRECO, have you – another one of the home building
competitors that's a partner of yours in South Edge has taken a pretty sizable write-down in the second quarter. Do you
guys have any remaining exposure to that? Do think the continued settlements there could end up being an issue in the
third and fourth quarters of this year?

<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We are very small partner in that enterprise, and we believe we're fully reserved and we took
those reserves some time ago. So, we're anxiously awaiting the settlement, but we think we're fully reserved. Now,
once the settlement is finally, agreed to, there'll be some cash implications. We build that into our cash forecast for the
balance of the year, so we're not expecting any surprises at this point.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover from D.A. Davidson.
<Q - Steve Chercover>: Good morning, everyone. Changing gears a little bit, I guess via your Catchlight joint
venture, you've entered into a relationship with Kior Biofuel. But can you elaborate on this relationship? I'm sure you'll
be selling the biomass and Catchlight will funnel to the fuel back to Chevron, but what kind of volume is committed?
And is it a needle mover? Will we see more of these?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: It is too early to tell whether it's a needle mover, Steve, and I think we will be likely to see
more of these. So, we do have a joint venture with Chevron. It's called Catchlight Energy. That joint venture's been
operating for about three years. The initial focus in that joint venture was to combine the expertise and intellectual
capital of Weyerhaeuser. If you think about the oil analogy is the upstream provider of biomass, and the Chevron is
downstream in the refining business. We have over time looked at all of the technologies that are out there and have
determined at this point that we will form more relationships with those like EOR that bring in some unique
technology. Weyerhaeuser's role in that relationship will be providing biomass. Chevron's role will be to take away the
product that would be manufactured or refined by the curers, because ultimately the challenge in this business is you
have to distribute it and get it to an end user. So, the strengths of our partnership are that we, better than anyone I think,
understand the upstream challenges and opportunities. Chevron covers the downstream, and we are likely to be entering
into a number of agreements in what we would call a wraparound strategy, where we have the opportunity to work with
those that have a variety of technologies.
We think there's great long-term potential, but it's too early to tell, and I would not be able to speculate at this point
timing for those technologies. But we're excited to be working with some that have been able to get funding. And we're
going to try to move the dial here and develop some renewable fuel alternatives for this country.
<Q - Steve Chercover>: So we should look at Kior something as the outsourced refinery?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Yes. Not the refining – they are a converter of biomass into a product that then would go into
a refinery.
<Q - Steve Chercover>: Okay. Because I guess at some point -
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: So if you think about it, it's a three-step process.
<Q - Steve Chercover>: I naively thought that a pulp mill would be a lot like a refinery as well, not being an engineer
or anything. Is that still a possibility?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: I -
<Q - Steve Chercover>: I mean, just to move more of the black liquor perhaps out of your processor or your – it's
good how it is where it's just your source of energy?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Right now we're using the black liquor to provide energy for our own facilities, and that is the
best use. The advantage of our pulp mills is that we have zoned entitled locations with boilers and equipment that can
handle some additional biomass. Plus we are located in areas where we have logistics and sourcing, and the challenge
in the biomass businesses is really logistical. How do you gather it on an economic basis in order to get it to a point
where it's competitive with alternative fuels? So pulp mills are great sources of energy. Black liquor in the near-term is

likely to be used by the pulp mill for its own energy. Yeah.
<Q - Steve Chercover>: Great. Okay. Well, keep us posted.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: The other thing that we are doing is where we had the opportunity, Steve, we have some
facilities where we have turbine generators that are installed where we have excess black liquor or biomass. We can
generate power, and the amount that we don't use we sell it to the grid. So, it helps to bring down our overall energy
costs, as well as create new markets for power.
<Q - Steve Chercover>: Well, some of your friends in the – of the timber REITs have signed some pretty significant
deals for volume even offshore. So, keep us posted as these things materialize.

Your final question comes from the line at Peter Ruschmeier from Barclays Capital.
<Q - Pete Bruce Ruschmeier>: Thank you, and good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Hi, Pete.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Pete.
<Q - Pete Bruce Ruschmeier>: I wanted to come back if I could to Japan for minute, Dan. And I was curious if you
have a high level view of how you think about the rebuilding affecting housing starts? I've seen pretty modest
expectations of 5%, 10%, but then it goes up from there. And are you seeing any, recognizing this could take three to
six months before we get to the front end of this, do you anticipate any different types of demand? In other words,
similar order patterns for logs and lumber or do expect a shift one way or the other?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: It's too early to tell, Pete. There are a number of initiatives underway in Japan in order to
position their home building industry to be able to respond to the need. We have customers that are home builders to
whom we sell lumber, engineered wood products. We expect their activity to begin to ramp up. There's been some
demand on panels, often the West Coast, more coming from Canada than the U.S. The issue on panels historically has
been it's a metric size versus a 4-by-8 panel. On a temporary basis they've been taking some 4-by-8 panels. There may
be some code changes in Japan that would allow more import of product from the West Coast. Our initiative is really to
be working with our existing customers. So, we've got long-term relationships with sawmill operators and with home
builders, and our goal is to provide them products so that they can participate in the rebuild.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: One area, Pete, that we might see late in the quarter or fourth quarter would be in the area
of the plywood operations in Japan, which were hit pretty hard by the earthquake. And some of those are starting to
come back on-line now. So, we would see – it's not a huge market for us, but on the margin that would be another area
of increased activity.
<Q - Pete Bruce Ruschmeier>: Okay. That's helpful. And then shifting gears back to timber, I think you mentioned
previously, I think you said that your harvest plan for the year would be up in the order of 10%. I'm curious if you have
any update on that? And maybe against the backdrop of what you're seeing in the South in terms of the dry weather,
increased availability to logs, and the lower prices, are you thinking about throttling back at all because of the prices to
defer? Or what's your outlook?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We evaluate harvest levels on an ongoing basis. We talked about our second quarter harvest
levels having been up. As we look out third quarter, Patty had comments in her outlook. We had that dry weather. That

allows more activity, but one of the problems with that weather is it's been so bad that, in fact, productivity levels are
down a little bit, because it's just difficult to work in the woods. We will continue to match our harvest levels with
profitable demand. We'll gauge pricing as we look forward and move our harvest. What we do is, fundamentally, we're
always looking to the future, making judgments about future demand and future pricing, and so that's just an ongoing
process. And I don't have any more information for you today, Pete, other than that we'll continue our normal process.
