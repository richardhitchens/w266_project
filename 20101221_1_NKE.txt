MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to NIKE's Fiscal 2011 Second Quarter Conference Call. For those who need to
reference today's press release, you will find it at www.nikebiz.com. Leading today's call is Kelley Hall, Senior
Director, Investor Relations.
Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking
statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC,
including Forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily
indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate
fluctuations, order cancellations, and discounts which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition, it is
important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s business, including equipment, NIKE Golf, Cole Haan,
Converse, Hurley, and Umbro, are not included into these future numbers.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to total wholesale equivalent
sales of NIKE, Inc. businesses that have licensed sales. Wholesale equivalent sales include both reported revenue and
estimations of sales by licensees based on the royalties paid. References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only
intended to provide context as the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not
be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results.
Participants may also make references to other non-public financial and statistically information on non-GAAP
financial measures. Discussions of non-public financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable
GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at NIKE's website, www.nikebiz.com.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kelley Hall, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Miss Hall, you may
begin.
Kelley Hall, Senior Director, Investor Relations
Thank you, operator. Hello everyone, thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2010 – or 2011 second
quarter results.
As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the
appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, nikebiz.com.
Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. CEO Mark Parker, followed by Charlie Denson, President of the NIKE
Brand, and finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer Don Blair who will give you an in-depth review of
our financial results.
Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions
as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event you have
additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to
you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.
I'll now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO Mark Parker.
Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Kelley, and happy holidays, everybody. Today's strong results demonstrate the power of our strategies and the
exciting opportunities we have across the entire NIKE, Inc. portfolio. We grew almost every area of our business,
across brands, categories, products, and geographies. What fuels this growth is our long-term strategy. It was not
short-term in nature. We leveraged the same competitive advantages that have driven NIKE growth consistently
throughout our history, putting the consumer first, fixating on innovative product, and leveraging the power of our
portfolio.
Like any great athlete, we have strong fundamentals. We're able to anticipate and react to opportunity and we stay on
the offense. That's what leaders do, stay flexible and balanced, yet also aggressive and aligned to create and leverage
opportunity, and that's what we did in Q2. NIKE, Inc. revenue was up 10%, NIKE Brand revenue increased 9%,
revenue for our affiliates' brands grew 13%, and as a result, we delivered earnings per share of $0.94 to our investors.
That's up 24% over last year.
The flexibility and power of our portfolio continue to build, and that's a crucial advantage for NIKE. We can really fine
tune how we apply our resources for the greatest return, and we're doing just that across the entire business. We can
attack with a single brand like Converse which just exceeded $1 billion in reported revenue for the past 12 months, or
leverage multiple brands like we do on our Action Sports business. We can drive market growth with a single category
like basketball or running, where revenue and futures are up double digits. We can expand key developing markets like
China or Russia, which continue to increase revenue, EBIT, and futures, and in developed markets like North America,
where innovative product, strong brands, and great retail presentation are driving solid momentum. Flexibility gives us
options, and that keeps us targeted, aggressive, and opportunistic.
We're also very focused on balancing our resources against our biggest opportunities. This is especially powerful when
we leverage innovation to drive growth, and we're creating more opportunity with innovation than ever before. That's
true in our products and our categories, and it's true in how we run the business. Both NIKE Brand footwear and
apparel continue to accelerate. NIKE Brand footwear revenue and futures continue to grow at double digit rates, and
that growth is not based on any single sport or product. It's the result of our category offense and its mix of innovation
and key franchises that we use to drive top line revenue.

In NIKE apparel, we continue to see tremendous momentum in our performance products like Pro Combat. You saw
this all season in college football, and you can expect to see it expand significantly across multiple sports around the
world in the months ahead. That success in performance apparel is behind the growing momentum we see across the
entire apparel business. We're delivering innovation to the competitive athlete, and we're taking that performance ethos
across to the style side of the business, and that's key to being compelling and distinctive in the market.
Innovation also drives how we run the business and how we invest to prepare for long-term success. Sustainability is a
great example. We're very active in this space. Lean manufacturing, open source innovation, renewable energy, closed
loop manufacturing. These are some of the commitments we're making now for the future. We're not waiting. This is
good for the planet and it's important to the success of our business. In an increasingly resource-constrained world, the
more proactive we are, the more nimble and profitable we become.
So when I look at our innovation pipeline, I see a lot more than footwear and apparel. I see a relentless flow of ideas
and opportunities that serve our consumers, our business, our shareholders, and our potential, and I'm very proud of
what we've done and very excited about what's on the way.
Finally, we put the consumer at the center of everything we do and we align ourselves to that consumer. NIKE, Inc. is a
company of highly distinctive brands. For us to perform at our best, these distinctions need to be clear and compelling
wherever we interact with consumers. When we opened our inline Converse stores in Boston and New York this
quarter, consumers experienced a fully-integrated mix of product, brand, and storytell. That's what they expect from us,
whether it's in the NikeTown in London, a Cole Haan store in New York, or an Action Sports store in California. And
we're seeing that commitment to the consumer drive strong sales performance.
This focus on alignment drives two things: growth in our own retail business and more consistency, innovation, and
inspiration into our retail partner doors. I've said many times, when we become a better retailer, we become a better
wholesaler. I think we're seeing that play out as we continue to align new concepts and experiences and launch them in
the marketplace. And we're doing that across the entire business.
Looking ahead, we'll continue to do those things that enable today's great results: listen to the athlete, serve the
consumer, stay nimble, and aggressively pursue opportunities across the NIKE, Inc. portfolio. It's a powerful equation
for profitable, sustainable growth, and one that's not going to change.
Near term, there are some continuing macroeconomic challenges. As supply and demand find a new normal in the
recovering economy, our industry is going to experience margin pressure due to rising input costs. While the impact of
these cost pressures has been delayed for us, these factors have not diminished. We expect to see these external forces
play out for the remainder of the fiscal year. However, the same competitive advantages that fuel our long-term growth
gives us the levers we need to help manage the impact of macro forces over the coming quarters.
You've heard me speak of NIKE's complete offense. Q2 is a great example of that offense in action. Strong
performance from our brands and categories, great new product for consumers, meaningful events around the world,
exciting new retail experiences in store and online, and that's the real power of NIKE flexibility, balance, and
alignment.
Now here's Charlie to take you through the NIKE Brand.
Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand
Thanks, Mark. Good afternoon, everybody. I feel great about where we are halfway through the year. Q2 is another
example of our ability to align innovative product, brand strength, and strong marketplace management to deliver great
financial results, but as always, the proof is in the numbers.
Q2 reported revenue for the NIKE Brand grew 9%, or up 10% on a constant dollar basis, with higher revenue in every
geography except Japan. Constant dollar futures are up 11%, with growth in all seven of our key categories, and our
NIKE direct to consumer businesses drew double digits, including strong comp store growth in our outlet and inline

stores, and the 15th consecutive quarter of double digit sales growth online.
Our performance in Q2 is not just about the last three months. It's about the last three years, and the steps we've taken
to grow the market worldwide, creating strong momentum around the brand even in uncertain times. The strategic
moves we've made to ensure our strength and leadership serve as catalysts to inspire athletes, expand markets, and
redefine the consumer experience around the world. A great example is in North America. I'm often asked, how are we
able to grow in this developed market? The key is our category offense. Each sport has its unique athletes, cultures, and
consumers. We're always looking for new ways to connect with them on a deeper, more meaningful level, and we're
seeing results across the business, including two of our biggest growth opportunities: apparel and retail.
Our performance apparel, led by innovations like NIKE Pro, continues to drive revenue for the entire apparel business.
NIKE Pro is a standard for base layer comfort and sports-specific injury protection. Our uniforms are consistently the
lightest, most sustainable, and most relevant to the sport, and there's a direct connection between on-field performance
and consumer preferences off the field. We continue to leverage that connection, contributing to great results like we
see in the North America business, where apparel revenue and futures increased over 20%. And we're seeing it at retail,
in our brand-new brand experience stores and in stores operated by our strategic retail partners around the world. That's
where we deliver innovation to the athlete, from competition, to training, to what they want outside the gym. There is
still a lot of opportunity to improve and grow in this space, but we're making good progress.
One quick category example is running, with its own unique athlete and consumer focus. Our momentum in running is
incredible and it's something we're very proud of. Running is one of our biggest and most important category
businesses. It's where this brand began, and it's a big part of our heritage. One thing we like to do on these calls is point
out where we're putting our focus and then update you on our progress. Well just over two years ago, we started to
ramp up our new category offense. Running was one of the areas we felt could benefit most. As Mark often mentions,
we've amplified our innovation agenda. Our key technologies like Lunar, Nike Free, and Flywire continue to reflect the
insights we get from our athletes and consumers.
We also committed to renewing that passion for the NIKE Brand with committed running consumer, putting a lot of
that emphasis on new runners and the new running boom we're fueling around the world. So we set out create authentic
and dramatic experiences for those running consumers. In Q2 alone, we executed 105 events in 28 countries, with over
150,000 – excuse me – 850,000 runners, an all-time record for NIKE. And it all comes together in stores like our
running-only destinations in Stanford, California, and Covent Garden in London, and we've transformed over 400
running retail partner destinations year-to-date. It's a global strategy that we will continue to execute with our direct to
consumer business, our brand retail partners, and especially with the core specialty running shops that serve the serious
runner.
That's our strategy: innovative product, strong brand, and compelling experiences in the marketplace. Our running
footwear and apparel products are performing extremely well. Revenue is up double digits, and futures are up and
accelerating.
I can tell an equally dramatic story around the basketball business, or even football. Our category focus and execution
is how we build and accelerate momentum in a developed market like North America, and we're doing that across the
business and around the world. Again, all work in progress, but we certainly like the path we're on.
I usually take a quick spin around the world to review our global results, but today, I just want to call out our emerging
markets business. Don will give you the play-by-play on the others in just a few minutes.
The emerging markets geography is a diverse group, and it's becoming more important with each quarter. Markets like
Brazil, Mexico, and Korea are playing a bigger role in the NIKE growth story. We have strong teams on the ground,
and they're connecting with consumers who have a huge appetite for sport and sport lifestyle. That's right in our
wheelhouse. It's a model that continues to help the emerging markets geography grow even faster than the overall
NIKE business, and it's showing up in the results, with constant dollar revenue up 19%, and double digit futures
growth. I'm sure we'll be talking much more about this in the coming years.

As we wrap things up around the NIKE Brand, I'll share a few things that we're focused on to increase our momentum
as we go forward. I'm very excited about our partnership with the NFL. It's one of the biggest and most meaningful
sports marketing investments in our history, and I'm confident we'll bring the most innovative performance product to
the game at the highest level, something you will hear a lot more about as we get closer to that 2012 season.
On the digital side, we've seen great momentum online over the last couple years, and I truly believe we are seeing just
the tip of the iceberg of what we can achieve. Cyber Monday was our biggest ever, and we continue to build
meaningful connections with our running, training, and football apps which give our consumers a way to connect with
their favorite sport in a way that only NIKE can provide. Look for us to continue to bring unique product and
experiences to our consumers as we leverage the potential of nikestore.com.
And finally, I see tremendous potential in women's training. We're excited by the renewed interest women have in core
fitness and its natural connection to the authentic performance of the NIKE brand. And we have more great
performance product coming, led by our Nike Free technology. The women's product will be one of the major
highlights of the Free campaign this spring.
Going forward, lots of opportunity. Having a strong brand and innovative product means a high level of demand. We
will continue to leverage our size and scale to optimize our inventory and manage the marketplace.
So as Mark indicated, we do expect to see some downward pressure from input cost as we move through the back half
of the year, and we'll continue to review all the elements of gross margin to maximize opportunities for improvement.
You can expect, given the strong demand for our brand and products, for us to continue to air-freight select product as
we work with our manufacturing partners to expand capacity. While we won't be able to completely offset the impact
of macro cost pressures in the near term, we'll use the considerable margin levers we do control to mitigate a sizable
portion of them.
Finally, something I don't often talk about, and that's our people, not just the management team but the entire
worldwide NIKE, Inc. team. Our business is complex, and we run it with an efficiency and a flexibility that is
unmatched in our industry. That's a huge competitive advantage for us, especially in times like these. So I just wanted
to recognize everyone around the world for such an amazing job. Have a great set of holidays, everybody, and with
that, here's Don to take you through a bit more on the results.
Don Blair, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Charlie. On our call today, we want to leave you with three key messages. First, that our business strategies are
resonating with consumers, laying a foundation for long-term sustainable revenue growth. Second, that over the next
few quarters, we expect to face gross margin headwinds along with the rest of our industry, but believe those
headwinds will ease over the next 12 to 18 months, and that we're in the best position to offset their effects. And third,
that we'll continue to stay focused on driving growth and delivering strong returns to our shareholders.
Let me take each of these in turn. The first key message is about sustainable growth. Our second quarter results
illustrate that our business strategies are resonating with consumers across our brand portfolio and in both developing
and developed markets. Consumer sentiment is improving, but not all brands will benefit. Today's consumer is seeking
value broadly defined. They're looking for brands that connect to their lives, deliver innovative products, and create
compelling presentations wherever they shop. Consumers are picking the winners, and our results demonstrate they're
picking NIKE. We believe that as we drive our strategies around the world, we'll deliver growth for years to come.
The second key message: we'll face strong gross margin headwinds for the next few quarters. The combination of
rapidly recovering demand and reductions in supply have driven higher cost for inputs such as labor and cotton, as well
as higher transportation costs as companies work to meet demand. In addition, uncertainties in the currency markets
have strengthened the dollar versus the euro and the pound. Even so, the strength of our brands and business model
give us greater ability to offset these headwinds, and we do expect them to moderate as supply and demand come into
balance and as economic fundamentals again drive the currency markets.

The third key message: we'll continue to stay focused on driving profitable growth. We're confident in our strategies
and we're going to invest in them to drive revenue. And as we have for the last decade, we'll maintain our financial
discipline to deliver growth in profits and cash flow, creating value for our shareholders.
So with that context, let's review our results for the quarter. NIKE, Inc. revenues increased 10% for Q2, and were 11%
higher on a currency-neutral basis. For the NIKE Brand, revenue grew 10% in constant currency, with increases in
every category except sportswear, and every geography except Japan. Futures orders grew 11%.
Second quarter gross margin was 80 basis points better than the prior year. The positive drivers were a higher mix of
full price sales, lower discounts on closeouts, and the impact of our product cost reduction initiatives, as well as faster
growth and higher margins in our direct to consumer businesses. These upsides more than outweighed higher costs for
air and ocean freight. The drivers of gross margin were those we expected, although the negative effects of FX and
higher input and transport costs were less than what we had anticipated.
Diluted earnings per share grew 24% to $0.94, reflecting revenue growth, higher gross margins, SG&A leverage, and a
slightly lower share count.
For the first half of FY '11, we've delivered $452 million of free cash flow from operations and raised our trailing
12-month ROIC 430 basis points, to 21.2%. We're proud of the work we've done to maximize capital productivity,
particularly our focus on accounts receivable and inventory. As of November 30th, accounts receivable were 3% higher
than last year, well below the second quarter revenue growth. And after six consecutive quarters of decline, inventory
at November 30th increased 8%, well below the 11% growth in futures we reported today.
Now, let's take a look at the second quarter results by segment. Revenue for North America increased 13% on a
currency-neutral basis, reflecting double digit growth in wholesale equivalent revenues. All categories except
sportswear grew versus the prior year, led by double digit growth in running, basketball, and men's and women's
training. Currency-neutral futures increased 16%, the highest growth in over ten years, driven by double digit increases
in all categories.
North America direct to consumer sales increased 17% for the quarter, as comp sales in NIKE-owned stores increased
13%, and online sales increased 26%, both driven by higher traffic and average transaction.
Apparel continues to deliver exceptional growth in North America, with currency-neutral revenues up 22%. Part of that
growth is due to the development of new category concepts with retailers such as Foot Locker, Finish Line, and Dick's,
which have increased apparel space and consumer demand. Futures for apparel increased 24%, with double digit
growth in almost every category.
The second quarter currency-neutral revenue for footwear increased 10%, driven by accelerating demand for our Lunar
and Nike Free running products and new basketball products. Footwear futures grew 15% with balanced growth across
every category. Second quarter EBIT for North America grew 24%, driven by revenue growth and SG&A leverage.
In Western Europe, Q2 revenue fell 7%, but grew 2% on a currency-neutral basis as most territories reported higher
revenue for the quarter. Football and running were the key category growth drivers. On a currency-neutral basis,
footwear grew 6% and apparel was flat. Currency-neutral futures are up 3% as we anniversary strong prior-year orders
for the World Cup.
Q2 EBIT for Western Europe declined 19%, primarily due to currency headwinds which lowered revenues, put
pressure on gross margins, and reduced the dollar value of euro-denominated profits. SG&A also rose as we continue to
make investments in our direct to consumer business and anniversary low levels of spending in Q2 last year.
Central and Eastern Europe's positive momentum continued in Q2, as revenue grew 7%, up 12% on a currency-neutral
basis. Revenues in Russia increased 40%, and both Turkey and Central Europe grew double digits. All categories
reported higher revenues, with football and running the key drivers. Currency-neutral futures rose 11%, even with
tough comparisons to the World Cup. Q2 EBIT for Central and Eastern Europe declined 10%, due largely to the
negative impact of currency on gross margin and profit translation.

In greater China, second quarter revenue grew 20%, including 2 percentage points of currency benefit. Growth was
fueled by expanding points of distribution and strong performance in running, basketball, and men's training, which all
increased more than 20%. Currency-neutral futures grew 14%, with double digit growth across most key categories. Q2
EBIT for greater China increased 39% driven by revenue growth, higher gross margins, and SG&A leverage.
As Charlie mentioned, our emerging markets geography continued to deliver impressive results in the second quarter.
Revenue increased 24%, reflecting 19% growth on a currency-neutral basis. Every category, and every territory except
Australia and New Zealand, posted higher revenues, with Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Korea driving the largest
share of the growth. Futures grew 15% as all categories grew except football, reflecting comparisons to the World Cup.
EBIT for the emerging markets increased 13% as revenue growth was partially offset by higher SG&A and lower gross
margins.
In Japan, second quarter revenue declined 14%, a 21% currency-neutral decrease, while EBIT fell 20%. In light of
ongoing macroeconomic weakness and a highly promotional retail environment, we continue to focus on strengthening
our brand and protecting profitability by closely managing our product flow, cost structure, and balance sheet.
Although gross margin is up and both SG&A and inventory are down, we believe it will take time before we see
significant improvements in growth and profitability.
Second quarter revenue for our other businesses increased 13% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, reflecting
double digit growth at Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, and Umbro. NIKE Golf grew at a single digit pace. EBIT for the
other businesses grew 69%, driven by revenue growth, higher gross margins, and SG&A leverage.
With the first half in the books, we're well positioned to deliver our goals for the full year which have not changed. On
a currency-neutral basis, we expect revenue for Q3 in the fiscal year to grow at the top end of our high single digit
range, with reported revenue growth slightly lower due to weaker foreign currencies. We anticipate gross margins for
the second half of the fiscal year will be below record levels in the second half of FY '10 as the downward pressure
from input costs has been delayed but not eliminated.
As we purchase product for calendar 2011, we're seeing the effects of higher input costs such as cotton and labor.
Given the scope and complexity of our product lines and supplier base, changes to input cost do not flow directly and
immediately into our product costs, making it difficult for us to call the peak. And while we're working hard with our
suppliers to increase capacity, we also expect higher than normal levels of air freight, at least through the first half of
FY '12, to meet strong demand.
To mitigate the impact of these headwinds, we'll continue to leverage our strength and scale. That means continuing to
work with our suppliers to increase capacity and reduce product costs. It means continuing to manage the marketplace
by keeping inventories tight, minimizing closeouts, and maximizing margins, including margins in our direct to
consumer operations. And it means continuing to work across our footwear and apparel product lines to identify
opportunities for surgical price increases on a market-by-market basis.
Specifically, we continue to expect full year FY '11 gross margin to be at least 50 basis points below FY '10, with
positive results in the first half more than offset by second half headwinds. We expect Q4 to be more significantly
affected than Q3, as cost pressures intensify and comparisons to the prior year become more challenging.
We expect demand creation to grow at a mid single digit rate for the year, with Q3 growth in the high single digits and
Q4 spending below the prior year as we anniversary heavy investments in the World Cup. We expect operating
overhead to grow at a mid single digit rate for the year, reflecting increased investment in our direct to consumer
businesses, balanced by increased efficiency in our core operating functions. For Q3, operating overhead should grow
at a high single digit rate as the result of our direct to consumer investments and the timing of stock option expense this
year. We anticipate that other income for each of the last two quarters of this fiscal year will be broadly consistent with

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Citigroup. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Kate McShane>: Thank you. Good afternoon.
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Kate.
<A - Kelley Hall, Senior Director, Investor Relations>: Hi, Kate.
<Q - Kate McShane>: I was wondering if you could quantify a little bit more the inflationary pressures you're
expecting for the second half? How much are you offsetting labor cost increases with some of the supply chain
efficiencies you've been working on? And how much are you offsetting overall higher costs through any possible
reengineering of some of your styles or any other kind of negotiations you're doing with your factories?
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well I think where I'd like to keep the conversation,
Kate, is where we expect the overall number to be. There are a tremendous number of moving parts in gross margin. As
we've said, we've had continued success driving cost down. You're very familiar with lean manufacturing initiatives,
and we continue to make progress in footwear and apparel there and see savings. We've had tremendous benefits
coming from shrinking our number of styles in apparel and making the productivity of that line much more effective,
and we have been, and we will continue to look at surgical price increases. So those are all benefits that we expect to
continue to realize over the balance of the year.
What we do think is that as we look forward, we're going to see input costs increase, notably cotton. Labor we talked
about. Those are things that we see increasing for a short period of time, call it the next three or four quarters at this
stage. And then as those ease, we think those long-term benefits of cost reduction initiatives are going to flow through
to margin.
<Q - Kate McShane>: Okay, great. And then my second question, completely unrelated to the first, is can you update
us on China and your strategy for entering or continuing to penetrate into the lower tier cities? And can you quantify
how much of your business is in fact in the tier three and tier four cities at this point in time?
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: Hi, Kate. This is Charlie. Well, we are continuing to move out into
the broader geography, into the tier three, four cities. I don't have the numbers, the breakdowns between the cities here,
maybe we can follow up. But I would expect us to continue to see growth coming out of that expansion. As we reported
here, the China numbers continue to be very strong. Our inventories continue to be in pretty good shape there, and
we've seen a great appetite from that consumer across some of the key categories like basketball, football, and running.
So we're still pretty bullish on the China long term, and short term, we'll continue to expand distribution out into the
broader geographies.
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And Kate, just to be clear, we're not expecting to be
going downmarket in those cities. Our strategy -
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: Yeah, that's true.
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: – is consistent across the board. We're a premium
brand, and we're going to continue to sell at prices that you would find around the rest of the world.
<A - Don Blair, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Converse is another lever that is more attractive for us
to pull in the China market. Gives us a little more range in terms of price and position in the marketplace. So that's
-Converse is becoming a bigger factor for NIKE, Inc. in China as well.
<Q - Kate McShane>: Great. That's really helpful. Happy holidays.

Our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Robert Drbul>: Hi, good afternoon.
<A - Kelley Hall, Senior Director, Investor Relations>: Hey, Bob.
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Bob.
<Q - Robert Drbul>: I guess the first question is a little bit more on China overall. The numbers still very strong, but
there's definitely some concern around if there's a slowdown. So I was wondering if you might be able to talk a little bit
more on market share, in terms of where you think you are, and sort of gains? And is there a number on points of
distribution that you could share with us at this point in time?
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: Bob, this is Charlie. Well let me take that – the market share piece –
again, the numbers are always, from a share standpoint, a little harder to acquire in China, as you would expect, than
maybe some of the other more developed or mature markets around the world. We do a lot of brand strength
monitoring as well, which is – in fact, we see it almost as – well as actually probably more important than the actual
share numbers. Both those numbers are very healthy right now. We retain the number one position in the country, and I
would expect to see us maybe grow a little bit over the last couple of quarters. I haven't seen the latest numbers
recently, but again, we're – we feel very good about both the brand and the business in China and its ability to continue
to expand and grow.
<Q - Robert Drbul>: Okay.
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: What was – you had a second part of that question.
<Q - Robert Drbul>: Just like a number on points of distribution -
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: I mean, we are – we've gotten away from sharing that. We continue
to see expansion, both in standalone shops, shop in shops, whether it's through the department store channel. You've
been to China, you've see how that marketplace continues to grow really exponentially and the different channels of
distribution. But we still look at it as a mono brand presentation, all the way along the – throughout the distribution
network, into the – even into the new cities. And we're starting to put a few more Factory Stores down in China as well,
to continue to maintain marketplace integrity and brand integrity on the inventory levels.
<Q - Robert Drbul>: Great. And I guess, my second question is, I was just wondering if anybody there had a
prediction on the football game score on January 10th, and how many pushups the Oregon Duck mascot is – should be
prepared to do?
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: Well, we're highly one-sided, I'll say that much for it.
<Q - Robert Drbul>: All right. Thank you very much, guys. Happy holidays.
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: All right. Same to you, Bob.
<A - Kelley Hall, Senior Director, Investor Relations>: Thanks, Bob. Next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Michelle Tan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Michelle Tan>: Great. Thanks. My question was on inventory relative to demand. I think you mentioned that you
still expect to air freight quite a bit of product, but on the surface, it looks like your inventory growth has largely caught
up with what you're seeing in terms of order growth. So where is the disconnect? Is there a timing shift? What is it
that's – that you're still chasing from an inventory perspective?
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well one of the things, Michelle, is if you go back to
some of the introductory language that we've heard so many times and we don't necessarily listen to it anymore, there's
a lot of parts of the business that are not on futures, including direct to consumer, and our direct to consumer business
has been growing pretty rapidly. We also have a lot of that once business that's also growing very fast. So the
combination of those two you wouldn't see in the futures number.
The other issue is just which products you're talking about. We've had colossal demand for a lot of the new product
innovations, particularly in the running space and some of our apparel styles. So keeping up with demand for this
leading-edge product is really part of what's generating that air freight.
<Q - Michelle Tan>: Great. Thanks. And then sorry if I missed it earlier, but have you guys given the trend in futures
through the window, first half versus second?
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It's really not much difference between the front and
the back half.
<Q - Michelle Tan>: Okay, great. Thanks. Good luck with the holidays.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Svezia with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Christopher Svezia>: Good afternoon, everyone. I just want to go back to the futures number for one quick
moment. I guess, two points to this question. When you guys reported your first quarter, you just made the observation
that the back end of the futures window was stronger than the beginning end of the – the forward piece of the futures
window. I'm just kind of curious, as you've kind of seen overall, sort of the mild sequential falloff constant currency,
was there anything unusual in terms of that happened as the quarter progressed, or it's just typical business in terms of
flow, cancellations, et cetera, that happened as the quarter unfolded?
<A - Don Blair, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I'm sorry, you're talking about the last quarter, or the
futures we just reported?
<Q - Christopher Svezia>: No, the last quarter, Don. Just – I think when you guys reported, just made some
observation that the backend around holiday was stronger, and then -
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Oh, I see what you – I see. I see. So holiday was
stronger than fall, and so that's what we were really referring to in the futures – the last futures window. This futures
window is largely going to be the very tail end of holiday and spring, and then the very beginning of summer. And one
of the things you got to bear in mind is, the spring and summer particularly are affected by the World Cup comparison.
<Q - Christopher Svezia>: Okay. All right, that's helpful. And I guess my other question just had to do with, when
you guys think about the basketball business, seen a nice rebound in North America. Just wondering – I think you made
some comment, maybe you can clarify in terms of what you're seeing in terms of the backlog. I think you mentioned a
double digit growth in the backlog trend? Just maybe talk about what's happening on the basketball end of the business

and sustainability there, how broad based it is, et cetera?
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: Yeah, this is Charlie. The basketball business continues to actually
gain momentum. I think a couple of the things that you've seen recently, the new Kobe shoe came out. We have the
emerging talent of Kevin Durant who is actually becoming a bigger and more effective, I guess, driver of the basketball
business. And then obviously LeBron, and the Jordan brand. So we're excited about that.
The apparel business in the basketball area is very strong and a lot of that is being driven by the NIKE Pro position that
we've taken in basketball. These are all North America data points. The other thing that we continue to see is a very,
very strong appetite for both the sport and the product line in China, and we're starting to see an increasing interest
coming out of Western and Central Europe which has been a little bit of a nice surprise as we've continued to see
basketball become more and more of a global sport.
<Q - Christopher Svezia>: Okay. That's good to hear. Best of luck around the holidays, and take care. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Michael Binetti>: Hey, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter there.
<A - Kelley Hall, Senior Director, Investor Relations>: Thanks, Michael.
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: Thanks, Michael.
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you.
<Q - Michael Binetti>: Just following up on an earlier question. Where are the ASPs in the back half of the futures
window versus the front half that you guys reported, please?
<A - Don Blair, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I actually don't have that detail in front of me,
Michael, and wouldn't provide that level of granularity either. I think it's not necessarily something that you should
look at those small windows and believe there's something really that significant in it. Generally, on the footwear side,
we're seeing the ASPs about even at this point.
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: But continued strong sellthrough and demand for the premium end
of the price range as well.
<Q - Michael Binetti>: Okay. And I ask mostly because there's obviously a lot of question about which brands have
the ability to take price with all the inflation everybody's talking about, but I appreciate the color.
So I'm a little bit surprised to see the ongoing gap between the futures and the prior quarters in the revenues in Western
Europe. And we've definitely heard better things about Lunar and the Free catching on over there and taking off. I
mean, is this – as we look ahead to your revenue guidance for the rest of the year, should we be looking at Europe,
excluding FX, as a low single digit growth vehicle? Or is it – am I wrong to be thinking about it that way?
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: No, I think you're – I think you're in the right space. This is Charlie.
I think one of the other things just to remember that the running number isn't quite as significant in Western Europe as
a percent to total, and we're seeing it increasing, but it's a smaller piece of the business when you think about
comparing it to something like North America.
<A - Don Blair, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think just once again bear in mind, World Cup is
going to be fairly significant when you look at the futures for Western Europe. It's also very significant, by the way, for

Our next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy from Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jim Duffy>: Thanks, good afternoon.
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: Hi, Jim.
<A - Kelley Hall, Senior Director, Investor Relations>: Hi, Jim.
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Jim.
<Q - Jim Duffy>: Couple questions on manufacturing and cost pressures. Can you talk about manufacturing capacity
and the timeframe for catching up with demand levels? Is that mostly a labor issue, or do you need more capital
investment and factory capacity from your partners?
<A - Don Blair, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It actually requires more production that requires
capital investment, and that's something that our partners are scaling up to do. The consolidation work that we did
about a year ago has really given us a much stronger platform to grow from, and those partners now are really working
to scale up the business. How long it takes us to work our way through it is dependent on demand, and the demand has
been so strong that we're continuing to work on capacity.
<Q - Jim Duffy>: I see. That makes sense. So labor hasn't been a gating factor then in production?
<A - Don Blair, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No.
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: No.
<Q - Jim Duffy>: Okay, and then Don, last question. You mentioned expectation for input cost pressures to ease over
12 to 18 months. Can you talk about that in a little bit more detail? What are the cost components in particular that you
expect to moderate? I guess air freight, for one.
<A - Don Blair, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, and to be honest with you, one of the things –
and I'm not holding myself out here to be a commodities expert, but when we look at some of the key input costs for us,
especially cotton, I think that this past year has been the result of a number of factors. I talked about the fact that when
the recession hit, demand was down, a lot of supply came offline, and then we've had floods in Pakistan and we've had
a real explosion in demand. So the combination of those things meant we had a shortage, and I think there's also
speculation going on in that market. So I think that as supply and demand come back into balance, we expect to see a
break. I'm not sure I would advise you to be speculating in the commodities markets on that advice, but that would be
our point of view at this point.
<Q - Jim Duffy>: Okay. Great. Happy holidays, everyone.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Thank you. You may
proceed.
<Q - Robert Ohmes>: Oh, thanks. Afternoon, guys.
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Robbie.
<A - Kelley Hall, Senior Director, Investor Relations>: Hey, Robbie.
<Q - Robert Ohmes>: Hey, two quick questions. In North America, if you look at the footwear business, and I think,
Don, you mentioned ASPs flatten out, can you guys comment at all on the relative momentum by distribution channel?
I guess specifically I'd be curious about sort of the family channel and if you're seeing maybe a pickup in your growth
there, versus the premium channels where you're already strong?
And then the second question was going to be on sportswear. Could you just remind us what the strategy is for the
sportswear business and why it's down, and then maybe contrast that with the performance apparel business? Thanks.
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: Yeah, Robbie, this is Charlie. Let me talk about channels first. We
don't really – I think a lot of the time, a lot of the industry looks at the channels. We don't consider it the primary lens
from which we look at the marketplace and the health of the marketplace. That being said, we feel very good about our
position on – in all the channels here in North America. I think the ability to segment and position the product line
appropriately for each and every one of the different distribution channels has been one of our strengths over a long
period of time.
I think – and today, as you see the premium product performing well in some of the specialty channels, and the brand
being as strong as it is, you're going to see the same type of performance coming out of the family footwear channel of
distribution because of the alignment that we have in product and product type. So I don't have any of the specifics in
front of me, but I would give you an overall perspective in that regard.
And the second piece is on the sportswear piece, and I think it's one thing we've been focused on a lot around here over
the last year, is really positioning our sportswear business within each of the different categories. We reference it, the
idea that we can approach a consumer on the field of play, in the gym as they train, and then as part of their lifestyle, is
certainly an opportunity we believe is a huge competitive advantage for us. We have continued to develop iconic styles.
The Destroyer jacket, I think the pants, the bottoms bar that we've developed in the women's business is really starting
to establish itself, examples like that, the Legend tee, iconic pieces like the Tempo shorts in running and the basketball
short are all solid foundational pieces that we put in place around some of our sportswear business that we expect to
continue to see, to both expand, and use as an efficient – against SKU and style management and productivity.
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I want to add too that this is the quality of the
sportswear business for NIKE is much improved. There's been a lot of work done on trying to edit the product line
down and amplify the focus on the key styles, some of which Charlie mentioned. And so we're seeing some great
results in terms of productivity per style, and editing down the product line by 30% or more, actually.
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: That is an apparel number that Mark's sharing, by the way -
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: – on the SKU management piece.
<Q - Robert Ohmes>: Is there a time where you're going to anniversary those adjustments and we start to see
sportswear go positive again?
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: Well, I think – again, not to – I'm not getting out any crystal ball that
I shined up, but we feel very, very good about the position of where we are, both in footwear and apparel. I think one
thing to keep in mind right now, our performance business is on fire. It's not obviously all used on the field of play. I
think some of the running footwear that you see out there, the – both the Lunar and the Dynamic Fit product, as well as
the Free product, is taking away some of the numbers from our sports style business, which we're happy to trade back

and forth as consumer preferences move back and forth. I think that's one of the big advantages of the NIKE brand, that
we can capture that consumer as they do move back and forth, whether it's a retro style or a new innovative technology
like the Dynamic Fit and Lunar product that's out there today. So we feel pretty good as far as where that business is
and how it swings back and forth.
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, and we are pulling back, too, on some of the
demand on some of the key franchise items, particularly in footwear, to make sure that we don't oversaturate the market
in some of these key styles. But I think you're going to see some of that business really starting to pick up again sort of
in the later part of this year, into early '12. But over the long term, we're very, very bullish on sportswear, both in
footwear and in apparel.

Our next question comes from the line of Chi Lee with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Chi Lee>: All right, good afternoon, everybody.
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: Hi, Chi.
<Q - Chi Lee>: You guys have talked about surgical price increases as still being a lever. But to clarify, have you guys
already taken price increases for the back half window? And just given where we are in the year, do you still have
flexibility to implement price increases at this point?
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The pricing on the back half is pretty much locked in.
We may have a little bit of flexibility in some of the emerging markets business, and we may have a little bit of
flexibility on some of the at-once business. But for the most part, most of that product you – I guess we would have a
small amount maybe on the June – the May/June futures time period, where – but most of that is represented by the
summer product line which has already been locked in.
We do look at pricing continuously, and where we have increased demand or price value elasticity, we've always been
very aggressive surgically, taking advantage of those factors in the marketplace. But it is a market-to-market type
situation. What may be working in the U.S. right now doesn't necessarily work in China or Western or Eastern Europe.
So it's an ongoing process for us. We feel actually very, very good about our ability to be both flexible and aggressive
when we can, and we'll continue to do so.
<Q - Chi Lee>: Okay, great. And then in the current quarter, it seems like the operating overhead came in a little bit
above where you guys had been guiding in terms of growth. Can you just talk about what drove that incremental
growth? And presumably, it's somewhat of a timing shift, given that the full year operating overhead guidance is still
being maintained constant.
<A - Don Blair, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: That's right. First of all, in a year-over-year basis,
there are some timing issues, and we talked about stock options in the prior calls. We also had a fairly significant
number of sales meetings during this particular quarter, which just was a different timing than last year. So if you
looked at last year's phasing, Q2 was the lowest – one of the lowest quarters we've had, and this year I think is more
normalized.
<Q - Chi Lee>: Okay. Great. And if I can squeeze in one last one. Can you just update us on where you stand on
vendor consolidation, in terms of how much you've accomplished this year and really where you expect to end up for
the full year?

<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: Yeah, no, I think our consolidation is pretty much complete. I think
we were trying to be – we tried to execute that strategy relatively quickly. Right now, we're actually looking at capacity
expansion with our current partners and how fast we can continue to ramp up against the demand that we're seeing. So I
wouldn't expect to see a whole lot more consolidation.

<Q - Omar Saad>: I actually wanted to follow on Chi's question a little bit, on the pricing side. Can you talk about
some of the work that you've done on demand elasticity, especially in footwear, given your clear market leadership
position? How sensitive is consumer demand to pricing when it comes to athletic footwear? Does it vary significantly
globally? And do you guys think about yourself, and we're in a kind of an equation right now where the supply and the
demand is obviously out of balance, more demand than supply. Do you guys consider yourself on the supply side, and
if so – and your suppliers are kind of seeing a natural lift in their pricing and their cost structure, shouldn't that kind of
flow through as – if NIKE is indeed also part of the supply chain?
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, no, I mean, I think we would expect to see some
price increases across the board. I think the – I guess one of the competitive advantages that we do hold is our portfolio,
and our ability to manage that across both product types, geographies, and categories, and – but there is a lot of
sensitivity to, style by style, market by market situations, and like I said, I'm both very confident and very proud of our
ability to manage that continuously. I think we've done a great job of that over the years, I think we have a good
process in place that allows us to take advantage of the opportunities when they exist, and we'll continue to do so, as we
said. We're looking at a very strong demand curve, some capacity issues, and the ability to take up prices over time. But
again, it'll be on a surgical basis, and you won't see a broad-based application of price increases around the world.
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: I mean the good news is we have a very strong brand around the
world, and high demand, as you mentioned, for some of the key iconic styles, whether it's some of the franchise styles
that exist – or the new technology, like Lunar or Pro and products like that. So there's definitely some opportunities out
there, and we'll be looking at taking advantage of those over the next six to 12 months.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then last question. There might not be one single answer to this,
but some of the – regionally, some of the disconnects between the futures numbers that you're reporting and then how
kind of the sales are flowing through the following couple quarters. Central, Eastern Europe, it seems like the futures
look a little bit stronger than what the flowthrough has been, versus emerging markets, where you guys are just
crushing it. And the future numbers are great, but the actual revenue numbers you're reporting are even stronger.
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: Yeah, this is just the conversation we were having earlier. There are
quite a few elements of our revenue equation that are not part of the futures model. In sales to our wholesale accounts,
footwear and apparel, futures are still the primary method by which we sell, but we are increasingly doing on the
margin footwear and apparel at-once, we've got a very rapidly growing direct to consumer business. So that varies by
geography. There are timing issues specific to geographies. For example, in the emerging world, you have a lot of
protectionism, sometimes it takes a while to get through customs.

So the issue I think of trying to match up futures for one quarter against revenue for one quarter, that is not necessarily
a productive exercise. In the long term, futures are a great indicator of business momentum and trajectory.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Okay, great. So it's not necessarily futures are a better indicator in one region versus another
region. It's more over the long term, it's a good indicator for kind of across the board -
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think using it more directionally is a better way to
think about the futures numbers.
<Q - Omar Saad>: All right, very good. Thanks. Happy holidays.
<A - Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks, same to you.
<A - Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand>: Same to you.
