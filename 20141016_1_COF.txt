Stephen S. Crawford
Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with slide three. Capital One earned $1.1 billion or $1.86 per share in the third quarter.
On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.94 per share, and have return on average tangible common equity of
15.7%.
Included in continuing operation, results this quarter were higher linked quarter revenue, flat linked quarter non-interest
expenses, higher provision for loan losses driven by a $214 million allowance build partially offset by lower
charge-offs.
There were a few non-recurring legal reserve changes in the quarter I would like to highlight. First, a $27 million
contra-revenue impact, second we had charges in non-interest expense, which were offset by a $28 million benefit in
our Domestic Card business. And last, we had a $70 million charge from rep and warranty expense and discontinued
operations.
Turning to slide four, net interest margin increased 14 basis points in the third quarter to 6.69%, primarily driven by
higher average balances in our Domestic Card business, and the third quarter having one more day worth of recognized
income. Average interest earning assets were up quarter-over-quarter driven by higher average loan balances in our
Domestic Card, Auto Finance and Commercial Banking businesses.
Turning to slide five, let me cover capital trends, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized
fully phased-in basis was 11.8% in the third quarter compared to 11.6% in the second quarter of this year.
With the benefit of phase-in, our common equity Tier-1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 12.7%. And
while we are yet to enter parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches, we continue to estimate, we are above our
target of 8%.
We reduced our net share count by 3 million shares in the quarter, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions. We
completed approximately 500 million of our share buyback program in the third quarter. And we expect to buy an
additional 1 billion over the next two quarters.
Let me close tonight with a brief update of our 2014 expectations. We continue to expect pre-provision earnings to be
about $10 billion, excluding non-recurring items. Traditionally, our marketing expenses are seasonally higher in the
fourth quarter. That seasonal increase in marketing as well as our operating expense investments in growth, which Rich
will review in more detail will driving an increase in non-interest expense in the fourth quarter of this year, which will
carry into 2015.
We highlighted for you last quarter that allowance releases were less likely going forward. In the third quarter, we build
allowances, as we grew our card loans and expectations for future card growth will likely drive allowance builds in
coming quarters.
With that, let me turn the call over to Rich.

Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on slide seven, with our Domestic Card business, which delivered another quarter of strong
results. Ending loans were up about 5% year-over-year, and about 3% from the linked quarter, stronger than typical
seasonal growth in the third quarter. Continuing momentum in new account originations and credit line increase
programs drove loan growth in the quarter. Purchase volume on general purpose credit cards, which excludes
private-label cards that don't produce interchange revenue grew 17.5% year-over-year.
Revenue margin for the quarter increased 34 basis points to about 17.4%, consistent with normal seasonality. Revenue
dollars grew about 6% from the linked quarter, driven by growth in average loans and the seasonal increase in revenue
margin.
Year-over-year revenue dollars were down about 4%, as the revenue impact of our choice to sell the Best Buy portfolio
was partially offset by strong underlying growth in average loans.
Non-interest expenses increased $17 million from the prior quarter, driven by higher marketing expense. We expect
both operating expenses and marketing to increase in the fourth quarter, driven by loan growth, the expected seasonal
ramp in marketing and continuing opportunities we see to grow customer relationships, purchase volume and loans.
Domestic charge-off rate improved 69 basis points on a sequential quarter basis to 2.83%. We believe this sharp
improvement in the quarter is temporary. The third quarter is usually the seasonal low point for card losses, but we
think seasonality drove only about half of the improvement that we saw in the quarter.
Most of the remaining improvement was the result of better than seasonal delinquency rates we experienced in the first
half of the year, flowing through the charge-offs in the quarter. We've already seen this short-term delinquency benefit
reverse itself.
We think the 2.83% charge-off rate is an unsustainable low point, and that losses are headed up from here. In the short
term, we expect normal seasonal increases in the charge-off rate in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2015.
Beyond seasonality, the temporary delinquency benefit, I just described has run its course, which will add to the
upward trend in the charge-off rate in the fourth quarter.
Longer-term loan growth will start to impact the charge-off rate in 2015. As new loan balances season, they will start
putting upward pressure on losses. While the impact on the charge-off rate will be modest first, we expect that the
impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond.
Pulling together both the short-term and long-term factors, including seasonal variability, we expect the quarterly
domestic charge-off rates throughout 2015 to be in the mid-to-high 3% range. In addition to rising charge-offs, we
expect allowance additions resulting from loan growth.
We aren't counting on further economic improvement helping our credit loss, nor are we projecting renewed economic
weakness. Of course changes in a still tenuous economic recovery could substantially impact our current loss
expectations. Our Card business remains well-positioned. Loans, purchase volumes, and revenues are growing and we
are delivering strong and resilient returns.
Moving to slide eight, the Consumer Banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans were flat
compared to the linked quarter and declined modestly from the prior year. Growth in auto loans continues to be offset
by expected mortgage run-off. Auto originations increased 14% year-over-year. Most of the growth came from prime
originations as we continue to capture additional prime share from our existing dealers. On a linked quarter basis, auto
originations were essentially flat.
Ending deposit balances declined by about $1.5 billion or 1% in the quarter. Year-over-year deposit balances declined
about $800 million. We've had an abundance of deposits since the ING DIRECT acquisition, and we've been allowing
the least attractive deposits from Capital One's legacy direct bank to run-off.
Consumer Banking revenue was flat compared to the second quarter. Year-over-year revenue declined by $61 million
or 4% driven by the impact of persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances and
margin compression in auto. Auto loan growth partially offset these negative revenue impacts.

Non-interest expense increased $29 million or 3% from the prior year. The increase resulted from growth in auto loans
as well as a change in the geography of where we recognize auto repossession expenses, which are our now included in
operating expense rather than in net charge-offs.
Provision for credit losses increased $55 million from the linked quarter, driven by expected seasonal trends in auto
charge-offs. Home loans credit trends remain favorable and continue to perform well inside the assumptions we made
when we acquired the mortgage portfolios.
Our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing challenges. While we
expect that auto returns will continue to be resilient and well above hurdle, we expect that they will continue to decline
as we move from exceptional levels to more cycle average performance.
And in our Retail Deposit business, we expect that the inexorable impacts of the prolonged low rate environment will
continue to pressure returns even if rates rise in 2015.
As you can see on slide nine, our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of profitable growth. Loan
balances increased about 3% in the quarter and 17% year-over-year. Most of this growth is in specialized industry
verticals in C&I lending and CRE.
Loan yields declined 11 basis points in the quarter and 48 basis points compared to the prior year driven by increased
competition and our choice to originate more variable rate loans. Revenues increased 3% in the second – from the
second quarter, and about 10% from the prior year. The year-over-year increase was the result of growth in loan and
deposit balances across the franchise offset by declining loan yields. The stronger increase in non-interest income was
driven by the Beech Street acquisition and growth of fee generating business.
Non-interest expenses were up 18% from the prior year as a result of growth, including the Beech Street acquisition,
and continuing infrastructure investments to drive future growth. In the quarter, non-interest expense was flat.
We continue to closely manage credit risk. Charge-offs, non-performing loans and criticized loans all improved in the
quarter and remain at exceptionally low levels. While commercial credit results remain very strong, the current levels
are not sustainable through this cycle.
Commercial Banking competition continues to increase, pressuring margins and returns. As competition continues to
increase, it's likely that the pace of our commercial loan growth will be slower in 2015, and closer to overall industry
growth rates. But we expect our focused and specialized approach will continue to deliver strong returns in the
commercial bank.
I'll conclude my remarks this evening on slide 10. We posted another quarter of solid results for the company and
across our businesses, and we continue to return capital to our shareholders, as we execute our announced $2.5 billion
dollar share repurchase program. As Steve mentioned, we're on track to deliver 2014 pre-provision earnings of about
$10 billion.
We expect growth in full year revenues in 2015, driven by strong growth in average loans. While the efficiency ratio
will vary from quarter-to-quarter, we expect the full year 2015 efficiency ratio to be between 53% and 54%, excluding
non-recurring items.
Our expectations for both the remainder of 2014 and 2015, include the impacts of investments to drive future growth to
be a leader in digital banking, and to continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements.
Continuing opportunities to grow our Domestic Card business are expected to drive higher marketing expense in the
fourth quarter and in 2015. Marketing efficiency, cost to acquire new accounts and the NPV of our marketing
investments are strong. We're also making significant investments in digital and technology. Banking inherently is a
digital product, and digital will transform banking over time.
The momentum around digital is building across financial services. Consumers increasingly expect elegant and robust
digital experiences from all companies, including banks. Software is the predominant way consumers interact with their

banks even today, and that engagement will only go up. Activity in the payment space from financial services
companies and non-banks is accelerating.
The ability to efficiently store and use vast amounts of data will unlock new opportunities. Capital One is
well-positioned to succeed in a digital world, and we're investing in the foundational infrastructure and capabilities to
be a digital leader.
We're continuing to expand Capital One 360 as a national digital banking platform. We're bringing in significant native
digital talent. Engineers, product developers, designers and data scientists. We're very active in mobile and in
payments. For example, we're one of only a handful of banks included in Apple's launch of Apple Pay in September,
and shortly thereafter launched our Capital One digital wallet.
We're focused on delivering an exceptional user experience to our customers and recently acquired a leading design
firm in San Francisco called Adaptive Path. While the financial cost was modest, Adaptive Path has been a pioneer in
the UX field and they will make a big impact on our customer experience.
Also, Capital One has a deep heritage as an information-based company, and big data is tailor-made for us. We're
investing in our big data infrastructure to enable rapid cycle analysis in the generation of even more powerful insights,
and new services.
As we're reminded of almost daily in the media, there are significant threats to information security across all
industries, including financial services. At Capital One, protecting customer information is paramount and requires that
we are ever vigilant in our defenses. We've made significant investments in this area over the years, and we'll continue
to invest aggressively.
Ultimately, the winners in banking will have the capabilities of world-class software company. Most of the leverage
and most of our investment is in building the foundational underpinnings and talent model of a great digital company.
To succeed in a digital world, the company can't just bolt digital capabilities onto the side of an analog business.
At Capital One, we're embedding technology, data and software development deeply into our business model and how
we work. For example, we're focused on building reusable plug and play middleware using RESTful APIs, modern
software development and design, integrating our platforms and making them scalable in real time, and building a
powerful and flexible data infrastructure.
These foundational investments while not always the most visible are glamorous aspect of our digital journey, create
sustainable competitive advantages and position us to continue to thrive as banking goes even more digital.
We're also investing to continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. We're enhancing our capabilities,
infrastructure, and talent to meet heightened expectations for risk management and regulatory reporting. We're
continuously improving processes for capital and liquidity management including CCAR and the new LCR
requirements. And we're investing to deliver on the broad set of emerging regulatory requirements. The expectations
for large financial institutions continue to rise, and we'll continue to invest to keep pace with these requirements.
Pulling up, Capital One is delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns today, and we expect that will continue. We have
the financial strength to invest in our future without compromising current financial results. We remain focused on the
leverage that create and sustain high performance.
We'll continue to pursue growth opportunities in Card, Auto, and Commercial Banking. We'll maintain our
longstanding discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive focus on resilience. And we'll
actively work to return capital to shareholders as capital distribution remains an important part of how we expect to
deliver value to our investors.
Now, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?

Thank you, Rich. We'll now start our Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask
a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any further follow-up questions
after the Q&A session, the investor relations team will be available after the call. Lauren, please start the Q&A session.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
<Q - Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani>: Good evening. First question, just on your expectations for charge-offs, I
appreciate the color. Is it fair to assume the ramp in the reserves was kind of related to that as well as the growth? And
maybe you could just remind us of the methodology you use to determine reserve adequacy. And I guess, second
question I'll ask upfront, just the growth in the balances, it's pretty encouraging. What are you seeing that's different
from maybe a year ago, that's driving that growth in balances in card? Thank you.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah, I'll take the first I think, Rich will take the second. You're spot-on in your
observation about what drives the allowance; it's really two factors, loan growth, which we've been talking about
returning in the second half for a while. And then also, the higher delinquencies, which translates into higher NACO
likely in the future.
And basically, we have an extremely low quarter of NACO this quarter. As Rich talked about, we expect that to
normalize, and that replacement effect also has an impact on allowances. So going forward, you should absolutely be
focused on loan growth. And then to the extent that you believe delinquencies and NACOs are headed-up, and that's
going to have an impact on allowance, and obviously if you thought the opposite, the opposite would be true, but it's
really both factors.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: And Sanjay – what we're seeing is a continuation of what I've been talking about for – in
a sense talking about what we're working on for a number of years, and talking about the traction for the last several
quarters, the traction that we're getting. It's really in both originations and in line increases.
In originations, we – in the areas that we have really chosen to focus on, including the – top of the market will be heavy
spender segment, and in revolvers other than high-balance revolvers, we have seen really growing traction in those
areas, and that – that's a good thing to see.
The other big effect is line increases. Line increase is something that is always a central part of how we manage our
business. As you know, we were kind of experienced sort of a line increase brownout. Starting really in some sense
back in the throes of the Great Recession, we were very conservative, and then of course we had the CARD Act and the
rules associated with proof of income, before we could do line increases.
So as we – so in some sense, what you see now is moving from a browned out line increase situation to now where
we're back into equilibrium in doing that; and also catching up with some deferred line increases alone the way. So
there's lot of strength in both areas, and I think we're encouraged not only by the traction, but by the prospects for
continuing traction.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck at Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi, couple of follow-ups. One is just on the ALLR ratio itself. I get your point that, expecting
NCOs to come back up, are you using a forward look of, say 12 months, 18 months, and I also just wanted to
understand if, how you're assessing, what ratio to get that ALLR up to today?

<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah, it's actually different Betsy based on product, but the big driver is card – and card,
the most important timeframe is the next 12 months. So it's really the view of what's going to happen to loss rate over
the next 12 months, that's going to be the principal driver. In addition to that, you've also got to factor in what the
growth will be.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Ryan Nash at Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Good evening. Steve, when you think about the 53% to 54% efficiency ratio for 2015, can you
give us a sense of what type of PP&R would be associated with that. I know you noted, Rich, noted that you expect
growth in revenues for the coming year. But Rich also gave a long list of things that you needed to invest in. So I guess,
if we do continue to see balance sheet growth at the pace that we are seeing, can you just help us understand what
might be a good base level first anchor to? Thanks.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah. So I think, Rich did a couple of things. He reconfirmed a 53% to 54%, he also said
we expect loan growth to really drive the revenue outlook. So I think, we'll leave it up to you to really figure out what
you think a reasonable rate of loan growth is. And that's probably as far as we're prepared to go in 2015, in terms of
forecasting PP&R.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: And then, if I could ask one follow-up question, Rich, you talked a lot about digital
investments. Steve spoke about opportunities to make the business more efficient in the past, I know you guys are
talking about a 53% to 54% next year, which is essentially flat on a core basis, but as we look out over the next few
years, do you think there is enough leverage in the investments that you're making now, that we should see continued
efficiency improvement over time?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Ryan, I think that, digital, there are many benefits to digital investment, I would – and
the economics ultimately of going digital are pretty dramatic. The marginal cost of a digital interaction is virtually zero,
and we are far from that in the analog activities that we do.
The couple of things I want to say about that, first of all, I don't even think the biggest benefit or the most compelling
case for digital is just to lower costs. Even though I do believe that, that is the end game. This is one of those few things
in life where it's pretty much everything gets better, but we're talking about being able to be faster, more efficient, a
better customer experience, better controlled in an intense regulatory environment, much more able to innovate a better
associate experience, so there's a lot of things that come on this journey.
From an economic point of view, we have tracked digital investment and also the clear savings that come from that,
most importantly from driving customers to digital. Just because you build it, they don't necessarily come. So we have
a lot of efforts on that, and we're making a lot of progress. That said, the tally right now for the measurable parts is,
we're spending more than the manifest savings are, and I think actually that differential will continue, because there's a
lot to invest in. But it's very clear to me that we can see savings, and we can see a lot of other benefits happening.
But the thing I want to leave with you is, this is not a – this is not a program, this is not a project, this is not a one-year
kind of thing, I mean, we're essentially talking about – we happen to be living through probably one of the biggest
revolutions in the history of the world up there with possibly fire in the wheel.
So that said, I think there's – there's a lot of transformation to go on in banking. But – and so, I think that the impact of
digital investment will put upward pressure on efficiency ratios as opposed to downward in the near and medium term.
Longer run, its direction is clearly downward, but I just wanted to leave you with that.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

We'll go to Ken Bruce of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kenneth M. Bruce>: Thanks. Good evening. I guess, I would like to delve into the – what you're seeing within
either the portfolio or just generally that's leaving you to believe it, that delinquencies are heading higher. It seems, just
looking at some of the Trust data that you see a little bit of a seasonal effect. But I'm wondering, if there's something
specific that you're kind of focused on or what's going to leave in you to believe that, we kind of passed the best in
delinquencies?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah. So let me separate out sort of the comments I often make about where we are in
the cycle versus things related to Capital One, and the strategies that we have.
I think – I don't have a changed point of view about where we are in the cycle. We are in an extraordinary time. It's
hard to imagine as an industry, loss is getting much better than this. I've been wrong before that. Over the last few
years, it's really quite extraordinary, where we have come to. But this is not – when we're talking about delinquencies
and charge-offs going up, this is not calling a turn in a sense of – finally the credit card industry has gotten beyond its
lowest point. At some point that's going to happen.
What we have going on here is much more – it's partly just mechanics that we want to share with you. And then most
importantly, it's the growth story. The mechanics are that, we had an unusually low third quarter. And so, coming back
often unusually low third quarter is part of the math that we want to make sure that everybody understands. And within
that, of course, you have seasonal – the seasonal effects, but also we've seen – in our history, we watch very, very
carefully for changes in flow rates that we see across the business.
There was a particularly positive good surge in flow rates in the first half of this year that, just looking at the mechanics
of that, that has sort of reversed itself, not into something bad, but more of a just kind of reversing of that particular
surge. That's one effect that's kind of going on here.
But as we look forward, so first of all, we're reversing out of the unusual momentarily low of this quarter. And then,
you pretty much from there, you're looking at seasonality, and we're heading into the seasonal ramping part of the year.
And then you have the growth, the dynamics of growth taking over from there.
So this isn't really about the charge, the credit card industry, it's really about Capital One, and the effects of the very
positive story that we see developing in terms of our growth. But we want to make sure people understand that, what
comes with that territory is increasing losses, particularly compared with our environment of not much growth, and
even shrinking over the last few years. And we want to make sure investors just understand the charge-off math
associated with that.
<Q - Kenneth M. Bruce>: And everybody is focused on credit card growth, it seems that, the success that you all have
had is being kind of looked at by others jealously, and I'm wondering if you've seen any change in the competitive
landscape, based on others' behavior?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: So, I think the competitive landscape in card continues to be intense, but strikingly
stable. And again, I would compare, you've often heard me talk about, I think, both the commercial business and the
auto business are getting kind of into a degrading – a competition, and as they regress toward the mean and so on.
I think that – so with the Card business, pricing is relatively stable. You've had mail volumes increased by about 16%
over the last year, and so, we got to keep an eye on that. And by the way, that's mail volumes increasing in the context
of where the world's increasingly going to digital. So, that the total amount of marketing is even greater than kind of
what you see in mail volumes.
So certainly, there is more – there is – there is competitive intensity there. But I think, the real thing that's going on is,
there's – that the surviving and successful players in the Card business have looked back in their rearview mirror at
their trip through the Great Recession. And they have figured out where they're good, and where they're not so good.
And they have staked out, in most cases strikingly different strategies.

And I think, each of those strategies makes a lot of sense for the particular issuer, and it's playing to the strength of the
particular issuer. But I think, it helps contribute to a rational competitive environment in which, in its own way, we can
kind of all succeed.
Now, one thing kind of helping us a little bit after all these years of the card industry and total growth going nowhere,
you have seen in the last few months, just looking at revolving credit data, things inching up from near zero to in March
1.5%, April 2.6%, May 2.5%, June 2.9%, July 3.4%, August 3.3%. So – just a little bit of rising of the tide as well. So
these alleged jealous competitors, I think, are feeling very good about how they're doing in this pretty stable industry.

We'll go to Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities.
<Q - William Carcache>: Thank you. Good evening. There's a lot of focus on Auto, and so I had a couple of questions
that I'll ask upfront. Rich, can you give some perspective around how the Auto business at Capital One has transformed
from its early years to where it is today, and the extent to which, during that time there's been a remixing away from
what was then, maybe a bit more of a focus on subprime customers to perhaps a bit more of a focus on prime today?
And then, just kind of bring us to where your mix of prime versus sub-prime is currently. And maybe talk about the
relative attractiveness of each of those segments in the current market, and then finally, maybe just does it necessarily
have to follow that the risk of loss is greater in sub-prime given collateral quality and the extent to which used car
prices still remain pretty strong? I know there's a lot there, but I would appreciate any color on that.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Then you say, is the risk of loss greater in subprime greater than what, greater than it was
before, greater than prime, what do you...
<Q - William Carcache>: Yeah. I mean, I guess, maybe just talk about, like risk adjusted margins and how they've
changed in both prime and sub-prime, and how collateral plays into that?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Okay. Thank you, Bill. So Capital One in 1998, we entered the Auto Finance business
with the belief that this highly fragmented industry was going to go national. And we wanted to bring
information-based strategies and a national kind of strategy to that business. And we bought a subprime credit card
company, Summit Acceptance Corporation.
So our initial foundation came out of the subprime side. And over the decade and a half that we've been doing it since
we have migrated to a pretty much full credit spectrum perspective. This is not only to leverage scale economies, but
what's very clear is that the real leverage is in deep dealer relationships. And there is economic benefit in that, and I
think in terms of the quality, the kind of loans that come out of that, it's a win-win to build deep dealer relationships.
And also, it is our nature, if you look across the businesses that we do, that we tend to try to play across the credit
spectrum, and tend not to specialize just in one particular place.
So this has been a long journey over this period of time, but you can see the continuing move toward not only near
prime, but so much growth in prime. And I think – and most of this is a matter of solidifying and deepening the existing
dealer relationships that we already have. So I think it's a win-win as we do that.
Now, when you think about the economics of the business, subprime has high margins, and higher losses, and it's all
about how well one can play the credit risk management game. And I think, this is not for the faint of heart, this is for
companies that deeply invest in that, and we have 15 years' experience in Auto, and couple of decades experience in the
Card business at underwriting in that particular segment. And we feel very good about the risk adjusted through cycle
returns that we experience there. And I think our rearview mirror experience in the Great Recession is confirmatory as
well. The prime business – near prime by the way is just in between everything that I'm going to say about prime and
subprime.

On the prime side, this is very thin margins and very low credit losses. And that is a business that – where scale
matters, and every expense dollar is really important and so on. But I think we've managed to build a, one of the top
positions in that business, and while the returns are much lower, we are comfortable with those returns, much – they're
much lower than the subprime. We're comfortable with the returns, and we're very comfortable with the integrated
economics we're getting in this business.
Just one comment about the cycle for a second. The extraordinary returns of a few years ago in the Auto business, as
competition headed for the hills have now pretty much regressed very close to the mean, subprime remains a little bit
above in terms of returns at this point. And the prime business is really right there at the intense point in the cycle from
a margin point of view. But overall things here, we feel good.

upcoming 10-Q?

We'll go to Don Fandetti with Citigroup.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Yes, Rich, I had a question around Apple Pay. And it seems like the banks may be paying
some type of fee to Apple, obviously, you can't talk about specifics. I was curious if you can offset that outside of
fraud? Then secondarily, I know the networks are creating a vault and charging the banks, and there's been some talk
that the banks might create a vault, so I was wondering if you've considered that as well?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Okay. Don, we don't get into the economics of our contract with Apple. But we – the
decisions that we make come with a belief that, this is an important thing for us to do, and I think offers a good
opportunity and upside for us.
The vault that Bill was referring to, let me just comment for a second. One of the key elements in security that's a very
important breakthrough is that, card numbers are not going to be embedded inside the secure element on a phone,
instead one-time single use or a few-times use tokens will be in a sense, sent to the phone so that the risk of extended
fraud is massively reduced.
Visa and MasterCard are creating a vault, and there is activity – there is other activity that's going on of some –
alternative approaches as well, just in the nature of an evolving industry. I think, people aren't leaving single solutions
as the only way to go, but whether it is coming from Visa and MasterCard or from a banking industry vault or really
actually from individual issuers' vault. There's work going on all three of those dimensions, but the big story there is,
this tokenization is a game changer in terms of security.

<Q - Robert P. Napoli>: Thank you. Good afternoon. Just on the Credit Card business, Rich, I mean your growth, just
over the last few months has just really accelerated. And is there – are we getting to high single-digit growth or double
digit growth in the Credit Card business? Or is it just this – just kind of a one-time catch-up in bringing the credit lines,
kind of catching up with the increases in the credit lines that you had delayed for several years? I mean pretty
[indiscernible] (42:06) increase in loan growth from 0% to 5% in the last three or four months?

<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah, it's funny given the heritage of the company that we would think numbers like this
are...
<Q - Robert P. Napoli>: Right.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: ...are so big, but all jokes aside, of course we did live through the period where, not only
were we – so you had – we're going from an environment where we had a very cautious consumer, and we ourselves
had a certain challenges that we had to deal with that I talked about earlier.
And then we also had sort of the running-off of some of the HSBC highest risk at things, and then our multi-year still
going on, avoidance and running-off of high-balance revolver. So that's a lot of things that sort of conspired to generate
some anemic, and frankly negative numbers in terms of our growth.
And what's going on here Bob is not really a kind of one-time effect, there is, on the line increases, there's a bit of a,
there is some element of kind of catch up with that. But I would more leave you with, this is really the product of, the
steady work we've done from a number of years, both in the line increase, innovation side and on originating in the
segments we know so well.
It's actually continued traction there, and you know us well enough to know that we're not going to make a forecast of
growth. But you can also tell that, that we feel pretty good about the traction we have right now, and we do look
forward to seeing continued growth.
<Q - Robert P. Napoli>: Then the last question is, just on the commercial business, the – you've had a very good
growth there. But your loan yield or credit is phenomenal, your yield has dropped almost 50 basis points and deposit
costs are relatively flat year-over-year. And you talked about very intense competition. But how does this, where do the
– these loan yields flatten out here, does the growth really slow down because it's too competitive, can you really
generate the returns you're looking for with the trends that I'm looking at?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Well, I think that the nature, let me comment for a second about the nature of how, I
think, credit cycles work. When you're in the sort of good part of the credit cycle, which has been like the last few
years, where borrowers are more careful, and lenders are more careful, and maybe a little more scarce. As you go on in
the cycle, I think there's a very kind of classic pattern that occurs, that as competition increases, lenders particularly
those who have strong memories of a recent recession like we all do here. What happens is the competition becomes
almost singularly focused on price, and I think that prices fall until you get kind of down to that point where there's not
a lot of room there, and then you kind of move to Phase II in the industries – in the cycle evolution where people start
compromising various underwriting terms.
I think most of the, how I would describe Commercial, this battle has been played out on the pricing side, but also there
are certainly other things going on, on the C&I side. The impact of the CLO market and the covenant light loans has
put a lot of pressure on sort of the lower-end of the marketplace, but it's not impacting banks that much at this point, but
we have a wary eye on that. I mean, just the percentage of loans on the institutional market that are covenant light is
substantially higher than before the great recession.
So we certainly have to keep an eye on this, and in other areas, individual areas as you start to see some loosening of
some underwriting standards in the industry, but I think all-in-all the things aren't too in a bad place yet. The key thing
we're doing is focusing on segments, where we are comfortable with the segments, and for us, that's mostly the
specialty lending segments that are not as subject to 8,000 banks who are looking for assets, trying to go out and see if
they can generate business. This is kind of like the Card business where highly sophisticated limited numbers of
players, who know what they're doing, are competing in these spaces.
So the net effect of all of that is I'm going to leave you with. I mean we still feel that there is good business to be had in
Commercial, but you should be thinking that as this regresses to the main, our own growth is going to do the same.

We'll take Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Christopher R. Donat>: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask about the marketing
spend in the third quarter, which typically, or at least for last few years, has been down from the second quarter but it
uptick this year. I'm just wondering if that's reflective of opportunities you're seeing that are then translating into new
account growth, or is it more tied to other campaigns or something like Quicksilver. Just little explanation about where
we are in the third quarter, also with your comments of expecting an increase in the fourth quarter?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah. So it's a very natural thing for everybody when they think marketing to think of
TV ads, because that's what you all see unless you're blessed by having your mailbox full of some of our solicitations
and so on. I want to say that just as a reminder, the amount of money we spend on television advertising is a modest
portion of the entire expenditures that we do in marketing. So, my short answer is that you've seen the seasonality of
marketing spend and a bunch of that comes from campaign seasonality, so things like our sponsorship of a lot of things
in the NFL in college football and things like that, there's a whole seasonality there. Campaigns you see like
Quicksilver and various things, there is a lot of hard wiring in advance of some of that stuff. But the increases that you
see beyond the normal seasonality really are a reflection of real time seizing of the opportunity that's going on at
Capital One as we see growth opportunities.
So there's kind of a fixed component in the near-term and there's a variable component. And we've always said that, in
the end, that variable component is pretty sizable as well and you're just seeing the manifestation of kind of seizing the
moment and taking advantage of that.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

We'll take Rick Shane with J.P. Morgan.
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: Thanks guys for taking my question. I actually want to circle back a little bit on the question
that Bob Napoli raised. When we look at margins particularly in the Card segment, when we strip out sort of the impact
of the HSBC portfolio and the run-off there, it actually looks like your margins have been pretty stable. Rich, I know
you've given a lot of metrics related to 2015 outlook in terms of credit and expenses, and I don't want to push too hard
in terms of getting you give us one more. But give us a sense, I mean, do you think that we're – and again you guys
have talked for a long time about margin erosion and then backed away from it. Do you think that we're at that
inflection point now?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: You're talking, Rick, about the Card business?
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: I am talking about the Card business.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah.
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: And specific – yeah.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: I don't see evidence that we are. I mean, look, I'm the last guy you'll ever see saying read
my lips, no price reductions from here kind of thing. But no, I see people intensely competing in the segments where
they see their strength. All of them are sophisticated. They all have fresh memories from the great recession. And look,
yes, we have been one that has been predicting margin decline for a number of years. And so, first of all, you probably
shouldn't be asking me giving my credibility that has been lost over that subject, but I see again a very competitive but
stable rational environment. And probably in the longer run, there will be pressure on that, but I don't – it sure has a
different feel to me again than the other segments we play in where things are only going in one direction.

<Q - Richard B. Shane>: Got it. Yeah. No, I mean, I think of it is that several years ago, you talked about margin
compression following CARD Act and eventually sort of through your hands up and said, hey, we're just not seeing it.
It feels that way still?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, again the lot of my predictions about the margin compression back
in the post CARD Act days really was sort of thinking through the mechanics of all the aspects of the CARD Act and
how that would play out and some of that stuff. It didn't play out exactly as we had predicted.
The other thing that's going on, I really want to draw another thing too into this conversation. In both the Commercial
and the Auto space, if I were to calibrate that compared with the Card business. In the Commercial and Auto space, you
literally had people heading for the hill for a whole period of time, as the Great Recession was raging. A lot of Auto
players literally like bailed out of the business. You had a lot of particularly European players bail out of the business
so much capital markets, money, and so on, leaving the Commercial space. And so, supply itself has really changed
over this period of time and it has led to margins to really go up and then to really go down.
In contrast in the Card business, all the players who pretty much entered the Great Recession are still the same list of
players on the other side of it. We're all a little wiser now, but we're all very committed to the Card business and pretty
much doing all the things that continue to make us successful. So the Card business never had the spike in margins that
occurred in the other businesses, nor does it have the regression to the mean therefore, that occurred in the other
businesses.

We'll go to Brian Foran with Autonomous.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: Hi. Good evening. Can you hear me?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Yeah, Brian. Sorry.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: Okay. I guess, I don't want to – I know you said you don't want to give revenue guidance. I
guess, the question I have is, you're being fairly explicit about expenses going up and we're at a $12 billion annualized
run rate. So it feels like the current consensus is $12.3 billion, it feels like up, there's something more than that. And
you're still talking about a 53% to 55% efficiency ratio. I guess, just to make those two tie out, wouldn't revenue growth
has to be like in the high-single digits, just to make the math work?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Brian, if we'd wanted to get that specific by line item, we really would. There is a lot of
moving pieces in the environment. We're trying to do a lot of the same things – a lot of things at the same time, keep
our customers, our regulators, and our shareholders delighted. And particularly, in this interest rate environment, that's
a handful. So we feel comfortable with our guidance of 53% to 54%. We've tried to give you a sense as to what's going
to drive the top-line growth next year, which is really loan growth. Rich has talked a little bit about how we feel about
loan growth. I think, given where we are, that's probably as far as we're prepared to go.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: Fair enough. Maybe a follow-up on a separate tack, is marketplace lending or peer-to-peer,
whichever term you prefer. I mean how do you think about it both as a competitive threat and as an opportunity for
Capital One?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: We have a great interest in all of the innovations that are coming out of the digital space.
I think one thing that is a classic thing that banks do, and I always worry that we resemble that description, is to focus
on things the way that we do it. And miss the fact that there are really breakthrough things going on. So the
peer-to-peer lending which is pretty much non-existent activity on the banking side is clearly picking up quite a bit of
steam in the startups and in the digital space. I think there's a – it is our view that of all the opportunities in the digital

space and we pretty obsessively study those including a bunch of lending ones, the peer-to-peer lending opportunity is
not one that's at the top of our list in terms of the opportunities.
We're going to be very close students of what's going on, but I think there're a number of other really clever things that
are happening with startups that we're a lot more interested in. I think there's – when you think about peer-to-peer
lending and all the risk issues associated with that, and all the regulatory environment we live in, and kind of the things
that we have learned – that I personally, for example, have learned in over two decades of building a consumer lending
company, there's a lot of challenges and a lot of risks in there. So what we're going to do is probably be a very eager
observer and we'll go from there.

Our final question this evening comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Thanks for taking my question. A bigger picture question and then a fairly focused one. Rich,
given all the commentary you gave us in terms of your focus on improving the digital offerings, and at a time when a
lot of the traditional commercial banks are spending a lot of time and effort on doing the same thing, can you give us a
sense as to the trend in your level of comfort, in your ability to keep deposits and maintain deposit pricing relative to
maybe how you were thinking about that a couple of years ago?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Are you talking about asset liability sensitivity or – you seem the [indiscernible] (58:48)
cost.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: I guess I'm really talking about deposit beta. One of the questions we get most often from
investors is Capital One spent a lot of time talking about their digital offerings. And I think that in some cases gets
investors worried about the potential for outflow of deposits faster at Capital One than at a quote-unquote, traditional
bank, even though those traditional banks are now following down the path of Capital One trying to focus on digital
acquisition of deposits.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah. So first of all, so much – when I gave my little spit flying, little passionate speech
about digital a few minutes ago, one thing I want to say is the way digital is transforming banking goes far beyond what
I think, the thing people most think about, which is today there are branches, and tomorrow there is a branch in people's
pocket. And look, that is a very important component of that whole thing. And by having bought ING Direct, by having
before that already built a digital bank of our own, and having a big commitment to digital innovation and having a
heritage of 20 some years being a direct marketing company, I certainly am very interested in the opportunities there.
But the bulk of our digital investment itself and capabilities is really for things that kind of extend beyond some of the
narrowest view about just moving to a bank in your pocket kind of thing.
Let me comment on deposit stickiness, and I really appreciate that you asked the question. If the conventional wisdom
out there is, gosh, will the only way that some of these online banks have got – they've used price as a way to generate
their business. And, again having 10 years' experience ourselves in building an online direct bank and then having
bought ING, we have a window that shows how very different the actual world that we live in is versus some of those
perceptions.
And a lot of it – and it really pivots around, what is it that is drawing customers into a bank like ING DIRECT, for
example, and now Capital One 360. Many years ago at its very beginnings, ING offered one of the highest rates paid.
And over the years, they had a very explicit goal that we are going to move into building a franchise and building a
brand. And the benefit of that is that we're going to get people to come for us for something other than just being
number one in the league tables with respect to rate. And over time, the ING franchise has, now Capital One 360 has
moved way off the frontier of where the hot money goes. And in fact, we now have well more than a decade of
experience of just seeing how long lived these customers are, and also how beloved this franchise is. The customer
loyalty is really extraordinary.

And so while I would say that relative to the branch on the corner, we, in our own planning, are assuming a deposit beta
that is higher than those most sticky of deposits. I think that people are going to be pleasantly surprised by the
resilience of these deposits. You make the other point, which is really important too, which is that there is a blurring of
the lines here over time as more and more of banking becomes digital. And I think, especially, with Capital One
strategy ourselves to kind of create the fusion of the truly kind of ING oriented digital bank and the physical
distribution Capital One that we are. And I think that as our own lines blur, also you're going to see the industry lines
blur, and I think that over time it is a franchise with surprising striking resilience.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: And Rich just to add, extending that beyond just how online versus in branch deposits
respond, I think the way your whole liability mix response to changes in environment is a much bigger question. You
know it's a function of your wholesale retail mix, what's insured, what's not insured, the size and duration of your
deposit relationships. And as we look at it, we don't feel disadvantaged relative to peers. And I think if you looked at
our asset sensitivity, you'd find it lines up pretty closely with the average peer bank.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Thanks, Steve. And then a quick question for you perhaps, you mentioned the LCR
requirement. How far along are you on that end? Was the decline in the yield on investment securities this quarter
versus the second quarter driven by some of the actions you've taken over the past three months?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: We have been rotating. There'll probably be a little bit more, but that's not a big impact
on margin. We're going to be fine in terms of meeting the transitional requirements. LCR isn't a huge issue for us,
except, there is a little bit of a margin compression. And obviously, there is some OpEx getting our systems in a place
where we'll be able to calculate all the stuff on a daily basis. It's a good example of the regulatory cost that Rich was
mentioning.
