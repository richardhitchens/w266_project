MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Leticia and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any
background noise. [Operator Instructions].
Thank you. Ms. Moehle, you may begin your conference.
Mary Jo Moehle, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications
Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call as we report Charter's earnings for the second quarter of
2010. The results we're reporting this morning are included in the news release we issued over PR Newswire at 8 AM
Eastern Time and posted on our website charter.com. The website also contains a presentation that accompanies today's
comments.
Before we proceed, I'd like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements
contained in Charter's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 filed earlier this morning. We'll not review those
risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call; however we encourage you to read them carefully.
Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans, and prospects constitute
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause
actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. You are cautioned that any forward-looking statements
reflect management's current view only, and that Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements
or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.

Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting as required by GAAP. As a result, our
pre-emergence financial statements are not comparable in some respects to those following our emergence from
bankruptcy. However, the revenue and expense items through adjusted EBITDA that we'll discuss on this morning's
call were not impacted by fresh start adjustments.
During the course of today's call, we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in this morning's
earnings release. These non-GAAP measures as defined by Charter may not be comparable to measures with similar
titles used by other companies.
In today's earnings release, we reported results in accordance with GAAP as well as pro forma results for 2009 and
2010. These pro forma results reflect the divestitures of cable systems in 2009 and 2010 as if they had occurred on
January 1, 2009. On this morning's call, we'll be referring to pro forma year-over-year growth rates.
Also on this morning's call along with Mike Lovett are Kevin Howard, Interim Chief Financial Officer; Marwan
Fawaz, Executive Vice President of Operations and Chief Technology Officer, and Ted Schremp, our Chief Marketing
Officer.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike Lovett, President and CEO.
Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Mary Jo. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Given the challenging environment, we're pleased
with our continued increases in revenue generating units and the resulting top line growth. Our focus continues to be on
discipline execution to deliver solid operational and financial results along with strategic investment to position us for
long-term growth.
I'm pleased with our success in deploying switched digital video and DOCSIS 3.0 and we recently accelerated our 2010
launches. Approximately 25% of our systems are now SDV enabled and we plan to increase that to about 60% by year
end. DOCSIS 3.0 is available to nearly one-third of our footprint and we plan to have it available to about half our
footprint by the end of this year.
In our commercial business we are adding capabilities to serve new customer segments and capture additional market
share. Our efforts to improve customer experience with a focus on first call resolution and network reliability are being
recognized. Our scores in third-party surveys have increased this year with improvements in quality, value, customer
loyalty and customer expectations.
While we're pleased that our efforts are starting to be recognized by our customers, there is still much work to be done
and we remain keenly focused on driving further improvements in this area. While the strategic investments we're
making to enhance our product and service capabilities and expand our commercial offerings are weighing on margin
in the near term, we're confident these investments will better position us for long-term growth.
We expect to begin realizing the benefits of these investments as we move into 2011. We maintain our balanced and
disciplined approach to delivering operational and financial growth while positioning the company for future success.
Our business continues to be solid with second quarter revenues of 1.8 billion, a 4.9% increase over the prior year,
driven by continued growth in bundle penetration, Internet and commercial customers and advertising sales. Adjusted
EBITDA in the quarter was 646 million representing 1.3% year-over-year growth and we generated a 127 million of
free cash flow during the second quarter.
Focusing on the residential side of our business, revenues increased 4%. We added approximately 6,000 revenue
generating units during the quarter, which reflects typical second quarter unit seasonality. Year-to-date, we added about
250,000 RGUs nearly doubling net additions in the first half of 2009.
As consumers demand faster Internet connections, we're capitalizing on our speed advantage. In the second quarter, we
added 22,000 Internet customers, more than doubling Internet net gains year-over-year.

Our DOCSIS 3.0 launches are proving successful as our product superiority and availability of Ultra60, our 60 megabit
product are driving a shift to higher speed tiers. With approximately 60% increase in home networking customers'
year-over-year, about 17% of our customers now rely on our home wireless solution, which contributes meaningfully to
ARPU growth.
Increasing Charter's digital penetration continues to be a focus. And through strategic investments in advanced
technologies such as switched digital video, we're enhancing our digital video offering to drive growth.
In the second quarter we added approximately 26,000 digital customers and our digital net gain year-to-date is six times
greater than the net gain for the first half of 2009. Digital penetration now stands at 71% up from 64% last year as our
video product enhancements are driving increased demand. With a 30% increase in customers taking HD and/or DVR
set-tops during the quarter, nearly half our digital customers now have these advanced services in home.
Video-on-Demand orders for the quarter grew 30% year-over-year as increased content and awareness generated more
usage. These advanced video services are increasing revenue and enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. We
added 35,000 phone customers during the quarter growing our triple-play customer base to 1.3 million. Our overall
bundle penetration rose to more than 59% in the second quarter and we see the opportunity for still greater phone and
bundle growth.
Value is the key bundle message and we're adding a growing number of customers to our 24 month bundle price
guarantee. Given today's economy, value, simplicity and predictability are important to consumers and our bundle
provides all that and more.
Moving to Charter business. We delivered a 10% increase in revenues year-over-year reflecting strength in our
small-medium business service offerings. We continue to gain share in this segment and we're broadening our business
solutions portfolio as we move up market into the carrier and wholesale segment. I believe there is a significant
additional opportunity for Charter in the commercial space and we're prioritizing our investments and resources to
leverage our infrastructure to drive further commercial growth.
We're pleased to report a return to growth in ad sales this year. We generated a 16% increase in revenues during the
quarter driven by higher demand across all segments. With a stronger balance sheet and the generation of positive cash
flows, we have and will continue to evaluate a broad range of strategic investments.
There are a few categories of opportunities. There are revenue generating opportunities to expand this business, for
example; entering into the new commercial segments and enhancing products and services. There are M&A
opportunities around tightening up or better clustering our footprint to improve efficiencies in our operations. And there
are opportunities to reduce leverage and create a more balanced maturity profile.
There are a number of ways we evaluate the various opportunities. First, we look at what immediate and long-term
impact the related activities will have on our customers. We'll also look at scalability and resource prioritization. It is
the right focus for the company and doesn't meet our returning criteria. We've always prided ourselves in disciplined
execution and we'll maintain that approach as we evaluate strategic opportunities for future growth.
Now I'd like to introduce Kevin Howard, who is serving as our Interim CFO, while we complete our search. Kevin has
been with Charter for eight years and serves as a Chief Accounting Officer and I'm confident we're in good hands with
Kevin and his team. Kevin?
Kevin D. Howard, Interim Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President,
Controller and Chief Accounting Officer
Thanks Mike. Revenues totaled $1.77 billion for the quarter, up 4.9%. Year-to-date, revenues were up 4.7%. Video
revenues, which account for just over 50% of total revenues, were essentially flat in the quarter. Declines in basic video
customers were offset by strong digital and advanced services sales.

Consistent with the second quarter of last year, we lost approximately 77,000 basic customers during the quarter,
essentially all of which were video only. We added approximately 26,000 digital video customers during the quarter
compared to a loss of 6,000 digital customers in the second quarter of last year.
Video ARPU increased 4.8% due to increase in digital, high definition and DVR penetration. High-speed Internet
revenues were up 9.5% to 402 million, as we continue to capitalize on our speed superiority. We added 22,000 Internet
customers in the quarter more than doubling our second quarter 2009 net gain. Internet ARPU increased 1.9% driven
by customer demand for higher speeds and continued growth in home networking.
Phone revenues increased 10.8% in the second quarter, driven by continued bundled growth. We added 35,000
residential phone customers during the quarter with phone penetration now reaching 16%.
Residential phone ARPU decreased 4.2% year-over-year reflecting phones role in the bundles pricing strategy. In total,
residential revenue was up 4.1% year-over-year contributing approximately three quarters of the total revenue growth.
Commercial revenues increased 10% to 121 million reflecting increased sales of the Charter Business Bundle and
customer growth. As Mike indicated, we continue to make operating and capital investments to expand our commercial
offerings to generate future growth. Advertising revenue increased 16.1% as a result of improvements across all
sectors, but primarily in political, automotive, and furniture.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was 646 million, an increase of 1.3% compared to the year ago quarter. Operating
cost and expenses increased 7% resulting in 1.3 percentage points of margin compression, as a result of increases in
programming cost and the activities related to strategic investments in SDV, DOCSIS 3.0, and our commercial
business.
As Mike said earlier, this will continue to impact margins in the near term and we expect to begin to realize benefits of
these investments as we move into 2011. Programming expenses increased 6% as a result of annual rate increases. We
expect programming costs to increase at approximately the same rate in the second half of 2010 as in the first half.
Labor costs continue to increase due to increased installations and strategic product and bandwidth initiatives.
Marketing spend has increased year-over-year, but remains approximately 4% of revenue. Capital expenditures totaled
339 million for the quarter, a 68 million increase year-over-year, primarily due to strategic investments.
About 80% of our CapEx in the quarter was success based. We continue to expect CapEx for the year to be
approximately 1.2 billion. We generated positive free cash flow of 127 million in the second quarter and 332 million
year-to-date.
Total principal amount of debt at the end of the second quarter was 12.7 billion. Total availability under the revolving
credit facility was about 800 million at June 30, 2010. Year-to-date, we've extended more than 5 billion of our 2013
and 2014 maturities. We'll continue to take an opportunistic approach to improving our leverage and maturity profile.
We reported solid results for the quarter and we will continue our balanced and disciplined approach to the business.
Now let me hand the call back to Mike.
Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Kevin. We're pleased with our performance given the challenging environment. We're cautious about the
strength of the economy with the value that bundle plays well in this environment. And we believe we're making the
right investments to generate future growth.
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator and take your questions.

[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak [Pivotal Research Group LLC].
<Q - Jeffrey Shelton>: Hi, this is Jeff Shelton for Jeff Wlodarczak. I have a question about margins for the quarter;
what was the impact of the strategic investments in dollar terms that impacted the compression?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Jeff, I don't have the exact dollar terms, but
probably the best way to position this when you think about we're replacing our bets on generating longer term growth.
If you look at our investments in our commercial business and then service labor primarily associated with our
deployment of the strategic issues on DOCSIS 3.0 and switched digital video. In those two areas, if we weren't
investing in those long-term growth opportunities and those strategic investments weren't being made in the quarter,
you were to see margin relatively flat.
<Q - Jeffrey Shelton>: And you expect the dollar amount to be relatively similar for the third and fourth quarter?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We're not stating what we expect for third and
fourth quarter, but we expect these investments to start to show return as we enter into 2011.
<Q - Jeffrey Shelton>: Okay. So probably your previous statements about being comfortable with the flat margins
year-over-year probably need to be adjusted for the strategic investments where you'll see a positive impact next year?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I mean that's probably a reasonable way to look at
it for the year.
<Q - Jeffrey Shelton>: Okay. And second question, can you provide some color on your interest in Bresnan and given
what appeared to be attractive multiple for that property or would you be interested in selling off some of your non-core
properties?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well as I mentioned, when we think about the
position we have with our balance sheet today and how we're thinking about the filters of strategic investments, we
look at expanding revenue opportunities organically, internally; commercial is probably a good example of that. When
we talk about M&A, we look at the opportunity to create additional efficiencies around clustering whether that's either
acquiring or divesting.
<Q - Jeffrey Shelton>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kim [Goldman Sachs].
<Q - Jason Kim>: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. The first question is, I was wondering how
you view your pricing, not the total ARPU, but at the product level compared to your cable peers? Do you feel like
you're at the right level right now or is there an opportunity to be more aggressive on pricing as you look to reaccelerate
your RGU growth, that's my first question?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Jason, I think it is – kind of a high level,
strategically over the last several years and we've talked about this a number of times. We have been working diligently
to close the ARPU gap relative to our industry peers and feel like we're in the ballpark now and we're striking at what I
would argue is a healthier balance between rate and volume.
If you look at our monthly recurring revenue through the first six months of this year, there is a very healthy balance
between 50% of our growth coming from rate and 50% of our growth coming from volume, so I feel good about where
we're at. From a pricing strategy standpoint, may be Ted could add a little color.

<A - Ted Schremp>: Yeah. I mean, Internet is probably a good example to talk through and we got a lot of levers
within each one of the product portfolio. So for Internet example – for example, as we deploy DOCSIS 3.0 we've got
an Ultra60 product that's priced at $100 all the way down to a 1 mg, what I call sort of a DSL price fighter product at
90.99.
And so what we've done is leveraging our direct response capabilities and targeting capabilities and essentially
identified prospective customers along that demand curve. And really done what I would call a classic good, better,
best retail price positioning to make sure that we're able to identify folks along the demand curve, but ensure that we
drive ARPU as we do that.
One of the key levers that we have to across the product portfolio, but certainly again with Internet are things like home
networking and other value added services that are strong sort of value added up-sells that helping drive ARPU as well.
<Q - Jason Kim>: Okay, thanks. And I was wondering if you could provide any more color in terms of your monthly
RGU trends? And obviously, the second quarter is seasonally weak, but even beyond seasonality if you saw any
particular strength or weakness as you move through the second quarter and what you've seen so far in the third
quarter?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. We did see strength through the first five
months and there is as you stated typically particularly the video side of our business seasonality – a seasonal
downturn. We saw softness in June that continued into July; we're keeping a keen eye on it relative to some of the
economic indicators as I'm sure you're tracking as well.
But when we think about the value proposition we have with the bundle, and really I think we have a pretty good
position despite the environment that we're in. We've got some examples in markets where we continue to have great
success that are challenged probably more so than other parts of the country. And maybe Ted, you want to add a little
color, I think Michigan is probably one other example.
<A - Ted Schremp>: Yeah, Michigan is probably one of the best examples. It's been a strong phone and triple-play
market for us. Obviously, they experienced economic challenges earlier on than the rest of the footprint. But it's been
one of our strongest phone and triple-play markets and continues to be.
So, not only does it have some of our highest phone penetration, it also has some of our highest phone and bundled
growth. So we absolutely see the value of the triple-play bundle and frankly price guarantee as well as another retention
vehicle above and beyond the value of the triple-play.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And Jason we see as we come out of the seasonal
downturn in Q2, the back-to-school benefit. It's a little early in August for us to really state that. We're probably about
10 days away from where we start to see the real traction associated with that, but obviously we're optimistic.
<Q - Jason Kim>: Okay. Just to follow-up, would you characterize the slowdown you saw in June and July as beyond
typical seasonal slowdown or typical as you've seen in the past?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We saw a little bit more than we've seen
historically.
<Q - Jason Kim>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne [Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.]
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Hey good morning guys, it's Ben. Mike, I wanted to ask you about the video business. I
know it's, I guess the least profitable of the revenue streams; but at the same time I think you're making some pretty
significant investments in the product. And maybe Marwan if you can chime in as well, if you look at the basic sub

losses, are those impacted this quarter by the digital transition comp? Are you seeing anything out of the satellite guys
they've all sort of picked up their Free HD marketing out there and I'm wondering if that's having an impact at all?
And then in the switched digital market, I think Mike you said that your 25% rolled out with SDV. What do those
markets look like in terms of HD channel accounts versus your non-SDV markets; and are you seeing a difference in
operating metrics?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So I'll take a couple of these and then I'll probably
hand off to Marwan on the last one Ben. On the video side of the business, the majority virtually all of our losses were
video only customers. Unlike some of our industry peers, we didn't chase the digital transition quite as aggressively in
2009, so we don't see a real roll off trend associated with that in this past quarter. And I think you can see that in the
trends from a year-over-year standpoint, we're relatively flat on losses for 2009. So didn't see any significant impact
there.
From a competitive standpoint, we have seen a fairly significant increase in competitive advertising from the satellite
players, particularly during this quarter. And I think that did have a bit of an impact on us and I think intuitively, you
can tie that to the single product loss, the video only household loss that we saw in the quarter. The challenges that we
saw there were seasonal downturn obviously, but competitively to a single product provider.
On the SDV deployments maybe Marwan can give a little color as to the HD channels we're seeing and then also
operational benefits.
<A - Marwan Fawaz>: Yeah, Ben this is Marwan. We've – as you know we've ramped up our SDV deployment late
last year going into this year we've had several markets now that are enjoying the benefits of SDVs. We've launched
additional channels in those markets, some of them up to 60 linear HD channels. And thus SDV gives us the ability to
grow as many as 100 channels on the linear side. So we're seeing benefits of that. We're adding contents – specialty
content on HD as well as SD, standard-definition contents like ethnic programs and the like.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And Ben, the thing that I'd add on the – from a
long-term perspective where we look at – how do we combat some of this. Obviously, the bundle plays significantly in
customer retention. But as you can see, we're focusing on driving deeper penetration of our digital product as well as
our advanced digital services. And we see retentive benefit associated with that as well. There is customer satisfaction
and loyalty that comes from all of those products and services being in the household. So that will continue to be a
focus for us.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: And presumably the analog video subs are the ones probably most at risk?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Those – exactly, those are the most risk customers
we have today and we're trying to change that by driving deeper digital penetration.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: And if I could just sneak one more in, just going back to the investments you're making
which I think all certainly makes sense. I was just curious are the OpEx investments around SDV and DOCSIS 3, are
those of permanent head count around engineering talent; I guess I would have always associated those roll outs as just
mostly capital spending, but maybe I am thinking about it the wrong way?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: They are really near term investments, similar to
when we deployed our residential voice product, hard in the networks, so you see some additional activity in service
call truck rolls, see the same thing as we deploy SDV and DOCSIS 3.0. So there is a spike associated with it, and there
is a near time drag on margins, but that's not additional head count that is sustained.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Okay. So that was in theory roll-off then as you get through this?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Okay, all right. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Pace [J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.]
<Q - Michael Pace>: Hi, thank you. I'm sorry if I missed this, I jumped on a little late. But, getting back to the
commercial business, I noticed a deceleration of growth in the quarter, but your RGUs in that business line was still
pretty robust. I'm wondering are you selling to obviously lower ARPU customers. Can you give a little more color on
what's going on there? And can you talk about your ability to push more to somewhat larger enterprises?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah Mike, that's a great question and it ties
directly to the strategic investments we're making. As you know, we've been in the small-medium business space
serving that segment for several years and we've had good success there. There has been some particularly in light of
the tough economic times that some of these small-medium business owners are facing, we have done some additional
pricing that allows us to drive additional RGUs near term pricing and also to drive deeper penetration in that segment.
Our focus is really about expanding our product portfolio to drive deeper penetration into that segment, so providing
additional product mix that allows us to go back to that market with a different message and a different value
proposition. And then we're investing in moving up market into the carrier and wholesale segment.
We currently have about 500 – probably the best example of where we're having early traction with regards to carrier
and wholesale is on cellular backhaul. We've got about 515 sites that are actually lit today and a very robust pipeline to
serve that segment.
<Q - Michael Pace>: And then given that your free cash flow profile and I guess the strength of the balance sheet is –
is there anything in the commercial side on the M&A front that you would look at? Does that make sense whether it's
fiber based assets or CLEC [Competitive Local Exchange Carrier] assets in some of your markets?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah similar to any other aspect of our business,
we would look at M&A from the standpoint of does it add additional market share opportunity, does it add capabilities?
We don't have anything specific to speak to, but certainly we're evaluating all the opportunities to accelerate that
business.
<Q - Michael Pace>: Great. Thank you.

We have a question from the line of James Ratcliffe [Barclays Capital].
<Q - James Ratcliffe>: Good morning folks. Thanks for taking the question. Looking at both pretty solid growth on
video and Internet ARPUs, can you do all this aggregation related to a couple earlier questions of how much of that is
rate increases versus a mix shift to people taking either more services or higher-end broadband services and the like?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: On the video side, our average rate adjustment for
2010 was in the 3.5 to 4% range. So a fairly large chunk of the overall growth is coming from the mix of additional
products and services; so consumer driven.
<Q - James Ratcliffe>: And on the broadband side?
<A - Ted Schremp>: Yes, on broadband it's almost purely home networking we've had very strong growth there and
see very healthy attach rates. Home networking incidentally helps to drive or more than incidentally helps drive speed
up-sell as well. So as we see multiple users and multiple devices tapping into that single Internet connection, we're able
to up-sell on speed above and beyond the incremental home networking ARPU.
<Q - James Ratcliffe>: Great. Thanks.

Your last question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield [Pali Research].
<Q - Richard Greenfield>: Hey a couple of questions, I'm sorry. First-off on AT&T lost a substantial number of
broadband customers, I wanted to get a sense from you, you obviously added broadband subs, but the business
obviously continues to slow at least sequentially. And we're trying to get a perspective on how big of an opportunity do
you think broadband share shift from the RBOCs [Regional Bell Operating Companies] to you all is given the problems
they are having with their DSL product?
And then two, I noticed that phone ARPU was down; it seemed a little bit weaker than it has been. I'm just curious kind
of what you're seeing if you're needing to discount more to drive penetration on that product or just kind of how you
think about the growth of phone ARPU going forward? Thanks.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks Rich. And regarding the broadband side,
obviously we doubled our year-over-year RGU volume there. So we're pleased with the success we are having
particularly as we deploy DOCSIS 3.0 and get the pull through benefit of our Ultra60 launches. Ted could probably add
a little bit of color on where we're viewing share shift relative to DSL?
<A - Ted Schremp>: Yeah. So we don't have our final Q2 numbers in yet and obviously folks are reporting this week,
so we'll have a better sense of it. But obviously, we feel we're happy with our performance in the first half. We did
speed increase in March, actually increased all of our speed tiers by about 60% across the product portfolio; enhanced
our position around speed superiority.
A lot of what we're seeing from a consumer perspective in terms of bandwidth demand is in fact driven by home
networking and all of the device ecosystem inside the home and we only see that continuing. So, certainly we're going
to continue to leverage our speed advantage and hope to see the kind of performance that we have so far year-to-date.
From a phone ARPU perspective, I think we're at a point where phone is arguably more about the bundle and the
customer lifetime value associated with the churn reduction of triple-play. And so as we go to market, both to new
customers and continue to up-sell customers into phone, the primary objective is to solve for customer lifetime value
and you'll see net impact on ARPU.
Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer
I'd like to thank you all for your time today and we look forward to talking to you again soon. Thanks.
