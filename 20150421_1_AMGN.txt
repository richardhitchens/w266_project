We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you
separately by e-mail.
Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement which in summary says that through the course of
our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary
materially.
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?
Robert A. Bradway
Okay. Thank you, Arvind. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our call.
As you can see from our results, we are off to a solid start so far in 2015 and our performance during the quarter is a
good indication that we're on track to deliver our long-term objectives as well. Financially, we delivered a strong
quarter really across the board. Our U.S. business delivered 15% growth, and internationally we were up 10% at
constant currency. Product performance was solid across the portfolio and I was especially pleased with the strong
growth we delivered for Prolia, XGEVA, Kyprolis, Enbrel and Vectibix. Heading into the balance of the year, we have
good momentum in our base business, and Tony will have more to say about that in a few minutes.
Our earnings growth of 33% reflects the benefits of our transformation initiatives and our discipline in controlling
expenses ahead of the launch investments that we'll make later this year. As David will share, based on the strong
performance in the quarter, we're raising our 2015 earnings guidance.
With the Corlanor approval last week, we're excited to bring the first new heart failure medicine into the market in the
U.S. in almost a decade. Corlanor was approved to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in
patients with chronic heart failure which, as you know, is a significant economic burden on our society. Through
Corlanor, we look forward to establishing our presence in the cardiovascular field as we prepare to launch Repatha later
this year.
In addition to Corlanor, we're launching BLINCYTO for patients with relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic
leukemia and our Neulasta On-body Injector which addresses a real clinical problem with an innovative solution that
enables the administration of Neulasta the day after chemotherapy. R&D, as you know, is a core focus at Amgen, and
our pipeline continues to deliver results that position us well for future growth.
We reported the third successful Phase III study for AMG 416, an intravenous calcimimetic for use in kidney disease,
and a second successful Phase III study for our lead biosimilar product, adalimumab.
In oncology, Kyprolis delivered impressive results, showing a doubling of progression-free survival versus bortezomib
in relapsed multiple myeloma patients in our ENDEAVOR study. And of course these data come on the back of the
unprecedented progression-free survival data that were generated in our ASPIRE trial. Kyprolis is currently under
accelerated review in both the U.S. and Europe for multiple myeloma patients who've relapsed and we're excited with
the opportunity to bring this important medicine to many more patients globally.
Sean will speak more about progress in our pipeline in a few moments. And in summary, there's a lot to be pleased
about with our progress so far this year. Our strategy is working and it's delivering results. We're executing effectively
across the company, controlling the things that are ours to control. Our focus and priorities have never been more clear.
Our launches are proceeding well and we're ready to launch Repatha later this year.
We continue to grow key products, including Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Sensipar and Nplate. We have strong
momentum as we defend our base business against new competition. And our transformation efforts are delivering
efficiencies and cost savings across the company and we're being very disciplined about capturing them. Finally, we
continue to advance our robust pipeline of important medicines, setting the stage for long-term growth.

Before I hand over to David, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their
unwavering commitment to delivering for patients and for shareholders.
David?
David W. Meline
Okay. Thanks, Bob.
Turning to the first quarter on page five of the slide deck. Revenues of $5 billion grew 11% year-over-year, with 12%
product sales growth, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Total revenue and product sales
were impacted 2% unfavorably due to foreign exchange headwinds.
Adjusted operating income at $2.4 billion grew 32% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved to 50% for
the quarter, reflecting strong growth and continued progress from our transformation initiative.
On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.1% improved by 0.6 points, driven by lower royalties and higher
average net sales price, offset partially by product mix. Research and development expenses at approximately $850
million were down 14% versus the prior year. R&D spend was favorably impacted by the transformation and process
improvements across the area. SG&A expenses were flat on a year-on-year basis as increased commercial investments
in new product launches were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Total operating expenses declined 3% year-on-year and 22% sequentially. This performance reflects the combination
of the first quarter being typically the lowest expense level during the calendar year plus a share of the $400 million of
incremental savings expected during 2015 from our transformation initiative. Going forward, we expect quarterly
expenses to increase in line to modestly above historical trends, reflecting increasing launch and R&D investments
through the balance of 2015.
Other income and expenses improved 9% on a year-over-year basis and $146 million in the quarter. The adjusted tax
rate was 17% for the quarter, a 1.6 point increase versus Q1 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the
unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings, partially offset by a state audit settlement in the
quarter. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 33% on a year-over-year basis.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page six. For the first quarter we generated $1.2 billion of free cash
flow, an increase of $0.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales and
profitability. Total debt outstanding ended Q1 at $30.3 billion and cash and investments totaled $27.1 billion.
Additionally our first quarter 2015 dividend increased to $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior period.
Finally in the first quarter of 2015 we increased our share repurchase activity with over $450 million of share
repurchases or approximately 3 million shares in the period. We intend to continue repurchases at a stepped-up level in
2015, consistent with the commitment to complete up to $2 billion of repurchases by the end of the year.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on page seven. We remain on track with our plans to
continue supporting growth of the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. With
regard to updated outlook for 2015 revenue, we are raising the bottom end of the range, resulting in a revised guidance
of $20.9 billion to $21.3 billion for 2015. This reflects solid revenue performance in the first quarter, partially offset by
the effects of foreign currency headwinds which will exceed $200 million for 2015 at current rates versus our original
planning framework. Versus 2014 results, we expect over a $300 million revenue impact or 2% in 2015 at current
foreign exchange rates.
Our revenue guidance also reflects progress on our product launch activities as well as our latest view of evolving
competitive dynamics. We're also increasing our 2015 earnings per share outlook to $9.35 to $9.65 from the previous
$9.05 to $9.40 forecast. The increased earnings outlook reflects continued conviction in our strategy and strong first
quarter performance, along with an incremental expected headwind of $0.05 per share from foreign exchange. Versus
2014 results, we expect a $0.12 EPS impact in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates. We would also expect our

quarterly tax rate to increase throughout the balance of the year, to be more in line with our guidance range of 18% to
19% which, as a reminder, excludes the benefit of the Federal R&D tax credit in 2015.
Finally we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $800 million this year. This concludes the
financial update.
I will now turn the call over to Tony.
Anthony C. Hooper
Thank you, David. And good afternoon, folks.
You'll find the summary of our global sales performance for the first quarter on slide number nine. I'm pleased to report
that we're off to a strong start in our first quarter of 2015. We saw excellent execution across all aspects of our
commercial strategy: launching products, growing our newer products and defending our mature in line brands.
Globally, product sales grew 12% year-over-year. As Bob mentioned our U.S. business delivered outstanding results
with 15% year-over-year growth and our international business grew 10% year-over-year, excluding the negative
impact of foreign exchange.
Let me first update you on our new product launches. In the U.S., our recent launches of BLINCYTO for acute
lymphoblastic leukemia and the On-body Injector for Neulasta are going very well, with positive feedback from
health-care providers. BLINCYTO, as you know, was approved in two and a half months by the FDA, underscoring the
unmet medical need in ALL patients. We are seeing a broad acceptance of the product, with orders from most major
institutions and good reimbursement access.
We launched the On-body Injector for Neulasta during quarter one. Patients no longer have to return to the hospital 24
hours later after their chemo. The On-body Injector simply infuses Neulasta at home. While still in the early phases of
our launch, we have seen good breadth of prescribing, with about 800 accounts ordering product to date.
And last Wednesday we received the approval for Corlanor to reduce the risk of hospitalization in patients with chronic
heart failure. Corlanor is the first new medicine for chronic heart failure in the U.S. in almost a decade. Heart failure is
a common condition that affects nearly 6 million people, with annual costs of over $30 billion in the U.S. The majority
of these costs are related to hospitalizations. And we at Amgen estimate that as many as 1 million patients could be
candidates for Corlanor therapy.
Since our approval last week, our manufacturing team have worked through the weekend printing labels, packaging
product and made our first shipment to wholesalers yesterday. Product will be in pharmacies later this week and our
sales force are trained and in the field. We're excited about the opportunity and ready to bring this innovative new
medicine to cardiologists and patients.
Let me now turn to the first quarter performance, beginning with Enbrel. On slide 12, you'll see that Enbrel delivered
strong growth of 13% year-over-year primarily driven by price. Segment growth remained strong in both rheumatology
and dermatology, growing 23% and 30% respectively. Competition continues to intensify, particularly in dermatology
where Enbrel has lost five points of value share over the last year but still retains 27% share and will continue to be a
logical choice for patients starting treatment with a biologic.
On slide 13, you'll see that sequentially Enbrel sales declined 17%. Units declined 7%, reflecting normal quarter one
season patterns and price growth of 9% and there was a 17% unfavorable impact from the inventory. You may recall
from our conference call in January that wholesale inventories ended 2014 at a higher than normal level by about $40
million. And we expect the level to return to normal in quarter one.
However, in the first quarter the days on hand dropped to the low end of the range. Additionally, revised prescription
data revealed that there was a modest end customer buy-in in the fourth quarter which then burnt off in quarter one.

To summarize, in quarter one, the lower than normal wholesaler inventory level, coupled with the end customer
burn-off, negatively impacted sales. We expect Enbrel to deliver significant growth in 2015. And as we've said before,
we remain committed to Enbrel becoming a $5 billion brand.
I'll move now to Prolia. Prolia delivered 39% growth year-over-year with 30% unit growth in the U.S. and 44% in
international. Over the last year, Prolia market share grew three percentage points in the U.S. and about four percentage
points in Europe. This performance is driven by our program [indiscernible] (17:01), improved adherence, along with
direct-to-consumer marketing in the U.S. Prolia is now capturing one in three patients starting post-menopausal
osteoporosis treatment in the United States. As you can see from the March prescription data, the expected Q2 pickup
is underway.
XGEVA continued its solid performance with a 22% growth year-over-year. U.S. unit share increased four percentage
points over last year and in Europe unit share increased about seven percentage points. Our brand strategy continues to
focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition.
Over time, Vectibix has received expanded indications into earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer in
both the U.S. and Europe. This delivered an 18% year-over-year growth with exceptionally strong unit demand. We've
also recently received an additional first line indication in combination with FOLFIRI in Europe.
Let me now turn to Kyprolis which delivered year-on-year growth of 59% and quarter-over-quarter growth of 19%. In
the U.S., we received priority review for label expansion into second line based on the ASPIRE data with a late July
PDUFA date. We have submitted application in Europe and is currently under review. These data, together with our
compelling ENDEAVOR data, should position Kyprolis to the best-in-class proteasome inhibitor.
Sensipar grew 24% year-over-year driven by 14% unit growth, price, and inventory levels compared to quarter one in
2014. Nplate grew 12% year-over-year with strong unit growth in all regions across the world.
Now we'll turn to our mature brands, starting with filgrastim franchise. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 4%
in the first quarter, driven mainly by price and inventory changes. As I mentioned earlier, we launched the On-body
Neulasta Injector during the quarter with very positive feedback from both providers and patients. NEUPOGEN
declined 15% year-over-year, mainly due to branded short-acting competition in the U.S. But strong execution by our
U.S. NEUPOGEN team resulted in relative stable, quarter-on-quarter sequential market share in the short-acting market
at around 80%. Granix share was about 15% and Leukine about 5%. We continue to compete account by account and
reinforce NEUPOGEN's long track record of clinical efficacy and safety as well as our ability to reliably supply
patients.
With potential competition from biosimilars expected in the U.S. this year, we will leverage the success we've had in
the U.S. versus branded competition, as well as our considerable experience with NEUPOGEN biosimilars in Europe.
Next up is EPOGEN which had an unusual 16% year-over-year in the quarter. On top of price gains of 7%, EPOGEN's
year-over-year growth benefited from a favorable compare to quarter one 2014, where end customers drew down
inventory levels significantly. In addition, quarter one 2015 benefited from favorable accounting and discount
adjustments, as well as higher end customer inventories due to an SKU conversion. From an underlying business
perspective, the dosing and hemoglobin levels remained relatively stable and the unit demand is relatively flat.
Aranesp sales grew 4% year-over-year with a unit growth of 6%. A portion of this growth reflects the timing of early
tender orders in the Middle East versus 2014.
So in conclusion, I'd like to personally thank our Amgen customer-facing teams across the world. This is a unique
moment in our company's history where we are simultaneously launching, growing and defending more brands than
ever before. I know our team is embracing the Amgen value of competing intensely to win and has a clear focus on
delivering value for shareholders, Amgen and most importantly for patients.

Sean E. Harper
Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon.
Well, it continues to be a very busy time for Amgen R&D and today I'd like to start with our cardiovascular program,
specifically the recent U.S. approval of Corlanor or ivabradine for chronic symptomatic systolic heart failure. Chronic
heart failure is on the rise in the United States and represents a very large and growing healthcare expenditure burden,
primarily due to the cost of repeated hospitalizations in these very fragile patients. In fact, reducing hospitalizations in
these patients is a specific focus of many healthcare systems, including Medicare.
A resting heart rate of 70 or more appears to be a maladaptive response in the setting of chronically reduced cardiac
pump function. Yet despite the availability of the beta blockers, many heart failure patients in the United States
maintain such an elevated heart rate at rest. For these patients, Corlanor's unique mechanism of action may potentially
benefit them with respect to reducing their risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure.
In the large outcome study performed by our colleagues at Servier, called SHIFT, that risk was reduced by 26%
compared to placebo on top of standard of care, including beta blockades. Obviously, reduction in hospitalizations
reflects patients doing better overall in terms of their heart failure management. We're not only thrilled with the
prospect of making Corlanor available to chronic heart failure patients in the U.S. but we also view this as an excellent
way to introduce ourselves as a company to the U.S. cardiology community as we prepare for the launch of our PCSK9
inhibitor Repatha.
Of course, Repatha continues to be the main focus for us. And we were very pleased to see the enthusiasm for this
agent at the recent American College of Cardiology meetings in response to the data we presented there and published
in the New England Journal of Medicine. It's quite remarkable to see so much depth of understanding and appreciation
of the potential benefit/risk profile of a novel mechanism by cardiologists and lipid specialists. We were also pleased to
have filed Repatha in Japan with our partners at Astellas.
The last thing I'd like to mention our cardiovascular portfolio is omecamtiv mecarbil or AMG 423, the novel
mechanism agent we are advancing in systolic heart failure with Cytokinetics. We look forward to seeing the data in
the second half of this year from our Phase II Chronic Oral study which has now completed enrollment.
Turning to oncology. We were pleased to receive priority review from FDA on our Kyprolis sNDA for relapsed
multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data. And we look forward to continued interactions with regulators to bring
Kyprolis to patients in need. Also in the relapsed setting, we were quite encouraged by the ENDEAVOR data,
demonstrating a doubling in progression-free survival in patients randomized to Kyprolis as compared to Velcade. We
look forward providing the details of these results at ASCO in the multiple myeloma oral session on Tuesday morning.
We are also initiating a Phase III study of a weekly dosing regimen for Kyprolis which we feel will be quite important
for patients and caregivers. I'd also note that during the first quarter, Vectibix was approved in the EU for first line
metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with FOLFIRI and was also granted full approval in the EU.
Turning to T-Vec, we completed the Phase Ib portion of the T-Vec combination study we're performing in metastatic
melanoma in collaboration with Merck and their PD-1 antibody Keytruda, and we expect to advance next into the
Phase III portion of this exciting study. We're in the final planning stages of a similar Phase Ib/III study in head and
neck cancer with Merck and Keytruda as well. Clearly, the vast majority of the potential value of T-Vec lies in priming
the immune system in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and other mechanisms that modulate the immune
system's discrimination between cells and non-cells. We continue to explore such opportunities both within our own
pipeline as well as in collaboration with others.
In the meantime, despite the very rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape since the design of the T-Vec monotherapy
study in melanoma, including the approval of multiple agents with proven overall survival. We continue to believe that
it is important to make T-Vec monotherapy available to the patient segments in which meaningful rates of durable
response were observed in Phase III. We therefore look forward to our discussions on this topic at the FDA Advisory
Committee meeting scheduled for April 29.

Finally, we have decided to stop administration of blinded investigational product in the Phase III study of trebananib
in first line ovarian cancer based on a recommendation by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee who deemed the
study unlikely to achieve its primary PFS endpoint.
In the inflammation space, our Phase III psoriasis data from brodalumab, our IL-17 receptor antagonist, was very well
received at the recent American Academy of Dermatology Meeting, as we discussed in detail at our investor relation
event. For those of you who were not able to participate, in addition to the very compelling efficacy data including
superiority over Stelara ustekinumab, along with an overall balanced safety profile, we did note that we've seen suicidal
ideation and behavior in our brodalumab program in these patients known to be at risk for these events. However, we
believe the evidence to-date does not suggest the causal relationship between IL-17 inhibition and suicidal ideation and
behavior.
Data have been provided to regulatory authorities and we will be discussing it with them on an ongoing basis. This
topic will be an important and appropriate focus of regulators in their analysis of the risk/benefit profile during their
review of the applications we plan to file for brodalumab. Along with our partners at AstraZeneca, we do anticipate
submitting this agent globally mid-year. We also recently decided to stop a Phase II asthma study with brodalumab
based on futility at a planned interim analysis.
In other areas, our Phase III head to head study of AMG 416 versus Sensipar in hemodialysis patients with secondary
hyperparathyroidism was positive and we anticipate initiating global regulatory submissions in the second half of this
year. Our biosimilars programs also continue to advance with positive Phase III data for our Humira biosimilar in
rheumatoid arthritis.
We view our migraine prophylaxis program with our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody AMG 334 as a top priority.
And we will strive to be both first and best in class in this field. We expect to present data from our Phase IIb episodic
migraine study at the International Headache Society Congress next month and to initiate Phase III later this year.
Finally, I'd like to thank the R&D team at Amgen for their continued focus on innovation and execution of our key
programs. In particular, recently, it was very nice to see the level of acknowledgment paid to the remarkable
breakthroughs in human genetics by deCODE in Iceland, celebrated in both the scientific and lay press. There will
certainly be much more to come in this very exciting era of biology.
Bob?
[06QJS4-E Bob Bradway]
Okay. Thanks, Sean.
Before we move to Q&A, let me just repeat that we're focused on executing against the strategy for long-term growth
that we laid out during our business review meeting last October. We're successfully executing on our new product
launches while continuing to grow key products, such as Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Sensipar and Nplate. Of
course, we continue to advance our robust pipeline, as you've just heard from Sean. And our transformation efforts are
delivering efficiencies in cost savings which we're capturing across the company. This quarter's results prove to us that
we're delivering progress against our long-term objectives.
And with that, we'd like to take your questions. Brian, do you want to remind our callers of the procedures for the
Q&A?

<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: [ph] I'll probably (30:27) be brief. There have been some questions about a partnership
to support the launch of Repatha. And it seems as though it's fairly laid out but is that something that you can now help
us rule out definitively given that you have a pretty short interval into the launch? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Geoff, we're excited about launching Repatha, and we're well along, as you say, in our
plans for launching the molecule and we own the rights to this product globally and we look forward to
commercializing it globally. Of course, we're sharing – we have a partnership in Japan with Astellas but otherwise the

Operator
Yes. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Thanks. You hit on the Neulasta On-body device briefly but maybe can give us some color as
to the launch, how fast you think you can convert and whether or not there's anything else that we should be thinking
about as to why that would be different than the NEUPOGEN competition that you saw there? Now, we can get
comfortable with potential competition in Neulasta. Thanks.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Mike, it's Tony. So let me do some response. Obviously, it's pretty early in the launch
period itself. But we've seen fairly good uptake across, as I said, the 800 institutions. The early debate was around
reimbursement and access. We're locking that down and the product starts to move quite fast. We are exceeding our
own internal expectations at this particular stage and we continue to see very good feedback from patients who really
sees this as a distinctive and definitive advantage. Nurses are also very keen to utilize the product and to help patients
as they go home. And last but not least, more and more institutions are stepping in to buy products. So we continue to
see an ongoing conversion of the business to the On-body Injector.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Robert W. Baird.
<Q - Chris J. Raymond>: Question on Repatha. So I know you probably don't want to go too much into the patent
infringement case against Sanofi and Regeneron, so just noticing that the proposed Scheduling Order is out there and
some of the key events, the Markman hearing, for example, and the jury trial slated for after launch of both of these
drugs. And I know you've talked about in the past, in fact, you have a press release, I think, from last year, highlighting
a potential PI – preliminary injunction. Is that still on the table or how should we think about that given the Scheduling
Order here that's out there? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Thanks for your question, Chris. Yeah, we're focused on having this matter reviewed on
the merits. And as you point out, we're fortunate that looks like we're going to be able to do that early in the new year.
So we'll look forward to again this being reviewed in its entirety. And as you know, and as we've said before, we feel
we have a very strong intellectual property patent estate on this product and we've demonstrated in the past our
determination to assert our IP rights and defend them. And that's what we look forward to doing for this product early
next year.

<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First, congrats on all the progress in the last
six, 12 months on margins and on Kyprolis. So congrats on that. My question is actually on margins in the quarter.
David, you talked about how you printed a 50% operating margin which is dangerously close to the lower end of the
2018 margin guidance you gave. It sounds like you expect that margin to deteriorate throughout this year.
I was wondering if you can talk through some of those dynamics as the year goes on. I think your guidance implies a
full year operating margin of maybe 44%, 45%. Maybe talk about why your guidance implies deterioration throughout
the year. And I recognize this is a deterioration from a surprisingly great number this quarter. Thanks.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yes. So first of all in Q1, as we said we're really encouraged by the performance in the
business which was obviously a combination of solid top line growth as well as the fact that we had very good expense
management in the quarter. If you frame that as to how that evolves through the year then what I would say is a couple
things. One is we'd indicated previously that we expect this year our transformation to deliver about $400 million of
incremental savings. And certainly we saw a proportionate share of that already land here in Q1. And those savings will
continue pretty steadily through the year.
The second dynamic on cost then is around the cost trends in particular. If I look at SG&A in the sales and marketing
area, as well as R&D, we do expect to see rising costs which is a combination of the fact that we inevitably – normally
for the business, the first quarter is the low point for expenses overall for the year. But I think importantly for us right
now, we do have these launches that are coming up. We do expect to underwrite those launches significantly with this
transformation savings. And we do expect the trend of spending to increase through the year. So I think you've
basically framed it correctly as to how we're thinking about this evolving in the year.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: And Mark, not to miss the opportunity to talk about the long-term, as I said and as David
said in his remarks, we feel we're clearly making progress towards our long-term objectives including that margin
objective.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Brian, let's take the next question.
Operator
Yes. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one on ivabradine. You guys have
highlighted potentially a million patients that you think could potentially be candidates for ivabradine therapy. That's a
pretty big market number when you look at how you price that at about $4,500 on annual basis and well below sort of
where forecasts are. Can you maybe help us think about either why consensus is too low on ivabradine or why not all
of that patient population you highlight is actually accessible? Thanks.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So we did the initial analysis based around looking at the number of patients with cardiac
heart failure and then specifically looking at the subset with heart rates of 70 and above. And that started to help us
hone down the size of the particular market. The pricing is a pricing that's made based on the value proposition we
think that we're bringing to market. Obviously we come to market for the first time as a cardiology company and we
intend to try and get to as many of those million patients as possible.

And our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just given the recent outcome of the BPCIA case
about I guess the ruling, the first ruling was that you do not have to go through this patent dance and your confidence in
2017 launch of biosimilar Humira, can you help me understand like what gives you confidence that the timelines, if
you were to go through this patent dance, won't go longer, because many consultants say that the BPCIA discussion

could go for many years beyond like a two-year period or a one-year period. So help me understand given your
knowledge of that process why it won't take an extremely long time? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Well, Robyn, based on our understanding of legislation based on the progress that we're
making in developing adalimumab, we still expect that we will be in position to launch that in 2017. And of course
with respect to the Sandoz matter, we're expecting that, that will be heard in the appeal courts later in the year.
Tony, do you want to add anything?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: We're basically debating a concept of 180 days' notice. So that's the debate at the moment.
Once we get to a point in time that we've agreed to with Sandoz, they have the right to come to market at risk.

And our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company.
<Q - Eric Thomas Schmidt>: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a follow-up to Mike Yee's question on On-body
Injector for Neulasta. Tony, I have no idea how to put the 800 accounts into context. Could you tell us sort of how
many accounts you have in general for Neulasta overall? And is there a target conversion rate that you're hoping to get,
say, over the next 12 months? What would you define as a successful conversion, if you could share that with us?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So the 800 accounts are about 25% of our large customers. And we clearly have a target
that we're aiming for. I'm not going to be disclosing it at the moment. But we're driving hard to get as much of our
business onto the On-body Injector as possible.
<Q - Eric Thomas Schmidt>: Thank you.

Operator
Yes. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, we're following the approval of ivabradine
and the upcoming approval of [ph] e-mab (40:53). Just wondering if you guys can talk about longer-term thoughts on
your cardiovascular franchise because you will be putting your newer sales reps behind these two products but is there
an appetite to continue to add there? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: So Terence, it was a little bit hard to hear your questions but I think you were asking about
Corlanor and Repatha. We're excited, as we've said, to get launched in the cardiovascular field with Corlanor, and we
think again an innovative medicine that will require some work to educate the cardiologists about the appropriate use of
this medicine with heart failure patients. But we're excited about that. And we're excited also about the innovative
biology behind Repatha and the opportunity for that medicine to make a big difference for patients who are at risk of
heart attack and stroke. So our focus is on those two medicines right now.
To the extent that we have other opportunities to advance innovative biology with big effects in cardiovascular disease,
we'll look carefully at those. And as you know we have one such medicine that's in late stage of development now
which is our omecamtiv mecarbil program that Sean referred to earlier in his remarks. So those constitute three pretty
exciting innovative opportunities for us right now. And if we find opportunities to build on those, we'll look at them
carefully.

And our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Great. Thanks very much for taking the questions and congrats on a very nice quarter here.
Sean, I wanted to ask on the ENDEAVOR trial, Kyprolis that you reported this quarter. So should we assume that the
benefit that you saw with Kyprolis over Velcade was observed in both the Velcade-experienced and the Velcade-naïve
patients? Because I think [indiscernible] (42:41) allowed both.
And then can you also elaborate on the differences that you observed in cardiovascular safety between the agents? And
then just putting it together, based on the expert feedback, how do you think these results will impact the standard of
care in myeloma here? Thanks.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Okay. A few questions in there. I'd say that yes, we did see a pretty consistent treatment effect
of Kyprolis independent of the baseline characteristics of these patients whether they had experienced transplant before,
whether they had been treated previously with Velcade. The [ph] CD (43:22) safety data I don't have anything
additional to say than the information we put in the press release until we would be presenting at ASCO. And I do think
that the stand or my view on it is that while there's always lots of exciting innovation going on in oncology these days,
backbone therapies in this particular disease are going to include a proteasome inhibitor for a good long time. And it's
becoming pretty clear that the best agent is Kyprolis.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Citigroup.
<Q - Joel L. Beatty>: Hi. This is Joel Beatty in for Yaron. For Repatha, what do you expect the label to look like? Do
you expect statin intolerance to be a specific indication on the label or something broader than that?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Of course it's very hard to predict what regulators will decide to do there. I think it is possible
to write an indication which speaks to patients who are not adequately treated with respect to their LDL cholesterol
response with statins or intolerant to statins. If you look at a lot of the recent labeling indications that have been used by
the agency, they have this sort of a structure and that's kind of in my mind the base case, what you'd expect to hope to
get in the various jurisdictions that we're going to be negotiating the labels. But it's really hard to predict exactly where
the language will land.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Howard Liang from Leerink.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thanks very much and congrats. Regarding the FDA panel for T-Vec next week, in recent
cases, FDA has approved drugs for a narrow indication when the package is less than perfect. I don't know if this
applies to this case but can you talk about whether there's any population where the risk/benefit is especially
compelling for T-Vec? Also, will you show some of the new checkpoint inhibitor combination data at the FDA panel?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay. So the first question which implies that the package is less than perfect I think is
probably true. And that's true of almost everything we do. And I think that in this case, it's clear that the population that
we're studying in the Phase III trial included a fairly broad range of patients with local, regional, and metastatic
melanoma disease. And I think if you've seen the data that we've presented in various scientific forums, the durable
response rates and the subgroup analyses looking at survival for that matter have the biggest impact in the earlier stages
of the disease.
So it is possible that, that's where the conversation will go in the Advisory Committee and with the FDA. But at this
point, we do have a positive trial for the whole population of the study. And so that's the logical place to start the
conversation. And then with respect to the checkpoint inhibitor, all we would be doing at the Advisory Committee
meeting would be to have a slide that will indicate of course the various studies that are ongoing with the product that

scientific forum.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. First of all, I have a question on your
biosimilar Humira program here. Now that you've finished both Phase III trials already what's the timeline for
submission in your plans?
And then secondly, do you plan to seek a broad label including [ph] all the (48:02) indications that you did not try in
the Phase III? And then quickly for David, R&D costs is coming down much faster than SG&A this quarter compared
to a year ago. Should we expect that to continue and is that driven by research or development? Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: So why don't we break that into two parts. Sean will talk about the Humira question first.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yes. So we do intend to submit Humira later this year, the biosimilar later this year. And in
fact, we would be seeking the sort of broader label set of indications through the extrapolation mechanism that is
consistent with the current [ph] guidances (48:48).
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay. David?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yes. So in terms of the cost savings, what I would first say is that if you look at the savings
we expect this year as well as through the whole program, as we've said before, those are savings that are being accrued
across all of the areas of costs. So it's not concentrated in one versus the other. Secondly, if you look at the particular
pattern of savings in the first quarter, what you can observe, as I mentioned is that – and as we've talked before – we
are investing, freeing up flexibility to invest in our launch portfolio. So you can expect that a substantial share of what
we save in SG&A will be reinvested towards the launches.
And then I think the third thing I'd comment as to R&D, that was a combination in the quarter of – R&D tends to be
rather lumpy in terms of the spend. So you saw a combination of savings that we're getting from our transformation in
the quarter as well as some of the inevitable lumpiness that occurs from quarter to quarter in that area. So I think
bottom line is that we expect going forward through the year to see rising costs which you typically see in the pattern
through the year but see it a little more accentuated as a combination of rising costs with launch activities as well as in
the case of R&D we still are continuing to invest in clinical trials and will see some increases there.
And then as to the – if I may, one final comment, R versus D. Basically as we've talked before, we've done work to
look at all of the processes across all of our business activities. And so we're seeing efficiencies in both of those areas
broadly.

Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang from Jefferies.
<Q - Eun K. Yang>: Thank you. Question on romosozumab. In the structural trial comparing to Forteo is the change
in BMD [indiscernible] (51:08) sufficient enough to differentiate it from Forteo? Or are you following the patient
longer to see a difference in non-vertebral fracture risk reduction?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yes. So the studies that are being done with romosozumab versus Forteo are all designed to
look at BMD. And as you've seen probably the data that I presented at the business review shows that in fact those
differences are quite substantial. But of course, we're also looking at the quality of bone. And in particular the cortical
bone thickness which we're looking at using fairly advanced imaging technologies. There is no plan for us to do

Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays.
<Q>: Hi, guys. This is [ph] Carter (52:18) on for Geoff. Tony, can you provide NEUPOGEN's share of the short-acting
G-CSF market for the quarter? And I guess more broadly, what are your expectations regarding potential timing of a
potential biosimilar in Neulasta? I know some biosimilar companies have disclosed plans to file for approval later this
year, potentially just on a PK/PD study without a Phase III study. Your thoughts there would be appreciated. Thank
you.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Okay. So just to remind you in fourth quarter 2014, NEUPOGEN's market share was 80%.
First quarter 2015, NEUPOGEN's market share was 80%. As regards Neulasta, they could enter the market towards the
end of 2015 when our patent expires.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Okay, Brian, why don't we go ahead and take one last question as we are getting to the top of
the hour.
Operator
Yes. And our last question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. so I wanted to follow-up on Matt's
question regarding Kyprolis. With the impressive results now in hand for ENDEAVOR as well as ASPIRE for that
matter, how do you think about the implications for the front line CLARION study? And perhaps more importantly,
what does your market research suggest about the relative use of proteasome inhibitors in the front line multiple
myeloma setting relative to later stages of treatment? Thanks.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Why don't I start? Tony can follow up. I think with respect to the CLARION study, which of
course was a head-to-head study against Velcade in the first-line setting, we feel that, that study has been significantly
derisked by seeing the ASPIRE data and the ENDEAVOR data. Now to the extent to which you can read through
results from ENDEAVOR to CLARION is something people sit around and debate. But certainly, we feel good about
the likelihood that we'll see a favorable result from the trial. Tony, do you want to respond, too?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Certainly we've done a fair amount of work. It all comes down again to what potential
outcome of the CLARION trial will be. But as Sean just said, if we continue the trend from ASPIRE to ENDEAVOR,
we assume we will have a positive result versus the competition in the marketplace. The objective in multiple myeloma
is to drive progression-free survival for as long as possible before you have to go on to your second and third line. And
therefore we assume that we'll be seeing usage in the first line too once we got the indication.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: All right. Cory, thanks for your question. As you pointed out, things are going very well
for Kyprolis and we're excited about the data that we have in hand as well as the data that we may generate.
Robert A. Bradway
Well, thanks for joining our call. Arvind and his team will be around if there are questions that you didn't get a chance
to ask on the call. And we look forward to connecting with you on the next quarterly call. Thanks.
