Howard S. Schultz
Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today's call. Starbucks' third quarter of fiscal 2015 stands as among
the most remarkable quarters in our over 23 years as a public company. Our global comp store sales grew 7%, driven
by a stunning 4% increase in global traffic. Let me put that 4% traffic increase figure into perspective. A 4% increase in
global traffic on a business of our scale translates into having served over 23 million more customer occasions in Q3 of
2015 than in Q3 of 2014 or an average of approximately 25 more customer occasions every day from every single store
in our nearly 10,000 store global comp base.
Our fast-growing Americas segment posted 8% comp growth, also driven by 4% increase in traffic and a 12% increase
in revenues. EMEA delivered 3% comp growth with over 2% from increased traffic and a 23% increase in operating
income. As we announced last week, our EMEA segment is preparing to open its first store in Johannesburg, South
Africa during the first half of calendar 2016 in partnership with established food retail operator, Taste Holdings
Limited. We believe that South Africa could ultimately support 150 or more Starbucks stores over time.
Starbucks' fast-growing China/Asia Pacific segment, now with over 5,200 stores, delivered company-leading comp
growth of 11% in Q3, virtually all of which coming from increased traffic. Our now fully-owned and controlled Japan
market, our first international market outside of North America and a market in which we now operate over 1,000
stores, delivered among its strongest quarterly comp sales increases in years.
And I'm very pleased to report that we now have exceeded 1,700 stores across 90 cities in Mainland China. CAP
remains a focal point of our future growth plans and we're on track to meet our goal of doubling our CAP store count to
roughly 10,000 locations, tripling our revenue to over $3 billion and tripling our operating income to over $1 billion
over the next five years.
Strong global comp sales growth, combined with record performance from our new store class, drove an 18% increase
in total company revenues to a Q3 record of $4.9 billion. And a 24% increase in non-GAAP EPS to a Q3 record of
$0.42 per share. Noteworthy is that our Q3 results were achieved despite continued meaningful investment in food and
beverage innovation, our mobile and digital platforms, and our partner experience investments, all of which – these
investments will continue in Q4 and despite formidable foreign exchange headwinds and difficult retail and consumer
environments in many of the global markets in which we operate.
Starbucks' Q3 of fiscal 2015 was a fantastic quarter across the board, clearly evidencing a continuation of the strong
momentum we have seen across our business and around the world this fiscal year, and solid in-store execution by our
people who now deliver the Starbucks Experience through nearly 80 million customer transactions from over 22,500
stores in 66 countries around the world every week.
In a moment, I will highlight a few of the innovations and strategic initiatives and digital partnerships that were
announced or took shape in the quarter that will enable us to further extend Starbucks Global Coffee Authority and
leadership around all things coffee and tea, retail, mobile, and digital, and position us to continue to grow, lead, and win
around the world and into the future. Then I'll turn the call over to Kevin who will take you through coffee and
beverage innovation in total company, and individual segment operating performance in the quarter. Finally, Scott will
take you through our Q3 financial and operating results in detail, and we'll close the call out with Q&A.
Two years ago, I reported on the seismic shift in consumer behavior that would significantly impact traditional bricks
and mortar retailers. I was not clairvoyant, the coming change was apparent. Since then, many traditional retailers and
consumer brands have responded simply by substantially increasing their digital advertising budgets, significantly
driving up their cost of customer acquisition and producing little to show for it. We, on the other hand, took a very

different approach.
By further enhancing our already world-class digital technologies through the introduction of capabilities like Mobile
Order & Pay and soon-to-be delivery, and expanding our loyalty program, we are driving traffic as reflected in the 4%
growth in traffic in Q3, bringing in new customers and deepening our connection to our existing customers, elevating
the Starbucks brand and our customer experience, and streamlining our in-store operations. At the same time today, you
will hear about unique digital partnerships that we are forging with like-minded businesses in a number of verticals that
will further leverage the Starbucks brand and our digital assets in order to further reduce our already-low cost of
customer acquisition and drive additional incremental traffic.
Starbucks' superior customer experience depends in part on delivering world-class service and convenience, and we are
pleased to report great progress on several game-changing initiatives that are only in their infancy. We first introduced
Mobile Order & Pay into 150 of our company-operated stores in the Portland area last December and then quickly
expanded it to the full 650-store Pacific Northwest region in March. Given the powerful, positive impact Mobile Order
& Pay had on our business in Portland and Seattle, we accelerated the rollout of this offering and now offer this
innovative mobile capability in over 4,000 of our U.S. company-operated stores. And we are now on track to offer
Mobile Order & Pay capability across the entire U.S. company-operated store portfolio, in time for the upcoming
important holiday season.
Mobile Order & Pay is enabling us to serve more customers more quickly and efficiently and to significantly reduce
attrition off the line. We've already seen positive impact on operating results, but keep in mind that the rollout to 4,000
stores occurred only in the last couple of weeks of the third quarter. So the real impact for Mobile Order & Pay and
increased convenience remains in the quarters and years to come. That said, Mobile Order & Pay is fueling both
revenue and profit growth in every market in which it has been deployed, with customer adoption starting faster and
accelerating with each new phase we roll out.
By enabling our customers to order ahead and avoid waiting in line, Mobile Order & Pay is enabling us to capture more
on-the-go customer occasions, and the data is clear. In those stores where Mobile Order & Pay has been deployed, lines
are shorter, service is faster, and in-store operations are more efficient. The net result is increased traffic, incrementally,
that is exceeding expectations, improved throughput, and an elevated Starbucks experience for our customers. We will
add the Mobile Order & Pay feature to our Android app in the U.S. as well as introduce Mobile Order & Pay
technology into our international markets in the months ahead. Importantly, key features like suggested menu
recommendations that will drive increased ticket have not yet been deployed, as we are still in the beta mode.
In another important initiative designed to improve Starbucks' superior convenience, we have opened our first express
store in New York City. And while it's still very, very early, in terms of how many days it's been open, initial results are
nothing short of extraordinary. In approximately 500 square feet of space, we are now handling volumes we would
normally expect from a store three times its size, and nearby stores less than a few hundred feet away have not seen any
adverse impact or cannibalization.
This helps validate the assertion that we made at our Investor Conference last December that in many places in the
U.S., we have far more demand than our current stores can serve, indicating opportunity to significantly grow our
domestic store footprint in the years to come. And the express store is only one of several innovative new formats that
we are pursuing to take advantage of the different kinds of real estate opportunities we need to address in order to tap
into the demand that exists for more Starbucks occasions. The initial success of Mobile Order & Pay and the express
store are testament to the growth potential that remains for us in the U.S. where our ability to serve demand rather than
the need to create demand will be key to our achieving our growth.
In addition to more express stores, another will open in New York City later this summer. The next big initiative to
satisfy customer demand and provide added convenience is delivery. We remain convinced of the huge demand for
Starbucks delivery to your home or office and are on plan to pilot delivery in Seattle and in the Empire State Building
in New York City before the holiday. We have no doubt that delivery like Mobile Order & Pay will drive further
incrementally and increase profitability and enhance the equity of the Starbucks brand.

Just as digital technologies are enabling us to add convenience with features such as Mobile Order & Pay and delivery,
digital technologies are enabling significant expansion of our My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program. MSR continues
to be among our most important business drivers as new members contribute not only short-term increases in revenue
and profit but also to long-term loyalty for years to come. We now have 10.4 million active MSR members, up 28%
from Q3 of 2014, with 6.2 million being Gold members, up 32% from Q3 last year. The significant increase in Gold
level membership means that an increased number of our MSR customers are transacting in our stores more frequently
than before with MSR members now accounting for approximately 30% of total tender in North America.
And our mobile commerce platform is literally stronger than ever. We have reached the milestone where mobile
payments now represent 20% of all in-store transactions in our U.S. stores; more than double the figure from only two
years ago. And we are now processing nearly nine million mobile transactions each week.
Now, our plan all along has been to bring both our MSR membership and our digital capabilities to scale and we are
now there. And to then leverage the Starbucks brand, our deep engagement with customers, our global store footprint,
and our world-leading mobile digital card and loyalty assets to create the foundation of a much broader external mobile
digital and loyalty platform, one that would extend to purchases and experiences outside of the four walls of the
Starbucks store.
This new digital external platform will enable businesses whose customer demographics are similar to our own and
with whom we choose to partner, to purchase Stars from Starbucks, and then to distribute the Stars in order for them to
acquire, retain, and reward their own customers with the gift of Starbucks. And what's really wonderful about this
opportunity is that gift can only be redeemed at a Starbucks store.
Let me explain the enormity of this emerging digital and loyalty opportunity to you through the lens of the first three
expanded loyalty partnerships that we've recently announced. The first partnership we announced was with Spotify.
Under the arrangement, Spotify will purchase Starbucks Stars from us and then distribute these Stars to drive premium
subscriber acquisition. It will allow Spotify to differentiate themselves from competitive music streaming services and
reward customer loyalty. In addition, as an added benefit to our own employee partners, all Starbucks partners are
being given a Spotify premium account, free of charge.
The second partnership we announced was with The New York Times. Under the Times arrangement, as with Spotify,
the Times will purchase Starbucks Stars from us and distribute Stars to drive customer acquisition and to reward
customer loyalty. As an added benefit, Starbucks customers will be provided with free, unique, curated New York
Times content to the Starbucks digital network within our stores.
Our third digital and loyalty platform partner is Lyft, one of America's leading mobile transportation network
companies. As part of our partnership, Lyft will purchase Stars from us and distribute the Stars to increase customer
acquisition and loyalty, reward their drivers and distinguish Lyft from competitive services. There are a number of
innovative elements to this partnership but a few that highlight the like-minded nature of our companies include that we
will be making all Lyft drivers Gold members of our MSR program and that Lyft will be offering their riders the ability
to thank their drivers with Starbucks eGifts.
In addition, later this year, we'll be testing the possibility of introducing a convenient and cost-effective transportation
benefit to Starbucks employee partners in conjunction with Lyft in order to gauge partner interest and to determine the
long-term viability of this benefit.
What each of these partnerships afford is the opportunity for consumers to earn Starbucks Stars outside of Starbucks
stores and then to redeem them for their favorite food and beverages within Starbucks stores, providing a unique
opportunity for incrementality, increased profitability, and the opportunity for us to serve, connect with, and become
part of the daily ritual of an even more larger-base number of consumers, and adding further momentum to Starbucks
unique increasingly global flywheel. And since each and every Star has significant perceived value to our MSR
customers, these digital platform partners will be conferring a meaningful benefit upon their new and existing
customers and even their drivers in the case of Lyft.

We strongly believe that no other bricks and mortar retailer has the brand strength, digital and physical assets or
connection to consumers to create, build, and execute a program anything like this. We have identified prospective
partners in multiple attractive business verticals and you may expect to hear about many more carefully curated,
customized digital partnerships in the quarters ahead as we roll out this proprietary Starbucks Star-centric digital and
loyalty ecosystem.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?
Kevin R. Johnson
Thanks, Howard. Good afternoon, everyone. Before handing off to Scott to take you through the financials, I thought
I'd build on Howard's comments about the quarter and share some personal observations. As Howard made clear, Q3
was an exceptional quarter as measured by any standard or metric. Ongoing beverage innovation and global leadership
around all things coffee and tea remain at Starbucks core. In Q3, we continue to invest and elevate the premium, highly
differentiated, locally relevant coffee and tea, beverage, food, and in-store experience we deliver to our customers
around the world.
We grew global revenues by 18% over prior year to a new quarterly revenue record of $4.9 billion with a 7% increase
in global comparable store sales, representing our 22nd consecutive quarter of comp sales growth of 5% or greater and
on the heels of global comp sales increases of 6% in Q3 2014 and 8% in Q3 2013. These are truly extraordinary top
line results given the size, breadth, and complexity of our increasingly global operation. 4% of our comp growth came
from increased traffic, a testament to the increasing strength of our business and the global relevancy of the Starbucks
brand.
In addition to driving strong revenue growth, we also expanded operating margins 70 basis points to a Q3 record of
19.2%. We grew operating income by 22%. This reflects the Q3 record, $939 million of operating income and a
non-GAAP EPS of $0.42 per share.
I think there are three core drivers of this momentum. Number one, we're delivering innovation that is relevant to both
our customers and our employee partners. Two, we're driving operational execution on a global basis. And three, we're
leveraging the scale, reach, and breadth of our capabilities.
Our fast-growing Americas segment is firing on all cylinders, opening 658 net new stores over the past 12 months, and
posting an 8% comp growth in Q3 with a 4% increase in traffic. This results in a 12% revenue growth and 17%
operating income growth.
Ongoing beverage innovation that resonated with our customers and increased food attach across all regions and day
parts contributed meaningfully to the Americas segment's outstanding performance. Q3 was the 22nd consecutive
quarter that the Americas delivered comp growth of 5% or greater. More importantly, transaction growth in the quarter
of 4%, the best in six quarters, was an extraordinary accomplishment and reflects the success of our efforts to drive
traffic and incrementality through ongoing beverage and food innovation and increased store throughput.
Core beverage offerings contributed half of the U.S. comp growth in Q3 with blended and espresso platforms driving
over two-thirds of that growth. Beverage innovations such as Flat White, Frappuccino Minis and Cold Brew combined
to contribute approximately 1 point of comp growth and continue to perform ahead of initial expectations. S'mores
Frappuccino, a new limited-time offering, became the highest-selling LTO Frappuccino ever. Noteworthy, is the
Teavana branded Shaken Iced Teas continue to resonate with our customers, helping drive a 10% increase in key
beverages in our U.S. stores and again contributing 1 point of comp growth.
We continue to make progress, creating new occasions and growing our lunch and afternoon day parts. Food sales
contributed over 2 points to U.S. comp growth this quarter, once again, representing double-digit revenue growth over
the prior year. Our expanded breakfast sandwich platform delivered 30% net revenue growth with half of that growth
coming from increased attach. Our lunch platform continues to grow, delivering greater than 20% growth in Q3 with
the noteworthy success of warm sandwiches, Bistro Boxes and wraps, reflecting the fact that Starbucks is increasingly

being recognized by our customers as an attractive option for lunch.
In addition to growing new day parts, we've also made significant progress growing transactions that are peak day part
through a combination of great in-store execution and positive early results around innovative new store formats. We're
especially pleased with the progress we're making in growing transactions at peak even before Mobile Order & Pay is
fully rolled out across the U.S. company-operated store portfolio in time for the upcoming holiday season.
Our new class of stores are performing extremely well, generating record first-year sales and unit economics.
Noteworthy is that our new stores are delivering record performance without cannibalizing sales from established
stores in the local training area. The data suggests that we are creating deeper engagement with our existing customers
and we're attracting new customers to Starbucks.
U.S. licensed stores are seeing similar patterns and delivered strong results with revenue increasing 27%
year-over-year. Looking ahead to Q4, we're confident that our rich pipeline of innovation will deliver a strong finish to
the year, starting with Cold Brew and Teavana Mango Black Tea Lemonade, both launched just in time for the summer
heat and are exceeding initial expectations.
A carefully curated selection of innovative, delicious new snacks to enhance our afternoon day part offerings. Customer
feedback and research has shown us that snacks represent 50% of all American eating occasions each day. With busy
lifestyles on the rise, the demand for snacks both in the moment or planned is increasing. Our new portfolio of snack
offerings is available in more than 3,400 high traffic Starbucks stores in major metropolitan areas. We continue to
innovate around all things food with positive response from customers.
Let's now take a look at the EMEA segment. EMEA third quarter results continue the segment's steady measured
improvement in profitability despite the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation, the primary driver of the
9% decline and reported revenues over prior year. Excluding approximately $44 million of FX, the impact of the
closing and transfer of certain stores from company-owned to licensed, EMEA revenues actually increased 5% in the
quarter.
Comparable store sales in EMEA grew 3% in Q3 despite the FX headwinds and macroeconomic challenges in several
markets with a 2% increase in traffic, representing its 9th consecutive quarter of positive comp growth with every
EMEA market posting positive comps. EMEA also delivered a 320 basis point increase in operating margin and a very
strong 23% increase in operating income over Q3 last year. Our EMEA licensed markets are performing exceptionally
well, with Turkey and the Middle East in particular continuing to outperform. EMEA's results support our licensed
focused growth strategy for the segment where 66% of our nearly 2,300 stores in Q3 were licensed as compared to only
54% three years ago.
We will continue to accelerate growth in our EMEA licensed store portfolio as demonstrated by two very exciting new
partnerships. In June, we entered into an important partnership with Casino Restauration, one of France's largest and
most respected grocery retailers, to open Starbucks stores within a number of Casino stores. We view partnerships in
the grocery channel in Western Europe as an opportunity for Starbucks. And just last week, we announced plans to
enter South Africa in partnership with Taste Holdings, a leading South African restauranteur. And we'll be opening our
first store in Johannesburg during the first half of 2016. We will look to extend into other markets in Central and
Southern Africa over time.
As aggressively as we are growing our licensed business in EMEA, we are equally committed to improving the
profitability of our company-owned store portfolio in the region and we are making continued progress on that front.
Scott will provide details on that progress in a moment. Our China/Asia Pacific segment delivered and amazing quarter
with company-leading comp growth of 11% and revenue growth of 127%, 20% excluding the $309 million incremental
revenue from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan. Overall, CAP operating income grew by 49%.
We've added 750 net new stores in CAP over the past 12 months. Our new class of company-operated stores in CAP is
even more profitable than the prior class, reflecting the increasing strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand in the
region and improved operating leverage. We remain on track to increase our CAP store count to 5,500 by fiscal year
2015 and roughly double our store count to over 10,000 stores over the next five years.

As Howard mentioned, we've now surpassed 1,700 stores operating in over 90 cities in Mainland China. The passion
and commitment of our partners in China is enabling us to deliver a great customer experience that is driving strong
comp growth throughout the region. Our business in Japan delivered among the strongest quarterly comp sales
increases in Japan in years. We are benefiting from solid execution against our plans to leverage our brand, in
connection with consumers, to drive growth in all channels and across all day parts in the key Japanese market. By way
of reminder, Japan company-operated stores are not yet in our global comp base. We will include these stores in both
the global and CAP comp base beginning in Q1 of fiscal year 2016.
Limited-time offering Frappuccinos in particular are extremely popular in Japan. Our spring and summer promotions
featured locally developed products that are successfully positioned Starbucks as a top-of-mind destination for summer
beverages. The increasing strength of the Starbucks brand in Japan gives us confidence that with full ownership we can
accelerate growth in this market as we head towards our 20th anniversary in Japan in 2016.
At our recent store opening in the Tottori Prefecture, the last prefecture in Japan without a Starbucks store, 1,000
customers queued up for the store opening and more than 50 reporters showed up to cover the event. Starbucks' brand
strength spans the entire CAP region. It is not limited to China and Japan. In fact, Starbucks ranked 15th on the
Nielsen's Annual Regional List of Asia's Top 1,000 Brands for 2015 and has been ranked as the number one restaurant
brand in Asia for the fourth year in a row.
Let's now move on to the Channel Development segment. Channel Development revenues of $404 million in Q3 were
up a solid 8% over the prior year, despite the increased competitive pressure in the at-home coffee categories and the
timing of the Easter holiday which impacted the comparison to Q2 of this year. K-Cup portion pack sales continued to
be a primary driver of the revenue growth for Channel Development and we are very pleased that our total K-Cup
portfolio continues to gain share despite increasing price pressure and new market entrants.
Innovation has been a key driver in establishing our leadership position in the K-Cup category and will continue to
drive our sales growth. Cinnamon Dolce and Mocha performed very well in Q3 as our flavors platform increased its
share of the total category. And Starbucks Iced Coffee K-Cups, launched only three months ago, gained strong
momentum ahead of the peak summer season.
Looking ahead, we are excited for customers to experience our third K-Cup beverage: Hot Cocoa, a new platform we
are launching with Classic and Salted Caramel Hot Cocoa flavor profiles. Ongoing innovation, combined with
increased marketing activities in Q3, give us confidence that we will continue to extend our leadership position on the
K-Cup platform.
Foodservice had a strong Q3 with 14% revenue growth year-over-year. We offer a very broad product portfolio to the
foodservice trade that is becoming increasingly appealing to businesses seeking to differentiate themselves by
providing employees and guests with premium amenities in these establishments.
Beyond the U.S., we're seeing strong growth in China/Asia Pacific ready-to-drink sales, underscoring the size of the
opportunity presented by the strategic partnership we announced with Tingyi where we are on track to launch
ready-to-drink Frappuccino through a large number of outlets in 2016.
As part of our plan to accelerate growth of ready-to-drink products in international markets, I'm pleased to announce
our expansion throughout Latin America ready-to-drink with our long-term business partner, PepsiCo. Starbucks has
been operating in Latin America for 13 years and now has more than 870 stores in 14 markets with plans to add several
hundred more stores in the years ahead. The new agreement with Pepsi will bring the Starbucks ready-to-drink coffee
and energy portfolio to this important region, and will leverage the Starbucks brand and store footprint along with
PepsiCo's marketing and distribution capabilities in order to unlock the growing $4 billion Latin America
ready-to-drink coffee and energy business. Customers will see Starbucks ready-to-drink bottled beverages throughout
the grocery and convenience store channels in 10 Latin America markets in calendar year 2016.
Innovating in ways that amplify our leadership in coffee is a key strategic priority. Starbucks' immersive 15,000 square
foot Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room continues to attract customers and tourists from all over the world

and is exceeding our most optimistic expectations. The Roastery is also enabling us to build a new ultra-premium
coffee brand, Starbucks Reserve. With the additional small-batch coffee roasting capacity provided by the Roastery, we
can now source, roast, blend, and market spectacular, limited availability, micro-lot coffees from around the world
under the Starbucks Reserve brand. This is elevating the super-premium coffee experience we deliver to our customers.
We're able to find many Starbucks Reserve arrivals sell out as soon as we bring them to market.
To facilitate the expansion of the Starbucks Reserve brand, we are leveraging some of the design elements from the
Roastery to create a new store format called Starbucks Reserve that will showcase both our super-premium Starbucks
Reserve coffees from around the world and the newest coffee brewing methods. Starbucks Reserve stores will also
incorporate an integrated Teavana kiosk to increase customer awareness and interest in Teavana super-premium
loose-leaf and packaged teas. We expect to launch new Starbucks Reserve stores in targeted global markets over the
next year, laying the foundation for an exciting, highly differentiated, new global growth opportunity for us.
We're on plan to open our new Starbucks Reserve flagship store sometime later this calendar year and we're already
opening Starbucks Reserve coffee bars within selected existing Starbucks locations across the U.S. as part of normal
Starbucks store renovation cycles. I'm confident that the addition of Starbucks Reserve coffee bars will drive
incrementality in existing Starbucks stores and build customer awareness around our new Starbucks Reserve brand.
After more than six years on the Starbucks board, combined with the past five months deeply engaged with the
management team, I must say it's a privilege to be a part of the Starbucks journey. I want to thank all my Starbucks
partners for the great work they do to create that magical Starbucks experience for our customers each and every day.
I'll now hand the call over to Scott to take you through our Q3 financial results in detail. Scott?
Scott Harlan Maw
Thanks, Kevin. Good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks business has performed exceptionally well in fiscal 2015 and our
third quarter reflected a continuation of prior quarters' trends. Strong global comps, record revenues, record operating
margin, and record operating income once again, demonstrate the impact and the success of our laser focus on our
customers and our customer experience and fantastic execution by our partners across the globe. Our Q3 results are
particularly meaningful in light of the size of our global system today and the increasing complexity of our business.
Our Q3 GAAP EPS came in at $0.41 and non-GAAP EPS at $0.42 per share, 24% over prior year and our strongest
quarter of 2015 thus far, despite a meaningful ramp in the investments we are making in the business. Non-GAAP
operating margin expanded 100 basis points in Q3 to 19.5%. And excluding non-GAAP items, our operating income
increased 24% over last year to $950 million. Sales leveraged from the Americas and CAP segments and an increase in
COGS leverage drove this improvement.
Clearly, the supply chain initiatives we have previously discussed and are implementing are benefiting our operations
in a significant way. In fact, we have seen 120 basis points of gross margin improvement to-date in 2015. In addition,
we remain on track to eliminate $1 billion of supply chain costs over a four-year period. I would like to personally and
publicly thank all of our supply chain partners across the globe for helping us deliver our Q3 results and our future
supply chain savings while, at the same time, supporting the very significant growth in our business.
I'll now take you through individual segment performance in Q3. Our Americas segment grew revenues 12% in Q3,
primarily driven by strong 8% comp growth with transactions and ticket contributing 4% each. Americas operating
income grew 17% over the prior quarter in Q3, reaching $855 million, a record high and a particularly excellent result
considering our U.S. store partner investments continued to ramp during the quarter.
Operating margin expanded 120 basis points over Q3 last year to 25% and, importantly, sales leverage was significant,
more than offsetting the approximately 80 basis point impact from increased partner investments.
Our EMEA segment increased its operating income 23% over Q3 of last year to $36 million, a Q3 record. EMEA's
record results are even more impressive in light of challenging macroeconomic conditions across the region, significant

foreign exchange headwinds, and the fact that only two short years ago, EMEA was essentially operating at a
break-even operating margin. Particularly noteworthy is that EMEA's operating margin expanded 320 basis points to
12.2%, also a Q3 record. Continued progress against our plan to improve operations and evolve our store portfolio from
company-operated to higher margin licensed stores drove double-digit operating margin for the fourth consecutive
quarter. And our licensed store portfolio in EMEA continues to perform exceedingly well with high-single-digit comps
for the seventh quarter in a row.
Our China/Asia-Pacific segment continue to perform extremely well in Q3, delivering company-leading quarterly comp
growth of 11%, a 49% increase in year-over-year operating income to $150 million and becoming our second-most
profitable business segment for the first time in our history.
GAAP operating margin in CAP declined from 35% to 23% as a result of the impact of our acquisition of Starbucks
Japan. As Howard and Kevin mentioned, we have a very long and opportunistic runway of growth ahead in CAP with
stores that continue to deliver among the highest profitability and strongest unit economics of any stores the world.
Excluding the nearly 16 point financial impact from the ownership change in the Starbucks Japan, CAP's operating
margin increased by 370 basis points. Strong revenue growth and margin expansion driven by the performance of
company-operated stores as well as sales and operating leverage all contributed to CAP's excellent results.
Channel Development's operating income increased 3% to $143 million while segment operating margins declined 160
basis points year-over-year to 35.5%, largely a result of increased marketing to support our ongoing production
introductions and commodity coffee costs. Noteworthy is that our portfolio continues to increase its share of the K-Cup
category despite competitive pricing pressure from new and existing market participants. Year-to-date performance in
Channel Development remain strong with 11% revenue growth, margin expansion of 220 basis points, and an 18%
operating income growth.
I want to shift gears a bit and take a moment to discuss our balance sheet and capital deployment activities. Earlier this
month, we took advantage of the continued low-interest rate environment to opportunistically refinance our $550
million 6.250% coupon Senior Notes that were due in 2017 with $850 million of lower coupons 7-year and 30-year
bonds. This transaction enabled us to both reduce our interest expense going forward and to significantly extend the
maturity of our debt. Upon redemption, we incurred a charge of approximately $63 million that will impact our P&L in
Q4 mainly for the premium related to the early redemption of the 2017 notes. This charge is included in our updated
GAAP targets that excluded from our Q4 non-GAAP targets.
As we previously shared, we will target share repurchases at least equal to the diluted impact from our broad-based
stock compensation programs. We've also noted that we will modestly add to debt and may, from time to time, increase
the pace of our buybacks. Given the strength of the quarter and the favorable economics on our most recent debt
offering, we increased our buybacks somewhat in the quarter.
In Q3, we returned a record $874 million of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and, today,
I'm pleased to announce that the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional 50 million shares
under our ongoing share repurchase program. This is on top of the 11 million shares that remained available at the end
of Q3.
Strong results during the first nine months of fiscal 2015 enabled us to deliver both earnings per share above our initial
EPS target growth range and current quarter earnings above our updated range. Our full year GAAP EPS targets are
now $1.77 to $1.78 and we are increasing our full year non-GAAP EPS target range to $1.57 to $1.58. This relates to
GAAP EPS growth of 31% to 32% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 18% to 19% for the full fiscal year. Noteworthy is
that this growth is above our initial non-GAAP EPS growth range of 16% to 18% and that it will be accomplished
despite two points of foreign exchange impact on both our revenue and earnings per share growth rates. For Q4, we
now expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.39 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.42 to $0.43 consistent
with our prior guidance.
A few comments on our Q4 guidance. We're expecting another excellent quarter in Q4, albeit with somewhat lower
earnings growth rate than we delivered in Q3. This is consistent with what I had noted on last quarter's earnings call

and I want to again clearly caution against extrapolating Q3's extraordinary performance onto Q4. Several factors
support the Q4 guidance we have announced. First, we are continuing to ramp our partner and digital investments.
They will reach their peak in Q4 and be up notably from Q3 levels. Our results this quarter demonstrate that these
targeted, carefully considered investments are beginning to bear meaningful fruit and we will not hesitate to accelerate
investment where we see opportunity.
Second, we expect the impact of foreign exchange on our top and bottom line will be at its peak in Q4. And finally, we
are lapping over phenomenal results in Q4 of fiscal 2014 when we reported an operating margin above 20%, our
highest operating margin ever which was 280 basis points over prior year on a non-GAAP basis.
Breaking down Q4 operating margin by business unit, we expect Americas to deliver year-over-year margin
improvement but somewhat lower than the 90 basis point improvement year-to-date. CAP operating margin is expected
to finish the year slightly above 20%, which is significantly higher than our initial guidance. The CAP's Q4 margin will
be roughly flat to Q3's very strong 23%. Channel Development's operating margin in Q4 is expected to be up nicely
from Q3, but down slightly compared to last Q4, reflecting the challenging and competitive retail environment,
additional marketing investments and somewhat higher coffee costs. Finally, EMEA operating margin is expected to
show strong year-over-year expansion with a full year operating margin at or slightly better than the high-end of our
10% to 12% guidance range. For the total company, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be up from Q3 but
down slightly from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of the Japan acquisition offset somewhat by
favorable operating and COGS leverage.
We continue to expect commodities to be roughly neutral in 2015 with coffee somewhat unfavorable and dairy
offsetting this impact. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 16% for the year including 2 points of FX
impact. All other guidance for 2015 remains consistent with what I shared last quarter.
One final reminder before turning the call back to Howard and then on to Q&A. As I mentioned on our earnings call
last quarter, we will be providing our initial growth targets for fiscal 2016 and all future years during our fourth quarter
earnings call. Given the size and the scale of our increasingly complex global business, we have been contemplating
shifting the issuance of this guidance from Q3 to Q4 for some years now in order to have it coincide with the
completion of our annual operating plan.
This shift will allow us to thoroughly vet our AOP prior to the providing targets. Finally, I would point out that we are
now over 80% locked for coffee costs into 2016 at rates slightly lower than 2015. Starbucks' strong year-over-year
financial performance demonstrates our commitment to delivering best-in-class financial and operating results while, at
the same time, investing in our future growth. Building new stores, renovating existing stores, deploying new
technology, investing in our partners, and delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers, we believe
that by getting this balance right we will be able to continue delivering best-in-class growth, profitability, and increased
capital returns to our shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call back to Howard. Howard?
Howard S. Schultz
Scott, thank you so much. Before we head into Q&A, I just wanted to make one comment as it relates to how you
might be looking at comps and traffic going forward. I think I speak for everyone at Starbucks in saying how proud we
are and how gratified we are that we've been able to put up the kinds of numbers that really are unprecedented given
our scale. But I've said in previous quarters and I think it's really worth repeating again that we don't expect internally
to maintain these kinds of very high-level, high-single-digit comp numbers and the kind of traffic numbers that we
provided with you today.
So I would hope that there's common language and common understanding that the guidance we've been giving for
years now is mid-single-digit comps and I would hope that you would hold us to that. And if we're in a position to
surprise on the upside, that's wonderful, but not to count on it, and certainly not to model it. In our quarter – this quarter

demonstrates a unique opportunity for many, many things that have come together. We're certainly going to work very
hard to reproduce that, but I think going forward, mid-single-digit comp numbers and a modest traffic number should
be the kind of number you're putting in your model and I hope that you would respect that as we go forward to Q4 and
fiscal 2016. Thank you very much. JoAnn?

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Keith Siegner with UBS.
<Q - Keith R. Siegner>: Thank you, and congratulations on such a record quarter. As exciting as the Mobile Order &
Pay is and you all know how excited I am, a lot of others will eventually get somewhat close. What I think really is
interesting about this is the ecosystem expansion. Such a long-term competitive advantage. So, Howard, when you
think about this expansion, is there any limit to this? Is this a nice, slow, gradual pace? Is this something that can get
really broad and pervasive? I mean there is no precedent for this, right? How do we think about this ecosystem
expansion with other retailers evolving?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Well, let me try and answer it this way. I think you have to go back to the two years when I
did share with many of you the concern that I had about, what it meant to be a bricks and mortar retailer today in terms
of the challenging issue of mobile commerce and the web. And that has resulted, I think, in lots of activity that is not
producing the kind of positive results across all of retail, especially those that are mall-based. So on one hand,
traditional retailers that are bricks and mortar based are longing for ways in which to accelerate and leverage their core
assets and specifically drive traffic as opposed to waiting to intercept it.
I think we've established not only a very successful application in Mobile Order & Pay, but we've established Stars as a
currency that is highly relevant to our customer base. And when you look at our customer base, how broad it is and the
demography of it, when we start looking at verticals and like-minded companies, it's very easy for us to integrate our
data against the way in which our customers are shopping and spending their free time and spending their money. And
as a result of that, we've identified a number of companies in unique verticals that, we think, sequentially can be part of
this external ecosystem. However, like anything else, I think that we have to walk before we run, and I think we have a
core responsibility to demonstrate to the initial partners that, in fact, the proposition that we've created is going to drive
incrementality for them.
I can tell you that the phone has rung with many, many inquiries from both regional and national retailers in all types of
business who are very much interested and intrigued to be part of what it is we are building. Now there is a company,
and you probably have seen it, and that's what is – what Plenti is doing and they – and what they're doing is assembling
an amalgamation of companies as part of that ecosystem, and you see many companies jumping into that.
What's different about what we're doing and why I think it's going to be better and more proprietary is that we're
offering a single currency and that currency has to come back to Starbucks. And we know at the value of a Starbucks
store and the equity of our brand is very, very relevant to this kind of proposition.
So the short answer to your question is, I think this is a very big idea, but it's an idea that I think we have to prove
internally and prove to these new partners. And you are going to see, sequentially, more partners in the quarters to
come. And I think it'll be more than a domestic opportunity over time, as we introduce Mobile Order & Pay, and the
features and benefits in international markets. But this strategy goes back two years to three years when we started
talking about leveraging this internal system once we got to scale and creating this external flywheel. And I think we're

in a very unique position that will create incrementality in a very low-cost of customer acquisition.
So – and I think what we're trying to do here is recognize that we can't embrace the status quo. We have to keep
pushing for innovation inside and outside of our stores. And we have to be as relevant for our customers on their phone,
as we are inside the Starbucks Experience, and I think this is exactly what we're doing. I think the first three
partnerships represent a level of diversity, in terms of New York Times, Spotify, and Lyft, and you're going to see a lot
more in the days ahead.
Operator
The next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - John Glass>: Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about the Mobile Order & Pay rollout. My ultimate question is,
if you're willing, at this point, to talk more specifically about the kind of lifts you're experiencing in the older markets,
that – when it's rolled out? And if you're not willing to talk about that more specifically, can you talk about, to what
extent, these are new – when people are joining in, is it new members to My Starbucks Rewards? Are they existing
members? How deep is the penetration usage in your existing user base of My Starbucks Rewards? Any kind of
qualitative comments around that would be helpful?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Go ahead, Adam.
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: Okay. Thanks, John. This is Adam. So first of all, specifically to answer your question,
we're seeing both our existing user base use Mobile Order & Pay as well as bringing in some new members into the My
Starbucks Rewards loyalty program, as well as them using the Mobile Order & Pay. And while we can't break out
specifics, as you mentioned, it's worth noting that, obviously, this program is gaining tremendous momentum. We've
been exceeding our own internal expectations in terms of the number of mobile orders we're seeing, in terms of the
incrementality that we're measuring and in terms of the qualitative factors, like customer and partner satisfaction.
They're all exceeding our expectations. And that's even more true in our busiest stores, which bodes well as we
continue to finish the U.S. rollout in such cities as, New York, in San Francisco, in Chicago.
And I'd also add that we're seeing – and we're happy to be seeing that the adoption rate is accelerating as we – Seattle
actually started out faster than Portland, which we were quite happy with. And then this last wave in the Sun Belt has
exceeded even that in terms of its initial adoption rate. So we have momentum. We're just getting started and you can
imagine we're pretty excited about this.
Operator
The next question is from Joe Buckley with Bank of America.
<Q - Joseph Terrence Buckley>: Thank you. A couple of questions, if I can. The deals with Spotify, Lyft, New York
Times, do they all involve a commitment to buy certain number of Stars? And are there upfront payments for the Stars?
Just explain a little bit more how it works and who's heading up that effort, Howard? Is it you at this point, or is it
Kevin or someone else within the organization?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Sure. Kevin, you want to take that?
<A - Kevin R. Johnson>: Sure. I'm happy to, Howard. Yeah, Joe, thanks for the question. I think that without getting
into the specifics of each of these deals, they all have a common element which is each of these partners is paying us
for Stars that then will be used to reward MSR customers for, in the case of Spotify or The New York Times, for
subscriptions, in the case of Lyft for rides. And in the case of Lyft for some benefits they have for their drivers as well.
In each, there's a range of terms in each of those agreements, but there's a fundamental principle around how we're
going to pivot to help them achieve their goals in terms of subscriptions and ridership and in return, they're going to
buy Stars or pay us for Stars, they're going to reward MSR customers for those benefits and that's where it becomes a

win-win-win, if you will.
MSR customers win because it's another place for them to earn valuable Starbucks Stars that they can redeem at
Starbucks. Starbucks will win because that will bring traffic into our stores. And our partners will win because we're
going to help them bring MSR customer base and bring customers to their offerings, whether it's subscriptions or rides
and we're going to go from there. So certainly that is the foundational concept behind the three deals that we've done
and the vision that we have going forward.
I think as Howard mentioned, we've got to walk before we run. And so, right now, I think the plans are to get the
Spotify implemented this fall, then we've queued up New York Times and Lyft in January early Q1, calendar year
2016. And, in the interim, we're going to continue to have dialogue with other interested partners. But I think the
priority right now is we're going to make sure that we do a great job with these first three partners and that our
customers have a great experience, our partners get benefit from that and that's where we're going to put our energy.
In terms of your question around who is managing this, I mean obviously, a big part of this links into the digital
experience we've created with our mobile app. So Adam Brotman and his team are doing a lot of the software
development that's enabling this. Certainly between Howard, Adam, Matt Ryan, and myself we've all been involved in
these dialogues and helping shape these. I think we're now at a point where we're going to now start formalizing
organizationally where the accountability is to scale it, but now clearly, the implementation of getting this done is a
responsibility that I have along with Adam Brotman.
<Q - Joseph Terrence Buckley>: Okay. And one more, if I could. On the 4% transaction growth, that is obviously a
very, very strong number. Can you talk about what you've done? You mentioned peak hour throughput transactions
being up, but if you're doing 4%, I'm sure they have to be up. But what have you done to kind of streamline that
process? Mobile Order & Pay, I'm assuming wasn't in enough stores long enough in the quarter to have too much
impact. So what else is going on to help drive those transactions?
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Thank you, Joe. It's Cliff here. The focus has been on all the basics in our stores and really
those peak hours in the mornings in our busiest stores we've really focused on labor, making sure we have enough labor
in the right place. That is helping us serve more customers. We're also seeing an increase in occasions with the work
we're doing around day part and that can be lunch, that can be our Frappuccino platform right through to the evenings
in stores, and all of those are helping us to grow all our stores across all day parts and it really is an absolute focus on
the basics. You're right in your assumption that Mobile Order & Pay is not yet a material part of that. As Adam said, it
launched too late in the quarter. But we are really encouraged by the work we're doing investing in our partners,
investing in labor in stores, and serving more customers.
<Q - Joseph Terrence Buckley>: Thank you.

The next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Thank you very much. I wanted to actually ask about food and in particular – and day part
expansion. In particular, when you, you talk about you have some impressive growth in some of the categories,
breakfast and then even lunch. Could you maybe help me think about ultimately if you have an idea about where food
could get to in terms of share of mix? Are there limits by not having a full kitchen? And on that note, can you maybe
update us on Starbucks Evenings, the rollout there and how you would think about that day part more expansively.
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Thank you, Sara. As was highlighted by Kevin, we've seen a real growth around the
breakfast day part driven in part by the breakfast sandwiches seeing a 30% growth, lunch, as we've expanded into that,
we've seen a very healthy 20% growth of that day part. And it really is focused from the work we started with La
Boulange products, it feels like almost three years ago now, and great quality ingredients that are resonating with our
customers. We keep refining and improving not only the choice of food but the relevance of the different day parts. As
we've expanded our offer of Teavana Iced Shaken Teas, again, the complement to lunchtime food gives us

encouragement that we're in the right direction here.
We said in the analyst conference at the end of last year that we would see our food mix growing up to the mid-20%s in
terms of percentage of mix, and I think that feels like a good place directionally. We're now up to 20%. We've seen a
one-point increase in the mix. So directionally heading that way and we have a good line of sight on it. Evenings, we
have rolled out the Evenings program to stores across different parts of the country. We're still in the early phase. We
will see the expansion of Evenings to hundreds of stores in the U.S. over the next 12 months. And that again gives
another opportunity not only to introduce wine and beer, but to strengthen our food offering to be part of that Evenings
offer complemented by teas, coffees, and our range of beverages.
We've also expanded many of those new food offerings, certainly breakfast sandwiches and lunch, and our pastries into
our Canadian business and into many of our licensed store partners. It's the first time we have had an aligned range
across such a wide portfolio. So that will also help us strengthen the relationship with our customers in terms of a
consistent offer, and also focus on delivering great quality food for our customers.
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: Hey, Sara, I would just add, and we commented on this last quarter. If you look at the ticket
in the U.S. business, the four points that you see there, there's a really healthy mix of ticket. There's a little bit of price
in there, but by far the majority of that is a combination of premiumization, so we're seeing customers trade-up within
categories or across categories, and then attach. And so that 4% is as healthy as we've seen it over the past few years.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Thank you.

<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thanks. Good evening. What are you learning in the roll up of Mobile Order & Pay from an
operational execution standpoint, particularly as you get into the thousands of stores? How are you finding the
customer satisfaction, especially with regard to having that beverage perfectly ready when the customer wants? If your
partners or consumers are suggesting tweaks or opportunities for the app, or execution, can you share any of those?
Thanks.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Sure. Adam, why don't you start and then Cliff can talk about the in-store experiences.
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: Okay. David, this is Adam. First of all, the things that we're learning are that we can
continue to refine. In fact, my guess is we'll do this for a long time and making sure that our estimated pick-up time
algorithm is always based on something where we're trying to improve. We're very happy with how it's working in beta
mode, and so happy that we're going to continue to accelerate our rollout. But that's something that we're continuing to
work on. We're also learning that our customers are requesting things like the ability to have very specific
store-by-store menus being turned on. That's something that we plan on turning on before the end of this year, in fact.
So we're working on that. So you can order things like Clover, and Fizzio, and Evolution Fresh smoothies.
So those are examples of the kinds of things that our customers are asking for that we are in the process of improving,
as we speak. And then of course, putting this capability onto an Android app and then starting to rollout in the U.K.,
Canada, and elsewhere around the globe. So those are kind of the examples the things that our customers are asking for.
Cliff?
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Yeah, I would say, David, the acceptance and enthusiasm from our partners across the
country has been incredible. They feel well trained. They feel ready for the rollouts and customer adoption, and usage
of the new app has just been fantastic. And we keep learning and we keep tweaking, but the ramp-up rate and the
adoption rate that Adam talked about earlier has just got stronger with each rollout. We now have some high-volume
stores which has allowed us to pressure test what happens in those stores. And in fact, those are the ones where we are
seeing the strongest adoption, and it does bode well for the future.

So, so far, all the learnings are good. I think that piece Adam said about getting store-specific menus so that customer
can order just what they want in their store. And I think the other one is just the excitement and the pressure to get it
into all of our stores so it's a standard part of our offer.
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: David, this is Adam again. Just to add on to what Cliff said. It's something that's worth
noting that if you look at our opportunity with Mobile Order & Pay and soon delivery, we have an absolutely unique
and differentiated capability because, unlike any other consumer-brand retail or restaurant company, we already have
an industry-leading integrated card loyalty and mobile system with massive momentum and usage, and Stars that are
relevant to our customers. And fully integrated into the POS system into the operations of our stores.
So it gives us a unique and differentiated ability to roll something like this out in a seamless and elegant manner, and
one where our partners, and our customers, are adopting it. So we're very excited about our differentiation in Mobile
Order & Pay.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thank you.

The next question is from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Karen Holthouse>: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I actually, I have another question about food and as
you've continued to see this platform grow across day parts, is there anything you've noticed in terms of the mix of
customers using it? Is it something that seems to be skewing Millennials, something that's skewing older? And then
also usage patterns in urban versus suburban, for sort of the grab-and-go-food? And then in particular, is there any
difference in how consumers are capitalizing on the drive-thru for sort of Starbucks as a non-fast-food drive-thru
option?
<A - Clifford Burrows>: There's a lot there, Karen. I would say that we are seeing more similarities than differences
across the country. Drive-thru, we focus primarily on a narrower range, and often our bestsellers or new introductions
or seasonal changes. But if somebody wants, and is familiar with the wider range, they just order it. We are seeing
bestsellers the same across the country, and there is no particular skew to Millennials. I think the lunch time offering
tied with Iced Shaken Teas is a new development for us. There is a strong drive towards the breakfast sandwich
platform, and that really is across the country.
One of the things that has been extremely encouraging is our strongest food markets have got even stronger with this
new food offering, and that is what is most encouraging. It's not everybody catching up. The traditional markets for us,
we've had our biggest adoption, and people buying the food have got stronger. And we see that this will continue to
grow.
I think the other thing that we have with this frozen distribution model is our availability of product has increased
significantly. Mobile Order & Pay is helping us again to improve that availability by us knowing exactly what the
customer wants.
So a lot of changes to the supply chain. A lot of refinements to the operational practices in stores, and at this stage, we
are not – we're not tailoring to a particular group, but we are also taking the opportunity to bring in some locally
relevant products; D.C. with a diverse supplier there and also in New York with an opportunity with a local supplier.
And I see that, plus the grab-and-go snacks, as some of the curated offers that we can start to put into the stores to
complement our base.
<Q - Karen Holthouse>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Hi. Good afternoon. I have a question about the China/Asia Pacific segments and the
strengths that you're seeing and the traffic trends there. Just wondering if you could elaborate on what you think is
driving that strength and maybe comment in particular on China and we've heard a lot of macro concerns about China,
but it seems like your business may be charging right through those. So perhaps could you elaborate on what's driving
the strengths in your mind?
<A - John Winchester Culver>: Yeah, hey, David. This is John. Clearly, we continue to see very strong momentum
across the region and the 11% comp growth is indicative of that. 10% of that was transactions. We're attracting more
customers now than ever before into our stores across all the markets we operate in. And when you look at the comp
growth in China, our comp growth in China has outperformed the overall regional comp growth again this quarter,
which is very encouraging. A couple of things are at play. First is the relevance of the brand and the fact that you know,
we are building this coffeehouse ritual and more and more customers are coming in. We're increasing the level of
frequency of our existing customers and then we're also attracting new customers into the brand each and every day.
In addition, what we're seeing is that as we've accelerated the store growth across the last several years is that our stores
are more accessible and, with that, we're also seeing very strong performance from a financial standpoint in the
first-year stores as well as in the second and third-year age-class stores as well. Digital is becoming a bigger piece of
our business across Asia to include China. We now account in several of our markets. 40% of our transactions is done
through the Starbucks Card and so digital is becoming a bigger piece of that.
And then the last piece I would say is when you look at the store designs and the store environment that we're creating,
we are truly creating a third place inviting environment for our customers to come with their family and friends and this
is resonating very strong. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to hand out awards for the top store designs and it just
reminded me of the fact of the beautiful stores and the beautiful spaces that we're creating across the region.
The big opportunity that we have going forward is this morning day part and the development of the morning day part.
And increasingly, we're seeing more and more relevance towards morning, but we do see this as an opportunity to
continue to develop and grow that, but we're highly encouraged by what we're seeing across the region and in particular
in China. As Howard mentioned, 1,700 stores now in over 90 cities and we're well on our way to that 10,000 store goal
across the region over the next five years.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Great. Thank you.
<A - John Winchester Culver>: Yeah.

The next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
<Q - John William Ivankoe>: Thank you. Howard, in your prepared remarks – and I'm not going to quote you
exactly, but I'm going to try, but you said that Starbucks' opportunity was about serving existing demand as opposed to
creating new demand. And that was just a very interesting comment, just related to latent demand that presumably
exists within the United States. And as you think about all the different things that you have that can bring additional
customers, whether they're new customers or you're bringing existing customers more often into existing Starbucks
stores and into new Starbucks stores, can you compartmentalize really how big of a revenue opportunity that you see
for Starbucks in the Americas that can be reached through your existing store footprint and maybe how much is
available over time through new store footprint and a bigger variety of different formats?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Let me try and answer that in a number of ways. First off, I think you would all agree that
unequivocally, we have proven and demonstrated that anyone who a year or two or even three thought that Starbucks
might be achieving a level of saturation in the U.S. or North America is clearly not the case. I think the ability that we
have from a design standpoint and real estate acquisition to create segmentation in our design and uniquely be able to
position Starbucks has given us opportunities that perhaps very few people thought existed in terms of the size and

scale of the market. I can't give you the specific number, but I can tell you that we believe that we are a long way from
the average unit volume of a Starbucks store achieving its ceiling.
And I think one of the unique strengths that we've developed over the last couple of years is being able to identify need
states and then to link that need state with the right product made for our customers in a customized fashion. And so,
John, you've been covering the company for many, many years and so you know perhaps better than anyone else that
there was a time when Starbucks' entire business pretty much happened 70%, 80% of it before noon. Well, that's not the
case today.
What's happening today is that we have identified, developed and executed against a strategy of leveraging the fixed
asset we have throughout the day part by creating need states products and now we're going to extend that to evening.
So when you link the fact that we still think we are in the early stages of what the average unit volume could be,
coupled with our ability – I think this is the third, maybe the fourth consecutive year of best-of-class new-store
performance given our store base, it's pretty unusual.
And what I was trying to say in my prepared remarks – and don't take me literally is that we're not in the business every
single day of just trying to intercept traffic. We're in the business of creating demand through the experience – the trust
in the brand, the social impact of what Starbucks is about, the trust that people have and who we are as a company, and
obviously, the value proposition in the unique experience that people are having. I think it's over 20 years now that
we've talked about the relevancy of the third place. We haven't talked about that in quite some time. The truth of the
matter is that the third place that we have established all over the world has become as relevant as the product itself.
And so when you couple all of these things together, and you create the kind of position we now have in the
marketplace, and you can leverage that scale, and I think the thing we've done really, really well, and it's quite a
challenge is how do you get big and stay small? How do you maintain intimacy and trust with your customers and your
brand when you are as ubiquitous as Starbucks has become. And the way you do that is through local relevancy and the
kind of product design and experience that we've now been able to create around the world.
It's one thing to talk about 23,000 stores in 67 countries, but the fact is if we transported ourselves to China or Spain or
France, or Malaysia or Singapore today, you'd see and feel the kind of experience that you're enjoying in New York
City, yet it's highly localized, highly relevant. And most importantly, the culture and values of the company continues
to be the brand-competitive difference of what we've been able to create around the world. So I still believe these are
early days for the company, not only in terms of the innovation that we've talked about, digitally and through Mobile
Order & Pay and other things that we have in the pipeline, but our core business. Our core business is re-affirming
every single day, our leadership position and all things coffee.
Kevin touched on the Roastery. The Roastery and the Starbucks Reserve is a big, big idea that is going to put a halo on
the entire company as we are not going to allow any small company or independent in any way to subordinate our
position as the leader in all things coffee. And the interesting thing about that then I'll stop because it's pretty long
winded, is not only are we able every single day to reaffirm our leadership position in all things coffee, but at the same
time, create the kind of beverages that are more impulsive, like Frappuccino, in ways that are accretive to the brand and
not dilutive to the brand of coffee.
So once again, I think we're doing things that are very difficult to do in terms of balancing scale, relevancy, the equity
of the brand, product innovation. And most importantly, really taking the company from a typical bricks and mortar
environment just three years ago to a new arena and kind of reinventing what it means to be a traditional
bricks-and-mortar retailer whose relevancy has to be where people live, where they work and where they play and on
every device that they're using in terms of the equity and the emotionality of the brand.
