MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
[Audio starts abruptly]
Operator
[Procter &] Gamble's quarter end conference call.
Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K,
10-Q and 8K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ
materially from these projections.
As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of
references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable
information on the underlying growth trends of the business.
Organic refers to reported results, excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, where
applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Free cash flow productivity is the
ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure adjusted
for certain items.
P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.
Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.

Good morning. I'm joined this morning by A.G. Lafley and John Chevalier.
We will start our discussion with a review of fiscal year and fourth quarter results. A.G. will then discuss our going
forward strategy and plans to strengthen our results and I will close with guidance for fiscal 2015.
One housekeeping item before we begin. All the numbers we will be discussing today assume discontinued operations
treatment for the pet care business, reflecting our planned exit. Impacts of the move from operating results to
discontinued operations were provided previously in an 8-K filing and are available online.
Now to on to results. We grew organic sales 3% in the fiscal year we just completed, in line with median performance
in our industry. We essentially held market share. Core earnings per share increased 5%. Organic sales and earnings per
share results were both within our target ranges and in fact, they were both within the pre-Venezuelan devaluation
ranges that we established going into the fiscal year, despite more than a 25% reduction in market growth rates from 4
points a year ago to 2.5 to 3 points currently and significant negative foreign exchange developments versus our going
in plan. Our productivity program, which we will talk more about later, was a significant enabler in delivering this
outcome.
On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share grew double digits, despite market growth headwinds. All in sales
grew 1%, all in earnings per share grew 4%. We generated $10.1 billion of free cash flow with 86% free cash flow
productivity. We increased the dividend 7%, the 58th consecutive year that the dividend has been increased. We
returned $12.9 billion in cash to shareholders, $6.9 billion in dividends, and $6 billion in share repurchase, about 110%
of net earnings, all in. We made significant progress on productivity, operating discipline, and execution.
We delivered $1.6 billion of cost of goods savings well ahead of our target run rate of $1.2 billion and ahead of our
going in estimate of $1.4 billion. We improved manufacturing productivity by over 7%, reducing overall enrollment
while adding new capacity and new sites. We opened the first new multi-category distribution center in the US, with
five additional centers slated to come online by early next calendar year.
We continue to accelerate overhead reduction. In February 2012, we announced a targeted 10% reduction of
non-manufacturing enrollment by June of 2016. As of July 1st, 2014, we reduced roles by 16%, more than 50% ahead
of the original objective two years earlier. We've made good progress driving marketing effectiveness and efficiency
through an optimized media mix with more digital, mobile, search and social presence, improved message clarity, and
greater savings in non-media spending.
While acknowledging the progress I've just described across cost of goods sold, overhead, and marketing, you may be
asking yourselves, "Where have all the savings gone?" In the year we just completed, most went to offset FX. We have
large leading positions in some of the markets where currencies have softened the most: Japan, Venezuela, and the
Ukraine and where price controls are in place. Excluding foreign exchange, core earnings per share were up double
digits.
Partly as a result of devaluation we are seeing significant wage inflation in developing markets, as much as 30% per
annum, which we also need to offset. We are continuing to make targeted investments in innovation, trial generation,
and in selling coverage to drive growth.
In addition to productivity, we made good progress this year in continuing to focus the portfolio. Just yesterday, we
closed the Americas pet care sales to Mars. Mars has also chosen to exercise their option to purchase the Asia business
which accounts for 10% of sales. We're working the European pet transaction with a different set of buyers. We exited
the concierge health care services business, MDVIP, we exited the bleach business and we divested several additional
smaller brands, Latin America Pert, as an example.
Moving from the fiscal year to the fourth quarter, organic sales grew 2% in a very challenging macro environment,
with decelerating levels of market growth in both developed and developing regions and intense competitive spending
in several categories. Organic volume was in line with prior year levels, pricing added 2 points to sales growth. All in
sales were down one point, including the two point headwind from foreign exchange and a modest negative impact
from minor brand divestitures.

Core earnings per share were $0.95, a 20% increase versus the prior year. Foreign exchange was a $0.04 headwind on
the quarter, excluding foreign exchange core earnings per share grew 25%. This includes a 5 point benefit from tax, and
a 4 point benefit from minor brand divestitures.
Core operating margin improved 170 basis points, driven by productivity savings. Core gross margin was down 50
basis points. Cost savings of approximately 270 basis points were offset by product category and geographic mix,
foreign exchange and higher commodity costs. Core SG&A costs as a percentage of sales improved by 220 basis
points, driven by overhead savings of 110 basis points and marketing efficiencies of 30 basis points and other SG&A
reductions.
As we previewed in the last call, non-operating gains from minor brand and business divestitures added approximately
$0.03 to core earnings per share in the quarter. The effective tax rate on core earnings was 19%, bringing the fiscal year
rate to 21%, consistent with the outlook we provided in the last call. June quarter all in GAAP earnings per share were
$0.89 which included approximately $0.04 per share of non-core restructuring charges and $0.02 of charges from legal
reserve adjustments.
In summary, we've just completed a challenging and tough, but on target, year. We met our objectives, delivered
double digit constant currency earnings growth, meaningfully advanced our productivity and portfolio focus agendas
and built on our strong track record of cash return to shareholders. There is more work to do to deliver sustainable sales
growth and reliable profit, cash and value creation.
I will turn it over to A.G. to talk about strategies and plans to accomplish this.
Alan G. Lafley
Thanks, Jon.
So that we are crystal clear, as Jon reported we delivered our business and financial commitments in 2013/14, but we
could have and should have done better. If just a couple of businesses that missed their going in operating plans had
delivered, we would have achieved our internal leadership team goals of 4% sales growth, built modest market share,
delivered 7% core EPS instead of 5% and 5% core operating profit growth instead of 2% despite all the market realities
Jon described: country volatility, market slowdowns, currency hurts, customer and competitor challenges. The point
here is delivering a better year was solely in our influence and control.
So while operating discipline and executional capability is getting better, a lot better around here, it must continue to
improve to reach the levels of performance this company and our organization is capable of. We are increasing our
focus on shoppers and consumers. They are the boss. Everything begins with consumer understanding, winning the
zero, first and second moments of truth and everything ends with winning the consumer value equation, consumer
preference, purchase and loyalty.
We are focused on creating and building consumer preferred brands and products that generate leading industry growth
and value creation. This is how we will generate top tier total shareholder return. We need to continue to strengthen our
brand positions, our product portfolio and pipeline, and our selling effectiveness in the countries, channels, and
customers in a way that maximizes shopper trial and regular purchase, drives brand and category growth, and delivers
more reliable value creation for customers, partners, for P&G and, of course, for shareowners.
Today we are announcing an important strategic step forward that will significantly streamline and simplify the
company's business and brand portfolio. We will become a much more focused, much more streamlined company of 70
to 80 brands organized into about a dozen business units, and the four focused industry sectors.
We'll compete in categories that are structurally attractive, and that play to P&G's strength. Within these categories, we
will focus on leading brands, marketed in the right countries, channels and customers where the size of the prize and
the probability of winning are highest with product lines and SKUs that really matter to shoppers and customers.

Why the significant strategic where to play change in brand portfolio? These core 70 to 80 brands are consumer
preferred and customer supported. These brands are for the most part leaders in their industry, category or segment, 23
with sales of $1 billion to $10 billion, another 14 with sales of $0.5 billion to $1 billion, and the remainder 30 to 40
with strong brand equities and sales of $100 million to $500 million. These brands are all well positioned with
consumers and customers, and well positioned competitively. These brands have strong equities and differentiated
products, and a track record of growth and value creation driven by product innovation and brand preference. These
brands are core strategic and have very real potential to grow and deliver meaningful value creation.
Over the last three years, this 70 to 80 brand portfolio has accounted for 90% of company sales and over 95% of profit.
It has grown one point or 100 basis points faster than the total company and has earned more than one additional point
of before tax margin. This new streamlined P&G should continue to grow faster and more sustainably and reliably
create more value.
Importantly, this will be a much simpler, much less complex company of leading brands that's easier to manage and
operate. This simplicity will significantly focus investment and resource allocation and enable execution. We will
harvest, partner, discontinue or divest the balance, 90 to 100 brands. In aggregate, sales of these brands have been
declining 3% per year over the past three years, profits have been declining 16%. These brands make up less than half
the average company margin.
The strategic narrowing and refocusing of the brand portfolio will have a number of significant benefits, mutually
reinforcing. 70 to 80 brands will bring clarity, focus and prioritization and simplicity to a smaller, more integrated,
better coordinated organization. The brand business units will be responsible for brand and product programs, end to
end down to the local country level. Selling and market operations will be responsible for customer and channel
strategies...

distributor level. This focus on fewer core strategic brands will enable a significant rationalization of product lines

Thank you for using the replay system. Good-bye.

This focus on fewer core strategic brands will enable a significant rationalization of product lines within brands, and an
even more significant pruning of unproductive SKUs.
As we rationalize business and brand portfolios, product lines and SKUs, P&G brands and products will be easier to
shop and more productive and profitable for our customers, our partners and for the company. This focus on fewer
strategic brands will enable R&D to focus product and technology development on more consumer relevant and
impactful brand and product ideas. We have already started reallocating R&D resources and budgets, cutting out low
value activity and doubling down on our most promising product innovations.

This focus on fewer core strategic brands will importantly inform our supply chain transformation. We will now match
manufacturing capacity to the brand portfolio and product lines. We will build distribution and mixing centers for only
the brands and products we choose to sell. This should enable industry-leading responsiveness and service to customers
at lower costs throughout the value chain.
With this refocus on consumer and shopper preferred leading brands, we will be able to focus selling operations by
retail account, wholesaler and distributor, strategies, tactics, and in-store executions that really make a difference. This
same simplification and prioritization enables all of our functions to provide the business units and sales operations
better value-added help and support.
In summary, we are going to create a faster growing, more profitable company that is far simpler to manage and
operate. This will enable P&G people to be more agile and responsive, more flexible and faster. Less will be much
more.
As a result of the company's strategic focus on its leading brands, we will both accelerate and over-deliver the original
$10 billion productivity plan. While we are not going to publish or report specific endpoint savings numbers today, we
will clearly over deliver the original goals and we will update you on progress along the way.
In cost of goods sold, we're driving further and faster than when we established the original savings objectives. The
annual manufacturing productivity improvements we're making and have made measured by the number of cases of
product produced per person per year are well beyond initial targets. Better process reliability and adherence to quality
standards is resulting in less raw material and finished product scrapping, increasing localization of the supply chain is
driving transportation and warehousing cost savings.
Earlier this year we initiated what is probably the biggest supply chain redesign in our company's history. We are
moving from primarily single category production sites to fewer, multi-category manufacturing plants. We are taking
this opportunity to simplify, standardize, and upgrade manufacturing platforms for faster innovation, qualification and
expansion, and improved product quality. We moved to standard manufacturing platforms a little over ten years ago in
Baby Care. We're developing standardized manufacturing platforms for a number of businesses: fabric care, grooming,
oral, and personal power, to name a handful.
We are transforming our distribution center network; moving from shipping products to customers for many ship points
as if they were coming from different companies, to consolidating customer shipping into fewer distribution centers.
These centers are located strategically closer to customers in key population centers in North America, enabling 80% of
P&G's business to be within one day or less of the store shelf and the shopper. This will allow both P&G and our retail
partners to optimize inventory levels while still improving service and on-shelf availability, efficient customer and
consumer response and more importantly, reducing in-store out of stocks. All of our new distribution centers will be up
and running by early 2015.
To manage and operate this simpler brand portfolio, we have made several important organizational design changes,
moved to four industry based sectors, streamlined and deduplication of business units and selling operations,
recombination of four brand building functions into one, reduction of hierarchy with all the sales operations and
business unit leaders working together and working directly with Jon and with me.
Each of these changes reduces complexity, each creates clearer accountability for performance and results. We are just
beginning to benefit from these opportunities to improve performance and reduce overhead costs that the organization
changes create.
We believe we have more opportunity to improve marketing effectiveness and efficiency in both media and non-media
areas, while increasing overall marketing effectiveness and improving top line growth. When we get brand and product
innovation right, source and sell brands and products effectively and efficiently, we grow and we drive meaningful
value creation. We generate higher sales and profit per unit, which enables us to capture a greater share of the value,
profit and cash, where we choose to complete.

It is this share of value, the share profit and cash that is generated, that we really want to focus on, and if we can,
disproportionately capture. Today we have about a 60 share of US laundry market sales, but earn approximately 85% of
the profit and cash generated in the entire category. Nearly a 70 share of the grooming business worldwide, and about a
90 share of value or profit. This disproportionate capture of category value is a direct result and reflection of our
business strategy and our business models.
There's been some discussion in this context about whether premium priced brands and products are still drivers of
growth and value creation, and I want to comment on this briefly this morning. We are shopper and consumer led.
Their wants and needs come first. We meet those needs with differentiated brands and better performing products
priced to deliver real and perceived consumer value.
In all four industry sectors and in most of our businesses, there is as much and often more sales growth and value
creation, profit and cash, in the premium and the super-premium segments. We have had some success in these
segments.
In the grooming market, premium products generate about 43% of category sales. Gillette has an 88 share of this
segment. Four years ago we introduced Fusion ProGlide priced at the higher end of the premium segment. Fusion grew
global value shares for 31 consecutive quarters, reaching $1 billion in sales faster than any other P&G brand or any
other Gillette shaving system in history. Fusion has been very successful in developing markets, which account for
25% of the brand's and product line's total business.
In countries where Fusion has been in the mark for several years, it has earned value shares that rival those of the best
developed markets. South Korea we have a 45 share, and Russia a 33 share, for example. Last month, we launched the
newest product in the Fusion lineup. FlexBall is the first razor designed to respond to the contours of a man's face
maintaining maximum contact and delivering a closer, more complete and more comfortable shave.
Pre-market, men preferred FlexBall 2 to 1, versus the then best-selling razor in the world, our own Fusion ProGlide.
FlexBall is off to a very good start, and appears to be revitalizing consumer interest in the category. While it's only
been available a couple of months, we have seen a 30% spike in male razor category value in the US and acceleration
in cartridge sales and shares.
Crest 3D White premium oral care regimen was also launched in the U.S. and grew market share for 17 consecutive
quarters. Crest has expanded worldwide, and has become a $1 billion business. 3D White has been an important driver
of toothpaste market share growth in Brazil and Mexico, adding about a point and a half of share in Brazil and a point
in Mexico.
We recently launched 3D White in Spain, France and Australia, and early results are encouraging, with growth in both
category and our market share. In Western Europe, the oral care category grew 3.5% in value this last quarter in a
region where many other categories are declining 1% to 2%. 3D White is a big driver of that category growth.
Following up on the 3D White launch, we introduced Crest 3D White Luxe toothpaste and whitestrips. The toothpaste
removes up to 90% of surface stains on teeth in just five days and protects against future stains with a proprietary
technology. The whitestrips with FlexFit stretch and mold to your teeth for a custom fit.
Tide, Gain, and Ariel unit dose laundry detergents have been an innovation breakthrough, resetting the bar for
delightful consumer usage experience, product performance and convenience in the laundry detergent category. Tide
PODS are priced at a 20% premium to base liquid Tide and have grown to over 7% of the laundry category.
In March, we launched Gain Flings, their version of PODS, priced at a 60% per use premium to Gain liquid detergent.
Flings have already grown to nearly 3% value share. Combined, Tide PODS and Gain Flings now hold a more than 10
value share of the U.S. laundry category and over 80% of the unit dose segment. We now offer this innovative product
in over 50 countries. In several other markets, including Japan and China, we have recently launched a single chamber
unit dose product, setting the stage for future upgrades as the unit dose segment develops.
In Japan, Ariel and Bold unit dose detergents are off to a strong start, achieving a nine value share in just three months.

Managing a brand and product portfolio is obviously a balance. In some categories where affordable pricing is a more
important part of the consumer value equation, we broaden our brand, product line, package size and price offerings to
serve more consumer needs. Bounty and Bounty Basic, Charmin and Charmin Basic, Pampers and Luvs, Tide, Gain,
and now Tide Simply Clean Fresh.
While we will continue to complete in product innovation and brand differentiation, we will not allow ourselves to be
uncompetitive on a consumer value basis in segments where we choose to play. There are times we must and will make
appropriate pricing adjustments to remain competitive. We are doing this now, as you know on a targeted basis in U.S.
fabric care and family care where competitors have been price discounting and promoting heavily since last calendar
year.
In the end, we follow the shopper, and the consumer. We meet their needs with consumer preferred P&G brands and
better performing products, priced at a modest premium that delivers superior consumer value.
We're currently entering the female adult incontinence category. This is an attractive $7 billion global category,
growing at an annual rate of 7%. We're entering the category with consumer preferred, superior performing products
that deliver significant benefit advantages from Always, a brand women trust and prefer. We began shipments of
Always Discreet in the U.K. last month and we'll start shipments in North America and France over the next few
weeks. We'll be sending you more details about this exciting new product line from Always next week.
In September, we're launching Crest Sensi-Stop strips. This is a revolutionary new product technology that provides
tooth sensitivity relief like never before. One strip applied for just ten minutes delivers immediate relief and up to one
month of protection from sensitivity pain for many consumers.
We are setting the brand and product innovation agenda in our industry. When we do this well, we build consumer
preference for our brands, extend the level of product competitive advantage, build brand and product consumer
preference, cumulatively over time and capture a larger share of category value, profit and cash.
The final area that will benefit from brand portfolio simplification is the consistency and the quality of our brand
building and selling execution. This execution is the only strategy our consumers and customers ever really see. We're
bringing renewed focus to brands. When we get brands right, we deeply understand consumers and we create desirable
ideas, iconic equities, and become the prototype in the category. We consistently express the brand promise with ideas
that attract consumers to the product's superior benefits to create trial, purchase, lasting preference, and loyalty. This
brand focus allows to us improve execution, and build our most strategic brands to win ultimately with consumers.
We are also focusing selling resources to improve coverage, expertise and execution in key retail channels, wholesalers
and distributors. This should lead to improved distribution, shelving, merchandising, and pricing execution to win
consistently at the first moment of truth. We are and will continue to increase coverage, sector and category dedication
of our sales force and merchandisers in store. I'm excited by the opportunity to further elevate brand and selling
execution, and feel very strongly these efforts will be enabled by the portfolio focus we have embarked on.
I'm working directly with sector and SMO leaders on these opportunities to profitably accelerate top line while Jon and
the team continue leading the work on portfolio simplification and productivity. This portfolio transformation may take
a little more time than any of us would like, because streamlining the brand and product portfolio will be governed by
our ability to create value on every exit. When we get there, to our, in effect, P&G NewCo, with a streamlined 70 to 80
brand portfolio, this will enable faster and more sustainable growth and more reliable value creation through the end of
the decade and beyond.
We will be a simpler, faster growing, more profitable company that's far easier to manage and operate. We will be a
company of brands that consumers prefer and customers support, well positioned competitively, a company of brands
simpler to source, sell, and service. This streamlined company of leadership, household and personal care brands will
deliver more reliable value creation for consumers and customers, partners and suppliers, and will deliver reliably and
sustainably total shareholder return in the top third of our industry peer group.
I look forward to updating you on our progress when we meet for our analyst meeting here in Cincinnati in November.

Now I will turn the call back to John to provide the details on our outlook for this year.
Jon R. Moeller
We continue to expect global markets in our categories to grow in value terms 2% to 3%. Against this backdrop we are
currently forecasting fiscal 2015 organic sales growth of low- to mid-singles. With this level of growth, we'll maintain
or modestly grow global share on a local currency basis. We think this is a pragmatic and realistic starting point for our
fiscal 2015 financial commitments.
Pricing should again be a positive contributor to organic sales growth, though likely not to the same degree we have
seen over the past several years. Foreign exchange is expected to be a one point sales growth headwind.
With this level of sales growth we are forecasting mid-single digit core earnings per share growth. We will benefit
again from significant productivity savings, but like last year, these will be partially offset by FX headwinds which
won't annualize at current spot rates until the back half of the year.
We have a few value corrections to make, we are also going to invest in consumer trial on preferred brands and major
new product innovations that are in market and that are coming to market. We will continue to make investments in
innovation and go to market coverage in the fastest growing sales channels.
Non-operating income and tax should be roughly in line with prior year levels and we're targeting to deliver 90% or
better free cash flow productivity. Our plans assume capital spending in a range of 4% to 5% of sales, and share
repurchase in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion.
At this level, share repurchase should net of option exercises contribute about 1 percentage point of earnings per share
growth. On an all in GAAP basis we expect earnings per share to also grow mid-single digits including around $0.20
per share of non-core structuring investments.
In addition to the assumptions included in our guidance, we want to continue to be very transparent about key items
that are not included. The guidance we are providing today is based on last week's FX spot rates. Further currency
weakness, including Venezuela, is not anticipated within our guidance range. We continue to monitor unrest in several
markets in the Middle East and Eastern Europe and we continue to closely monitor markets like Venezuela and
Argentina where pricing controls and import restrictions present risk.
This guidance does not assume any major portfolio moves. We'll update guidance as these occur.
Finally, our guidance assumes no further degradation of market growth rates.
There are a few things you should keep in mind as you construction our quarterly models. Our toughest top line comps
are in the first two quarters. The top and bottom line impacts from consumer value corrections will disproportionately
affect the first quarter and the first half. FX impacts will not fully annualize until the back half and productivity savings
will build as the year progresses.
In summary, we are pleased to have delivered an on target year on both the top and bottom lines but realize there's
more work to do. We are realistic about where we stand in the journey and are excited about the path ahead.
That concludes our prepared remarks. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and
will be available on slides which will be posted on our website at www.pg.com following the call.
A.G. and I would be happy now to take your questions.

[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hi, gentlemen, good morning.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Good morning, Bill.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Good morning.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Can you give us a timeline for the sales of those 90 businesses that have been deemed
non-core?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Well, as A.G. said in his remarks, the timing on this is going to be governed by our ability to
create value, which we're committed to do as we exit these businesses, much as we've done – exactly as we have done
with the prior category and brand exits. And rough order of magnitude, this is, I would guess, Bill, though I'm not
providing specific guidance, probably call it 12 to 24 months. But, again, we're not going to be governed by a timeline,
we are going to be governed by value creation.

Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher. Please proceed.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Yes, thank you. Sort of continuing with this, one of the things you guys are working on is
driving sort of more cost efficient structures and I guess, how do you fragment some of these brand groups or, you
know, is this – I guess can you talk a little bit about how this is making the structure less complicated as you go to this
many brand groups?
And then secondly, as you look at some of the productivity efforts, can you talk a little bit about the focus on stranded
overhead and do you feel like your recent productivity will allow you to eliminate some of the potential dilution from
selling off some of these businesses? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So, John, first of all, as we look at the portfolio, in the way that A.G. described, we are really
looking at it through a strategic lens. And we are wanting to play in categories with brands, leadership brands, that play
to our strengths. We've talked before about the core capabilities that we believe we have as a company, and very
simply, brands that leverage those capabilities have proven over time to sustainably create value and those that don't
fully leverage those capabilities, on average, we have struggled with.
And so part of this simplification, if you will, is just matching up our businesses with what we are good at and not
having to struggle with some things that we're not as good at. So that in itself is a big simplification.
You can imagine, going from a company of, call it 160 brands, to a company of 70 or 80 brands is in itself incredibly
simplifying. The number of innovation platforms that we need to focus on, the number of manufacturing platforms that
we need to focus on, the number of products we need to sell to each and every customer and distributor. So there's
tremendous simplification that comes with this.
To your specific question of stranded overheads, it's our objective and expectation that we will use the productivity
savings that are available both through simplification that comes from portfolio focus, but also the productivity savings
that come through the organization structure changes that A.G. talked about, to in effect, offset the stranded overhead
impact.
There will be some dilution as these businesses go out, just as there have been with businesses that we have been
divesting. But it will be on that order of magnitude and it will result primarily from the loss of operating earnings of
those businesses. We will take care of the stranded overhead.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: John, just a couple of additional points, I mean, this is a classic strategic choice. We want to be
in the businesses we should be in, not the businesses we are in.

Secondly, it is driven by shoppers and consumers and the market primarily. We are focusing on the brand and business
portfolio in the four industries that consumers actually buy and prefer, right? That customers really support and can
support, where we have very strong brand equities, where our net promoter scores are higher, where our brand
positioning is well differentiated and where the product performance delivers. So it's very straightforward and the
objective is growth. The objective is balanced, profitable sales growth and much more reliable value creation. Much
more reliable generation of cash, primarily, but cash and profit.
In terms of the organization side, it's going to get a lot simpler. It has already begun to get simpler. A lot of this is
already underway. But we just have real clarity about what a regional selling operation does and what a business unit
does. And they are now connected with far fewer handoffs and we will continue to improve that design to further
reduce the handoffs. We are just going to be much, much more agile and much more adaptable, you know, much
quicker inside. Much simpler inside so we can deal with all of the change and the pace outside. That's really the
objective here.
We had our last global leadership council meeting last week, okay? I don't know the number, Jon, what are there, 30 to
40 people? We now have a lead team of about 10 of us. And basically the region leaders, the sector BU leaders, you
know, Jon and myself, 10 to 12 of us. We meet more often. We work on the business. We get things done on a weekly,
biweekly and monthly basis. So we're just going to be more adaptable and we're going to be more agile, we're going to
be more responsive. We're going to be able to make more decisions a lot faster and turn the decisions into action in the
market that really matters.

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
<Q - Lauren R. Lieberman>: Thanks, good morning, just two quick things. First was just around any kind of tax
implications or risks from selling businesses on a very low cost basis. And then the second was how do you think you
will be able to kind of ensure you don't lose shelf space or facings as you, you know, divest or discontinue brands?
Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: On the tax question, Lauren, there will be some low base assets that will be part of the portfolio
that's going to be disposed. We have done a pretty good job historically about managing that through tax efficient
structures. Those do take time, which is what we are talking about when we say, you know, that value creation will
guide the pacing of the exits. So what we'll try to manage that as effectively as we can.
A.G., do you want to talk about...
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Yeah, I mean, Lauren, obviously, we have anticipated the concern that you raise and a whole
bunch of other concerns that we have to manage through the transition and through all the details of the execution, but I
guess I would just mention three quick examples.
One, in the U.S. we started out with a laundry brand portfolio of 15 brands, okay? Today we have a brand portfolio of
five and over the decades our share has increased and as we pointed out in my prepared remarks, our share is
approaching 60 again and our – more importantly, our share of the value created in that segment is at probably the
highest level, based on our calculations, ever.
So I think there's a lot of evidence in a number of our business categories that the shopper and the consumer really don't
want more assortment and more choice. They want efficient consumer response.
If you just look at what's going on in the omni-channel and pure play e-tailer environment with online shopping, you
know, we are doing a pretty doggone good subscription business. We are doing a good shopping list and automatic
replenishment business because in a lot of our categories frankly, they're low involvement and consumers want to keep
their lives simple and convenient and having the leading brand, better performing products and a good value every day
helps them keep life simple and convenient.

Two last very quick points. If you look at this company decade by decade, at the end of the decade, all of our growth in
value creation is driven by three things.
One, we are able to grow and continue to create value from our core established brands and businesses going into the
decade.
Two, we are able to create, transform or acquire and build, at least one major new business.
And three, we are able to move successfully into new space, okay, whether that's developing markets or new channels
or whatever. And I suspect in 2021, when we look back at this decade, we are going to see the same pattern. We have
done a lot of analysis that shows more does not drive growth and more certainly does not drive value creation.
Absolute last point and you will know this one as well, or better, than I. You know, when the team sort of got us into
the beauty and personal care business between 2000 and 2007, we tripled the sales from whatever it was, under 7 to 20
plus. We quadrupled the profit and we did it on a half a dozen brand businesses: Pantene and Head and Shoulders, Olay
and SK-II and a trio of fragrance brands accounted for virtually all of that growth and value creation in an industry
that's notorious for activity and complexity.
So I just believe very deeply that we're picking our spots in these industries that play to our strengths and our assets and
we're going for it.

Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: I have two questions. First maybe for you, A.G. You said at the beginning that there were
several businesses that missed plan during the course of the year. And I'm curious whether that is or was predominantly
innovation that fell short of expectations or miss-priced products or what the problems were. And I think you said you
feel more confident about your execution ability going forward, but maybe specifically why is that? Is it different
people in charge, or do you have a better sense of adaptability if things are going wrong? So that's question number
one.
And then number two, Jon, your comments really surprised me. You said that for next year you only plan to maintain
or modestly grow market share, which strikes me as a very weak stance to enter the year. I would think with all the
innovation and all of your planned spending you would have more confidence or more enthusiasm about your market
share trends, thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So, let me take the second part of that question and then I'll turn it over to A.G. Look, we're
trying to establish very realistic external guidance that frankly is reflective of the macro environment we are in and is
reflective of what we have proven ourselves capable of delivering thus far. We delivered 3% organic sales growth this
year; we're forecasting low to mid singles next year. We've delivered 5% core earnings per share growth this year;
we're forecasting mid-singles for next year. We share completely your desire to do better than that, and as we prove
that capability, if and as we prove that capability, guidance will reflect that.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Wendy, on your first question, first to be very clear about what I said. If just a couple, two
businesses, had delivered their operating plans, we would have achieved our internal goals of four, seven, five
operating, okay, and generated, of course, even more cash. Just two, okay?
The issues were different. In one business, frankly, they let their pricing get out of line. And the thing that was
frustrating about it is it was out of line and for whatever reasons, I don't feel like the team came to grips with that
reality fast enough. Okay? It's being fixed. It's happened before in this category. We know how to fix it, it will get
fixed. And ironically, it was a business that had like a 10 or 12-year run of very strong balanced growth and value
creation.

In the other case, we got our nose ahead of the tips of our skis on an investment in a new line of brands and products
and we just need to get back to the discipline, okay, of testing and qualifying major investments that we're going to
make. Hey, there's a lot of risk on the product innovation side.
There's a lot of risk when you are making investments in the marketplace, but we try to and we have a track record of
and when we are performing to our capability, we do a reasonably good job of testing things before we expand them,
and we just got the investment way ahead of the actual results in the marketplace. Those are the two.
The thing I feel good about, I should say, is – and my team knows this, is I actually feel very good that more of our
businesses are executing better, are sharpening their strategies and translating it into operating plans and that our
execution is improving. But, hey, this is an intensely executional industry, and we just absolutely have to be at the top
of our game all the time.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: And just one more point on this. While we did have problems in a couple of businesses, as A.G.
described, we had many businesses that had the best year they've had in a long time.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: That's right.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So, for instance, our Duracell business had a fantastic year. Our Salon Professional business
had one of its best years in quite a long period of time. So there are many more things working than not working.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Oh, yeah.

Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Good morning. So A.G., on the portfolio rationalization, can you discuss why you are
implementing it now? The strategy makes sense, but what's kind of changed that's driving you to undertake this now?
And you previously outlined that 90% of the business was core, and you expected divestitures. I'm assuming the brand
rationalization announcement today includes those businesses you already expected to divest or should we look at this
as rationalization on top of that?
And then last, just given the process will take 1 to 2 years, are you committed to staying on board as CEO for as long as
at least the bulk of the brand rationalization process takes?
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Okay, Dara stop me if I don't capture all of your questions.
Okay. Last question first, hey, the board – I'm serving at the pleasure of the board and we're criteria driven. We are not
schedule driven. Okay? So obviously, I wanted to drive this strategy and accelerate it, but that's totally driven by our
understanding of shopper and consumer needs and wants and the realities, okay, of the marketplace, whether we are
talking about channels and customers, whether we are talking about competitive factors or whatever. So this is purely
consumer market and competitive driven strategic choice.
Second thing is we're already underway, okay? So this is a continuation and acceleration. I mean, we are underway on
the portfolio pruning. I just want to accelerate it. Okay? We are underway on the organization redesign. I just want to
accelerate it. We are underway on the major restructuring and productivity savings that were announced two to two and
a half years ago. I just want to get it to a logical endpoint for the first phase so that we can focus on operating with
excellence and growing this business and performing at our peak.
And I'm sorry, the third part of the question was, Dara, remind me?
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Just why now specifically? I mean it makes sense, but what drove you to make the change
at this point?

<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Okay. Look, in an ideal world, okay, in an ideal world we would have done this at the depth of
the financial crisis, in recession. That would have been the perfect time to do it, if you think about it right, dramatically
focus, dramatically simplify, get the cash flowing, right? And then once the bank is full, bide your time until the market
starts to come again, right? That would have been perfect, right? If we were Monday morning quarterbacks and I could
look over the last 40 years that would have been the perfect time.
But I missed, we missed some of that opportunity and frankly when you are in the middle of a financial crisis, when
you are watching oil approach $150 a barrel and chaos is reigning around you in the biggest recession since the 1930s
you always – you don't always have the time to think through or the resources to act on a transformation of this size and
scope.
But having said that, I don't see any reason to wait. I don't see any virtue in waiting another minute. And I guess the last
thing I would say is, just think about what we're going to undertake. I don't want to go out and spend $1 billion round
numbers on totally redoing the sourcing and supply chain in North America and do it for the wrong business shape and
size. That would be a terrible mistake, right?
So in a lot of other places, we are making investments that are going to make this company stronger, help us operate
better, et cetera, et cetera, and we have to make sure that we are doing this for the business that we think we are going
to have and we think we are going to run for at least the next five plus years or so.

Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please proceed.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Can you talk about what other strategies you considered? Why is this the right strategy? And why
doesn't this at least in the interim take some focus away from fixing issues in the 70 to 80 brands that you are planning
on keeping?
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: I don't see any tradeoff there, Olivia. In other words, we will have more talent, more resource,
financial and people, against the 70 to 80 brands. So I mean, we have been all over several of those businesses, and
frankly, I'm involved with 10 to 15 of them working with the leadership teams. So I don't see any tradeoff.
Now, I won't tell you that there – that we haven't taken on extra work for another year, year and a half, maybe at most
for parts of it. As Jon said, it may be the last disposals are, as far as 18 to 24 months away. But, no, job one, job one is
take care of shoppers and consumers, work with our customers and suppliers and deliver the operating plans and
commitments on the 70 to 80 core brands that make up the portfolio that's going to drive this company ahead.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Okay, thanks. A.G., you highlighted, P&G following the consumer as it relates to innovation at
the premium side of categories and at higher priced categories. And I think you called out the success of the innovation
in high end laundry as an example. Now, I understand you don't report laundry standalone, but Fabric and Home was
up 1% organically. The Nielsen data in the U.S. shows share erosion, even following the launch activity. Obviously,
there was a lot of competition there with a lot of deep discounting. You responded with your own deep discounting. I
guess, is this an anomaly, what has happened in this category? How do you reconcile that with the view that innovation
is successful at the high end, at least in this category?
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Okay, Chris, let's go through this one in some detail, because I think it's instructive. And if you
have the patience, we'll go through one or two others because I think they are instructive, too.
But let's just take U.S. Laundry and let's go back to about a year ago in early September when we were at Barclays.
And you may recall, that we announced a series of fabric care category brand and product innovations that would be

coming to market in the middle or end of the first quarter of 2014. I think we said at the time that they included the
extension and the expansion of our PODS product innovation to Gain and Aerial and to other countries like China and
Japan, which I spoke about. We announced strengthening of our heavy duty liquid product offerings, so the-called
value-added offerings, to meet consumer needs that were unmet. And we announced the introduction of Tide Simply
Clean & Fresh to meet unmet consumer needs in the mid-tier segment of the category.
I think at the time, we pointed out that virtually all of the category growth and most of our P&G sales growth and value
creation would come from the PODS and the value-added heavy duty liquid brands and product lines. So let's look at
what happened.
Well, in September and October, the media and many of our analysts commented on the program and 95% of the
commentary was on Tide Simply Clean. In October, November, and December, our three main economy competitors
all unleashed a series of, essentially price rollbacks and price discounting and temporary promotion after temporary
promotion, all of which has continued to the present. We started shipping in mid- to late February, and frankly, we
couldn't keep up with all of the demand of our customers. So we were probably well established in stores, at retail by
March and the beginning of April.
Now, let's look at what's going on with the market shares. You know, week by week, from let's say, the time that we
really got established by retail. Well, lo and behold, we have increased market share every week, okay? And if you look
at our past 52-week share and compare it to our past 4-week share, we are up a full share point.
Now, what else went on in the market? Well, with all of that spending by the economy players, they essentially took
dollars out of the category, which concerned some of the retailers. And basically, they traded cases, dollars and share,
and made less profit than the ones they traded. So, yes, there was a winner in that group, but there were also losers in
that group.
I think there's some indication; we think there's some early indications that maybe we have reached the point where it's
pretty clear about what the middle and premium part of this category is going to look like, and what the economy part
of this category is going to look like.
And then, if we turn to Tide Simply. I think we said last September that the worst case scenario would be we would get
a big share and we would cannibalize from ourselves. Well, we have gotten a medium sized share, frankly, about what
we thought it might be and we still don't know where it will end up because it's still only at 50 plus percent retail
distribution and relatively low trial rates among its target. But over 60% of it has been net extra to us.
So I don't look at this week versus the same week year ago. I don't look at this quarter versus the same quarter a year
ago. I look at shares over time. We are on our way, we think, back to a 60 share. We have only had a 60 share of dollars
a few times in the history of this company and, in fact, peaked at about a 62 to 63 when one of our principal
competitors withdrew from the market back in 2007. But we have a higher share, the highest share we have ever had of
the value created. So that's how we think about it.
I know I have gone on a bit, but I just want to mention a couple of others so that you get the point. We didn't talk about
it this morning, but in our diaper business in the U.S. and North America, we have rather quietly moved back to share
leadership, which we lost 20 years ago when our competitors brought training pants to market. And we recaptured it in
the last 18 months and we have opened up a spread of almost six points, six share points on diapers and I think a couple
of share points plus on the whole baby care category, that counts wipes and some of the other product lines.
But how did we do that? Okay? How did we do that without pants? Well, we did it because our baby stage of
developments line of products, and particularly Swaddlers, which is unique consumer preferred, et cetera, has just
cumulatively, year after year, slowly but surely increased its trial, increased its share. And is now just in and of its own
right a $600 million sub brand that we think, now that we offer Swaddlers on all sizes, now we are finding moms
actually prefer the design, could become a billion dollar business. So my only point is I want to look at the cumulative
impact of our brands and our products.

Last point. In 2007, we introduced a novel, totally new, proprietary product and technology on Always. It was called
Infinity. I think we weren't as clear as we could be with consumers about what the product was and what it did. But
without boring you in all the details, it is a very unique, ultra-thin foam product, far and away the best absorbing.
This past year, we had all kinds of issues trying to get a totally new technology and manufacturing process started up.
We struggled, as I said, to connect with consumers, but this last year, we did over $200 million on Always Infinity. We
have now expanded into parts of Asia and parts of Europe. It represented 15 to 20%of our growth. It's a clearly superior
product. Women who have tried it and purchased it are repurchasing it at a rate of 60 to 70%.
So I actually see across most of our categories, brands and products that are really unique and/or highly differentiated,
that when properly presented to consumers, when the value's clearly explained and if they have a chance to try it, that
we can drive a lot of conversion.
And final point, I'm not going to take you through the details but virtually every brand and product line we sell, even in
the U.S., is dramatically under tried, dramatically under tried. So, you know, we will be back at ensuring that
consumers who are prospects for these brands and product lines have a chance to really try the product and give it a
chance.
Sorry, Chris, I went on a long time, but I wanted to make the broader point about brand differentiation, product
superiority and consumer preference.

<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Yes, thanks. Hey, A.G., maybe you can just provide a little bit more context on the streamlined
portfolio. Will there be a geographic angle to this as well or is it just, hey, these are the 80 brands that we are going
focus on globally? If you look at it on India or Venezuela or Brazil, are there certain brands that maybe you'll pull back
from, even though they are a global brand? Thanks.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Okay. Understandable question. I'm going to – hopefully I will be able to answer this as clearly
as possible. Remember, Nik, we are shopper and consumer driven. That means we are – all of the shopping and
consumption occurs locally. So, if and when we get this right, we will have the right mix of brands, product lines and
SKUs for China. We'll have the right mix for Brazil. We'll have the right mix for the Arabian Peninsula and Turkey,
we'll have the right mix for India and the Sub-Sahara, okay? So this is totally shopper and consumer driven.
We looked at the real growth and value creation potential, and as I pointed out, these are brands that for some time have
not been delivering on that front, okay? So, yeah, if we get this right, we will have the right – we will not be short of
brands or products to win in any market we choose to compete in and eventually, I think as you know, that is going to
mean all the emerging markets of the world, because that's where the demographics will be driving us. That's where the
babies are born. That's where the households form and that's where incomes are rising.
We think this positions us just as well in emerging markets as it does in any developed market.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: And if you think about the screen we talked about earlier, Nik, which is businesses that play to
our strengths, typically when we are operating a business that does play to our strengths, we can operate that business
globally. And so this is not a – there's not a geographic frame to this. It's as AG said, consumers, shoppers, matched
with P&G's strengths.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: And Nik, just one more thing. Again, in an attempt to help everyone understand, in some cases,
it's simple. We sell one brand name everywhere in the world, Pampers, Pantene, okay? In some we sell two,
Always/Whisper.
In some of our lines, in fabric, in home, in beauty and personal care, we sell what we call cloned brands. Okay? So the
principal brand might be Rejoice, okay, but we sell Rejoice under a different name, okay in individual markets, because

that's sort of the history of the brand. We keep those brands, same in laundry, same in cleaning.
So we are very practical. We are very consumer and customer driven and we worked outside in from the markets to our
brands and then to our business categories and sectors.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. So, before I get to the question, and I often hate doing this, but I think it's worth just a
comment, because I've heard it from many investors. I'm not sure you did yourselves many favors on the – in the press
release not talking about the quarter really at all. So we all got to page 13 or whatever it was, seeing that there was
some rounding and beauty was down three, but there's no explanation. I'm not sure you did yourself any favors. For the
sake of it, I heard it from a lot of people and I wanted to put it out there.
The question though more is around learning about this very interesting structural change. So it feels like, I think most
people have been going with the assumption of 10% of the business that was going to be divested was going to be more
along business segment lines and now I think you are flipping a little bit and talking about it from a branding line. So I
want to understand that, if that's true.
And then there are a few questions that come out of that. One is, lots of changes and the rationale is focus, which I get,
but where do you know where the right balance is? So why isn't something even further like a bigger breakup not the
right answer? How did you make that decision?
And then also from a – also from a focus perspective, if these brands you are going to sell are about 10% of the sales,
5% of operating profit, can you give us a sense of how much of your time, management's time and resources were on
those?
And then last, I want to go back to a question from before and give you another chance. If A.G., the board says, we
want you here through this 12 to 24 month period, big transition period, we trust you to do this, do you want to be there
for that time? Thanks for all of those.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Criteria driven, I'm having fun. I'm full of energy. I'm 24/7. So that will take care of the last
one.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: If my email volume is any indication, it just backs up what A.G. said. He's here and working
hard.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: The second point, Ali, it's strategy first, structure second, right? Structure supports strategy.
Third point is, ultimately, it's about competitive advantage and value creation, right? So we don't see – we see
competitive advantage in multi industry sector participation. We see competitive advantage in technologies that flow
across categories and industries. We see competitive advantage in sourcing as a company and providing information
and other services as a company and purchasing as a company. So, you know, when we do the math on the value
creation, we get to this choice, strategic choice, this set of businesses has the potential to be the biggest value creator,
right? Which should be in the interest, not only of our company, but also of our shareowners.
But, yeah, I mean, the balance point is a very fair one and I'm not going to tell you that any of us are good enough to
get this precisely right and you know what, we will adjust as we go. I can't tell you whether a 50 brand company might
not be a little bit better than a 70 brand company, if you see what I mean. Okay?
The last point, to your direct question, is the management distraction is episodic, intermittent and not the driver. The
activity and complexity that clogs us up is the real issue. Okay? Let's just take SKUs, okay? I don't know what the end
result will be here. It's being worked business by business iteratively, but believe me, the SKU reduction will be a lot
bigger than the 10% off the sales line or revenue line. Let's take product lines the same, okay?

So all of a sudden – you know, one of the reasons that a number of our businesses have performed better is because the
businesses and the R&D team and I all sat down in July and we sat down several times since and we just pruned out,
you know, the bottom 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% of the activity and focused on a few others and that's accelerated better
products to market. The businesses, some of the businesses that Jon mentioned and other businesses that did really well
this last year, did well because they were extremely focused.
And the last point, and I could use a whole bunch of different examples here. When you are carrying the bag, I will use
the old metaphor, with all the P&G brands and product lines in it, to a distributor or a wholesaler or to one of our
sophisticated retail customers, believe me, it is a huge advantage to be selling fewer leading, consumer and shopper
preferred brands and product lines.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Steib with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Thank you. Good morning. I have a couple of questions, please. AG, you mentioned – you
emphasized really, the importance of having the right balance between – between premium priced products on the one
hand and affordable products on the other hand. You know, where the consumer demands it. I was wondering, in the
core brand portfolio of 70 to 80 brands that you have identified now, do you think that that balance is right at this
point? And in other words, you know, should the sort of negative mix effect on the top line going forward be less of a
headwind once you have gone through these various disposals? That's my first question.
And then, Jon, forgive me for asking a financial question, but given your outlook for fiscal 2015, you suggested that
essentially the top line growth is going to be against tough comps in first half and cost savings will build through the
year. Should we therefore expect earnings growth to be sort of flattish in the first half and it will all come good in the
second half? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: A couple of things and one on the expectation of the reduction in negative mix on the top line
as we go forward. That will, in all likelihood continue. We have been pretty clear about that. It's driven by
disproportionate growth in developing marks which we expect to continue. And as we move consumers up those
portfolios over time, that impact will lessen. As developed markets growth is reinvigorated, that dynamic will lessen.
But it has been with us and will likely be with us for some period of time.
On the guidance question, we're not providing quarterly guidance, but all the dynamics that you talked about are the
right ones. I think you are focused on the right things and I would encourage you to follow up with the IR team later
today.
And I will let A.G. handle the question on whether we are priced right, broadly or...
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Yes, Michael, again, let me try to make a couple of strategic points and then I will try to give
you some insight into where we think we are at this moment in time.
The first thing is incredibly important and often not well understood, and that is the issue in our industry, in household
products and personal care products, is almost always consumer perception of value. And value has different drivers in
different categories and different brands. Price is one of them. Okay? Price is one of them. But brand awareness and
trial rates and household penetration, brand equity, okay, product performance, also are incredibly important.
Second point, we have a huge opportunity to get a lot clearer with consumers about what the value equation really is. I
am going to give you a specific example from Gillette.
We talked earlier that we just introduced FlexBall and it's off to a good start and we will see how it does, all right? We
did pre-market research in a blind context. So they don't know what the brand is, and the new FlexBall razor was
preferred 2 to 1 by system users versus the best performing product in the market which happened to be our ProGlide.

Page 18 of 20
We are now in the market, four, six, eight weeks. We went out and did a 400 male person panel, where we ask them to
use the new FlexBall razor versus whatever they are using today. So we had disposable users, we had shave club users,
we had system users, we had electric razor users. 95% of them preferred the FlexBall. 95%.
Interestingly, a lot of disposable users, by the way, half the world, okay, uses a disposable razor today. The interesting
thing is disposable users often say they use disposables because they think it shaves just as well as a system. Many of
them have never used a system. And they think it's a better value.
So their first belief, if they try and use the FlexBall, they see it is a totally different experience and result. And then, the
second thing is when you ask them what they think the price is, or the cost is or the value is, they always say it's way
more expensive. And when we tell them you can have a cartridge for $1 a week, they are astounded, and then we show
them the math.
So my only point here is if you just read the Wall Street Journal, okay, or if you just listen to the anecdotes on the
Street, or if you look at the $50 for 10 cartridge pricing in some retail establishments, you may perceive that the price is
high. But the actual price per use and the actual quality and performance of the use is better. And that's incredibly
important.
Now, to the direct question. I said in my prepared remarks, we're in some businesses where the price point doesn't
matter, or, in fact, a higher price point is better. I sell more SK-II when my price point is better. We sell a lot of Oral B
electric toothbrushes at very high price points and I could go on, on, on throughout our line. But if you step back and
look at all of our businesses around the world, we are in the best shape we have been in in three years in terms of our
relative pricing. In other words, we have the smallest percentage of our total business that has a price gap and is losing
share. And here's the important part. The three biggest opportunities are tissue, towel in North America, which is
Bounty and Charmin and laundry, which Chris asked me about earlier, all of which are being addressed. Okay?
Interesting point there, on laundry, is major retailers are sort of discounting Tide 15% to 20%. It's still a better deal for
them because Tide at a 15% discount is a higher price and generates more value for them than the balance of the
category.
Last point on this one. The number of opportunities we have where we are priced below where we should be or mixing
below where we should be are as large or greater than the opportunities we have to adjust our price.

And your final question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Believe it or not, a few more questions, if I could. First, Jon, maybe I missed it, but did you
offer any cost or timing estimates associated with the supply chain restructuring that you are undertaking?
And then, second, taking a step back, you are clearly making progress on the cost cutting, especially in SG&A, but the
top line continues to lag a bit. This quarter it does feel like you rounded up 2% organic growth in the quarter. So does it
make sense to drop all of these marketing efficiencies to the bottom line or should you be reinvesting even more
aggressively?
And then, lastly, maybe related to that, A.G., as you said, it all starts with the consumer, and you guys have been long
known for leading consumer insight capabilities. So what specifically is the consumer telling you that you need to do
better in the market that you are not doing? And maybe you could just talk about that in the context of beauty, for
example. Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: In terms of the marketing, we are perfectly happy to reinvest and are looking for opportunities
to reinvest. And feel that we can do that and continue to become both more effective and more efficient. We are going
through a transformation in this industry that we want to take advantage of, while remaining fully in front of consumers
with our marketing efforts.

And so, we look at things like the reach, the frequency, the targets that we are reaching, the conversion rates on the
messaging. And that's much more important than actual dollars spent, given what's happened in that industry. But you
should not mistake this for a second as lack of willingness to invest behind smart ideas to build the top line.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Yeah, we are maintaining or increasing our investment in marketing that works and we are
driving for savings, and frankly, non-working dollars or other efficiencies that you get from the move to more digital,
you know, mobile, social, et cetera.
Hey, on the consumer insight side, that is the focus, the sole focus of a lot of people in this organization and, again, I
think we had a lot of activity going on, and we weren't relentless about digging, digging, digging for shopper insights
and consumer insights. You know, very simple thing, the mind-set at Gillette was to test the new system with system
users. You sort of slap yourself in the forehead and say, well, wait a second, everybody grooms. Some people do a
clean shave. Some people do a sculptured groom in the face. Some people body groom. Let's, first of all, understand
what the job to be done is, and then second of all, let's make sure we are putting together instruments, okay, and
experiences that meet all the needs. So, I mean, we are going to sell an opening price point disposable razor from
Gillette at, I don't know, $2 to $3 and we will take you all the way up to $200 to $300 if you want to buy an Art of
Shaving product or a top of the line Braun product.
Specifically regarding beauty, look, here's the headline on beauty. In terms of value creation, they were one of better
performing sectors this last year, unfortunately, it was a little unbalanced. Too much of the value creation came from
cash and profit improvement, although I'll take it and there's a lot more there.
Secondly, the progress we are making, okay, the Old Spices and Safeguards some of the hair care hair brands. We had
– we showed some real progress on Pantene in a lot of important countries around the world, still not the progress I
would like in the U.S. We had a little bit of share pick up in the first quarter, which excited some of our competitors
and turned into a second quarter that was heavily promoted, but at any rate, we will get through that. Pantene is
growing very strongly in important places like Brazil, was growing in sequentially in China, it's growing in a lot of
developed and emerging markets, and I can see the product programs starting to come. Head and Shoulders has just
gone from strength to strength. Herbal is growing again. Vidal is growing again in key markets, so I think that's going
to come.
And then before the year was out, even on Olay, which is still struggling, we have some real encouragement in a couple
of places. We had two of the top five new facial cleanser products, two of the top five new facial moisturizer products,
and this line called Luminous is actually driving a little bit of share growth in the past couple of months.
So the bigger point, okay, the bigger point is the one you made, which is everything begins with shopper understanding
and consumer understanding, and when we have it and understand it, that informs importantly and allows us to do a
much better job with our brand idea and our product pipeline and portfolio.
Jon R. Moeller
