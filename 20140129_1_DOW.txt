three.
I will now hand the call over to Andrew.
Andrew N. Liveris
Thank you, Doug, and just turn to slide four. Thank you. One year ago, we outlined our proactive plans to improve
return on capital, grow profitability and generate cash. We said we would take specific actions to release more value to
you, our shareholders and, as you have noticed in prior quarters, we have been steadfast in our execution throughout the
year. Our fourth quarter and full year results reflect the cumulative benefit of this focus.
Here are the headlines in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were up 97%. We achieved adjusted sales increases
in all operating segments, excluding Feedstocks and Energy, with record performance in Agricultural Sciences,
Coatings and Infrastructure, and Performance Plastics. EBITDA grew 31% and we delivered a 300 basis point
expansion in EBITDA margins, led by Performance Plastics, Performance Materials, and Coatings and Infrastructure
Solutions. And we drove a number of proactive portfolio and balance sheet focused actions that enabled us to exit 2013
with strength and momentum, which brings me to the full year.
Adjusted earnings per share grew 31% and adjusted EBITDA rose $900 million, reaching $8.4 billion. Importantly, we
delivered on our self-help actions and exceeded our goal to deliver $500 million of EBITDA through cost savings.
Cash generation was a key narrative for us this year. We ended 2013 with a record level cash from operations, with and
without the benefit of the K-Dow award, and we used this cash as we said we would: to reduce debt, invest in organic
growth programs and reward shareholders. Today, net debt to EBITDA stands at 1.4 times, well below our 10-year
average, and we delivered $1.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and declared dividends.
In sum, our cash flow is at an all-time high, our debt ratios are well below the historical company average and, looking
forward, our board has full confidence in our earnings capability and cash flow, leading to today's announcement of a
15% dividend increase and an expansion of our share repurchase program to $4.5 billion with more than $4 billion yet
available, all to be executed in 2014.
Fundamentally, these results are a reflection of the strategy we embarked upon several years ago and the specific
actions we have taken, and continue to take in line with that strategy, repositioning our company to address the
uncertainty and new realities that are defining our world. Our company is strong with a very focused and integrated
portfolio arising an increasingly growing earnings profile and tremendous financial flexibility.
Now, let me turn the call over to Bill, who will provide more detail on the fourth quarter and full year results.
William H. Weideman
Thank you, Andrew. Turning to slide six, Dow reported earnings of $0.79 per share or $0.65 per share excluding
certain items. Sales increased to $14.4 billion, up 3% or 4% on an adjusted basis. This is primarily due to volume gains
of 3% with increases across all operating segments excluding Feedstocks and Energy as well as all geographic areas
excluding Europe, Middle East and Africa. Price also rose 1%. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.1 billion in the quarter, a
31% increase versus the same quarter last year. We had favorable certain items at $0.14 per share in the quarter with a
gain in our sale of our Polypropylene Licensing and Catalysts business being the most notable.
Now, moving to slide seven where you see the key drivers of our results this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, demand
was healthy in the quarter and buying activity remains steady throughout December. As a result, we are able to expand

margins in a rising hydrocarbon environment as well as grow volume in nearly all regions. Equity earnings grew
year-over-year driven by strengthening global ethylene fundamentals in Thailand – in both our Thailand and Kuwait
joint ventures as well as improvements in Dow Corning. In the cost focus, we've been driving throughout the year,
gained further traction in the fourth quarter. We surpassed our year-end target on site shutdowns, workforce reductions
and discretionary spending, all of which enabled us to exceed our $500 million cost reduction target for the year.
Now, turning to our operating segments starting on slide eight. In Electronic and Functional Materials sales were up 3%
with healthy gains in Asia Pacific and North America, which offset a 1% price decline. Continued demand in OLED
materials, an interconnect technology used in mobile devices drove volume increases in Electronic Materials.
Functional Materials delivered broad-based sales gains in all businesses and geographies, led by a 9% increase in North
America. Electronic and Functional Materials' EBITDA was up $15 million versus prior year. Sales increased 10% in
Coatings and Infrastructure Solutions year-over-year.
Dow Coating Materials delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of sales growth. Strong demand in architectural and
industrial coating markets drove both price and volume gains in the quarter. Performance monomers also delivered
double-digit sales growth in all regions and businesses.
Building construction reported higher sales with volume increases in all geographic areas. Segment EBITDA increased
$44 million, which represents a 34% increase versus the same quarter last year.
Now turning to Agricultural Sciences, which reported fourth quarter sales record of $1.8 billion, up 13% versus the
same period last year. Sales gains were broad-based across all geographies, led by double-digit growth in the Americas.
Crop protection rose 11% with new crop protection products increasing 23% and sales in Seeds, Traits and Oils were
up 20%. Agricultural Sciences achieved record EBITDA in the quarter, up 13% versus the prior year. Performance
Materials sales were up 1% versus year-ago period. Sales growth in Dow Oil, Gas and Mining, Dow Automotive
Systems and Polyglycols, Surfactants and Fluids more than offset volume declines in epoxy where we continue to see
challenging industry dynamics. Adjusted EBITDA increased $144 million or 450 basis points versus the same quarter
last year, driven by expanded margins and ongoing productivity improvements.
Sales in Performance Plastics were $3.9 billion, up 5% in the same quarter last year and up 8% excluding the impact of
divestitures. Double-digit sales gains were achieved in Latin America, Asia Pacific and North America. Dow
Packaging and Specialty Plastics delivered increased sales in specialty packaging and hygiene and medical markets.
Dow elastomers delivered record fourth quarter sales driven by increased demand in transportation, carton sealing and
non-woven market sectors. Adjusted EBITDA was up 40% from the same period last year as broad-based pricing
across all geographies more than offset the impact of higher propane costs in the U.S.
In Feedstock/Energy, sales were $2.4 billion, down 6% versus the prior quarter. Volume was flat while price declined
6%, driven by lower aromatic prices within hydrocarbons.
Now turning to slide 11. At the beginning of the year, we outlined a clear path to accelerate our cost reduction and cash
flow actions. And as Andrew mentioned earlier, we have remained focused on prioritizing our gross spending, further
reducing spending in our low ROC businesses and actively managing our portfolio, all with the goal to increase
shareholder value and our actions have delivered strong results.
We generated $7.8 billion of cash from operations in 2013. We reduced gross debt by $3 billion and interest expense is
down nearly $170 million versus last year. Our net debt to total cap declined to 30% and our net debt to EBITDA
declined to 1.4, well below the company's historical average.
And going forward, the cash generation from our embedded catalysts and divestiture targets position us very well to
execute against our cash priorities.
Before I turn it back to Andrew, let me walk you through our key financial assumptions for 2014. While there are signs
of improving economic conditions, our business plans assume that the 2014 macroeconomic environment remain
largely unchanged. As Sadara approaches startup, our share of operating costs, which will be recorded in equity
earnings, will increase approximately $50 million to $100 million. And we expect the additional – to receive an

additional $150 million to $200 million benefit from our previously announced cost reduction actions.
Due to increasing discount rates, our pension expense will decline approximately $300 million this year. And capital
expenditures will increase between $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion as we accelerate actions to enhance our feedstock
advantage from our U.S. Gulf Coast investments.
From a tax perspective, we anticipate our tax rate will remain in the 25% to 29% range. And finally, you should expect
our share count to decline as we accelerate our share repurchase.
Now, let me talk a little bit about the first quarter. We expect to see a normal seasonal uptick in Agricultural Sciences,
as farmers make purchases for the upcoming Northern Hemisphere planting season. And we anticipate good market
fundamentals to continue in Performance Plastics with healthy levels of demand supporting price increases and strong
earnings.
However, with the recent run-up in hydrocarbon costs, driven by the cold weather, we expect overall hydrocarbon
energy cost will rise approximately $250 million to $300 million sequentially, which will put pressure on margins in
both Performance Plastics and Performance Materials. And finally, we expect planned turnaround spending to be up
approximately $80 million sequentially.
And now, let me turn it back over to Andrew.
Andrew N. Liveris
Thank you, Bill. If you turn to slide 14, one year ago when we provided you with our report out of 2012, we committed
that we would proactively take decisive self-help actions to protect our growth plan and accelerate near-term value in a
slow growth world, and that is exactly what you saw from us in 2013. Collectively, our actions led to strong
performance in 2013: substantial earnings growth with top line gains, margin expansion and improving return on
capital in key segments, record level cash flow above and beyond the infusion of cash we received from the K-Dow
arbitration outcome, all of which enabled us to further pay down debt, fund highly accretive growth investments and
return increasing value to our shareholders.
Turning to slide 15, and as you know, over the last several years we have pursued a consistent strategy endorsed and
continually monitored by our board; transforming from a commodity chemicals and plastics producer of specification
products into an integrated, low-cost and value-add producer of agricultural materials and plastics products with patent
protection and high-value to end-users, all with the goal to deliver higher and more consistent earnings. In line with this
strategy, we have taken a number of consistent aggressive actions since 2006, both in the upstream low cost assets and
the downstream value-add businesses, to reshape and position our company for consistent long-term earnings growth.
We rebuilt our innovation pipeline. We accelerated the establishment of our portfolio towards downstream,
high-margin businesses. We strengthened the unique benefit of integration within our key value chains. We drove down
our cost structure and further tightened our capital allocation criteria in a slow growth world. And critically, we reduced
our commodity footprint with an endgame to fundamentally exit all commodity merchants sales, not because these
were a bad set of businesses, only because the return to these businesses were challenged by global competition
especially from state-owned entities and national oil companies.
Throughout this process and with deliberate and strategic moves and full transparency, we have regularly
check-pointed with our board, tracking our milestones and continually examining strategic options throughout the
volatile landscape that has included the world's largest global economic crisis and a subsequent lackluster recovery.
This transparency – this accountability demonstrates our commitment to continually challenge all aspects of our
operations and execute portfolio moves to upgrade our earnings profile to become more consistent and less exposed to
commodity cycles in our industry. This led us to the seminal decision we announced in December, exiting a value chain
that has been part of a Dow's history since the company's inception more than 100 years ago. We decided we would
take on the complex task of exiting commodity chlorine products and focus on our downstream value-add businesses.
We determined we would do so carefully to avoid negative synergies and redirect the funds we released for higher

value uses in the growth portfolio of the company.
The fact that we have announced the carve-out of and our pursuing transaction options for our chlorine value chain is
clear evidence that when it comes to creating shareholder value, everything is on the table and we are constantly
examining options for how to create maximum value for our shareholders without creating significant friction costs or
sacrificing Dow's long-term growth potential.
If you turn to slide 16, as a result of these strategic actions, we have completely re-crafted our portfolio, demonstrated
by the significant remake of both our revenue and geographic mix as well as the overall quality of our mid-cycle
margins. After the divestments of chlorine and related commodities, we, in essence, have taken a $49 billion
commodity driven enterprise circa 2006, shrunk it by divesting $14 billion to $15 billion of commodities, some of
which are in motion and grew it with $18 billion of value-added products, all in less than a decade. And this does not
even take into account the joint ventures we have formed, particularly in our commodity chains.
So this re-crafting did not happen overnight and it is testament to the fact that we have not and will not shy away from
aggressive options to exit complex portions of our portfolio, where and when it provides the best value creating option
for our shareholders. Exiting commodity products that Dow has been in for decades such as styrenics and
polypropylene or joint venturing where that was the better option such as in ethylene glycol is proof point of our
willingness to do that. In fact, the portfolio decisions we have made these last many years have been driven by our
commitment to increase return on capital and had been grounded by a comprehensive analysis of the markets we serve
and our competitive position in these value chains from low-cost inputs in feedstocks to technology advantage products
in the end use. In short, we understand where value is created and what needs to be done to upgrade our earnings.
Turn to slide 17. Today, the vast majority of our portfolio resides in high-margin, high-growth sectors and we are
further capitalizing on our attractive and industry-leading positions in these less cyclical sectors. Further, our integrated
value chain is aligned directly to these markets with a unique intersection of competitive cost positions, market
leadership and technology differentiation enables us to win. Our unrelenting focus on growth markets and our
leadership in those markets, it is this combination that makes us unique. We have the scale, the low-cost feedstocks and
the differentiated technology to succeed across the value chains.
We are not a petrochemical company that takes oil and gas and makes first derivative commodities and sells those into
a merchant market. We don't try to compete with integrated oil and gas petrochemical producers. We buy hydrocarbons
or joint venture with national oil companies and then we add value to these feedstocks with technology to make them
patent-protected into the end use products. Our unrelenting focus on growth markets and our ability to win in those
markets as a differentiated provider of low-cost and technology advantaged products are the strategic parameters that
drive our portfolio decisions.
Importantly, we have been clear, consistent and transparent regarding our commitments and actions in optimizing our
portfolio to release new value. With the majority of our integrated portfolio aligned to growth sectors, today, we are
focusing our resources and investment decisions on these high-return sectors. And we have actions underway for each
of our segments, actions designed to increase margins and deliver near-term earnings growth.
So turning to slide 18 and going through those sectors, Electronics and Functional Materials to AgroSciences and
Performance Plastics are high return businesses aligned to attractive high-growth markets where science capabilities are
rewarded in the marketplace. And here, we will continue to invest for strategic growth. In Electronic and Functional
Materials, we expect to see growth on the back of our industry-leading position and our robust innovation pipeline.
We expect to grow above market by working closely with our customers to leverage our advantaged technologies,
enabling next-generation products such as lighter, brighter and more efficient electronics, healthier foods and more
effective pharmaceuticals.
Dow's unique set of chemistries, such as in polyurethanes and other polymers, are a source of differentiation versus
smaller standalone competitors. And as our portfolio continues to shift to higher growth sectors, we expect to increase
margins 100 basis points to 150 basis points over the next several years.

In Agricultural Sciences, our differentiated technology positions us well in this $100 billion growth market to continue
outperforming the industry with top line growth and expand margins with the commercialization of our powerful R&D
pipeline.
In our crop protection business, the ramp-up of our high-margin new product sales, which grew 14% in 2013, will
contribute to segment margin expansion. And in our $1.6 billion Seeds, Traits and Oils franchise, farmer demand for
solutions that maximize yield and productivity is driving faster than industry sales growth leading to scale efficiencies
and improved segment margins.
Our innovation pipeline is rich with products that will deliver continuous growth, such as our Enlist weed control
system, which combines the technologies and expertise of both our crop protections and seeds businesses and recently
accomplished an important next step in the USDA review process. This product launch, more than any other, shows the
power of synergy between chemistry and biology, unique to Dow AgroSciences being part of a chemical company. In
fact, as we commercialize our overall Dow AgroSciences pipeline, we expect to expand margins 300 basis points to
400 basis points in the near-term, en route to doubling the value of this franchise again over the next five years to seven
years.
Turning to Performance Plastics, we have reshaped this portfolio extensively by exiting commodity value chains such
as styrenics, polypropylene and polycarbonate and aligning ourselves with attractive high-growth market sectors that
value technology-driven solutions such as packaging, transportation and telecommunications using our unique resins.
For example, in our packaging business, we are collaborating throughout the value chain to deliver innovative,
high-performing materials such as more convenient, functional and sustainable packaging.
Our ability to deliver consistently strong returns based on this market-driven participation strategy is clearly illustrated
by the businesses superior return on capital performance over the cycle, which is well above industry averages.
Coupling our brand owner engagement with our low-cost integration advantage and strategic investments on the U.S.
Gulf Coast and our Sadara joint venture, we are well-positioned to further strengthen our position in the value chain
delivering higher and more consistent returns.
Turning to slide 19, we also have businesses where we've been very clear that the return on capital has not met our
expectations. And yet, these businesses have strong underlying competitive advantages and are aligned to markets
where gradual improvement is underway, such as in construction and transportation. Through targeted cost and
portfolio actions, these sectors will deliver significant margin improvement in the near-term.
Case in point, our Coatings and Infrastructure Solutions segment. Here, we are utilizing self-help actions, strategic
investments and targeted innovation to reposition the segment for growth. We are focusing our attention and resources
on projects with strong near-term payback potential, investing in the water market and investing in driving
differentiation in coatings where our portfolio improves hiding properties, stain resistance and washability. These new
products are gaining traction as construction dynamics begin to demonstrate signs of improvement and our PDH
integration investment to reduce raw material costs is another example of low-cost feedstocks adding value through
downstream differentiation. When coupled with our cost actions and improved asset utilization, we see margin
expansion of more than 300 basis points in the near-term.
Turning to Performance Materials where we are driving similar cost discipline actions and raw material improvements,
in addition to an aggressive portfolio management strategy. In the near-term, our announced cost actions will drive
operational efficiencies and our PDH and Sadara investments will also benefit this segment. Collectively, these actions
will expand margins by approximately 400 basis points over the next several years. Aligned to our long-term strategic
priorities, we are moving out of the commoditizing portions of the chlorine value chain such as chlorinated organics
and epoxy resins, both part of Performance Materials and focusing on the high-value parts of the segment such as
automotive, energy, food and pharma and finally, the Feedstocks and Energy where the strategy is simple, optimize our
assets to ensure maximum profitability and provide advantage feedstocks for our downstream businesses.
Turning to slide 20, all of these actions are driven by our strategy and our perseverance to build a portfolio that is not
only resilient but it's positioned to deliver sustainable high margin growth. And therefore, we continually reshape and

re-examine selecting into attractive high-growth markets where our technology differentiation is rewarded while
simultaneously exiting commoditizing value chains that no longer align with our long-term strategic priorities such as
our announcement to exit a significant portion of the chlorine value chain. We maximize the value of our investments
through prioritizing high return integration projects that bolster our upstream competitive advantage and drive further
differentiation of our downstream businesses through our innovation pipeline, and we drive a strict focus on operational
and financial productivity, selectively allocating our capital and expense dollars while driving operational excellence to
improve cash flow.
Underpinning all of these actions is our strict focus on return on capital. You have seen us be proactive and decisive in
our actions over these last 12 months resulting in an improvement of 150 basis points in one year in our return on
capital. Going forward, we will continue to explore all strategic options to further advance our agenda of delivering
sustainable high margin growth.
On slide 21, you can see our earnings trajectory where, with the ongoing execution of our strategic agenda and our
capital management strategy, we have a number of earnings catalysts in-flight and 2014 will be an important inflection
year in our growth strategy.
On slide 22, a combination of self-help measures, strategic integration and growth projects will total more than $3
billion of EBITDA in the near-term. These alone bridge us to the more than $10 billion of EBITDA target. In addition
to these lower pension costs, higher operating rate leverage due to GDP improvement and any upside in the ethylene
cycle plus a strict focus on driving productivity will move us to the next level of earnings power. Let me be clear. 2014
will be a capital-intensive year for Dow. Our key bridge year as we reach critical milestones in our key growth projects
particularly those of the U.S. Gulf Coast and at Sadara. However, our teams are steadfast in their commitment to
deliver on schedule and on budget enabling us to unlock significant shareholder value once these highly accretive
projects come on line. We expect 2014 to be a year of strong operating cash flow and we will deploy a great deal of this
cash to fund our higher CapEx build due to the U.S. Gulf Coast projects in particular.
Turning to slide 23, but for overall uses of cash, I want to be very clear. We know our priorities. Our actions over these
last many quarters have enabled us to reach debt levels well below the company's historical average. Therefore, moving
forward, you should expect we will focus our cash on the organic growth projects I previously discussed which will
enable us to deliver higher margin growth in our segment. And with these Dow specific catalysts fully in place to create
step-change improvement in EBITDA and record cash flow from operations, we are now in a position to increasingly
reward our shareholders as witnessed by today's announcement, to increase the dividend 15% and an expansion of our
share repurchase program to $4.5 billion with more than $4 billion yet available all to be deployed this year. This is a
clear illustration of our unwavering commitment to shareholder remuneration that will continue even after these
announcements.
So going through the agenda on slide 24, I want to turn to the priorities for 2014 on slide 25, where you can expect the
same diligence and focus. We will maintain our operational discipline and strong cash flow, drive productivity gains to
build on our cost savings momentum, continually refine our portfolio aligned to our targeted market strategy and
continually focus our portfolio by growing the high-margin value chains and pruning from the bottom using ROC as a
lens. Dow is a world-class company. Our enterprise is 117 years strong because the women and men of Dow have
unique expertise of running complex value chains. This collective rich experience provides the insights from which to
draw to identify and drive the most attractive shareholder friendly actions.
Our management team regularly engages with all of our owners whether recent owners or long-term holders so as to
understand their views and see if there are better ideas out there. We run a complex, highly integrated enterprise and we
believe we know how to exit the low return highly volatile businesses while funding our growth. We share with our
owners one goal: to maximize value through all of these levers. We are confident that our financial discipline, cost
savings actions and active portfolio management position us well to deliver against our commitments for long-term
success and continued an ongoing shareholders remuneration. We are exiting commodity businesses for value, we're
deploying funds to grow our integrated value chains, and we will increasingly remunerate our shareholders.
And with that, Doug, let's turnover to Q&A.

<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: Obviously, extreme volatility in terms of NGL prices. What is your view about sort of these
recent spikes we've seen in propane and ethane in particular?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, yes, and welcome to the polar vortex, I guess, Hassan. We're in the middle of it here
in Midland, Michigan, I can tell you that. So weather-driven, this is obviously going through a spike. This is a very,
very odd winter in extremities, and I think this has caused a few of these fractionation facilities, extraction facilities to
shut down and curtail supply of NGLs and at the same time, demand is peaking because of the cold weather. We
believe that this will be a spike that will subside and based on the huge oversupply of NGLs that is coming on, this will
be an oversupply year in NGLs. So we consider it transitory. As Bill said in his modeling point, it'll create some
pressure in the first quarter, but we've got all our cost levers in place and we're going to blow right through it.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: Fair enough. On a separate note, Andrew, you obviously talked about some of the growth
levers that are out there, and part and parcel with that is Sadara, the PDH facility and the like. Could you comment a bit
on whether they're on schedule, on budget and the like?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: On schedule, on budget and we – I just was in Saudi Arabia last week and we've had
exceptional reviews. As you know, with Sadara, I'm honing in on Sadara because that's the one that's here and now. It's
roughly 35%, 40% complete in terms of construction. It's a sight to behold, Hassan, and we've got an Investor Meeting
in March. We invite everyone to come that can make it through Doug May. He'll get that organized. Saudi Aramco and
Dow are going to host a visit to the site and we're going to show you 40,000 people on that site growing to a peak of
60,000.
So it'll be on budget, on schedule, is a phenomenal achievement. We're very proud of them and their safety record, in
particular, as well as of course their financial record so far. A complex project that will begin operations next year is
going to result in that year being the year that you'll start seeing positive. We'll have headwind this year, as Bill said,
but we'll have tailwinds next year out of the earnings stream of that project. And within – the ethylene envelope is one
of the first envelopes that will start up there, which is powerful because that'll time nicely for the cycle that we
anticipate to begin next year.
U.S. Gulf Coast up – we're up to speed. PDH is the lead unit there. Of course, the incremental expansions of St. Charles
up and running, doing great, over achieving. LA-3 in Plaquemine, we're going to add another $250 million of
incremental EBITDA. That will be on stream in 2015, PDH on stream in 2015. The big second wave, which is the big
[indiscernible] (36:12) cracker is still slated for 2017 startup.

Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Morning.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Andrew, one of your newest investors is arguing that your pet chem businesses are under
earning due to your focus on your downstream businesses, resulting in some poor efficiencies. How do you respond to
those critiques?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, in the earnings script, as you heard me talk through who we are and who we're not,
it's really easy to talk about pet chem and specialty chem and commodity chem. But we, at Dow, look at value chains
and we look at ethane to ethylene to polyethylene resins of the solution resin kind that provide high-end uses for
packaging and elastomers and automotive and wire and cable and telecommunications. We are a complete value chain
and we're number one across that chain. It is honestly impossible to think of Dow as a petrochemical company anymore
because we've exited over $10 billion of commodities. Lots of the K-Dow scope is now sold. We've actually done the
divestment of what might have been called a pet chem business, the traditional commodity businesses.
The results speak for themselves in our strategy. Our value chain between NGLs, ethylene, our specific high-value
plastic resins, these are high-value. There's only one other competitor out there with these high-value resins and they're
a big integrated oil company and they love their business as much as we do. No one else can mimic this Dow business.
And so it's a misnomer to start talking about pet chems. We think the performance is great. It's doing – it's got – we
agree, by the way, with that statement from that investor that there's upside. We are going to release all the upside by
the investments we're doing, like the one that Hassan asked about. Plus, we're building up our innovation engine. More
than half the profits that are coming out of that chain come from innovation, not from low cost feedstocks. So there's a
lot of clarity that I think that letter speaks to that we need to provide and we will do that.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: And just lastly, Performance Materials strong Q4. How much of that's sustainable into
2014?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: So the polar vortex to one side in this big spike that we're all seeing as an aberration and
hopefully not repeatable. Q1 is going to be a bit challenged. But look, I said in the script that there is a lot of cost focus
and productivity focus. Joe Harlan and his team are right on it. We are taking down costs. We are growing the growers.
We're seeing good demand in things like polyglycol, surfactants, for example, that was mentioned on the call. And
we're doing great in polyurethanes again because we've taken out costs and we're starting to see expanded margins.
There's the beginning of tailwinds; tailwinds in the economy. We don't talk much about that, but the quarter showed
some tailwinds, especially here in the U.S. That is helping polyurethanes, in particular, and there's some – a bit of price
momentum as a result. We're very confident that they'll have a good year this year on top of the good finish to the year
last year.

Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Mr. Roberts, your line is open.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Morning. Can you hear me now?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Hi, John.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Dow has a number of commodity JVs that are largely merchant sales. Are those due to the
hedge? Or should we view them like the consolidated strategy of exiting commodity merchant sales over time?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: More the latter, John. Because they're joint ventures, they definitely are more complex as a
result. We entered them, some of them, at a time and a place when we were a commodity petrochemical company, to

the previous question. We are no longer a commodity petrochemical company and as a consequence of that, you could
consider we love these assets. They're making great financial returns, particularly now at the commodity cycle but
they're volatile, and the volatility in our earnings over time is something that, as you know, we're trying to shed because
we have higher ROC uses, especially in the 100% owned plastics business I just described in the previous question.
So we're going to continue to run those to optimize value, maximize value. We obviously have to work with our
partners who we – across those chains we have great partners from Siam Cement to the Kuwait partners, to the
Argentinian partners. But over time, you can consider that we would look at those as options. As I said earlier today,
we've looked at over 35 options to release value at this company. Our board finalizes strategic review late fall, you've
seen our announcement in December. You can expect more. We've got lots of outside advisors who advised us on this.
You can expect us to do more over these next 12 months to 18 months than what we've announced.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Now, as a follow-up, how much of the Performance Plastics segment now has advantaged
feedstock, and how much of it is still linked to a NAFTA supply chain?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, the number I prefer to give you is once the Texas cracker is up and running, it'll be
about – greater than 70% will be advantaged. And that's a global number.

Our next question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Thanks very much. Just wanted to clarify one item with Bill. I think you said, Sadara would
hit you for $50 million to $100 million, but your equity earnings would be flat. Should we imply then there's some
uptick cyclically in polyethylene, ethylene glycol, et cetera, that gets offset by the Sadara costs?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Bob, yes, exactly. So we believe we'll continue to see improving equity earnings in
those other companies including Dow Corning. So overall, for 2014, we expect our equity earnings to remain in the $1
billion level – at a company level.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: And, Andrew, I think you address the margin situation of Performance Materials. What has to
happen to finally see a little volume improvement? It seems like some of those end markets you serve are growing, so
why haven't we seen any traction at the volume line?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, I mean look, the demand picture, remember, these are very consumer exposed, Bob,
and so the demand picture in things like furniture and bedding and even the strong rebound of automotive, that's only a
small percent of the polyurethanes in the U.S. for us. These are rigid polyurethanes that go to automotive. We are
mostly in the flex and that's historically been a great position for us but it's very consumer-led and that's not stuff
consumers have been buying for all the reasons you know. And so that's a big chunk of Performance Materials today.
Now, as we do the investments in Sadaras, we do the investments in PDH, we go down low on the cost curve, we don't
need price to expand margin, but it would be nice to have price if there's consumer-led demand, which is what I said we
started to see in the quarter. It's going to make it for a better year to your – the earlier question.
But between the PU part of that group and the specialty chemical part which is doing great, it offsets the other down
drop that's in that group which is epoxy. Epoxy as we've now said for three earnings calls is the problem child, we're
solving for it the way we've announced. But the PU side is beginning its rebound and it doesn't have to be just the
carve-out strategy, it can be a demand-led price increase strategy as the economy rebounds especially in flex polyols.

pretty different in that your Performance Materials were, call it, up a little bit more than $100 million from your core
operations and your Performance Plastics and EBITDA were up maybe $250 million. Can you talk about what actually
happened sequentially to really lift those returns so sharply? And why this year was different from previous years?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: The two things, very simply, Jeff, that we've actually answered now the quarter was a
stunning quarter not because it was a surprise to us, because the cost reductions throughout the year took hold across
those value chains especially in Performance Materials and the beginnings of tailwinds of demand especially help
Performance Materials. Performance Plastics has been running pretty snug. Our Performance Plastics has been really
running pretty snug all year but they've had terrible margins in Europe and Asia because of all the weak demand that's
in those two continents. The U.S. business has been doing great but the beginning of price movements in those
businesses as the entire industry, we have price up 7% year-on-year in the quarter in Performance Plastics, up 3% over
Q3. That's a big indicator of – in answering your question...
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Sure.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: ...of demand growth beyond the U.S.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: And then lastly, your CapEx for 2014, I think you've said is $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion. Is
that an unusual bump-up? Or with the many new capacity additions that you have coming on over the next several
years, are we now in a $3 billion to $3.5 billion range?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Yeah, Jeff, this is Bill. That's very much in line with what we had indicated earlier. We
had mentioned to you that our Gulf Coast project is roughly $4 billion spread over three to four years. So we have said
that our CapEx spending would increase roughly $1 billion per year. So if you take this year where we ended up at $2.3
billion, if I recall, add $1 billion and you're in that $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion so no, very much in line with our
expectation. And then we'll kind of stay at that level for a couple years and then it will drop off. It'll start to drop off
after the PDH unit and then further obviously after the cracker but very much in line with our previous input.

Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Hi, Kevin.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Andrew, Dow AgroSciences continues to perform well. You indicated margin ramp
potential of 300 basis points to 400 basis points there and a potential to double the value over five to seven years.
Would you consider separating that business if you became convinced that Dow could be remunerated for that future
growth potential in today's market?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, so – thanks, Kevin, for the question. Exactly the numbers I used on the call and
something that I've been asked about for the better part of seven or eight years and so there's a consistency to the notion
that a biology driven business with a higher multiple that's more biotech indicated could have a different valuation than
the Dow some of the parts valuation. Our data doesn't suggest that for our business right now because it's mostly a
chemistry-driven business. Crop protection is by far the biggest part of Dow AgroSciences. So there's a couple of our
competitors out there that are more lookalikes to us, BASF, Bayer, a more chemistry-driven businesses. We do have, as
you know, a substantial investment in biology but it's chemistry-related biology. So in essence, Enlist is a great
example that the weed control system we've obviously talked a lot about.
So there's a lot of leverage that's going on between Dow's chemistry expertise where we have world-class capabilities
as a company and what Dow AgroSciences actually launches. In fact, most of their launches over these last several
years have been in ag chemicals and crop protection, not in just new seeds and traits. Obviously, by growing SmartStax
and growing Enlist, it does start to create new value in Seeds, Traits and Oils and the breakeven year for that is next
year, 2015. And we believe once Seeds, Traits and Oils gets to a breakeven year, then we could start looking at Seeds,

Traits and Oils a little more standalone than its relationship to ag chemicals.
But I want you to think about it Dow AgroSciences is two businesses, one very linked to Dow and one linked to the
other business at Dow AgroScience, chemistry, but it's biology and chemistry intersections that we exploit at Dow
AgroSciences. We will look at all options though, with better offer always applies and I've used it on the call. I've used
in every earnings call I've ever had. I've used it in every shareholder interaction. If someone comes up and gives us an
offer we can't refuse, we will definitely look at it.

Our next question comes from Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investment.
<Q - Peter E. Butler>: Yeah, good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning, Peter.
<A - William H. Weideman>: Good morning, Peter.
<Q - Peter E. Butler>: How have the economic and government-related uncertainties impacted your prior view on the
ethylene supply outlook? And what are the prospects now for ramp up in the cycle? And related to that, when do you
see the liquid-based ethylene around the world getting into the shorter zone?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Thank you, Peter, for your question. We believe that the economic recovery although not
great in the last several years has kept the view towards the cycle and being in the 2014, 2015, 2016 timeframe. We
pushed out that to late 2014 into 2015 because of weak demand especially out of China. You mentioned the
liquids-based. The Southeast Asian, Asian crackers have been under incredible pressure as of the Europeans and the
consequence of that has meant that demand has been weak and they've been under margin pressure and the only thing
that's going to save them, of course, is price increases because they can't do much on the cost side.
We believe the U.S. will lead this cycle. We're seeing signs of traction now. We're getting up into the high 80%s. We
feel this year will be somewhere around 89%, maybe as much as 90% for the entire industry operating rate. That's a
global number. And as a consequence of that, I think you're going to see maximum operating rates for these next
several years and so the liquids cracker should start expanding margins next year.
<Q - Peter E. Butler>: Does Dow have a wag on how a possible 2015, 2016 ethylene peak might compare to previous
peaks? For instance, it looks like in this cycle, uniquely, you could have a situation where product prices go up a lot,
but raw material costs actually go down?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, well, that's the U.S. advantage. There's no question shale has brought a complete
different view to profitability in this peak cycle in ethylene-related products, not just plastics but also ethylene glycol.
Our plastics business, the way we've configured it, as I said, half of the profits are coming from value-add downstream,
half are coming from the upstream integration. The part that's going to go up of course in a very big way in a cycle is
the upstream ethylene margins. We believe that our plastics business will go north of $5 billion of EBITDA in the next
year or so as a result of what we could see based on your question because of low NGLs in the U.S. super cycle like the
late 1980s.

<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: No. We have our own pipeline and storage capacity. We're in good shape. We, obviously,
were tracking that but no, to answer you quickly.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Okay. Thank you. And then as a follow-up separately on Enlist, I know in the U.S., you have
DuPont licensed it, Monsanto's licensed it, but down in Brazil. How do you plan on commercializing Enlist and
soybeans? And I guess what do you think the first stack will be? Are you going to stack it with Roundup Ready 2 or
how's that going to work?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, we have obviously our Enlist soybeans license with DuPont, which is global. We
believe that's particularly valuable in Latin America where Dow chem. does not enjoy the same registrations and
widespread use of 24D. So that's going to be one way to monetize to your point on Latin America. We also really
believe that as a consequence of that Enlist, we will have a great fit in the Latin America market. It's our first year in
soybeans in Argentina. We entered Brazil just two years ago. As you know, we have a strong corn position ourselves in
Latin America. So between our license with DuPont and of course what we're doing with our own market penetration,
we believe that will occur in a very quick timeframe in Latin America and partly as a stack.

Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yeah, hi. Good morning, Andrew.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Morning.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: In the U.S., you run a lot of propane in your crackers because you need propylene for the
specialties. And as you know propane crack is lower than ethylene crack. So how much of your crack today is propane
versus ethylene? And at least in the near-term before PDH starts, what can you do to improve that?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, as you know, we have some of the best flex crackers in the business, EP
cracker-wise. We're doing 30% propane about now. As you know, we're running the crackers for cash. We actually can
flex feeds within an hour. That's how fast we can do it. We can do a little more. We've got some projects there. The
biggest one you've heard us announce is the propane to ethane flex for LA-3. LA-3 in Louisiana is a NAFTA cracker,
liquids cracker. So that's a big project that will start up next year. We've been doing our incremental ones, the very
incremental ones. But the 30%, 35% technical minimum is what we need to run at for our downstream products.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Okay. Thank you. And secondly, there's all this talk about commodities and specialties, which has
been going on for years. So when you look at your strategy, many times in some chains you stopped with intermediate
because historically Dow did not want to compete with its customers. And so you ended up with a lot of intermediates.
So is there a change in strategy on how you want to go downstream further? And/or maybe stop there and get rid of
those businesses, the two options. Can you just talk about that?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Very targeted question, P.J., and obviously shows your longevity in the industry. So when
we did Rohm and Haas, one of the key parameters that we used is we'll never be a company that competes with our
customers. We have to be the very best technology provider to people who we consider our customers who touch the
consumers. So coatings is a great example where we could take that one step forward into high value emotions and use
our building blocks that you talked about whether they'd be butanol or whether they'd be acrylic acid, which we didn't
have a lot of until we acquired Rohm and Haas, and then go that one step, but not be a paint company. And so that's
where we stopped. We know our customers prefer our high technology.
Obviously, we'd like to do more exclusive with key customers on key product launches like, for example, the
[indiscernible] (56:21) using the coatings example. Electronic materials is a great end-use market fit from Rohm and
Haas that actually had an R&D synergy with polyurethane chemistry to help make better slurry pads, for example, but
then we've got a lot of other technologies we could lever in through the product materials that we had in our other
businesses. Our water business, the ion exchange resin business that Rohm and Haas had completely complemented our

Rohm and Haas – excuse me, our reverse osmosis business and the two together have created a powerful water
business. But we're not a water provider.
So we are an ingredient and technology and component provider, and that's our strategy. And that's why Rohm and
Haas was such a terrific fit for us in terms of technology and application, and that's what you should think about we're
doing here. We're not trying to be a consumer company. We're trying to be the best functional technology provider
using our low cost building blocks, our integrated value chains, but stopping short of being the company that provides a
consumer.

We'll go next to Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Hi, Frank.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Well, the pressure is really on, Andrew, but first I wanted to start out, obviously, great end to
the year, but more importantly congratulations on the Order of Australia award.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, thank you.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Always nice to see a chemical guy do well. Some discussion this morning on raw materials,
but you'd also described a healthy demand, particularly in the plastics area. So I was wondering about the pace of
pricing to offset this big spike, polar vortex driven spike? And how fast you think you can realize some offsets on the
pricing side? And then, as has been talked about before, record earnings in plastics in this quarter. Can you give us a
sense as to what percent of the earnings came from outside the U.S. in the plastics area this past quarter?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: The second one, I'll get the guys to quickly look up. I don't have it at the top of my head.
But certainly, let me talk about demand, the finish to the quarter and then of the year and the finish, the way we saw
with demand leading to some recovery of the polar vortex led cost increases. As I said, we had a $0.07 increase for
plastics in December, and we have a $0.04 announcement for February, Bill?
<A - William H. Weideman>: I think so.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. So this is the two that, hopefully, on the plastics side based on good demand, will
help overcome. Performance Materials might have a lot more pinch, and so we're going to have to be very aggressive
on the cost side there, but we've got aggressive moves going on in the price but whether they stick or not based on
demand, based on how I answered the earlier question. But you should think about it as condition neutral because of
January, February, and with demand picking up, maybe we'll get some margin expansion in plastics. In terms of how
we feel about the way the dynamics around the world are, you should think about the profit for the quarter in plastics,
70%, 80% coming from the United States and Canada.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Okay, great. That's very helpful. And you're setting high expectations for these conference
calls in terms of breaking news with the dividend and the share buyback this time, but the last quarterly conference call
obviously was the chlorine carve-out. Where do we stand on that? What is the interest level been like? What is your
current thoughts there?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Interest level has been terrific. We're marching down the path. We've got to prepare pro
forma financials. That's not an easy thing to do for something as integrated as chlorine. We've retained outside advisors
for the transactions. We believe that we're on our track. We'd like to complete them on the earlier part of the 12-month
to-24 month timeframe we talked about, but we'll stay with that for now. We have an internal organization. We have,
let's call them, CEO's announcement of the businesses and we have lots of interest. And I would basically like to bridge
to your earlier observation about the calls and what we announced on the last call, what we announced in this call that
dividend increase and that share buyback may have been a little lost in the wash of all things we've been talking about.

That is a significant statement from our board from a series of actions we've been taking through our strategic review
process that shows you our financial flexibility and our cash flow that we generated last year, and the cash flow we
believe we'll be generating these next many years. It's a statement of confidence. It's a statement of belief that we're
undervalued and that we're going to be releasing a lot of value in these next many, many quarters.
And, no, I'm not going to promise you breaking news every quarter, Frank, but I am going to say you can expect a
drumbeat of actions from Dow to liberate cash and reward our shareholders. And that expansion of the share buyback
program is very attractive to the shareholders, proactively manages dilution, and frankly, will hopefully enable in the
conversion of our preferred as we get the ups well for our earnings. Liberating earnings off the balance sheet, being
shareholder friendly and, of course, getting out of low ROC commodity businesses and I guess, Frank, you've served as
a way of a wrap-up here, Doug, thank you for that question.
Doug May

call for the day. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you.
