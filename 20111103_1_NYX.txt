MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2011 NYSE Euronext Earnings Conference Call.
My name is Gary, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be
facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. For the Q&A session, we ask that callers
limit their questions to one to allow for broader participation. I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen
Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at NYSE Euronext. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen C. Davidson

superior to GAAP measures.
For the call today, Duncan Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter, provide you
with an update on NYSE Liffe U.S., comment on the busy regulatory and legislative calendar in U.S. and Europe, and
conclude with an update on the European competition review of our combination with Deutsche Boerse. Michael

your questions.
When we go to the Q&A session, please limit your questions to one to allow for broader participation. We are
incorporating slides for the call today, which are available for viewing on our website and Duncan and Mike will refer
to the slides during their remarks. With that, let me now turn the call over to Duncan.
Duncan L. Niederauer
Thanks, Steven. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining today's call. I'm going to start on slide 3, which is
entitled Third Quarter 2011 Financial Highlights.
We're very pleased to share our third quarter 2011 results with you this morning. This was obviously a strong quarter,
which benefited from strong trading volumes, increasing revenue diversification, disciplined cost control, and strong
capital management. In my mind the primary story of this quarter is that our team made substantive progress towards
our goal of completing the transformational merger with Deutsche Boerse while simultaneously continuing to execute
on our core business strategy.
For the quarter we recorded EPS of $0.71 per share on net revenue of $704 million, up from $0.46 per share on $599
million in net revenue in the third quarter of last year. We're at the highest level of quarterly revenue generations since
the third quarter of 2008. Strong non-volume related revenues increased by $30 million year-over-year reflecting the
continuing benefit of our business diversification efforts.
Turning to our business highlights, in our derivatives segment, we finished our first quarter for the semi-mutualization
of NYSE/AMEX options. Market share in the third quarter for AMEX was 15% and quarter-to-date we are trending
around 16%. So we are very pleased with the development of this venture. We continue to make headway on NYSE
Liffe U.S., which I will address in the next slide. While the market wide decline in open interest after the September
expiration has resulted in a leveling activity, we remain optimistic on Treasury futures and I am pleased with the recent
growth in the MSCI product complex.
In the cash trading and listing segment, we have seen higher volumes and a strong year-over-year performance for
listings where we were number one globally for the third consecutive quarter. Of particular note, we have made good
headway in gaining a higher share of tech IPOs with approximately 50%. While challenging market conditions have
slowed companies coming to market, the pipeline remains strong and diversified and when market conditions improve,
we expect to see a flurry of activity.
Turning to the technology segment, in the third quarter, we completed the integration of Metabit, a leading
Tokyo-based provider of high performance market access products throughout Asia. Metabit is a key component of our
Asia growth strategy going forward. With the positive momentum that we have in our businesses and the compelling
benefits of our merger, we do not believe that these factors are reflected in our current share price. So after today, we
will begin a modest buyback of $100 million that we announced the other day in conjunction with Deutsche Boerse's
€100 million buyback. This buyback should also be a clear signal to our investors that we believe in our business model
and we will use excess cash flows to create value. We are executing this buyback plan on top of an already attractive
stream of dividends that we expect to pay out in conjunction with the merger.
Please turn to slide four. On slide four, we provide you with an update on the future growth drivers of NYSE Liffe U.S.
As I mentioned a minute ago, although we've seen a leveling of activity on the platform in recent weeks due to a post
September role drop off in open interest, we remain positive about the growth prospects for the platform for a couple of
reasons. First, while the marquee products are certainly interest rate futures, we're seeing some nice growth trends in

our MSCI complex since we became the sole platform to trade those products.
As an example, the MSCI emerging markets contract is quickly developing into a benchmark. While admittedly off a
low base, open interest in MSCI is up 50%. Remember, over 3 trillion in assets under management are benchmarked to
MSCI indices globally, so we're quite optimistic about the development of the futures market in this regard.
As far as the interest rate products go, short-term interest rate open interest was down market wide following
September's expiration. We've retained our open interest market share which is roughly 8% in euro-dollar futures and
are starting to see firms come back into the market to rebuild positions that expired in September. There is no question
that the broad market volatility spike of August and September had an impact on NYSE Liffe U.S. volumes, but the
fact that we were able to maintain 3% market share on volume and 8% market share on open interest in such a difficult
market environment, I view as a positive.
We did not suffer, as many have before, the flight to the home market that takes place when markets are challenging
and volatile. Our market share remained stable and our market quality remains excellent.
The key going forward is market quality and liquidity, and we have it. As a result we are looking forward to launching
options on interest rate futures in the first quarter of 2012. Furthermore, we're working to expand the capital
efficiencies that our model affords to include customers in addition to the current clearing member house positions,
which we hope will also go live in early in 2012. Lastly, I would add that our pipeline of new customers remains robust
and we are focused on expanding the breadth of activity over the platform.
Please shift to slide five. Stepping away from the day-to-day business a little bit I want to spend some time on slide
five, as we all know there is a significant amount of attention focused on regulatory and legislative initiatives both here
in the U.S. and on the European side.
Let's start with the U.S. first. In the U.S. a lot of market participants will focus their attention this month on the
bipartisan Congressional Committee formed to address the deficit known in Washington as the Super Committee. The
group must reach a deal by November 23. We and others have been calling on policymakers to address these issues
swiftly, aggressively and in a nonpartisan manner so that it doesn't recreate the kind of market instability that we saw
over the summer.
However, we also believe it is incumbent for the private sector to step up and lead from the front instead of waiting for
perfect clarity and perfect information from the policymakers. We continue to advocate for the Dodd-Frank act
implementing rules that will create transparent, stable, efficient and effectively managed derivatives markets. This will
benefit not only our company but also investors, customers and the markets more broadly. We've also been increasing
our advocacy efforts and using our venue and public platform to advance key messages around job creation and access
to capital for SMEs. All of this has become an important part of our overall community strategy.
A couple of weeks ago we participated in the release of a report by the IPO Task Force done in concert with the
National Venture Capital Association and others. The report recommends tangible ideas for increasing job creation and
driving overall economic growth by improving access to capital for emerging high growth companies. Hang on one
second. It gets me choked up talking about it.
Recently there has been renewed discussion of implementing a financial transactions tax on cash and derivatives trades
in the U.S. We continue to think that implementation of such a tax in the U.S. is unlikely but that hasn't stopped us
from aggressively educating policy makers that a transaction tax actually would be paid for by investors whose
pensions and other investments vehicles would be reduced accordingly.
Let me shift to Europe for a few minutes because I'm sure that's where most of your attention is focused right now.
Regulators over there have been very busy dealing with issues related to market structure and financial regulation. On
October 20, European policy makers published proposals to revise MiFID, initially implemented in Europe in
November of 2007, which was designed to make markets more efficient, resilient and transparent. While MiFID
opened up the equity markets to more competition, it also created fragmentation and unlevel playing fields.

We view MiFID II as an opportunity to address some of these outcomes. We welcome the EU Commission's proposal
for improved trading transparency across a broad range of financial instruments including derivatives. This will align
European regulatory efforts with the respective requirements in the U.S. outlined by the Dodd-Frank act. The timeline
for Council and Parliament processes will not be specified until later in November when working groups of the two
branches are established. We expect the final adoption of MiFID II to take place at the end of 2012, or more likely, into
early 2013.
The European Commission also issued its EMEA proposal in September of 2010 which reflected the G20 mandate
established in September of 2009 which calls for the clearing of standardized OTC derivatives contracts through a CCP
by the end of 2012. The European Council and Parliament are negotiating a final tax which is currently expected to
enter into force as planned at the end of 2012. The European Commission also published a proposal for a financial
transaction tax in Europe. Again as we've stated publicly we are not in favor of any form of transaction tax as we
believe it will be ultimately passed through to the end investors.
Lastly in Europe, as in the U.S., we are pushing a broad platform around access to capital for SMEs; in this regard we
believe our merger can truly be part of the solution. Ultimately a deeper liquidity pool will make it easier for smaller
companies to access capital.
Lastly before I turn it over to Mike, please turn to slide six. On slide six we outlined the European Commission Review
process, the benefits of our combination for all customers and end users and the market. As is customary with a Phase
II merger review we received a Statement of Objections on October 5, which articulated the Commission's remaining
concerns with regard to our proposed combination. In response to the formal Statement of Objections we and Deutsche
Boerse submitted a written rebuttal to DG Competition on October 24 and then participated at our request in an oral
hearing last Thursday and Friday.
In our minds the hearing was an opportunity to broaden the perspectives of people regarding our arguments and to
underline the clear and compelling benefits the merger will provide, and as importantly, gave us a chance to provide
context around some of the arguments made by our various competitors.
Specifically, we demonstrated the competition in our industry is clearly global and that the merger will enhance the
transparency and safety of the markets, as well as facilitating better risk management.
Recent events like MF Global that are unfolding as we speak only reinforce the importance of systemic risk
management. We underscored that we will be creating an integrated and liquid Pan European financial market for
raising capital to the benefit of both SMEs and larger businesses, stimulating job creation and economic development at
a critical time.
We detailed how our derivatives businesses are complimentary and when combined will give Europe an important
counterweight to the established markets – centers in the U.S. with CME, in Asia with Hong Kong and in Latin
America with BM&FBOVESPA. For Europe, this is an opportunity that should not be missed. And we reaffirmed that
our combination will provide a direct benefit to clients at a time when freeing up capital is of critical importance. We
have shown how clients we'll realize capital efficiencies of more than €3 billion and actual cost savings approaching
€100 million. These benefits are unique to this transaction.
The next step in the process will be for the case team and the hearing office to evaluate the information provided to
them at the hearing. We plan to reengage with the case team next week in Brussels and at that point we will have a
better sense of their thinking and how they will approach the remainder of the process. On the back of that, we will then
determine how to work with them to further narrow and address their remaining concerns.
It is important to understand that we entered into this process this past February with the objective of creating value for
both sets of shareholders and as we have gone down this path together, I am more confident than ever of the compelling
industrial logic of the merger. That having been said, as in any deal, at some point the logic of the combination would
not hold together if we are asked to give up too much. This is not where we are right now, but I assure you that as we
go through the final stages of this process, the industrial logic of the merger will not be compromised and our investors
are top of mind.

We look forward to continuing our constructive discussions with the commission and the case team in Brussels and we
remain hopeful that the commission will complete its work and present a decision in 2011.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Mike for a review of our financial results. He will kick it back to me for the
conclusion and then we'll take your questions. Mike?
Michael S. Geltzeiler
Thank you, Duncan, and good morning. Slide seven provides comparative GAAP results for the third quarter of 2011.
For the quarter, revenue, net income and EPS were all above prior year and second quarter 2011 levels. This quarter
there were two primary reconciling items between our GAAP EPS of $0.76 a share and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.71 a
share. Third quarter 2011 results included a $40 million discrete tax benefit related to a decision by the U.K. tax
authorities to reduce corporate tax rates from 27% to 25%. In the quarter, we also reported a $29 million charge from
merger expenses and exit costs, which included $19 million related to our pending business combination. Year-to-date
a total of $45 million has been spent on the pending merger with Deutsche Boerse.
Our review of our financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit cost as
well as discrete tax items.
Slide eight provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter and year-to-date. Diluted EPS for the
quarter was $0.71, up 54% versus the prior year and above the $0.61 in the second quarter of 2011. For the first nine
months of 2011, EPS is $1.98, up 21% versus prior year. Our results for the quarter benefited from unseasonably high
trading volumes, a strong combination from non-trading related business and continued cost discipline, which resulted
in an expansion of our operating margins to 41% as all of the incremental revenue flowed through to operating profits.
For the first nine months of 2011, we generated over $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA, only $100 million shy of full year
2011 levels. The effective tax rate of 25% in the quarter was due to a decrease in our full year rate from 26% to
25.75%, which was in part attributed to the sharing of profits with our partners in the NYSE Amex Options
semi-mutualization. This compares with Q3 last year with the effective tax rate declining to 24% with some favorable
tax rulings in the Netherlands.
We are extremely pleased with the performance of NYSE Amex Options, which has increased its market share from
about 6% at the time we acquired the American Stock Exchange, to 15% at the end of Q3. For the quarter, the pre-tax
profit attributable to the non-controlling interest related to NYSE Amex Options was $11 million based on the sale of a
52.8% stake in the business. This negatively impacted our diluted EPS by $0.03 in the quarter.
As we indicated on the second quarter call, we repurchased 10% of the partner stake in late September, reducing our
partner's equity stake to 47.5%. Unless we decide to sell this stake to another partner, we will retain more of the profits
from this venture in the fourth quarter.
Slide nine provides our consolidated and segment results on a currency neutral basis. The U.S. dollar weakened this
quarter versus prior year for both the euro and the British pound. For the third quarter, 48% of our net revenue was
denominated in either euros or pounds and 52% in U.S. dollars. The currency impact on net revenue for the quarter was
favorable $23 million versus prior year and unfavorable $5 million versus the previous quarter. Foreign exchange
contributed a favorable $13 million to operating income this quarter versus prior year.
On a currency neutral basis, third quarter net revenues were up 14% and operating income increased 53% versus the
third quarter of 2010. Operationally, revenues for our derivatives, cash trading and listings, and technology segments
increased 16%, 15%, and 7%, respectively.
Slides 10 and 11 detail the financial performance for our derivative segments. Global derivative volumes increased
33% year-over-year, driven primarily by a 14% increase in European derivatives and a 53% increase in U.S. equity
options.

Against this backdrop of strong trading volumes, net revenues increased by 20% in the quarter. As with most other
exchanges, higher levels of volumes are very often accompanied by lower capture rates as clients hit tiers and earn
volume discounts. Derivatives accounted for 32% of our net revenues and 41% of our operating income in Q3. The
average net rate per contract for NYSE Liffe derivatives was $0.68 in the third quarter compared to $0.67 in the third
quarter of 2010 and $0.74 in the second quarter of 2011.
Within the first few days after each quarter end, we publish a preliminary estimate of our quarterly capture rates for our
primary trading venues, these are truly estimates. And in this quarter, higher than anticipated liquidity payments related
to EURIBOR futures and options activity resulted in a slightly lower revenue capture than was originally expected for
European derivatives. Mix of business combined with the strengthening of the dollar drove the decline in capture rates
compared to the second quarter of 2011.
Beginning December 1, we have modified pricing for the trading of individual equity options and index futures and
options on NYSE Liffe, Amsterdam, and Belgium. These ADVs represent approximately 10% of total NYSE Liffe
volumes through September 2011, and we expect this pricing change to decrease NYSE Liffe's overall capture by an
annualized 3% to 4%.
The revenue capture in U.S. options was $0.155 per contract in the third quarter, below third quarter 2010 and second
quarter 2011 levels. The decrease in the rate per contract was driven by an increase in the mix of market maker
volumes over Amex.
Similarly, slide 12, and 13 show the financial performance for our cash trading and listings segment. Cash trading and
listings net revenue was $353 million in the third quarter of 2011, up 18% versus the prior year period, and up 8%
compared to the second quarter of 2011.
European cash ADV of 1.9 million transactions increased 40% from the third quarter 2011 – 2010 levels. And in
August, trading volumes spiked 70% to a record 2.2 million transactions per day. In U.S. cash equities, volumes
increased 9% to 2.6 billion shares. Market share was down in Q3 for both U.S. cash and our four European markets
compared to the prior year.
Tape A share in the U.S. was 36% and European cash share was 66%. The decline in European cash market share in
the third quarter of 2011 was driven by higher levels of participation by global trading firms trading out of alternative
European trading venues. Listing revenues increased $8 million year-over-year and is up $19 million year-to-date
compared to last year.
Revenue capture for U.S. cash remained at $0.038 per 100 shares handled for Q3, well above the $0.032 recorded in
the third quarter of 2010. Since the second quarter of 2010, we have implemented dynamic tiers based on overall U.S.
consolidated volumes. We moved the inversion at the highest tier at Arca and added step-up tiers to capture trading
activity for members that are now coming direct to NYSE as a result of changes to sponsored access to begin to take
effect in July.
Revenue capture for European cash decreased to $0.64 from $0.66 in the third quarter of 2010 and $0.74 in the second
quarter of 2011. Decline in capture was driven by a combination of higher volumes with clients hitting tiers and overall
lower trade size, which began in August and continued through September.
Slide 14 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information
Services and Technology Solutions revenues was $125 million in the third quarter, an increase of $12 million, or 11%,
from Q3 prior year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in safety and collocation revenue and revenue
growth of managed service sales from TSC, WSC and SIGMA X.
This increase is against a tough comparison as last year's Q3 sales included the sale of UTP to [ph] Cutter (35:08) for
$6 million. Information Technology Solutions accounted for 18% of our net revenue and 10% of our operating income.
Operating margin was 25% compared to 21% in the third quarter of 2010, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 36%.
Year-to-date, revenues are running 10% above the prior-year period. While we have been targeting a full-year growth
rate in excess of 15%, we now expect this figure to be slightly north of 10% for 2011. We continue to see strong

interest from broker-dealer communities to outsource large portions of their trading infrastructure. However,
challenging market conditions for the banks have delayed decision-making and pushed out our pipeline.
In the third quarter, we closed and fully integrated our Metabit acquisition. Metabit is a Tokyo-based provider of
market access services to the Asian market and supports our growing focus on the Asian markets and strategic goal of
building a global liquidity network.
Slide 15 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. Third-quarter operating expenses were down $3
million versus last year on a reported basis. 40% of our expenses in Q3 were denominated in either euros or pounds.
After adjusting for FX and the impact of transactions, such as NYSE Blue joint venture and the acquisition of
Corporate Board Member, fixed operating costs were down $21 million or 5% from the third quarter of 2010. Despite
the intense focus on the merger and post-merger integration planning, we continue to make good progress this year on
reducing our standalone operating expenses.
Year-to-date, our fixed costs are running slightly below the prior year on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of
currency and changes to our portfolio, our expenses are running 4% below prior-year levels.
Slide 16 provides you with a view of our expected full-year 2011 fixed costs. Based on results through the quarter, we
expect to achieve our cost guidance for full year 2011 operating costs of less than $1,650 million on a constant-dollar,
constant-portfolio basis. On a related basis, we expect full-year operating cost to approximate $1,622 million. This
compares to a 2010 cost base of $1,678 million. We're anticipating full-year incremental costs from year-over-year
portfolio changes of approximately $28 million, which include the impact of Corporate Board Member, NYSE Blue
and Metabit.
The dollar has been consistently weaker in 2011 versus 2010. We anticipate that this will result in about a $30 million
increase in fixed costs year-over-year for 2011. Factoring in the portfolio changes and the impact of currency
fluctuations, we expect full year 2011 expenses to approximate $1,680 million.
Slide 17 details our cash and debt position as of September 30, 2011. The company ended the quarter in a strong
financial position, well-positioned for our combination with Deutsche Boerse. As a result of our strong EBITDA
generation through nine months and a weak dollar, our debt to EBITDA leverage ratio was 1.6 times in the quarter,
down from 2.2 times at the end of 2010 and at the lowest level since the NYSE and Euronext merged.
Q3 capital expenditures were $49 million, compared to $82 million in the prior-year quarter. Year-to-date capital
spending is $116 million. We're clearly on track to be well within our full-year guidance of less than $200 million of
capital spending.
This week the Board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2011, which is payable on
December 30. Given our strong financial position and current valuation, we expect to execute our recently announced
$100 million buyback during the fourth quarter. This repurchase was announced in conjunction with Deutsche Boerse's
buyback program designed to preserve the 60/40 ownership established in our business combination agreement.
I'll now turn the call back to Duncan for concluding remarks before we open the line for questions.
Duncan L. Niederauer
Okay. Thanks, Mike. So in closing everybody, our results for the quarter were strong and we are pleased with the
progress we are making on our strategy to create a global capital markets community that will empower our clients to
innovate and collaborate. As a result of our diversification efforts over the past several quarters, our non-volume related
revenues are increasing, lessening our dependency on trading volumes. While we have seen some leveling of our
growth trajectory for interest rate futures on NYSE Liffe U.S. and NYPC, we remain confident that our continuing
efforts to broaden the trading community on the platform will bear fruit in the coming months.

quarter. With our hearing before the Director-General for Competition of the European Commission now complete, we
are entering the final phase of the review. We look forward to continuing our constructive discussions with the
commission and case team in Brussels and are hopeful that the commission will complete its work as I said earlier in
calendar 2011.
Lastly, recent unfortunate events at MF Global that have negatively impacted thousands of hardworking and dedicated
employees have not had an impact on our platform. Our teams, both here in the U.S. and in Europe are implementing
proven procedures to mitigate risk and stem losses. They have also been working diligently with other market
participants, exchanges and regulators to ensure an orderly unwind of positions and to facilitate the transition of
customer positions to new clearing members.
With that, we'd happy to open the line for questions and I'll turn it back to Stephen.
Stephen C. Davidson
Okay. Gary, we're all set.
Q&A
Operator
Okay. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, your Q&A session will now begin. [Operator Instructions] We have our first
question coming from the line of Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Over to you, Rich.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Hi, Rich.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Hi. I guess the one question I have, because I have one, is on MiFID and you know sort of
the surprise attack on the vertical model, because when you look at sort of the European Competition Committee, this
is something that could stay around whether or not you do the merger and hopefully you do. But your comments – I
know it's too early to tell. I know the final version would be much different, but can you just give us your views more
specifically on the MiFID II and how it pertains to vertical clearing?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Yes, sure, Rich, and that's a question we have been getting a lot lately and I think – let
me answer it by saying the following. I think a lot of observers compare EMIR and MiFID II and sort of view them as
if they are at the same point in the process. And the way I would describe it is this: if you think about the EMIR
legislation that's been proposed, it's been vetted; it's been nearly agreed; and it's on the verge of being implemented
over the next 12 months to 15 months.
There's been a lot of debate at the European level and obviously a big part of that was to take into account not only
what was happening in Europe, but also what was happening globally in terms of the re-regulation of the financial
industry around things like Dodd-Frank, and it seems to us that the final product took all of that into account. So if you
think about how EMIR is envisioned to be implemented, it's very similar to Dodd-Frank and what's going on in the
other developed markets around the world: limited opportunity for regulatory arbitrage.
If you then switch gears and talk about MiFID II or whatever we want to call this next piece of legislation, I wasn't
actually that surprised, knowing who the proposers are and how the process begins. It is not unusual to see some rather
idealistic view slip into the initial proposal that would come out in a piece of legislation like this. I would remind
everybody that this has been proposed by one area of the commission. It has not been vetted; it has not been reviewed;
it has not really – the process is only beginning to take into account some of the other things that I think were correctly
taken into account with the EMIR discussion.

And you are always going to have this push and pull between what I call idealism and pragmatism, and I think we're
optimistic that as Europe looks at MiFID II and looks back at what MiFID did and didn't do and then looks about how
the rest of the world is thinking about its own derivatives businesses, my guess is: if the vertical silo is ever going to be
encouraged to go in the direction of being horizontal, that is something that the markets will do together and in concert
rather than one region at a time. So I don't think we want to overreact to MiFID II, that it's – since it's so early in the
process and is not nearly as vetted and developed as the EMIR legislation was. Hopefully, that gets to your question,
Rich.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Yes. Very, very much does help. Thanks.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Thanks.

Thank you. And next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman of Barclays Capital. Over to you, Roger.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Thanks. Good morning. Just I guess I wanted to ask around the technology business,
you made the comments that the banks, given market conditions, budget constraints have pushed out projects. I know
it's hard to kind of look out past this year, but I guess one of the things I wonder is: are any firms – are you hearing any
feedback that they are waiting to see, if this combo goes through, how it comes together in terms of the size that you'll
be and wanting to limit any exposure to you in terms of outsourcing technology?
<A - Lawrence E. Leibowitz>: So, this is Larry. Hey, how you are doing, Roger?
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Hi.
<A - Lawrence E. Leibowitz>: First, I don't think we've heard from any customers they want to see how big we are to
see if they want to give us a contract or not, but they also – but they do want to know who they're going to be dealing
with and will be in Basildon or where it's going to be from a datacenter perspective. So I think that that has been an
issue, but I also think that a lot of this is internal stuff going on at the banks as they go through their turmoil and just the
turbulence of their results.
So we don't see anything that detracts from the reason for this business, the strategic direction of the business. We're
not backing off our billion-dollar target. Sorry, [ph] Dominique (38:57) if you are listening and in fact we would expect
that we're going to have to adjust that target should the DB deal go through because they actually have some
technology businesses as it is.
So again, sorry technology guys, the bar is just going to go higher. So we think that there is some timing issues here.
Probably some of that was going to be natural anyway, but the merger and other things are probably making people –
giving people a reason, an excuse to push off some decisions.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Got it. Okay. Thanks, Larry.

Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Jillian Miller of BMO Capital Markets. Over to
you, Jillian.
<Q - Jillian Miller>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Good morning.
<Q - Jillian Miller>: Duncan, you had mentioned the concept of preserving the industrial logic of the deal with
Deutsche Boerse and I was just hoping you could give us a little more color on what conditions in your mind might
threaten that logic. I know in the past you've said that you wouldn't really be open to considering spinning off one of

the derivatives operations, but there's a lot of other things that could be asked of you, including some kind of clearing
open access.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Right. So I don't want to use the call as an opportunity to speculate about what we
would be willing to do or not, because we've promised the competition authorities we will not front run the process and
we are trying to be respectful of it. But I will try to get at your question by reviewing a couple of the things we did at
the hearing. If you think about what we might be asked to do at some stage, it's going to largely come down to how the
markets are defined and whether we all agree on what the real areas of overlap are.
And I think most of you on the call understand just how complementary the businesses are; you understand which
products overlap and really don't. And I have said publicly that if we were ever asked to divest one of our two
derivatives businesses, while several of our competitors have expressed an interest in that for obvious reasons, that
would undermine so much of the logic of the combination that it would be not – it would not be sensible.
So what we've been trying to work on with the Commission is to merely state the facts, stick to the facts, encourage
everyone to use the same facts and be realistic about where we do overlap. Both of us have an individual equities
options business, for example; we have a single stock futures business; we're both in the OTC equity business.
And I think when you think about this, other than that, there is not a lot of obvious overlaps. At the same time, we're
realistic; we said from the beginning we never thought it would be unconditional. And there are certain remedies that
are structural in nature and others that are behavioral in nature; and I think all we have to do is learn more next week,
understand what's being asked of us, and then, as we've promised to shareholders, not behave in an irresponsible way.
They've invested their trust in us, and I don't plan to undermine that trust.
<Q - Jillian Miller>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you for your question. And next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS. Over to you, Alex.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Good morning, Alex.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Real quick, wanted to come back to the, I guess, integration with DB1 if this deal goes through. I
don't think we've heard a lot of that. Is that really moving forward a lot still or is the focus really on antitrust right now?
And if it is continuing to move forward, can you give us a little bit more color of anything that you have decided
recently, any maybe sticking points still or decisions that haven't been made that maybe are big or anything new that
you have decided in terms of how you guys – going forward with platforms, datacenters and so forth.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Yes, sure. Thanks, Alex. We have been keeping that mostly internal for obvious
reasons. I would describe the process, which has been ongoing for months now, as being conducted in the right spirit.
Both teams have an integration captain that are both senior people from both companies leading the way.
They've continued to outline the key decisions that have to be made in terms of corporate systems: the ultimate auditing
decision, what will the new co-board look like, what is the organizational construct, what's the desired culture of the
new company, what are going to be the decisions around the technology and clearing platforms; and we've been
actively engaged in all of that.
We have been somewhat reluctant to report any of that publicly because we also think that's a bit presumptuous on our
part until we learn a little bit more about how the process plays out. But I think we are set up to move fairly quickly,
because many of those decisions are well in process and some of those decisions, in fact, around organizational
construct have already been made, but we are a bit reluctant to communicate them broadly at this point for obvious
reasons.

The thing that I think I am most pleased about is we just, to give you an example, we just completed a culture survey of
the top 250 people at the two companies combined, and the results were encouraging, strikingly similar, and I think the
path to the culture that we want the new company to have will not be a subject of disagreement. And I know many
people were concerned that the two corporate cultures were substantially different enough that that would be difficult.
That does not appear to be an issue given the findings we just had from our key people at both companies. So I would
say we are making very good progress there and we will – when we are able to, we will communicate some of those
decisions in more of a public domain.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Okay, great. That's good color, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James & Associates.
<Q - Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy>: Good morning. This is Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. One of
your exchange competitors headquartered in Atlanta made an interesting comment yesterday. He suggested that if the
regulatory environment in Europe became less favorable, there is nothing structurally to tie them to Europe, that there
is some flexibility involved. They could potentially relocate to a more regulatory advantageous geography. To what
extent do you think that sort of philosophy would be applicable to NYSE and I guess perhaps to Deutsche Boerse as
well?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Yes, I did not hear the observation. I was travelling yesterday, but I must say I, in large
part, agree with it. And whether you're looking at it through a lens of the competitive landscape in general or even if it's
just as narrow as what happens with a discussion around a financial transactions tax, and, for example, in which
jurisdictions it were to be implemented, be it the world, a region, part of a region, individual countries, et cetera. I think
what we've been trying to impress on the policymakers on all of these decisions is that many of the countries who
operate may be viewed as nationally focused or, to use the patriotism word, patriotic, but capital is not patriotic and the
markets are indeed global and capital can flow across borders pretty easily.
So when we talk about things like the financial transactions tax, we appreciate the pressure some of the policymakers
are under. We understand the populist views on measures like this, but I think it's incumbent on all of us as business
leaders, in a professional way, to continue to impress on them what some of the potential outcomes of these decisions
will be.
And set aside from the things like increased volatility and widening of spreads that would happen if you did something
like a tax, but ultimately all of these decisions will inevitably lead to jurisdiction shopping, which it sounds like the
comment yesterday was really talking about. And remember that a lot of the policy makers will think that it's easier
than it probably is in reality to implement decisions that would require them to behave in an extraterritorial way. And
history tells us that's not quite as easy as everybody thinks, right?
So I would be pretty much in agreement with [ph] Jeff (47:24) or whoever said that, that the business leaders would be
– they would be required to think about other ways to conduct their business looking out for all their other stakeholders'
interests, right? So I would agree with the comment.
<Q - Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy>: All right. Thank you.

Thank you for your question. And next question comes from the line of – is it, Niamh Alexander of KBW. Over to you.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Hi, thank you and congrats on the quarter. Just another issue that the regulators or politicians
are kind of holding on a little bit lately, but regulators, especially the SEC, maybe, and the IOSCO Report, High
Frequency Trading. It looks like there's probably a move towards maybe requiring these firms to register at least and I

don't know what kind of additional requirements in terms of compliance and costs, but can you help me frame how
much of your revenue comes from these firms. We don't think it's all that much, actually, because the fees that they are
paying is typically a lot lower than everybody else, but can you help me frame that and maybe how to think about what
could substantially shrink that.
<A - Lawrence E. Leibowitz>: Yeah, This is Larry again. This is – that's a good question and I think it's actually
harder to get at partly because it's hard to tag specific traders as high frequency. And partly, because the way the market
currently works, when people talk about it being 70%, 75%, all they are really saying is it's all electronic trading,
including algorithms. So there is a lot of different types of trading going on in the market, and you're right, so certain
classes of high frequency traders, particularly market makers actually were probably close to breakeven if not inverted
on.
And so if anything, some of that stuff may actually increase profitability; it really depends on exactly what got
changed. I would not disagree with you that I think there are a couple of directions that regulators around the world are
looking, many of which we don't disagree with. So, for example, whether it's registration of trading, whether it's better
transparency around who is doing what, whether it's surveillance across markets, those sorts of changes we think are
actually very good for the market. All the academic research clearly shows that high frequency trading – they've failed
to link high frequency trading to negative aspects of the market, either increased volatility or gaming.
Nonetheless we think shining more of a light on it to give people comfort is a good thing. But in terms of the
economics, it's really hard to get a read on. Some of it may actually end up being better for the exchanges, but again
that's not the reason we should advocate or be against it. What we really want is more integrity in the markets, people
feeling confident in the markets and I think that's why we work pretty activity with regulators and market participants
alike.
To be honest, many of the high frequency trading firms or other firms that do these things are in favor of some of these
measures as well because they feel that they've been unfairly tarred by people who have not brought forth any evidence
that there is actually harm to it.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Okay, fair enough. Thanks, Larry.

Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Daniel Harris of Goldman Sachs. Over to you,
Daniel.
<Q - Daniel F. Harris>: Thank you. Good morning, guys. I was wondering if we could shift gears here to the NYSE
Liffe business and similar to some of the conversations from last quarter, you still have a much higher level of open
interest than we're seeing volumes. Some of that is Block E coming from the asset management side, but I was
wondering if you could touch base a little bit on that and what you're trying to do drive the volume up with the open
interest. And one of the other things that we've continued to hear is that while the bid/ask spread is very similar, if not
on top of the broader market, the depth of the market is just not there yet, which is one of the reasons why the volume
still persists at your peers. So I was wondering if we can get some of your views around that. Thank you.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Thanks, Dan, and we'll try to – maybe we'll invite one of the NYSE Liffe's folks to
come to the next call as well because I think as we go into 2012 and we start with the new product launches and get
some more clients in the pipeline, I think that's all going to be important. I think your observations are pretty accurate.
We've been pleased with the liquidity and the tightness of the spread, but in think we need more market participants to
make the market even deeper, but the tightness of the spread has not been our issue.
I think we've got market quality, we've got enough liquidity. Some of the block positions that helped the open interest
earlier in fact were part of what did not get rolled in September. I think we started to see the open interest build backup.
Our goal is to still broach the million contract open interest level by the end of the year. But, I think our three or four
key initiatives now are we need to get some of the key players that aren't involved, involved.

We need to get – secondly, we need to get more brokers and some members of the buy-side involved. Thirdly, we need
to help these customers find their way through some of the connectivity issues. And to be realistic, as we get through
the end of the year not a lot of people are spending – on the customer side are spending a lot of time worrying about
new technology innovation, so that may be early next year. And then fourthly and probably most importantly is
expanding out the product set.
I think we will see more depth to the market when we lift the interest rate – with the options on interest rate futures in
early 2012. I think that's going to be the next thing that helps us take the next leg up. So we're certainly not giving up. I
think we're a little frustrated. We were spoiled by our early success and it certainly has leveled off. But we're
continuing to invest in the business; our partners are continuing to invest in the business and I think we will have more
good news coming out of there in the coming few months. [ph] Leibo (53:13), do you want to add anything to that?
<A - Lawrence E. Leibowitz>: Yes, also remember that the smart routing technology that you see so widely used in
equities isn't nearly as in place on the futures desk, probably because there was only one destination for some of these
products. And so, what you've got to do is convince people to get connected, that there is enough of the reason to do it.
They've got to improve the logic of how they decide where to route and so you hope to get this sort of snow ball effect,
where you keep giving them more and more reasons why they shouldn't ignore this venue. And so I think, that's kind of
the process and it just takes a while for the momentum to grow because it's not just them turning switches on.

Thank you. Ladies and gentleman, our final question comes from the line of Chris Allen, over to you – of Evercore.
Over to you.
<Q - Christopher Allen>: Good morning guys. Nice quarter.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Thank you, Chris.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Thank you, Chris.
<Q - Christopher Allen>: Duncan, you talked before about informing policy makers about the implications of
transaction tax and other structural changes, where do you think the understanding level is and does it differ by regions,
because the focus right now, the worry right now is that the Eurozone may implement a transaction tax even though the
U.K. or the Nordic region and the U.S. may not go along. Obviously, it's been heightened recently about the recent
draft from U.S. congressmen and senators. So any color on that will be very helpful?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Yes, and I won't reiterate what I said earlier Chris, I'll just try to add to it a little bit. I
think the understanding level is actually pretty high. I don't think the policy makers are confused about what the
ultimate impact would be. I still think there is a tremendous amount of political pressure and I would not expect that to
abate anytime soon. Part of it feels to me, and this is the part where I'm being a little more speculative, is having been
in a lot of these conversations in different areas of the world, I think part of it is to provoke a response that may not be
exactly in the form of a financial transactions tax.
So I believe as you see the debate go the next few weeks here, this will take on different shapes. And what people are
saying is, okay, if it's not that then here is the problem we're trying to solve, how are you going to help us solve the
problem. If the financial transactions tax doesn't work, because it's a pass through tax, how do we create some kind of a
de minimis charge that gets the money paid by the people we want to be paying it and supporting the efforts we wanted
to be supported.

My sense is also that in certain parts of the world some of the regulators, and there is precedent for this so you can't
blame them for this, view this potentially as an opportunity to create a self funding mechanism for their budgets in a
way that the SEC fee in this country for years has partly served to do. That's a big part of the SEC's budget every year.
And if you were the regulators in certain parts of the world and you're concerned about your ability to garner a
meaningfully sized budget, you could understand why, looking through a very narrow lens this looks like a potential
root to solve your problem there, where you don't have to have your hand out every year looking for a budget.
So I do think the policymakers we talk to generally, not all of them, but generally they understand it and my belief is
that you will this morph into a discussion about different kinds of surcharges as this unfolds the next few weeks. So,
let's see what happens.
