MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Celeste Mellet Brown
Good morning. This is Celeste Mellet Brown, Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to our First Quarter Earnings Call.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements which reflect management's current estimates or beliefs
and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
The presentation may also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our SEC filings at
morganstanley.com for a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a
discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley.
This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our
consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument.
I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.
James Patrick Gorman
Thank you, Celeste. Good morning, everyone. We will review the progress we've made towards the six comprehensive
steps we laid out in January that will drive our return on equity and return on tangible equity, excluding DVA, to
greater than 10% and 12% respectively, assuming a flat revenue environment. We'd like to update you on the progress
we've made towards each goal during this quarter and we remain committed to the targets as laid out.
First, and the first point, number one, to acquire 100% of the Wealth Management joint venture. As hopefully you
know, during the first quarter we received a non-objection in the CCAR process to our request to use $400 million of
our excess capital to buy in the remaining 35% of the joint venture from Citi. We're now awaiting further approval
from the Fed, consistent with the process for the 14% purchase last year and we look forward to hearing from the Fed
over the next several weeks or months.

Number two, to achieve Wealth Management margin goals through expense management, and to exceed them through
revenue growth. Due to better expense controls and a more robust revenue environment we were able to drive another
17% margin result in Wealth Management in the first quarter, despite seasonally higher expenses. In addition, our
flows into managed accounts were very strong at over $15 billion. Long-term we continue to believe this is an
extremely attractive business for Morgan Stanley. There is continued upside to profitability driven by a constructive
environment in expense controls; a gradual shift back into equities by our clients; continued migration of managed
accounts from commission-based accounts; and finally, revenue and margin upside from owning 100% of Wealth
Management.
Point three, to significantly reduce risk weighted assets in Fixed Income and Commodities. We made good progress
with our fixed income risk weighed asset reductions, ending the quarter at $253 billion, down from $280 billion at the
end of 2012 and slightly below our year-end target of $255 billion. Our progress was partially driven by passive
mitigation with much of the decline driven by credit derivative contract expiries. Although we're pleased with our
progress, we remain comfortable with our year-end target of $255 billion.
Point four was to drive expenses lower in 2013, 2014 and beyond. Non-compensation expenses continued to come
down sequentially, consistent with the progress we'd made last year and the targets we outlined in January. In addition,
our firm-wide NIC compensation ratios, excluding DVA and severance, were well below our full-year 2012 ratios,
while total compensation dollars were also below those from a year ago. This largely reflects the significant head count
reduction we made over the past 12 months across that business.
Point number five was to grow earnings through Morgan Stanley specific opportunities. As we discussed when we
reported the fourth quarter, we believe there is significant revenue upside and expense savings for both Institutional
Securities and Wealth Management as we more closely align those businesses. Institutional Securities and Wealth
Management launched a joint venture in September 2012 to increase collaboration between the businesses and there are
currently over 40 initiatives in various stages of execution.
We're already seeing the benefits in the first quarter and expect additional upside over the next several years. For
example, prior to 2013, the firm had two separate groups focused on fixed income middle markets institutional clients.
In January, these groups were integrated under a uniform platform and leadership and are evidencing positive early
results. Revenue generated on these accounts was up despite aggregate market volume declines for the particular
products in the same period.
During the quarter, we continued to deploy our excess bank deposits more efficiently. Our mortgage lending was again
higher, and we made significant progress in regard to our PLE, or portfolio lending efforts, where we expect to derive
the majority of our retail lending growth over the next several years.
On the Institutional side, we added two new initiatives to our bank sweep platform in the first quarter, and we are in
early stages of execution for commercial real estate and warehouse lending. There remains significant opportunity from
growing our bank. As we have previously discussed, our deposits will grow to approximately $140 billion after we
acquire 100% of the Wealth Management joint venture. And we have a prudent disciplined strategy to deploy those
deposits over the next three years.
Point number six, so how does all this add up? Well, our 8% ROE and 9% ROTE, both excluding DVA, are a solid
start to the year. We expect that these levels will improve driven by the steps I've updated you on. The consistency of
our returns is as important as the absolute level of our returns, and we have made progress in this regard as well,
particularly over the last several quarters. In addition, we believe many of the regulatory headwinds face the industry
are already reflected in our results, such as the cost of subsidiarization, and because our growth areas are those that are
unlikely to be much impacted by further regulation, our path is clearer.
In closing, I'd like to briefly touch on our Japanese business before I turn the call back to Ruth. It's top of mind because
of the trip I made to Tokyo last week to meet with our partners. I saw first-hand the impact of new monetary and fiscal
policies on the markets there and the impact they're having on our business.

Our joint ventures with MUFG, Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities and Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities are
uniquely positioned in Japan to take advantage of what is a macro resurgence due to the global client network and
capabilities of Morgan Stanley and the domestic Japanese corporate and retail footprint of MUFG. Combined, we have
an unparalleled distribution intermediating invested capital flows into Japan and helping Japanese companies grow
abroad. In Japan, we have top three positions in equity and fixed income underwriting and M&A. As Japanese
domestic firms consolidate their IBD market share, our JVs are differentiated as a domestic firm with truly unique
origination capabilities.
Outbound M&A volume was up significantly in 2012, and Japan became the number two acquirer nation globally
versus number nine in 2009. We're also well positioned in sales and trading and have and will continue to benefit from
cross-border flows into Japanese equities where we have a nearly 14% share in equity trading.
As we approach the third anniversary of the JV on May 1, the financial contribution of Morgan Stanley continues to
show positive momentum, which we expect to continue for some time and was worth calling out at this unique point in
transition in Japan.
So now let me get back to the broader results and particularly the first quarter and turn it over to Ruth. Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided
reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures.
The negative impact of DVA in the quarter was $317 million with $238 million in fixed income sales and trading and
$79 million in equity sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues were $8.5 billion, up
approximately 13% versus the fourth quarter. Non-interest expense was $6.5 billion, up 7% versus the fourth quarter.
Compensation expense was $4.2 billion this quarter, which included approximately $132 million related to severance.
Non-compensation expense was $2.3 billion, down 6% from last quarter.
The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the first quarter was 21%. Excluding discrete items, the effective
tax rate was about 30%. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders
excluding DVA were approximately $1.2 billion. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.61
after preferred dividends. On a GAAP basis, including the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues for the quarter were
$8.2 billion. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $977
million. Reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.50 after preferred dividends. Book
value at the end of the quarter was $31.22 per share. Tangible book value was $27.39 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet, our total assets were $801 billion at March 31, up from $781 billion last quarter. Deposits
were $81 billion, consistent with fourth quarter levels. Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $186 billion
compared with $182 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. $118 billion of our liquidity this quarter was parent and
non-bank liquidity versus $111 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. We increased our liquidity reserve to ensure
we're well positioned for the potential acquisition of the 35% stake in the Wealth Management joint venture.
With respect to our capital ratios, as a reminder, beginning this quarter, the definition of Basel I capital ratio reflects the
implementation of the Basel committee's market risk capital framework, which is commonly referred to as Basel 2.5.
Although our calculations are not final, we believe that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I will be approximately
11.5% and our Tier 1 capital ratio will be approximately 13.9%. For the fourth quarter, the pro forma Tier 1 common
ratio under the new framework would be 10.6%. Risk-weighted assets under Basel I are expected to be approximately
$403 billion at March 31. Subject to final rule making and reflecting our best assessment of the rules, our pro forma
Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was 9.8% as of the end of the first quarter.
Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, revenues excluding DVA were $4.4 billion, up
22% sequentially. Non-interest expense was $3.3 billion, up 8% versus the fourth quarter. Compensation, which
included severance of $113 million, was $1.9 billion for the first quarter, reflecting a 43% ratio excluding DVA.

Excluding DVA and severance the compensation ratio was 40%. Non-compensation expense of $1.4 billion decreased
6% from last quarter. The business reported a pre-tax profit of $1.1 billion excluding the impact of DVA. Including the
impact of DVA, the business reported a pre-tax profit of $830 million.
In Investment Banking, revenues of $945 million were down 23% versus last quarter. According to Thomson Reuters,
Morgan Stanley ranked number two in global completed M&A and number three in global equity at the end of the first
quarter. Notable transactions included in Equity Underwriting Zoetis which raised $2.6 billion in its public offering, the
largest IPO of a U.S. company in almost a year. In Advisory, Benckiser acquired D.E. Master Blenders for €7.6 billion
and Morgan Stanley served as financial advisor and joint lead arranger on committed financing to the bidder group.
And in Debt Underwriting as joint book runner, we successfully priced $3.5 billion of senior unsecured notes for
Intelsat, Luxembourg to refinance existing indebtedness.
Advisory revenues of $251 million were down versus our strong fourth quarter results due to lower industry-wide
volumes and timing of fee recognition. Declines were primarily in the Americas.
Equity Underwriting revenues were $283 million, up 19% versus the fourth quarter driven by improved performance in
the U.S. and Asia offset by declines in EMEA. Overall, revenue mix for the market was less favorable in the quarter
with fewer IPOs and greater block activity. Fixed income underwriting revenues reflected continued strong demand
across products, although our revenues of $411 million were down versus our record fourth quarter. This quarter the
market was more heavily driven by high yield and leveraged loans where our share has historically been lower versus
investment grade where we have stronger positioning.
Equity sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were $1.6 billion, an increase of 14% from last quarter. Equity
revenues were up broadly across products, regions and client segments versus the fourth quarter. Client revenues were
the highest levels in over a year driven, by market share gains and growth in prime brokerage balances. Prime
brokerage balance growth in fact outpaced the overall market due to greater balances from existing clients and from
new business. Strength in our core businesses was partially offset by the PDT spin-off that was effective January 1 of
this year.
Fixed Income Commodities and Commodities sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were $1.5 billion. Revenues
increased versus our fourth quarter results, reflecting seasonal patterns, despite a period of challenging market
conditions in March. CVA, net of hedges, continued to be a drag this quarter in part due to the tightening of our credit
spreads. Results in both macro and credit products were up versus the fourth quarter, driven by strong client activity; in
general clients focused on higher-yielding products. Credit corporates were up significantly as secondary trading
volumes increased. Securitized products result outperformed due to very strong volumes and several CMBS
securitizations in the quarter. Commodities sales and trading revenues continued to be challenged by cyclical
headwinds but were ahead of fourth quarter results. Other sales and trading revenues of $73 million compared with
negative revenues of $34 million last quarter. Average trading VaR for the first quarter was $72 million versus $78
million in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Global Wealth Management, revenues of $3.5 billion were up 4% versus the fourth quarter. Asset
management revenues were consistent with the fourth quarter, reflecting comparable market levels at the beginning of
each period. Transaction revenues increased 15% from last quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of $559
million, which increased 5%, reflecting greater mutual fund activity despite: fewer trading days versus the fourth
quarter; investment banking related fees of $274 million, which increased 32% versus last quarter, driven by strong
new issue activity for closed-end funds; and trading revenues of $298 million, which were up 22% versus the fourth
quarter, reflecting the impact of deferred compensation plans and higher fixed income revenues.
Net interest revenue increased 6% to $413 million in part driven by higher average BDP balances and more efficient
deployment of our investment portfolio. Non-interest expense was $2.9 billion, up 4% from last quarter. The
compensation ratio was 60% versus 57% in the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonally higher compensation expenses in
the first quarter.

Non-compensation expense was $808 million, down 6% versus last quarter, reflecting continued expense discipline and
the roll-off of platform integration expenses. The PBT margin was 17%. Profit before tax was $597 million, the highest
level of absolute profitability since the inception of the joint venture. Non-controlling interest was $121 million, up
from $103 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting stronger results in the joint venture.
Total client assets increased 6% to $1.8 trillion, reflecting higher market levels and inflows. Global fee-based asset
inflows were $15.3 billion. Fee-based assets under management increased to $621 billion at quarter end. Global
representatives were 16,284, essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter. Bank deposits were $126 billion versus
$131 billion at year-end, as clients began to shift back into the market in January. Approximately $69 billion is held in
Morgan Stanley bank.
In Asset Management, we continue to benefit from the steps we have taken to strengthen the business, with higher
revenues and another quarter of positive flows into fixed income funds, which is an area of focus for us. In addition, as
of March, an excess of 76% of our long-only strategies, excluding liquidity, outperformed their benchmarks over three,
five and ten years. Specifically, Asset Management revenues of $645 million were up 8% versus the fourth quarter,
driven by higher marks and growth in management and admin fees.
In Traditional Asset Management, revenues of $401 million were up from the fourth quarter, driven by higher global
equity markets and continued positive net flows into the long-only business, partially offset by outflows in our liquidity
funds.
In Real Estate Investing revenues increased 24% versus the fourth quarter. Due to the ownership structure of these
funds, the majority of these revenues are passed to third-party investors in the non-controlling interest line.
In Merchant Banking, revenues were down compared to the fourth quarter. Expenses were $458 million, up 21% from
fourth quarter on higher compensation expense primarily due to DCP. Profit before tax was $187 million, down 15%
sequentially. NCI of $51 million was essentially flat to last quarter. Total assets under management increased to $341
billion driven by mark appreciation.
In terms of our outlook, a number of factors continue to support our expectation for healthy activity levels
notwithstanding the persistent structural issues that must be addressed globally. In the U.S. positive economic data are
encouraging, with monetary policies supporting momentum despite the negative impact of the federal spending
reductions rippling through the public and private sectors. Strong liquidity inflows support both equity and credit
market activity as evidenced for example by higher PB balances and the greater engagement by retail investors that was
first evidenced in January.
In the Eurozone, there is work still to be done. However, the market liquidity facilitated by the ECB has inspired some
re-entry by investors, a modest uptick from the low market volumes in prior periods.
The Japanese market is clearly benefiting from a surge in investor and corporate activity on the back of the recent bold
central bank moves there. Notably Japanese retail investors are still heavily in cash, while many international investors
are underweight the market, suggesting the potential for continued healthy activity.
On the corporate side, global M&A dialogue is active, though CEOs seem to require sustained evidence of economic
strength to act. The periodic setbacks, as evidenced in markets over the last several weeks are reminders that global
economic recovery and market healing may not come in a straight line, even if major economies are clearly on a firmer
footing than just a year ago. Against this backdrop, we are confident about the steps we have taken to enhance Morgan
Stanley's business mix, benefiting from leadership positions within Institutional Securities, demonstrable upside in
Wealth Management and effective capital optimization.
Similarly, the firm's balance sheet is a source of strength, driven by our success in doubling our capital base since 2010
and fundamentally improving both the quantum and durability of liquidity.
Thank you for joining us, and James and I will now take your questions.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] First question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Hi, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning. So a handful of questions for you. The first one is, I think we can see plenty
of evidence of the cost management moving towards your – capturing your $1.6 billion expense target. But what's the
best way for us to track as we go through the year, your specific progress against the $1.6 billion?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So on the $1.6 billion, that was based on the calendar year 2012 actual compensation and
non-compensation expense. As I think you know, through 2014 is predicated on a flat revenue scenario, so we do
remain very comfortable with that target. There is some quarterly seasonality, so I think as we go through the year,
you'll continue to see progress against the $1.6 billion.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Is there some way that maybe starting with next quarter you could actually track against
those baselines what you've actually captured?
<A - Ruth Porat>: We'll try and highlight so you can see the progress, as we have in other areas, where we've laid out
a marker and then continued to hit and exceed the goals.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, great, I think that would be helpful. Moving on to just the whole question of the
risk-weighted assets and what we saw happening in the Fixed Income business more broadly in the quarter. You called
out rates and commodities as contributing to the year-over-year decline in Fixed Income revenues, but while we did see
the commodities VaR come down quite a bit if we measure year-over-year, the rates VaR was actually up pretty
materially. Can you help us square that with both the revenue momentum and with the decline that you called out in
terms of the FICC RWAs that got you ahead of your year-end targets by the end of the first quarter?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Sure. Obviously a couple of questions in that. So within VaR, the interest rate line is obviously
both an interest rate and credit line and, as you noted, was up year-over-year, flat to the last quarter. And it's affected by
a couple things. First and foremost, it's a measure of risk and not necessarily correlated with revenues. It does pick up
the activity in credit, as you noted. I called that out as an area that was quite strong for us, both corporate credit and
securitized products, our mortgage business generally. So it's a function of the shape of the book and volatility in the
market generally. But I think what we're looking at when you look at the total line is pretty consistent with prior period,
prior year. I think you then had another question regarding risk weighted assets?
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yeah, I mean to the extent that risk weighted assets are going to be driven in some measure
by your stressed VaRs, I was just wondering if you could try and reconcile for us the movement in VaR versus the
decline in RWAs? And I guess the follow-up question on the RWAs is, if you already exceeded your year-end target,
why stick with that as a target, basically, for the end of the year, or a couple billion more?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So the reduction, when we look at this reduction over the next period of time through 2016, it's
ballpark 60% passive and 40% active. This quarter it was mostly passive. It benefited from the structured credit
contract maturities as James noted; but it also reflected a change in the shape of the book and some other changes such
as active mitigation. And our view is that we're very confident that we'll be at that year-end target of $255 billion, if not
lower. But given part of the reduction was a change in the shape of the book, we just built in some degrees of flexibility
over the year.
And as I said, we're confident we're going to at least meet that year-end target; it may not be a straight line down
quarter-over-quarter, just depending on the shape of the book, could be higher in the second or third quarters. And
again, we remain very committed to the reduction this year and taking it down to that sub $200 billion level by 2016.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just to sort of continue I guess along the same lines, you
allocated a large part of the parent company capital down to ISG, $11 billion in the quarter, after holding a lot of that
really at the parent for pretty long time. Can you talk about what prompted the decision? And is there anything about
that move that kind of traps capital in the business in any way if in fact your RWA declines continue and you might
otherwise free up capital?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So the way we run the business, the way we look at capital, is we really run it with a Basel III lens.
And as I think you know, we actually charge capital and liquidity down to the business unit level, to the product level,
so we can look fully loaded at risk adjusted returns. The question then became over the last year or so, is what do we do
with parent capital, given the rules for Basel 2.5 and Basel III were still in flight and they hadn't been implemented.
And our view was that once the Basel 2.5 rules were implemented at the end of last year, and so there was complete
clarity on it, no guesswork in what was being charged to the various segments, it was the appropriate time to take that
parent capital number and allocate it up to the businesses.
So consistent with moving our Tier 1 common ratio to the Basel 2.5 metrics, we allocated the parent capital. And just to
make sure it's clear, because I find it can be confusing given the nomenclature's still Basel I, even though it's using the
market risk rules under Basel 2.5, our fourth quarter 2012 Basel I number was 14.6. The Basel 2.5 for the fourth quarter
was 10.6. So if you're looking at where our Basel I ratios were last quarter under an apples-to-apples basis, Basel 2.5,
10.6 last quarter going to 11.5 this quarter. Consistent with reporting ratios that way, parent capital was allocated into
the businesses.
And then to your very good question of does that mean that there is trapped capital, as we think about the businesses,
we look at, again, a Basel III lens, with that SIFI buffer and then above that we believe we have degrees of flexibility
with respect to capital return. And we're continuing to build that Basel III ratio based on the capital accretion from
earnings as well as the capital optimization through things like the risk weighted asset reduction. And so that does give
us greater degrees of flexibility.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That's a very helpful description. Thanks. I'll just ask one more, which is the Moody's
announcement and conference call a couple of weeks back kind of puts into focus that Morgan Stanley still has a lot of
its derivatives booked held outside of the bank unit. And I was wondering if, given what they're talking about doing,
that pushes you to try to move more into the bank to the extent that you can?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, we've been focused on moving more into the bank. We continue to write new
foreign-exchange derivatives in the bank, as we've talked about on prior calls and move old foreign-exchange
derivatives into the bank, and we do plan to write new interest rate derivatives into the bank this year. And timing and
speed is really a function of some of the regulatory processes. But I think more broadly on your question about
Moody's, we feel good about the steps we've taken to position Morgan Stanley for greater quality and consistency of
results, and it sets us up well. We've talked a lot about the changes to the business mix and funding on calls like this
with clients and counterparties, which really all go to the strength of our standalone credit profile of what we've done.
And I think also when you look at the change in the business mix, for example with fixed income, it really moved more
towards cash than derivatives. And so that puts us in a good spot. And obviously the industry has changed as well in the
past year with adjustments to IMAs post the ratings action, so would mute the impact of anything that maybe done on
the ratings front.
But I think the main thing is we think that all that we are doing continues to build our standalone credit profile.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.

<A - Ruth Porat>: Hey, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hello. Just one quickie follow up on the RWA reduction in FICC, it doesn't sound like it's had
much impact on revenues? I just want make sure that I clarify that point.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Correct. The majority of it was passive; the active was P&L neutral; and on the structured credit
position there wasn't a P&L impact as we'd really hedged out the revenue and risk.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay, great. And then on commodities, it's been a tough revenue backdrop for everybody given
the lower trending prices. I just want to make sure that you still feel this is mostly cyclical trending lower oil and things
like that, and make sure that there aren't any structural changes needed to the business?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Our view is that it is a cyclical headwind. As you said, it's continued backwardation, and it won't
turn on a dime, cyclical changes can take time to turn, but it is cyclical, it affects opportunities for us, it affects
opportunities for clients related to – in particular, structured solutions, which benefited us last year. But we do view it
as cyclical.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Got you. And then in terms of the physical oil, you tend to hedge that at all times, correct?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yeah, we don't take outright positions. We hedge our physical inventory.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Super. And last one is, there was some, not that big, but modest shifts of revenues and expenses
in the reporting from last quarter from Wealth Management to the Institutional Securities Group. I mean had a drop of
an effect on, positive effect on the margin. But the real impact on the margin besides the good markets was a core drop
in non-comp at Wealth Management. And I just want to see, is that a function of the systems integration cost running
off, and this is good run rate to run with?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So a couple of things. In terms of the international Wealth Management markets, you nailed it, it's a
small move. If you look at the supplement from the fourth quarter to now, it's about a 10 basis-point difference, so a
small portion of the – a small difference.
In terms of the overall margin, I think I'd highlight two points. One was the strength of the new issue underwriting
activity, in particular closed-end fund activity was very favorable last quarter and that helped on the top line. So that
you can't assume we're going to have the same volume in the next quarter. That was a positive.
Expenses clearly we have remained focused on, and the integration being done and rolling off was very much as
planned, and we're continuing to stay focused on the expense line. But I think if you're looking forward to the second
quarter, assume expenses pretty much hold at that level notwithstanding the fact that we remain tight on expense
discipline.
You've got the closed-end fund new issue activity, hard to forecast. We do see new issue activity, generally a lot of that
is outside the U.S. and the real catalyst comes from the U.S. At the same time, the S&P is about 10% higher than at the
end of the first quarter, which should benefit our fee-based revenues. I think those two revenue items sort of offset
another. And so at this point we're holding our market expectations pretty much in the area where it is, although you
can see we've got a number of levers that we're continuing to push.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Awesome. Thanks, Ruth.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.

<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Morning.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: On the remainder of the MSSB volume, what specific approval are you awaiting from on the
Fed regarding that?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So we've gone through obviously the CCAR, which is the capital approval and gotten the
non-objection there and then the approval, a Dodd-Frank – a process approval, we did the same thing last year when we
did the 14% buy-in – that approval, so it's a process approval versus a capital approval, that approval last year came in
May. Which wasn't really as relevant for timing because we didn't have the call until June and then we went through
the arbitration process which took it out basically to the end of the summer. And I'm not suggesting that you can read
anything into that May date, but it's the only proxy we have for what that timeline was at least last year.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Great. Thanks for reviewing that, Ruth. And then, James, speaking of CCAR, the test results
came in a bit – your own test results came in a bit below that of the Fed and I just wanted to get your thoughts on what
you believe drove that difference? What's in your control to maybe bridge that gap going forward? And how does it
impact timing and quantum of the next stage of capital return, post the buy-in?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So why don't I start on some of the technical of, I think you're pointing in particular to our PPNR
versus the Fed's, which you can see in the disclosure. Our understanding is that the Fed has its own model which relies
on historic data, and given we've invested meaningfully to increase the quality and consistency of earnings, there have
charges that have obviously been flowing through the P&L, such as MBIA, which are negatives in the historic
financials, but on a go-forward basis eliminate drag, improve the quality and consistency of results. And so it's
understandable there's a difference between the two, if one forecast is based on historic results and the impact and the
other is looking at a fundamentally different business mix.
We don't know the extent to which those historic results in the Fed model were adjusted and so it's hard to know
precisely how the models are different. But that in our view, is one of the key things that we're focused on working on
over the next period of time before the next submission to true the two up.
That being said, if you just look at our fourth quarter earnings and our first quarter earnings, the first two quarters of the
CCAR submission, that would add an additional 60 basis points to our ratios. So we will be focused on dealing with the
PPNR differences in methodology; we are continuing to accrete capital. And we think that does continue to give us
degrees of flexibility.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: And I think, Howard, the difference between what we submitted and believed the
models should throw out and what ultimately came out of the black box that is the CCAR process was actually
narrower than – the difference was narrower than what it was last year. We've obviously got better at it and I think it
was a – relative to some of the other firms out there – was frankly not a very surprising result. So we'll play this
forward. Our focus now is getting the Smith Barney, in which we got the capital approved.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Understood. Thanks. And then quick numbers one, Ruth. I realize, you said that RWA
reduction this quarter was P&L neutral, but what's driving the other sales and trading results? It seems to be less of a
headwind than it was in the past?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, it's a number of items. It does move around and it's difficult to model; it includes things like
our long-term debt hedging program and our bank liquidity portfolio, our loan book, DCP. So it's kind of an
aggregation of a number of different items.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Okay. Thanks. And then just finally for me, it remains a pretty fragile environment for you
and peers within the Institutional Securities business, I was just hoping you could comment on overall attrition levels
both absolutely and relative to your expectations? Thanks.
<A - Ruth Porat>: I think that beginning of the year having some departures is not in any way unusual. We actually
feel very good about the strength of the team, we've got a very talented senior team, been together for many years.
We've hired and think it's a great time at Morgan Stanley to be adding senior talent; people are excited to join given the

clarity of where we're going and the momentum moving in that direction. So it's kind of seasonal and we don't read
anything into it.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: And more specifically the attrition is actually tracking along exactly what it was last
year. And I believe, and Celeste will correct me later, a little lower than what it was the year before.

The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. I guess my questions could be grouped into the good, bad and the ugly, so I'll start with the
ugly. Financial Advisory, if you look at it, link quarter or year-over-year, among the five largest U.S. players, it looks
to perform the worst based on fees, and you had some management changes there. Can you reassure us that, that
franchise is still as strong as it's been historically?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yes, it is. The M& league tables are exactly the same as they were last year. It tends to be lumpy in
the first quarter in particular given the market environment with low activity levels, and we're consistently, here, have a
very strong M&A franchise as I noted in my comments. Part of it is just that lower volume and it tends to be lumpy,
and part of it is we had a very strong fourth quarter and there was some fee realization that moved within the fourth
quarter, so that partially explains it as well. But we feel very good about this and I think if you could just objectively
look at the league table this year or last year, it builds throughout the year.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then in my bad category, the absence of buybacks. I know you're not able to do that, but
trading at such a big discount to tangible book, if you have confidence in the value of your balance sheet which I
assume you do, why wouldn't you take more aggressive actions to downsize? And why not be more aggressive with
your FICC targets? Why not take some other actions to try to move up that Basel III ratio even faster?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Well, I think, Mike, there are a couple of questions meshed together there. I think the
actions on reducing our risk weighted assets in Fixed Income from I believe it was $390 billion in the third quarter of
2011 to $253 billion this year. We're a year ahead of schedule last year and we're at the end of the year's point already
in the first quarter this year. It would be easy to reduce it faster but you would also destroy revenues and destroy good
businesses. So our job is to balance sensible risk weighted asset reduction without destroying revenues in parts of that
business that we find very attractive. So we actually think we're being very aggressive bringing it down from $390
billion to a committed sub $200 billion by 2016. If we see more sensible opportunities which don't destroy value
obviously we'd be all over it.
The capital buyback's a completely different topic. As we said at the beginning of the year, we adopted a very clear
posture with our regulators which was that our focus was on the strategic benefits of buying Smith Barney for two
reasons. One it was an attractive business and, b, we're already carrying the effective cost of the capital for that
business so we wanted the earnings from it. And at $600 million pre-tax a quarter, 35% is real money. So that was our
focus, we didn't want anything to get in the road of that focus. We did not want to jeopardize that focus by prejudging
where we'd come out on CCAR or prejudging how the beginning of the year would start. Beginning of year has started
at $1.2 billion, significantly above where we were in the fourth quarter, as CCAR came out at 5.7, I think 5.6 net of the
capital allocation [ph] list (43:09) So we're now waiting for the Federal Reserve's – to go through the application
process. When they do that, we know our number, and as we go through the year obviously the next question we open
for ourselves is when and under what conditions we would pursue buybacks?
But we're not going to react very short term on this. We're trying to do – get this firm back on the rails, which we've
done over the last couple of years in a very deliberate path. And we believe we're now well on that path.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then the good category would be the brokerage margin, which came in higher than what
you guys had expected last quarter. What is your brokerage margin target? Is it still 15%? Seems pretty low. And you
had one peer yesterday report a margin over 20%. So what are you really trying to achieve margin-wise in that
business?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Well, I have to take that one again, Mike, because I was the one who foolishly a
couple of years ago went out with a 20% margin when we had then three years of zero interest rates following it. So I
admitted to my mistake on that and we set a more conservative margin target for the middle of this year which was
15%. The fact that we're ahead of it is good news; we're certainly not going to turn around and reset margins based
upon a short-term impact. Our job is less around what's setting the margins and it's actually delivering them. And what
I'm pleased about is the fact that we're delivering those margins. The competitor numbers I'm not going to talk about,
except to observe that they actually have a different business mix that comprises that ultimate margin number.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Was there anything unusual with the 17% margin this quarter? Or can we consider that a base
looking ahead?
<A - Ruth Porat>: No, there was nothing unusual. As I said the strength versus what is usually a seasonally lower
margin, it's typically seasonally lower because compensation expense tends to be a bit higher in the first quarter. But
what we had offsetting that, as I noted, was the stronger transactional volume in commercial activity was closed-end
funds so that really helped, coupled with the ongoing expense discipline. And so as we look forward you're starting
with a good base in the first quarter with that 17%.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Thank you.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.

Your next question will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of questions. First of all, on
the deposits, you saw about a 4% decline in deposits in Wealth Management, I think overall 3% down. Was that largely
seasonal or was there something else going on there?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Deposits came off in December. We saw some selling out in the market, we think it was primarily
tax driven by investors as distinct from real concern about the market. But our expectation was that it would come back
into the market in the beginning of the first quarter and it did, so it's really just the positioning by investors at the end of
last year and then coming back into the market and staying in the market as they have. So no, there's not anything more
to it than that.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. And then just thinking about your debt underwriting business, given that there's
obviously been pretty strong demand for that product over the last couple of years, you've admitted that you're a little
bit sub scale on high-yield relative to
some of your competitors. Does that have any effect on your desire for a couple hundred basis points of market share
gains within fixed income if that business continues to be relatively robust over the next couple of years?
<A - Ruth Porat>: No, we've set a target of 2% market share increase on an 8% total market share for fixed income
sales and trading. We feel pretty confident with that given the products set. Our fixed income underwriting, which is
actually reported, those sales are reported in the investment banking line and we did have a record – we had a record
quarter last quarter. This first quarter was actually the best ever first quarter that we've had. What that ends up driving
is the secondary sales and trading as you know well. But we feel very good about the – we remain very much focused
on our share gain, equally focused on how we optimize return. So it's really both of those. But no change.

<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. And then let me just confirm finally the 60% compensation ratio in Wealth
Management. You mentioned last quarter that we should think about that ratio being pretty unchanged for the next
couple of quarters. What would allow you to get that ratio down, presuming a steady revenue environment? And is that
something that we should be looking for towards the end of the year?
<A - Ruth Porat>: The 60% compensation ratio in the first quarter is precisely the reason we have indicated that the
margin tends to be seasonally weaker in the first quarter, you tend to have slightly higher comp in the first quarter,
things like [ph] FICA (48:13) and other factor. So it does tend to be a bit higher. Coming down a point or so near-term
is a very – it's a reasonable way to think about it. But the best driver of the comp ratio over time is really the growth of
our lending products. As we've talked about it, we're going to have deposits up to about $140 billion in the two years
post buying in the rest of the Wealth Management business. That's going to support growth of both Wealth
Management lending product and Institutional product. And on the Wealth Management side, it's on a different
compensation grid relative to the formulaic grid that generally drives that comp ratio. And that is what really gives us
meaningful operating leverage in the comp line. And that brings it down to the high 50%s, [ph] again (48:57) over
time.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.

Your next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Hey, good morning.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good morning.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Just want to follow up on, you're sitting on about 23% of your balance sheet in excess
liquidity. Can you discuss where you are sitting in terms of the LCR? Do you feel like you're pretty comfortable for
that or do you need to build more?
<A - Ruth Porat>: On the LCR, we're over 125% and that really is given all that we've done terming out the secured
book. It's obviously just a 30-day test and we do triangulate, as we've talked about on prior calls, with an outlook over a
12-month period of time in a stress environment. One of the reasons liquidity is running at these higher levels, as I
noted, is that we want to ensure that we have ample liquidity, assuming we do acquire the 35% of Wealth Management.
So there's a bit of flexibility thereafter.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay. Maybe just a follow-up, as you buy in the rest, should we – what is the timing around
the deposits? And how quickly do think you can reinvest them? And then I guess longer-term, do you think that can
help you bring down the excess liquidity and, obviously, help improve profitability?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So the deposits, the way it works is, they come in over the two-year period of time. We get about
$14 billion of deposits within a few weeks of closing, and then $40 billion ratably over the following 24 months. And
that will – that supports, as I just said, both retail lending as well as institutional lending. I think the best way to think
about it is, one, it gives us growth opportunities because there's a suite of products within institutional securities that
haven't grown as much as they could because they would be funded with unsecured debt versus substantially more
efficient deposits, but they're still bank appropriate areas and areas where we have real expertise.
So whether you're talking about project finance or commercial real estate, those are good examples of areas where we
could have incremental growth opportunities based on our competencies today and our clients today but it would be
funded with more efficient deposits in the bank.
And then there are also areas where we will be able to move businesses from institutional securities into the bank and
that enables us to do a dollar-for-dollar substitution, reducing unsecured debt and replacing that with deposit funding,

which is more efficient. And so yes, there is some efficiency the comes in, in that way. And then overall, if the question
is also and what does that do for liquidity, as those deposits which are currently really supporting the AFS portfolio go
in to support the lending product, the bank liquidity comes down as those are moving in to support loan growth.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: So we should see that excess liquidity start to come down as those deposits come in?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So initially – yes. If you look over time, the answer to that is yes, but as those deposits come in, for
example, that first $14 billion of deposits -
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Oh, sure. Right. In the short term it could go up, right.
<A - Ruth Porat>: It goes up. Then it goes into the AFS portfolio. It's positive carry on the AFS portfolio. As it comes
down again, because it's supporting loan growth, yes it does come down again, but at a higher return.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Right. Okay. Thanks a lot.

The final question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Snuck in under the wire. Good morning, guys.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Good morning.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good morning.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So just a quick follow up on FICC. Was obviously pretty volatile in some of these markets
here this quarter. Is there any – should we think about maybe the fact that revenue might have been a little bit lower
than usual just because there might have been some principal loss given some of that volatility and that this is actually
really a pretty lousy run rate?
<A - Ruth Porat>: The run rate we do think, given the markets were more challenging, especially in March, just
affected activity. And as I noted, rates was lower and then commodities is dealing with the cyclical headwinds we've
talked about. So I think it is very fair to say we don't view $1.5 billion of revenues, our revenues this quarter, as a
ceiling on what's attainable, even with quarterly seasonality. And I'd point you to the strength that we have in a lot of
areas like credit and the mortgage product and foreign exchange and we would expect that rates is higher.
So we do think that given the strength of the client activity levels that there is upside from here. I think an interesting
way to even just look at the client activity and volumes across the platform is just looking at the brokerage and clearing
line which is up, which really goes to client activity. So long way of saying we don't think that $1.5 billion in revenues
is a ceiling and look forward to the continued activity.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: But were there any principal losses to specifically highlight or was it mostly volume driven
within the FICC line?
<A - Ruth Porat>: There was not principal losses, no.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Great. Thanks. And on capital, once I understand that it's uncertain about when you
get the green light on MSSB, but if we assume that that happens prior to mid-year, is it too aggressive for us to think
about, given where you guys are on capital ratio front, the fact that MSSB is already fully baked into Basel III, that you
could be looking to take a second bite of the apple here with the regulators and a potential buyback with a new
submission?
<A - Ruth Porat>: As James said, our number one focus is closing the Wealth Management acquisition, given the
strategic benefit and the upside from owning 100%, so we're just focused on closing that acquisition which was our

capital request. We are accreting capital, your question is fair, but we want to get it closed before we think about
anything else.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: All right. Figured I'd give that a shot. And then the last one, the lending platform, is there
anything operationally that you guys are waiting on to get going? Because it seems as though you have excess deposits
currently. So it's not really a matter of funding and not having the right funding. So is there a system investment
process you need to go through in order to get everything up and running? Or is there any operational issues holding
you back? Do you want to have all of the MSSB completely bought in before you really start more aggressively
pushing the lending platform? I guess I don't understand why it's been slow to ramp so far?
<A - Ruth Porat>: In 2009 it became clear that over time would we would be buying in the remainder of the wealth
management business and at that point started investing in the systems, the risk management personnel, analytics, to
ensure that at the point we
ended up with full the $140 billion in place, we had the systems and infrastructure requirements there.
The gating factor is and we use this word so often in describing how we're building up the banking team and the
banking effort within wealth management. It's prudent consistent growth. There's no reason to rush it. We want to make
sure that we do it in a high-quality way and that we're leading with risk management. So it is better to do it prudently
over time than to try and rush it and that is really the governor of the growth in that business. We feel good about the
strength and the build, as James said. It's both on the mortgage side and on the PLA side and that's what we're
continuing to do.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay.
<A - Ruth Porat>: I will note one other thing. We said this, I think, last quarter that relative to our peers we are
under-penetrated in lending product and so what we're seeing is good take up and we're just keeping it at a measured
pace.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And at some point after that book, assuming that you guys want to grow that book to
a certain size, does that mean that there will be a transition to accrual accounting and we'll start to see sort of that level
of detail for you all?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well – so we talked about the fact, a couple of quarters – a think over a year ago now – that we
moved from fair value to HFI for our lending product, that's more – most relevant for what we're doing on the
Institutional side. And at this point about 69% of the book is on HFI. So that has been the approach, that was very clear
coming out of the CCAR process over a year ago that, that was a logical way to approach it and that's what we've been
doing systematically.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Thanks.
