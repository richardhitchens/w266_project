Please refer to our reports filed with the SEC for a detailed discussion.
Acknowledging the fact that this call may be webcast for some time to come, we believe it's important to note that our
call includes time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today's date, October 25, 2011.
During today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the
most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the earnings release or the company's supplemental
information package that was included in this morning's 8-K. This package is also available on the Simon website in

David E. Simon
Thank you for joining us today and I'll just give you a quick update on some of the highlights and then we'll open it up
for Q&A. First of all, we reported funds from operation of $1.71 for the quarter, which represents an increase of 19.6%
over the FFO in the third quarter of 2010 as adjusted for the third quarter in 2010 which adds back – add back our debt
extinguishment charge. This result beats First Call consensus by $0.05 per share. We have now met or exceeded
expectations for 29 of the past 31 quarters.
Let me talk about some statistics. Total sales on a rolling 12-month basis were $517 per square foot, up 9.3% from
$473 as of September 30, 2010 which is nearly 60 million square feet of GLA. Now that we've owned Prime for a year,
this quarter we've began to include the Prime portfolio in our statistics, and so we've adjusted September 30, 2010 to
give you a sense of comparability.
There were a couple of analysts out there that suggested that our average base rents went down sequentially. Keep in
mind that we did not go back and adjust 6-30 numbers for Prime, so that reduction in base rent is all associated with
adding Prime into our portfolio, and in fact when you add Prime in on 6-30, we've had – we did have sequential
average base minimum rent growth and Shelly can give you those details later.
Occupancy was 93.9%, 10 basis points higher than the year earlier period and 30 basis points higher than the end of the
second quarter. This was achieved despite the loss of over 160,000 square feet due to liquidations of Borders and
Anchor Blue. The re-leasing spread for the 12 months was $4.77 per square feet. a positive 9.6%. Our re-leasing spread
continues to include all in-line space including spaces larger than 10,000 square feet and most importantly, comparable
property NOI growth was 3.8% for the quarter and 3.2% year-to-date, was driven by increases in minimum and
overage rent.
Development activity quickly, we have three new developments under construction. All are premium outlets, two in the
U.S. and one in Malaysia. We have 22 renovation and expansion projects under construction in the U.S. with
completion dates scheduled for this year and 2012 and the restoration of Opry Mills continues with the completion
expected in the spring of 2012. We also have expansion – significant expansions underway at three premium outlet
centers in Japan.
As we have discussed with you in the past couple of quarters, our development or re-development programs in the U.S.
and abroad is accelerating. We're seeing good value creation opportunities. We expect our share of development spend
to approximate nearly $500 million in 2011 and the potential for 2012, again depending on timing, could approximate
$1 billion. As always, details on the costs and returns and timing of these projects are provided in our supplemental
reporting package.
On the acquisition front, we continue to demonstrate our ability to strategically invest capital. We completed two in this
quarter. First of all, in July we acquired ABQ Uptown, a 220,000 square feet – square foot lifestyle center in
Albuquerque, New Mexico. The center generates sales of approximately $650 per square foot and adds to our presence
in the growing Albuquerque market where we also own Cottonwood Mall.

And in August, we acquired a controlling interest in King of Prussia, one of the truly iconic shopping destinations in
the U.S., increasing our ownership from 12% to 96%. In addition, we have the contractual ability to acquire the
remaining 4% interest in the fall of 2013. This acquisition will be immediately accretive to our earnings and the
property has excellent growth prospects as we expect to increase the NOI at KOP by approximately 30% in the next
three years.
Capital markets, we closed on – in early October on a new unsecured revolving credit facility well ahead of its maturity
date that increased our revolving borrowing capacity to $4 billion with the ability to increase it to $5 billion during its
term and can be extended to October 30, 2016 at our sole option. The interest rate is LIBOR plus 100 and the facility
provides for money market competitive bid option which we expect to even lower the indicative pricing of LIBOR plus
100. We also have lower pricing grid from our previous facility and a new maturity, as I mentioned, out to five years,
which further enhances our already strong financial position. We also have nearly $930 million of cash on hand
including our share of joint venture cash.
On dividends, we are very pleased to announce that our common stock dividend for the fourth quarter will total $1.10
per share. This is comprised of two separate dividends. First of all, we've now increased our regular quarterly dividend
to $0.90 from $0.80. This represents a 12.5% increase of the dividend as payable on November 30 to shareholders of
record on November 16.
We also announced a special cash dividend of $0.20 per share. This dividend is payable on December 30 to
shareholders of record on December 16. These two dividends as I mentioned to you earlier total $1.10 for the quarter
and increases our total payout from $3.50 for the 2011 calendar year which we expect to approximate our 2011 taxable
income. The new $0.90 quarterly dividend rate also positions us to have a trajectory of at least $3.60 per share in 2012,
and we'd expect to revisit our dividend again in October to ensure that we're paying 100% of our 2012 estimated
taxable income.
Now let me turn to guidance. Based upon our strong results for the quarter and expectations for the balance of the year,
we increased the low end of our 2011 FFO guidance range by $0.15 per share to $6.80 and raised the top end by $0.12
to $6.85 per share. The midpoint of our current guidance is now a full $0.30 above the midpoint of our original 2011
guidance provided to you in February.
Before I open it up for questions, let me just conclude by saying we're pleased with 2011 thus far with our performance.
We've had strong performance at our core properties, accretive acquisitions. We continued to strengthen our already
industry-leading balance sheet, all of which will serve us well in 2011 but also position us for more good stuff in the
future.
We're now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Hi, everyone. Good morning. David or Rick, with respect to Gap's plans to close a chunk of
their stores, specifically where are their rents relative to the $54 level you've been signing leases at, and maybe from a
broader perspective, do you see this as a trend that some of your older more established chains of rightsizing their store
counts now that they're coming up upon lease expirations?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, let me start, then Rick can add. First of all, I think with respect to Gap, Ross, It's very
important to put in perspective they've been shrinking their fleet for the last few years. And I think the recent
announcement was nothing new to us and in fact, as I mentioned to you, we've been seeing a reduction in their fleet
with us for the last three or four years as they continue to have very anemic sales per square feet as well as decreasing
sales per square feet.

Now, just to put The Gap in perspective to your next question is kind of where do we think rents are with Gap, they
were very effective in being able to negotiate a large amount of space, a great space in highly productive malls at below
market rents when they were going through their growth phase. Now obviously, those days are over and it's – even
though we're likely to lose some space in less productive malls, we will more than make it up and I think we've already
have – I don't want to get too granular in rollovers for certain Gap stores, but we will more than make that up as we
reclaim the space in the higher producing malls that we will either shrink their footprint or in fact eliminate their brand
in those centers.
Is it a trend that we're seeing outside of Gap and the answer to that is, not really. But it's a trend that we have seen years
and years of experience where concepts tend to get bigger than what they should and it's a natural evolution in retail,
but frankly, they're the only one going through this kind of downsizing on a material basis.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Okay, appreciate that. And then my final question, there's been a few what we'll call "A"
malls that were created this year. But the trend of "B" malls changing hands didn't occur. Can you talk a little bit about
the pricing differential between those two categories and do you think that they've been overdone on both extremes?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I can only speak to our point of view. I mean, we were able to buy King of Prussia and
though we don't talk about individual mall transaction, we're extremely comfortable with the going-in yield and the
expected yield that we will get from that asset. As you might know, we didn't really run the property. We kind of ran it
through a joint venture and that was a terrific relationship over the years with our partners. The fact is we're very
comfortable that there's a lot of upside to achieve from that asset. So I can only talk about what we bought and there's
absolutely no concerns on my behalf in terms of what we paid and the growth that we have from the assets that we
bought.
The "B" malls, look, I think we're still trying to figure out kind of where that market is. There's not right now natural
buyers, so it is going to require a group of opportunity-type funds or entrepreneurs that are going to want to gobble
these up and a lot of that's dependent upon financing. There'll be strategic assets here and there that certain mall
companies might buy. But I still think price discovery is going to eventually occur there and I don't think it will be all
that earth shattering in terms of cap rates.
I still think kind of where the talk is assuming the market comes back on financing will ultimately deliver the values
that people are kind of circling for those assets.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of ISI Group. Please proceed.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Thanks, good morning. Maybe the first question's for Steve. When I kind of look at the implicit
fourth quarter FFO that you're giving given the full-year number, it's just up a little bit from the first – fourth quarter of
last year and I'm just trying to sort of understand why earnings would only be up 1% or 2%? What was non-recurring
last year, just given the strength in the core business, the acquisitions that you've done and probably some savings on
re-financings?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: So you're accusing us of being conservative? If that's the case, I hope you're right. One
thing that you do need to think about, Steve, is that the Prime acquisition does anniversary, and so it is in the full fourth
quarter of 2010 and so that will make a difference.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: No, I understand but if you – and I understand you won't be up 19% again, but at the midpoint of
your new range, you're talking about earnings of kind of $1.85 against $1.82. So I know you like to be conservative. I
know you got a very good track record of beating, but is there anything else that's one-time that occurred last year, like
lease termination fees or gains that may not come up in the fourth quarter this year?

<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, lease termination fees, generally speaking, were higher in 2010. We've had very little
lease termination activity in 2011. The other thing that you do have is that in 2011 – I'd have to look at the fourth
quarter specifically, Steve, but bad debt expense turned out to be a credit for most of 2011 where because of some of
the bankruptcies that have occurred this year, we have seen – while still a below normal level of activity, we have seen
some bad debt expense.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay, and then, David, maybe can you just talk about some of the international opportunities. I
guess there's been a lot of chatter just about your interest in Brazil and Europe over the last three to six months and as
you kind of travel around the world, and look for opportunities. As we kind of look through the European business, in
terms of the assets that you own, occupancy was up a bit, but the sales were kind of flat. I'm just wondering how you're
thinking about some of these markets today in light of sort of the dislocation that's going on in Europe and the stronger
growth in the emerging markets.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well look, I think Europe is going to be in poor challenge for sure. We still like the outlet
business worldwide and right now, that continues to be our primary focus worldwide. We have a worldwide franchise
in the outlet business. So, that's the primary focus to take advantage of and that could be Europe, that could be South
America, certainly Asia. We want to – you see all the stuff that we're doing in Japan, expanding that platform. Korea,
we think we have another deal on the horizon there. Malaysia, we open up in December. So, I think from an
international point of view, the priority will continue to be the outlet business.
Look, I think generally, I think we've proven that we have a unique model that allows us to acquire, develop, and
improve real estate worldwide. We certainly want to look at everything that's out there to do it. We do believe that there
is some – if there's a company that could really turn into a global retail real estate company, it's us. And that's going to
require us to look at everything there. There could be dislocation in Europe that could create buying opportunities, on
the other hand, sometimes those things never come to fruition. But day-to-day, we're looking at how to grow the outlet
business center internationally. That's the number one priority.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Steve Sakwa>: Sure.

Our next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Jay B. Habermann>: Hi, good morning, everyone. David, just back to the original question in terms of store
closings. As you think about leasing spreads over the next 12 months, is your assessment that there really should be a
minimal impact, I guess, and maybe go off leasing spreads and occupancy?
<A - David E. Simon>: From The Gap or generally?
<Q - Jay B. Habermann>: Yeah, just in general from some of the store closings that have been talked about recently
or planned store closings.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, look, I think not everything is robust in retail real estate. It never seems to be. And every
year we've got to fill the book again from people that are scaling back, but we believe strongly that as we look at our
rents and our occupancy costs, we will have the ability to increase our rents as we recapture space. We've proven that
almost 20 years now as a public company. So, I don't expect that to change at all. I think The Gap's a great opportunity.
They're under-performing. A lot of those spaces are well below our average rents and we look to take advantage of that
as well. And we're going to look at those one by one individually. So, I would expect our ability to produce rent spreads
assuming we generally have a decent economy, to certainly be produced again next year. Rick?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yeah, the only thing that I would add is that we're focusing on a Gap announcement but
there is a significant number of tenants that are doing well, are looking to expand and in fact, have already come to us
and us and said, well, if you get that Gap room back, we want it. So I would not just view this through the prism of a

Gap contraction. You have to also bear in mind all the tenants out there that are doing well, looking to expand and the
fact that there's virtually no new development. So whatever demand is being created among our retailers, it's going to
be satisfied out of the existing inventory in the industry.
<Q - Jay B. Habermann>: Okay. No, that's helpful. And Rick maybe as well can you give us some sense of perhaps
demand for 2012 or commitments at this point? Or is it really...
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, we're in the midst of our leasing now and demand has maintained pretty stable.
There are a number of tenants I've just said like Apple, Forever 21, Loft, Love Culture that are expanding. You've seen
the significant number of IPOs being done by retailers that are active in the mall area and they're recapitalized and
looking to grow. And we are sanguine about our prospects but as David emphasized, we are at the mercy of the
macroeconomic environment. So if things stay as they are, we should be okay.
<Q - Jay B. Habermann>: Okay. And just final question in terms of some of the class A transactions that we've seen
in the mall category, with the 30% increase in NOI, are you really looking at stabilized yields of 6% plus?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Oh, yeah.
<Q - Jay B. Habermann>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citigroup. Please proceed.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Hi, good morning. I'm here with Michael Bilerman as well.
<A - David E. Simon>: How are you?
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Good. Just in terms – just going back to the international question, I believe you're down in
Brazil recently and it sounds like internationally, you're more focused on the outlet side of business. But I'm just
curious to get your takeaways on the mall business in Brazil and whether or not that's something that could interest you
at some point?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, it's a vibrant economy. The malls there produce a significant amount of cash flow –
higher cash flow per foot or per meter however you'd like to look at it than they do in the U.S. which to me was very
interesting. They charge for parking which is very interesting, given that you've got an emerging customer there that
you would think would be hard to charge for parking.
A lot of positives, I think long-term, Brazil's – I'm sure there'll be lots of ups and downs given its historical nature but
long-term, I think the country obviously's got a tremendous amount going for it. There's some worries because the cash
flow per foot or per meter is so high. It's counter-intuitive versus say an emerging market. You would think it would be
low and growing but despite that, I think a lot of that has to do with supply and demand. It's a very intriguing market,
lots of supply coming on. So it'll be interesting to see how that all shakes out but an impressive group of companies and
malls and overall, an impressive marketplace.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: David, its Michael Bilerman speaking. Just a question on the dividend, just thinking
about how you sort of thought through the process in terms of paying out a special to get to a 100% payout ratio versus
setting sort of a dividend run rate without doing these sort of top-up specials at the end of the year. And how you
discuss that with the board and sort of how you came to this decision. I assume you could have paid out the bare
minimum to 90% but you went to 100% and just thinking about where you stand and how you think about next year?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think this year to put our dividend in perspective, there's a thing called bonus
depreciation that we took advantage of. And the reason we – so our taxable income is lower probably than a normal run
rate because the fact of the matter is that we took advantage of the kind of the bonus depreciation that has – that

Congress has put forward to kind of stimulate the economy. Whether that's worked or not, that's for another debate.
Next year, we don't know if that's going to be there or not, and I think we've told you from day one, we want to pay out
our taxable income at a bare minimum. So, our run rate now is $3.60. We probably will have a higher taxable income
than that next year and I kind of like having a run rate that's going to grow over time and then the ability to top it off
based upon our taxable income which includes a lot of different things.
So I actually think it's the more elegant way than raising it significantly and beyond kind of where the raise was. And
then in terms of if your taxable income ends up less than that, you're paying out more than that and given what's going
on with taxable income for corporate America today, we thought this was the best, more prudent and also reinforces
our strategy to provide a growing dividend. Not many REITs are growing their dividend. Certainly not many are
growing on a 12.5% basis.
And being able to use the extra capital that we have to fund our business and generate even more earnings and I think
it's a pretty good cycle to be on. So I read your thing, I was confused that you'd say disappointed. I don't know. I've had
a lot of shareholders that were very happy including the board.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: But it's a question more so of do you get paid for a $0.20 special at the end of the
year? Or do you generate more institutional interest, especially from generalist investors about having a consistent
quarterly dividend that increases over time?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well it did increase. It went from $0.80 to $0.90. And if – we had to pay out $3.50 and so if
you take the logic of what you're saying is that we would have to pay out $1.10 in the quarter and that would be $4.40
for next year, and that's not kind of the trajectory that we really want to convey. So I think it's the right thing to do. We
appreciate your input on it. We're very pleased with the outcome of it.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: What was the bonus amount, the depreciation in terms of how much it affected
taxable income for 2011?
<A - David E. Simon>: It was roughly, I'm going to say, $0.25, something like that...
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Less than $0.20, yeah.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: So you're set up for $3.75 for next year, so you're already...
<A - David E. Simon>: I think next year will be higher than that and that allows us to be put on a trajectory higher
than that.

Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Macquarie. Please proceed.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Thank you. If you guys take a broader view of the economy, it seems like, for one, very few times
in history, it seems like retail sales are doing very well despite the lack of consumer confidence. How long do you think
this divergence can last, especially in light of today's pretty bad print?

better consumer that does have disposable income to spend and we've been successful in doing that. We don't always
do it. We have certain properties that don't do that but generally, I think as long as the economy continues to at least
have some GDP growth, we'll be able to continue to attract a better customer that has – that I think has disposable
income to spend.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay and just to follow-up on a previous question, what would your sales per square foot and same
store NOI numbers be without the Prime inclusion?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, Ki Bin, this is Steve. The sales without Prime, I think would have been $3 a square
foot higher and the – excuse me, $7 a square foot higher and the comp NOI number does not include Prime. It won't
include Prime until the next quarter.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: All right. Thank you, guys.

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Hi, good morning. From the – we know from what the retailers have been saying on their calls
that there's...
<A - David E. Simon>: Hey Paul, can you speak up?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yeah, we can barely hear you.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Is this any better?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: That's a little better.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Okay, sorry. We just note from what the retailers have been saying that there's a lot of demand
for the "A's" and when they comment about space in the "B's," they talk about their being more getting stale, but from
your perspective, has there been any shift in the negotiations for space in the "B's" this year, as retailers maybe get a bit
more encouraged by their sales or is it still much harder slogging than in your top quartile?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Paul, this is Rick. I think we have always seen a pretty direct relationship with the
productivity of our properties and our ability to drive our rents as we have been able to increase the productivity of our
properties. We're making them more attractive to retailers and we have been able to drive occupancy and rents in those
properties. We put in our press release the fact that in 2011, we're opening 39 new anchors in big boxes, or almost 1.7
million square feet across the portfolio. We're renovating another 18 properties. All of this is making our properties
more attractive, driving market share, driving sales, and helping us lease the properties. Is it always going to be a
function of the market position and productivity? Sure but we think we're creating better product for our leasing guys to
sell.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Okay, can I sort of – on a similar thing, as you all look at the expiring leases for 2012 at $32,
that's like 20%, almost below where your in place average is. How should I think about – I mean, is that an opportunity
to take re-leasing spreads higher from where they are now or is it maybe representative of – you have a big portfolio
because you're representative of the types of malls where you have more expirations. How do we think about it next
year based on that $32 number?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think it's very positive quite frankly. So look, our size is such that these numbers
actually mean something, whereas others with smaller portfolios may have statistics that could indicate something other
than what it is just because they're smaller. So the fact is at the end of the day, that rollover is a great opportunity for
the company and we intend to take advantage of it. And we've said consistently that our leases are under-market. I
think that helped us performed in the Great Recession. Recall, if I could, Paul, that we did not have negative NOI

growth in our portfolio during the Great Recession. And I think that that is a good statistic that creates the insurance
policy of our ability to generate comp NOI growth.
The size of that spread is dependent upon a lot of macro things, but the bottom line, it's a great spot to be in. And
additionally, it lasts for a long time. So it is not a – it's not a one-year event. So let's hope we can continue on the track
that we've demonstrated for the past several years.

Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Spector>: Good morning. Actually this is Jeff Spector. I'm here with Craig. We have a few questions.
If I could just ask a couple first. David, I guess just thinking about the bumps in 2011 in your guidance, what were
some of the surprises I guess you felt happened during the course of the year? And as you're laying out your 2012
budgets, I guess from a macro standpoint what are you thinking at this point?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, the biggest surprise, pleasant surprise is that we've had comp NOI that's been higher than
the budget. To me, that's the most important thing that we can do. Sometimes it's out of our control because it's tied to
retailer sales. Bankruptcies could impact that. We've had more of that this year than last year if you recall. So, to me,
that's always the number one focus is how do we increase the cash flow on a comp basis from the property.
So with that said, I mean that's the focus. Prime, we've outperformed on our Prime portfolio, in terms of our
underwriting and our expectations there, that helps fuel our growth. Rates were a little lower than what we've projected
as well and – so those were kind of the material things we had. Offsetting that was some bankruptcies less lease
settlement income, but that's kind of the ups and downs.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Spector>: And how are you then thinking about your 2012 budget from a macro standpoint? I know
you're not providing guidance but anything you could comment on?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, we're just about to start that excruciating process, don't remind me, okay? We
actually do bottoms up property by property so if we look a little dazed. If you see us at the end of Thanksgiving, we
kind of get dazed by that time. But we actually do that. It's a little early. I mean I think the fact of the matter is the
biggest caveat that we have is all about the macro, where is the economy? Where is consumer confidence? The election
year throws a whole set of psychological issues at the consumer, none of which are positive. But you know what? We'll
figure it out and I expect to have another good year and another year of growth, but we're right now in that process. As
you know, Jeff, we do that beginning of – or kind of right when we do our year-end results. So – but we'd expect to
have another good year.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Spector>: Maybe just one more question before Craig asks his. I guess, thinking about the different
formats, it's pretty clear that Premium Outlets continues to shine, outperform. I guess can you – could you provide any
information, I guess, on your shopping center portfolio versus the malls as we head into Christmas, the holiday season?
Any feedback from tenants, whether it's the smaller tenants or the big box?
<A - David E. Simon>: I'll let Rick go ahead.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: A couple of things. One, all four of our platforms are positive to both budget and to actuals
last year. So they're all performing well year-to-date. In terms of the holiday, we literally have four tenants in here
today, and talking to them, they're all anticipating up, probably 2% to 3%. Inventories are very tight. People are not
chasing sales. They'd rather leave a few sales on the table and make sure that they drive their margins and are not over
inventory.

And the only other point I would say is there's a – and as we think about our world, there's a pretty high correlation to
the better retailers and how the S&P 500 does. So we're to a degree, I think really, focused on how that better
consumer's thinking about their position and that'll be reflected to a degree by the S&P 500.
<Q - Craig R. Schmidt>: I guess – this is Craig. I had a question on the King of Prussia, the potential 30% increase in
NOI. Clearly the conversion of Strawbridge will be a big part, but is there other things that'll be helping you push
towards that goal?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think that is part of that, Craig, for sure. But additionally, it's just we believe that in
putting in all of the Simon programs that we didn't put in previously because of the partnership limitations, all of that
led to that cash flow. And whether they're all of our marketing programs, going to fixed cam is an example, we feel like
the rents weren't at the level they should be, given the quality of the asset.
So all of that plus it's really interesting and it's probably somewhat premature to talk about it, but I'll go ahead, is that
we are looking to – put Strawbridge aside because as you know, that's under construction – but our ultimate focus in
this property will be to combine The Plaza with The Court with additional retailer – retail. And we have the FAR
ability to do that and we're just discussing that concept with the village but we think that's a great opportunity to really
integrate both of these properties and make it one unbelievable shopping destination beyond what it is today.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: But just to be clear, Craig – this is Steve – that's not in the 30%. The 30% is just executing
the redevelopment of the Strawbridge and then Simonizing the property by doing some of the things that David talked
about like the conversion to fixed cam and the full implementation of the marketing programs.
<Q - Craig R. Schmidt>: Great. And then just one last question, if you could talk a little bit about what you're doing
with Nanuet Mall? I mean I understand that may be more of an outdoor or mixed use and if you're going to doing any
kind of repositioning by the future tenants?
<A - David E. Simon>: We are about to demolish the mall in the next month or so and we will end up creating a –
what I'll call for better or worse – a lifestyle center, open-air center that will be anchored by Sears. Macy's, they will
stay in place. There'll be a road and retail kind of through the property. We'll have a health club where we'll add a
high-end food operation, restaurants and specialty retail and all systems go there. We're just about done with the all the
planning and the demolition as I said should occur here in the near future.
<Q - Craig R. Schmidt>: Great. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: Thank you, good morning. Question – first question from me, it's in the area that several
other questions have kind of been on and maybe coming at it from a slightly different angle, David. Looking at your
average portfolio base rent and average sales, obviously sales trends have been very, very positive in spite of the
negative productivity contribution I guess from Gap. And your average base rent in the portfolio is now at 7.5%, about
as low as it's been in a long, long time now.
We know the outlet center portfolio is included in that metric now, and I just wondered if you could help us think about
how you think about that 7.5% number? Over the course of the cycle in the past, it can run up to the mid-8% or higher,
and do you think it'll have that upside potential given the change in the composition of the total portfolio?
<A - David E. Simon>: There's no reason, assuming we have a stable economy, growing economy that we're not going
to work our way back to that level. Now retail – I mean, there's a lot of pressure in retail. We have the consumer under
pressure so it is going to take work. It's going to take some level of stability. It's going to require the mood to get a little
bit better generally in the country, but I'm actually feeling that these things will work their way through the system in

that way and it's hard to give you a specific number, but we do think that that presents a lot of opportunity on the rent.
There's no question about it.
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: And I guess going to the point about Gap given that Gap's productivity trend is negative to
the rest of the portfolio, presumably, the sooner you got that space back, the better off it will be in terms of that metric.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, there's no doubt you will have a step backward and then two steps forward, because as
you re-claim the space, you're going to have downtime and in some cases it's going to take a little bit a period of time to
lease it up. But at the end of the day – we've done all sorts of analysis on this – at the end of the day, we just think
there's tremendous upside overall. It's not to say that there aren't going to be some holes that will be generated as we
lose some of the Gap stores, Gap brands, whether it's Old Navy, Banana or just the Gap brand. But over a – not a long
period of time, but over a two-year period of time as you lease up the space that we reclaim, there's going to be
tremendous upside and even in "A" malls, their productivity does not allow them to – to essentially pay market rents
where others do. And the benefit that we see in "A" malls from them there versus others has been diminished somewhat
as they shrink their portfolio appetite.
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: Okay. Just a quick question regarding the projected rate of return on development spend. In
the quarter, the projected stabilized return on the anchor big box segment of the development went down a little bit
from 12 to 10. I know there was movements in and out of what's on that schedule. Was there any changes in cost
projections on projects or was it simply – it's the lower number simply because of what came out in the third quarter?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: It's just a matter of the mix of projects, Jim. In fact, we've had very good forecasting and in
the overall environment, our construction costs have been coming in at or below what we have been using for our
capital allocation approvals.
<A - David E. Simon>: And I think – I would say one thing, Jim, our people are used to – hopefully the conservative
nature in how we present ourselves resides throughout the building and certainly when we approve projects – I mean
the level of sandbagging in our projects depends on who's doing the project, but it's institutional in nature. So I would
hope over time that we would produce better results than that, but Rick's right. It is in the mix.
But we're being very aggressive and really focused on trying to make our properties the best that they can be. Spending
a lot of time, part of the reason to do more quicker, the reason why we hired Contis to help in that area. He's very
focused on it. So – but hopefully we'll outperform those numbers.
Now, Jim, you did mention in one of your reports, I tried to address it. I garbled. I'm not very good at reading those
things. But I do hope you realize that the 6-30 base rent did not include Prime. When you do, we actually do have
sequential growth. So I just wanted to reinforce that with you.
<Q - James W. Sullivan>: Okay, good. And final question for me, David, the Marketplace Equity Act recently
introduced in Congress, I know it's a modification from the prior bill that was posed or proposed, I just wonder if you'd
like to make a comment about it? And I don't know if you're hearing anything from people you work with about what
kind of success it might have?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well look, I think we're very focused on it. ICSC is very focused on it. I'd like to thank David
Henry and ICSC for finally recognizing – I think David's been the key to this to really to get – to create the level
playing field. There's two, or three, or four different approaches on how to do it. The good news is I think Congress is
beginning to understand the difference, the fact that the level – that the field is not level. We're still educating certain
congressmen and women about the fact that this is not a new tax. That's going through its process.
Everybody that we talk to understands the fairness of it and I think even Amazon with their different deals that they're
doing state-by-state recognizes that the days are over where they get the level – where they get the unfair advantage.
But it would be much better to do it at a national level. That's what's really being cried for than to do it on a
state-by-state level, but as you might imagine, it's a process. But we're actually feeling – Rick is involved, too. He can
add to it. But we're actually feeling like there is hope to get something out there that can be passed by Congress.

<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: And the only thing I would add is that you're talking about billions of dollars in lost
revenue from the States, and it's a tax that's already on the books. So, the combination of factors are coalescing that I

Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Donnelly>: Good morning, guys. If I could actually stick on that topic, David, the Marketplace Equity
Act, are you concerned that solution could actually prove to be something of a Trojan horse, in that by leveling the
playing field, really the door is open for online retailers like Amazon to actually provide same-day delivery service to
major markets because...
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think they're looking to do that anyway, right?
<Q - Jeffrey J. Donnelly>: Right.
<A - David E. Simon>: So that's going to happen. I wouldn't be surprised if people like ourselves play a role in that.
Believe me, we're focused on that. So, Jeff, the fact is that's what Amazon wants to go to. We've got to create the mall
version of that. But we're still not going to want to give them the benefit of exempting sales tax. I don't think it's a
Trojan horse. I don't think it's going to hugely change the fact that Internet shopping's important, but the fact of the
matter is there's a lot of people, the more research you do, that do a lot of – it used to be they researched online and
then went to shop physically. Now they go shop physically. They understand the difference that they don't have to pay
the sales tax, and actually go to the physical environment, do all the research and buy online.
All you have to do is ask Best Buy to get their perspective on it. And I think that needs to be eliminated. There's no
reason why Amazon and certain others need that benefit, so same-day delivery's a different issue as far as I'm
concerned.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: And the only thing I would add is that our retailers that are operating the malls are also
very focused on fulfillment and allowing their customers that want to have an online experience to fulfill those
purchases at the property and that just emphasizes one of the benefits we have of being able to facilitate those things in
a much more efficient manner.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Donnelly>: Yeah, I think I would agree, that's it not necessarily all one nor the other, online or bricks
and mortar. I mean, in some ways you saw in the Gap announcement, where they were scaling back on their mall
stores, but I think ultimately retailers are trying to find a way to provide value. And in that case, you saw Gap increase
– they're looking to increase their outlet store count.
To kind of switch gears to that, I mean, do you think that – you mentioned that you did not see a trend among mature
retailers looking to scale back their store count. But do you think we're at the beginning of maybe another secular
growth period for outlet demand, as retailers maybe being to discover that channel, if not here or then maybe more
broadly outside of the U.S.?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think the outlet business has been going strong for a number of years partly
because I think we had a little bit to do with it if I could in that we took it out of the backroom, more into the front
room. We personally, Rick and I, personally talked to a number of retailers talking about how it's not brand negative,
but brand positive for them and what's brand negative is when they do want to sell merchandise to sell it in their store,
their full price store. It creates all sorts of promotional issues and it, in a lot of cases, clouds what they're trying to do at
the full price level.

So, that change has been going on for a number of years plus the quality of the product that we built, how we execute
it, the tenant mix, the marketing, kind of all has been upgraded to the next level and we're still making improvements
on it to make it the best experience that we can make it.
So I think that trend continues. They still want – there still is a high amount of outlet demand. We're seeing a lot of
demand in our Mills portfolio because that's representing an outlet distribution channel. So I think it's – we're seeing
that internationally. I just happened to talk to a worldwide retailer that was talking to us about – wants to talk to us
about China outlet, which I'm always a little bit worried about for all sorts of reasons but for crying out loud, we're
building an outlet in Malaysia, right?. It's going to open in a month. So, it's there. We expect to take advantage of it in
other markets as well.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Donnelly>: If I could just ask the last question on – back on this "B" and "C" mall topic. As a property
investor, what realistically is the ball case for A "B" and "C" mall investment today? I mean, do you think it's a
fundamental story about occupancy and rent, or is it really a capital market story about leverage? Because your earlier
comment, that it's more about play for the entrepreneurial crowd, kind of implies an unattractive risk return profile, and
not to leave Steve out, I was curious what does the state of the capital markets look like for "B" and "C" product,
because there are a lot of anecdotes out there. The traditional equity and debt capital providers to the mall space really
don't look at malls anymore under $350 a square foot in sales.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, it's very simple. The operating story is that, if it's a "B" and "C" mall and there's a
reason for it to exist, it's going to have a stable cash flow, and in fact, if that area continues to have economic growth,
that cash flow will grow. And the fact of the matter is, if you have appropriate management running it, you're able to
add to the critical mass of that "B" and "C" property.
The market may not be overly exciting but the cash flow ought to maintain itself and in fact, if you execute
appropriately, you may even increase market share because there's a lot of – where the market share got diffused, were
a lot of these strip centers that are – that in lot of cases are suffering from oversupply and not a clear winner and loser,
and a lot of box movement back and forth.
So, from that standpoint, I think you're going to – and I think frankly, from our "B" malls, they've actually performed
reasonably well in a lot of cases in the Great Recession. Obviously, depending on the cap rate and depending on the
financing, there's a pretty good return on equity that they're generating and I think the ability to gain market share is all
part of the story.
Today, the CMBS market, one week it's on, one week it's off. We're getting bids so I think it's back on. Last week, it
wasn't. I still think that that market's still has a lot of – it's more affected by what's going on in the risk on, risk off trade
than it is what's going on in the real estate world.

board for whatever strange reason turned down that deal. They shouldn't have in hindsight. We felt comfortable that we
would have been able to execute a better growth story than they would have had by themselves.
We're still waiting. We're still shareholders. I have more faith, frankly, today than I did before because at least Mr.
Whittaker is a large shareholder. I think he's a very capable gentleman to reignite that company. So we're assessing how
that proceeds but we have no interest in buying the company.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: So right now you're more of just a passive shareholder who obviously would be there
for advice but you're not looking to get active in the company, is that correct?
<A - David E. Simon>: That's correct.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: That's correct...
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: And then sort of following that trend, what's your strategy? Is it just simply now a
stock investment or just something that you would look to unwind then?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think in this case we'll look at all of our options. That market is relatively depressed
just from a lot of macro issues. So we're kind of adopting a wait and see approach. That could change. That could
change but right now it's wait and see. I do think Mr. Whittaker is the kind of entrepreneur that that company needs to
get it reinvigorated. So, we're kind of waiting to see whether or not that can happen. And look, we're certainly an
important shareholder. We're certainly there to help anything we can do to make the company perform better.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. Second question is recently there've been a number of items of sort of
public-private, whether it's obviously Westfield going back into World Trade. There's the whole Willis Point here in
New York where it looks like Macerich and Taubman are looking at putting together bids. The Journal this morning
featured the Fulton Street subway stop adjacent to World Trade where maybe there's an opportunity for a retail landlord
to come in and manage some of that retail space. Curious from your perspective, you guys have spoken a lot about
development, re-development, but none of it has involved public-private. Just sort of curious if that's by design, maybe
it's not worth the headache or the opportunities are – the yields just don't make sense or if those opportunities are truly
few and far between for the real, out-of-the-park type situations?
<A - David E. Simon>: I'd say, all of the above. I mean, we've never been a real – we've never – we've kind of always
adopted the approach not to do RFPs whether it's from a private – whether it's just a private company or individual
that's looking to sell his land, whether it's a public entity trying to re-development – redevelop something. We just don't
really like the RFP process. We won't rule it out but the fact of the matter is I've never personally gotten excited about
it and the public-private stuff is hard to make money. I think if we felt like we didn't have a lot of opportunities with
our existing fleet of assets and our ability to look at things throughout the world, maybe we would resort to that. But at
this point, we just – I just have never personally gotten excited about it.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed.
<Q - Carol L. Kemple>: Good morning. Only question I have that hasn't been answered is relating to the income
statement. Is there a reason why G&A grew so much in the quarter?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, part of that is our recent LTIP program that we've had with the senior management.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Yeah, hi. Not sure I saw it disclosed anywhere but what was the investment in King of
Prussia and how was it financed?
<A - David E. Simon>: That, we – again, we don't disclose individual mall transactions and it was financed – I think
we announced that partly cash and partly from our line of credit.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Correct.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Okay. And secondly, the leasing spreads of about 10% for the nine months – or for the
year-to-date spreads of about 10%, what is the difference between the cash spread and the GAAP spread?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Michael, this is Steve. That is a cash spread. That is ending cash rent at the time the lease
expired or terminated to beginning cash rent with the new tenant or the renewal of the existing tenant. So if you convert
it to GAAP, it would be higher.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Yeah, about how much higher roughly is it?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Michael, I don't have the number in front of me. It's not something that we tend to look at
because as David has said on many, many occasions, his laser focus tends to be cash.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Sure.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: But it's – let us take a look at it and I will get you a number.

Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Hi and good afternoon, guys.
<A - David E. Simon>: Hey, Rich.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Steve, following up on that for a second, the line of credit's at about $1.8 billion at this
point. What are you guys thinking there in terms of – I mean you're up about $900 million from the last quarter. I
assume again mostly because of the acquisitions. What are you thinking about in terms of terming that out?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, as you know, Rich, the spreads in the bond market gapped out late summer and have
been at kind of wide through the year over the course of the last two or three months. The good news is they have
gotten better. The tenor in the bond market has clearly gotten better, so it is something that we're paying attention to.
And the good news is have the flexibility to be patient. But as we think about that level of outstandings on the credit
facility, if the bond market continues to improve, we'd love to term it out.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay. So doing CMBS, it sounds like is not really something that's an option at this point,
but maybe an unsecured note over the next six months would be the way to go?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Rich, the CMBS market as David mentioned earlier, we're getting quotes. On many assets,
we're getting very good quotes, but where we're focused there is primarily just a refinanced existing mortgage debt that

comes due as opposed to put mortgages on current unencumbered assets. I think...
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. And I'd just add, Rich, this is David. Even with all of the ups and downs of the capital
markets both unsecured market and the CMBS market, it is more cost-effective in the unsecured market versus the
CMBS market, for sure, especially as you look at – factor in fees, amortizations, any...
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Audit costs.
<A - David E. Simon>: The whole nine yards.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Appraisals, yes.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay, all right. Great. Thanks, guys. And then...
<A - David E. Simon>: And Rich, you made a comment about our sequential average-based rent, you're clear on that
now, I hope.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Yeah, you made that very clear. Thanks, Dave, I appreciate that. Let me ask you guys if I
could on...
<A - David E. Simon>: Part of my job, part of my job.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Yeah, no that was good. I got you. I got you loud and clear.. On the redevelopment scene, I
think you guys have said that you were looking to do a couple billion dollars of deliveries over the next say five years. I
mean, should we think in terms of $500 million kind of average per year deliveries as we look out to 2015? Is that sort
of the scope of the redevelopment scene?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think – and Rick can elaborate – but I think right now '12 could shape up to accelerate
some of that. So it could end up in '12 that we would have committed $1 billion in our redevelopment portfolio. So
actually, that number could accelerate, Rich.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: In terms of the timing of it.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yeah, Rich, this is Steve. If you recall, the number that we floated out was a quarter or two
ago and it was primarily centered around the 17 or 18, what we call transformational opportunities. I think number one
we've added to that list as we've continued to examine the portfolio and two, the ordinary course of business stuff like
Rick mentioned with the 40 boxes and all that is kind on top of those transformational opportunities.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay, good. And would – are you guys doing any densification sorts of efforts? I didn't
really see that. I'm guessing they're in there somewhere but where you add apartments or you add condos or office, that
kind of thing?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, we are very focused on that and if you look at the projects that we have opened,
several of them have both office and res multi-family and hotel components. The primary one being Domain where we
have a Weston plus multi-family in both phases, plus office in both phases. And obviously we're working right now on
the approval process for a very substantial residential tower over at Copley in Boston. So it's very much a part of our
focus and we in fact have a dedicated team looking to bring those incremental uses into our properties.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay all right, good guidance. And thank you, Rick. And then the last thing I had was
David it seemed that on the last call, the Chinese outlet scene was a little closer than you made it sound just on one of
the previous questions here. How close are you guys to doing something in China with as far as outlet centers goes?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think we'll make a decision here in the next couple of months. So it will either happen
or it won't. But it won't drag on for two or three years. So we're in the discussion – serious discussion phase and that
will either come to fruition in the next couple of months or it won't.

Our next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Thank you. David, listening to your comments earlier in regards to "B" malls or at least
those that are legitimate in terms of their existence given the quality of the market and their ability to maintain cash
flow, I know you've had that question perhaps in the past, but do you feel more inclined to be a consolidator of "B"
mall space at this point or is it still something that's far in the future?
<A - David E. Simon>: I don't think we will be other than we'll always look at what's there and if there's a strategic fit
for us, we could do a few deals. That's not to say we're running away from the product. It's just that we've got a lot to
do within our mall portfolio as it exists. And unless there's a strategic view of that asset or something to do really
something special with it, we probably wouldn't.
And the fact of the matter is what we've grown in the mall business frankly through M&A, we'll never rule that out.
And when you tend to do bigger deals, you tend to get – despite what we all say in the mall business, we don't all have
"A" properties. Nobody does. So you tend to – if there was ever deals to be done or kind of on the broader, more
portfolio basis, we'll tend to get some "B's" in that area and that would be a natural way for us to have more exposure in
that product, which is – we're fine with.
But to go out and look to grow that business on a one-off basis just doesn't excite us as much as taking what we have
and making it better.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: And just to emphasize David's point on not running away from it, if you look at our capital
expenditures, we are actively renovating, redeveloping and adding anchors to a number of the properties that are
perhaps lower productivity just because they're in smaller markets, but they're providing very stable cash flow, and with
renovations and anchor additions and opportunity to contribute to our comparable NOI growth.

Our next question comes from the line of Ben Yang with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please proceed.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Yeah. Hi, good morning. I have another question on the international plan. David, you did
make a few comments on China and I realized it's not an immediate priority, but one of your peers recently purchased a
real estate consulting firm based in China. So I'm curious, you mentioned maybe building outlet center share but if you
ever decide to re-enter China, do you see yourself maybe taking a similar path of this peer?
<A - David E. Simon>: You broke up on the last part.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: I'm just wondering, I mean, you mentioned maybe building outlet centers in China. Could we
possibly see you buying a company already on the ground there instead?
<A - David E. Simon>: No.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: It would be our people. I mean we would likely joint venture with an existing Chinese
company, whether they own the land or whether they were in the development business or a retailer, much like we did

when we built the Wal-Mart stores but we would not buy a company to do that, no.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay. Great. And just last question, you mentioned The Gap closing more stores than they had
previously planned being no surprise to you and since it sounds like they're basically not renewing upcoming leases,
and I assume you can look through your portfolio to figure out how many leases are expiring over the next few years,
where they're located, good centers or bad, what's your expectation for store closures from The Gap and how many of
those spaces are spoken for today?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, let me just clarify what I did say. I mean, they're not closing all their stores. They're
closing certain stores that they want to close and we're taking over space that we want them to close and we're trying to
find a happy middle ground on other – the majority of the stores. So but – so that's the first point that I just want to
clarify. And I will tell you that I don't think their acceleration of store closures is all that different than what they've
done the last couple years. Now, it may be marginally accelerated but it's not all that different than what they've been
doing frankly since '09, '10 and '11 and going into '12.
So that's the second point is at the end of the day, when we look at everything there, if we got all the real estate back for
whatever reason, they want to get out, we want them out, they decided not to do any U.S. deals, whatever the reason, at
the end of the day, we think the income stream that would come from those spaces would be higher than it is today that
they're paying.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: And can you just remind us how many Gap- branded stores are in your portfolio and of that
amount would you – how many do you think are going to close based on this estimate?
<A - David E. Simon>: Let me just say this, if you look at our schedule we have – in our APA, we have 386 stores, if
I'm right?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Right.
<A - David E. Simon>: Take away 138 of those because those are in the outlet business. So that gives you down to,
kind of the whole Gap fleet, so that's like 240.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yeah.
<A - David E. Simon>: And then I would say, roughly 50% is Gap, 25% is Old Navy, and then the balance is Banana
somewhere in that range.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: So it sounds pretty modest overall.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, it's a big relationship but we're certainly focused that we're going to replace as much of
the real estate where we don't think they're paying market rent.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure, thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Co. Please proceed.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Yes, good afternoon. Most of my questions have been answered but just two very quick
ones. Going into Christmas, I know you talked a little bit about just what you're seeing from your retailer perspective
but in regards to the typical temporary tenants that show up during Christmas, what are you seeing demand-wise from
those guys to take up space?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Demand has been pretty stable. We are finding that happily there are more and more
national tenants that are also now looking to establish stores on a short-term basis as the way to seeing if their customer
is located in that property. So that demand is constant pretty much year-over-year and we're very pleased with where

<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just in regards to the recent deals that you've done, Steve, I
know – pricing-wise you weren't talking about King of Prussia but could you give any pricing details on Albuquerque?
<A - David E. Simon>: Again, we don't do individual mall deals but we're great stewards of capital. Both of these
deals will – are very accretive. They got good rent growth in both of them.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Okay. Just one more last question. With the Davis Street asset, any reason why you were
not involved in those deals? Is that something you were interested in but you just didn't play a part in that process, just
given that class "A" malls don't come up that often in the market?
