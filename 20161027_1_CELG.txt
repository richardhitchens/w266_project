Thanks, Stephanie, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings conference call. The press release reporting
our financial results in addition to the presentation for today's webcast can be accessed by going to the Investor
Relations section of the corporate website at www.celgene.com.
Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are: Mark Alles, our Chief Executive Officer; Peter Kellogg, our
Chief Financial Officer; Jackie Fouse, our Chief Operating Officer; Michael Pehl, President of our Hematology &
Oncology franchise; and Scott Smith, President and Global Head of our Inflammation & Immunology franchise.
As a reminder, during today's call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in
addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may
cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q
on file with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we undertake no duty to update or revise
them. Reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part
of the earnings release.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark J. Alles
Thank you, Patrick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had an outstanding third quarter
and are excited to review and discuss the results with you, our outlook for the remainder of the year, and our
confidence and optimism in our future.
During the quarter, our global therapeutic franchises continued to build strong demand momentum for our major cancer
and immunology products. The value proposition these therapies bring to patients, physicians, and providers combined
with exceptional execution led to a meaningful acceleration of sales, allowing us to again raise our full-year 2016
guidance and provide an update to our 2017 outlook. Following my comments, Peter will review these numbers and the
drivers of our financial performance.
In addition to providing their insights about our commercial results, Michael and Scott will review the progress we are
making advancing several major late-stage programs in their franchises. Important new and updated clinical
information supporting these programs was recently presented, especially study results that continue to demonstrate the
transformative potential of both GED-0301 in Crohn's disease and ozanimod in ulcerative colitis. They will also
preview the range of data we expect to be published or presented at major medical meetings during the fourth quarter.
I'd like to again thank many of you and your colleagues for joining us at the September investor deep dive into one of
Celgene's core areas of research expertise, protein homeostasis. We are at the forefront of research aimed at
understanding and manipulating the biological pathways within cells that control the function and degradation of
proteins implicated in cancer and inflammatory diseases. The early programs that are emerging from this important
scientific platform combined with our internal discovery efforts in immuno-oncology, inflammation, epigenetics, and
with external collaboration partners are increasing our opportunities to discover and develop more best-in-class or
first-in-class molecules.
Our novel approach to drug discovery, complementing organic expertise with a network of collaboration partners, is
delivering. Working together, we have filed eight investigational New Drug Applications this year while continuing to
invest in discovery platforms with the potential to deliver breakthrough medicines for patients with serious diseases.
At this time every year, our executive leadership team comes together for an in-depth review of our long-range
strategic plan. We conducted our 2016 review just last week. In addition to reaffirming Celgene's mission and purpose,
we reinforced our understanding of and confidence in the robust opportunities we have for sustained high growth. The
momentum of our existing products, the potential of our pipeline and broad collaboration network, and the innovation
and execution of our high-performing teams are key drivers of our optimism.

We also focused on our financial strategies to ensure we are investing in research, commercial, business development,
and capital structure programs that have the greatest potential to make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients
and to generate long-term shareholder value. Our business model creates the most value for all stakeholders when we
invent medicines that improve and extend the lives of patients today while we invest in therapies that may cure patients
in the future.
Our principled approach to pricing innovative therapies is driven by the value they deliver to patients and to healthcare
systems. At Celgene, we continuously seek to work collaboratively with providers, payers, patient advocacy
organizations, and governments to maximize patient access and ensure that incentives exist to encourage research that
improves outcomes and ultimately that lowers the total cost of healthcare around the world. Discovering and
developing medicines that have clearly differentiated benefits for patients has and always will determine the level of
our success.
Before opening the call for your questions, Jackie will provide her perspective on our operating performance, business
drivers, strategic positioning, and the exceptional potential we have for long-term growth.
We are incredibly energized by our year-to-date progress, and I'd like to thank my colleagues across all functions and
around the world for their committed efforts on behalf of patients we serve today and the patients we seek to serve in
the future.
Thank you, and please help me welcome Peter to the call.
Peter N. Kellogg
Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.
Q3 was another exceptional quarter, driven by strong operating performance across the organization. The continued
commercial momentum with our core products enables us to raise our 2016 guidance for the third consecutive quarter.
Due to the strong positioning of our products within the marketplace, we expect this increased momentum to continue
into next year, and we now expect to achieve the high end of the previously revised 2017 range for total product sales
and adjusted earnings per share. We are delivering this level of financial performance while we advance our pipeline
and make strategic investments to access external innovation, all of which positions the company to grow through 2020
and well beyond.
Turning to the quarter, total net product sales in Q3 were over $2.9 billion, a 28% year-over-year increase, a significant
acceleration versus Q3 growth rates in the prior two years. Consistent with prior periods, our growth was
predominantly volume-driven, as product volume grew 25%. The contribution to growth from price remains relatively
small and can fluctuate in any given period due to the timing of pricing actions throughout the year.
Now the third quarter benefited from approximately $70 million in tender offer sales of REVLIMID to Russia.
Excluding these Russian purchases, total net product sales still grew 25% year over year. Please recall that last year the
Russian orders occurred in the second and fourth quarters. And for your modeling, we do not anticipate any Russian
tender business in the fourth quarter. What is clear is that REVLIMID, POMALYST, and OTEZLA are having
outstanding years and are greatly expanding usage. Michael and Scott will share their perspectives on this strong
underlying volume growth and the demand drivers for these products later in the call.
Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.58, a year-on-year growth of 28%. Operating income accounted for
the entire increase in earnings. Below operating income, the benefit from a lower diluted share count was offset by a
full quarter of interest expense related to the debt issued to acquire Receptos in August last year and a higher tax rate
due to geographic mix.
Our operating model remains flexible and aligned with our strategic direction. During 2016, we have continued to
increase our R&D investment as we support our growing pipeline and research efforts. At the same time, we have
leveraged our global commercial infrastructure despite increasing coverage of our international I&I sales organization.

The net result is a continued improvement in the adjusted operating margin of 80 basis points in Q3 and a 200 basis
points improvement year to date when compared to prior periods.
We ended the third quarter with approximately $6.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. Now we continue to
balance deploying capital between our share repurchase program and strategic transactions to access external
innovations such as the EngMab deal. Striking the right balance is critical as we prioritize our strategic initiatives to
position the company to grow through the next decade. For the first nine months, we repurchased $2 billion in common
stock and entered into six strategic transactions.
In summary, the business is performing very well. The year-to-date operating momentum places us on track this year to
achieve sales of approximately $11.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share of between $5.58 (sic) [$5.88] and $5.92
per share. This implies a fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS growth rate in the range of 31% to 35%. So as you can see, we
expect the earnings momentum to continue right through to year end. For 2017, we are now on track to achieve the
high end of our previously revised ranges for total net product sales and adjusted earnings per share, so really a great
quarter.
I would now like to turn the call over to my colleague, Michael.
Michael Pehl
Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone.
Q3 2016 was another great quarter for Hematology & Oncology, my sincere thanks to our teams worldwide for an
outstanding performance, with impressive growth in key brands and across geographies. In addition, we made robust
progress with key development programs for multiple pipeline assets.
We had a record performance in Q3 with 24% year-over-year and 8% sequential revenue growth. REVLIMID end
demand growth continues in launched countries, and we have secured reimbursement in most key markets where we
have not yet had a full year of revenues in many European markets.
POMALYST/IMNOVID continues to grow, and IMNOVID-based triplet combination is increasing utilization, driving
share and duration. ABRAXANE is maintaining its position in the U.S., with stable market shares in breast, lung, and
pancreatic cancer, and is growing outside the U.S. in pancreatic cancer.
We made significant process on our pipeline during the quarter. We expect to submit a New Drug Application to FDA
for AG-221 in relapsed/refractory AML by year end. We have further advanced our CC-122 program in a variety of
diseases, and our FUSION program for durvalumab continues to enroll six trials in hematologic diseases. Our
luspatercept and CC-486 programs enrolled well into pivotal programs in myeloid malignancies.
Through our recent acquisition of EngMab and their lead molecule, EM901, Celgene is now uniquely positioned to
pursue [ph] many (13:09) development opportunities using two key platforms, CAR-T and CD-3 redirected killing.
Our teams are diligently preparing for the upcoming ASH [American Society of Hematology] conference in San Diego.
We expect to have a robust set of data presentations across both our inline brands and pipeline assets.
REVLIMID had an outstanding third quarter with 30% year-over-year and 11% sequential revenue growth, reflecting
strong underlying demand across the globe. The ongoing [ph] immunological advice (13:38) provides significant
market share gains in key markets where we have reimbursement. In addition, we secured NDMM [Newly Diagnosed
Multiple Myeloma] reimbursement for Italy in September. We expect to have reimbursement in Switzerland by the end
of the year and in France by Q1 2017. Duration continues to increase in all geographies.
REVLIMID [RD] benefits from a stream of positive data, including another New England Journal of Medicine
publication, the PALACE trial. As a reminder, these data for RD plus daratumumab in relapsed/refractory myeloma
demonstrate an estimated progression-free survival for the combination of well over 14 months. Coupled with the FDA
Breakthrough status for RD plus daratumumab for treatment in relapsed/refractory myeloma, we are optimistic about a

major growth opportunity ahead for REVLIMID.
In addition, we have submitted applications to the FDA and EMA for REVLIMID as maintenance treatment in NDMM
patients after receiving autologous stem cell transplantation. The FDA has provided the application with a Priority
Review designation and a PDUFA [Prescription Drug User Fee Act] date of February 24, 2017. The decision of the
European authority is expected in the first half of 2017.
Furthermore, we are excited about the REVLIMID myeloma data to be presented at ASH this year, including final
overall survival data for MM-020 and key analysis for Myeloma XI. This trial, conducted by the MRC [Medical
Research Council] study group in the UK, randomized more than 3,800 transplant-eligible and transplant-ineligible
newly diagnosed myeloma patients, and is the largest myeloma study to date. REVLIMID has been investigated both in
the induction and maintenance setting, and respective results will be presented at the congress.
POMALYST/IMNOVID had strong growth, with 33% year-over-year and 7% sequential growth. Most launched
markets have achieved leadership positions in the third-line-plus patient segment, and duration continues to grow.
POMALYST/IMNOVID demand continues to grow in spite of some competitive pressure in the fourth-line-plus
patient segments with the launch of daratumumab. We have seen overall demand increase due to the use of
POMALYST in triplet combinations, including in combination with daratumumab. NCCN guidelines were recently
updated to include three POMALYST-based triplets for relapsed/refractory myeloma. In addition, FDA has recently
granted Standard Review to daratumumab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for
relapsed/refractory myeloma, with a PDUFA data in June 2017.
During the third quarter, we received EMA approval for an IMNOVID label update for patients with renal impairment,
facilitating the use of pomalidomide in this difficult to treat patient population. We expect all of these growth drivers to
lead to share and duration gains in the future.
We are successfully enrolling key development programs for POMALYST/IMNOVID to further support the use of
multiple combinations. Our Phase III OPTIMISMM trial in combination with bortezomib in second or later treatment
lines is on track to complete enrollment in the first half of 2017.
ABRAXANE continues to have stable performance. ABRAXANE grew 1% year over year, with growth coming from
outside of the United States. U.S. ABRAXANE maintained its leadership position in pancreatic cancer, and demand is
stable in breast and lung cancer in spite of the underlying competitive dynamics. Outside of the U.S., ABRAXANE
grew 5% year over year and 20% quarter over quarter, driven by pancreatic cancer in markets with reimbursement,
including Germany, Spain, and Italy.
ABRAXANE has generated additional impactful data in difficult to treat solid tumors. Data from multiple studies
evaluating the use of ABRAXANE alone, in standard combinations, or in combination with novel agents in pancreatic
cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer represented during the ESMO [European Society
of Medical Oncology] meeting in October. We plan to present the results of the ABRAXANE randomized Phase II
TENACITY trial in first-line triple-negative breast cancer at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December.
Data from the ABRAXANE abound lung cancer studies will be presented at the World Congress on Lung Cancer in
December. And we are awaiting the results of the ongoing pivotal ABRAXANE/Tecentriq combination trials in
non-small-cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer.
Additional Celgene data will be presented at several key congresses by year end. In addition to the Myeloma XI and
MM-020 studies that I already mentioned, data presentations at the forthcoming ASH Congress in San Diego includes
our REMARC study of REVLIMID maintenance in elderly first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients, data for
REVLIMID maintenance in CLL from the CONTINUUM trial, an interim analysis of our ASCO MAGNIFY study in
indolent lymphoma, as well as CC-122/CD20 combination data in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and indolent
lymphoma. In addition, a number of our collaboration partners will be presenting data on early and midstage assets.
As I noted earlier, we'll have key ABRAXANE presentations at the World Congress on Lung Cancer and the San
Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium before year end. We also very excited about the very encouraging Phase I
marizomib data in combination with AVASTIN in glioblastoma, to be presented by our partner Triphase at the Society

for Neurooncology in November.
In addition to the excellent performance of our inline brands, we are making very good progress in advancing our early
and later-stage pipeline. The luspatercept collaboration with Acceleron continues to advance. Our two Phase III trials in
lower-risk MDS and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia are enrolling extremely well. And we are actively engaged
in planning to further maximize the opportunity of the assets in additional patient segments and indications.
We are making progress with our I-O pipeline and CD9, [ph] CMPC (19:38), and CAR-T programs with our partners
Juno and bluebird bio. We received an EMA Prime designation for the development of JCAR015 in adult
relapsed/refractory ALL in Europe, which may enable accelerated development and approval.
The FUSION program is advancing, evaluating durvalumab in combination with key inline brands and novel agents.
We expect data readouts to begin in early 2017.
Our recent acquisition of EngMab and their lead molecule EM901 further complements our industry-leading portfolio
and pipeline of myeloma assets. We see B-cell maturation antigen, BCMA, as an ideal target from immune-based
therapies such as CAR-T and CD3 redirected killing. Celgene is uniquely positioned to pursue BCMA development
opportunities using both platforms, which we view as highly complementary. In addition to monotherapy, both
platforms provide the opportunity for rational combination therapies with our CELMoDs and checkpoint inhibitors in
order to further improve treatment efficacy, as well as for clinical department in other BCMA expressing B-cell
malignancies such as lymphoma.
Finally, we are aggressively pursuing our protein homeostasis pipeline. The CC-122 program is enrolling multiple
proof-of-concept studies in myeloma, lymphoma, CLL, and hepatocellular carcinoma both as monotherapy and in
combination with new agents. The data obtained will allow us to start making pivotal decisions in the first half of 2017.
In addition and as highlighted at our research meeting in New York earlier this month, our new AML CELMoDs,
CC-90009, has progressed into Phase I. And we have identified additional CELMoDs successor compounds with high
potential in various hematological malignancies.
In summary, our Hematology & Oncology franchise has had another outstanding quarter. Our key brands have
delivered strong financial performance, and the momentum gives us the confidence to raise our outlook for 2016 and
2017. Our early and late-stage clinical programs have advanced nicely during the quarter, and the acquisition of
EngMab is a perfect fit for our myeloma and lymphoma pipeline.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott.
Scott A. Smith
Thank you, Michael, and good morning.
Q3 was an important quarter for I&I, full of advancement for both our marketed and pipeline assets. With OTEZLA,
we've seen revenue continue to accelerate throughout the quarter, with growth in both psoriasis and PSA indications, as
demand, market share, and persistency continue to increase. At the same time, we have expanded the global access
footprint for OTEZLA. As of this month, reimbursement for OTEZLA has now been achieved in 20 countries
worldwide. In Q3, we advanced development of our pipeline programs, progressing multiple assets through important
milestones.
Turning now to OTEZLA, global net sales for Q3 were $275 million. This represents a 98% year on year increase.
Sales in Q3 continued to grow despite the regular market declines in prescribing typically seen in the summer months.
While we remain focused on launch execution in Germany and other early launch markets, we were able to achieve
critical reimbursement decisions in several key European markets.
NICE created a positive opinion for OTEZLA in psoriasis, which reverses previous guidance and enables access for
patients in England and Wales. With multiple positive reimbursement decisions in hand, we are now preparing to
execute the next wave of launches in the EU.

Focusing now on the U.S. market dynamics, the physician and consumer campaigns continue to drive increases in
demand for OTEZLA. With a sustained leadership position in new-to-brand share, we are seeing a continued rise in
market share for OTEZLA, which now represents more than 1/5 of the systemic treated psoriasis market. Consistent
with the OTEZLA value proposition and pricing strategy to date, much of this growth is coming from the pre-biologic
market segment.
Last week, the interim results from the GED-0301 CD-001 trial were presented as a late-breaker at the UEGW [United
European Gastroenterology Week] meeting in Vienna. These results represent an early exploratory look at the data and
are part of a broader development program that is well underway.
As a reminder, the objective of this study was to evaluate clinical response, clinical remission, and endoscopic
improvements in a broader, more difficult to treat Crohn's population than studied previously. It enrolled 63 patients
across three active treatment groups. All patients had confirmed endoscopic damage at baseline and clinically advanced
disease. The CD-001 results are generally consistent with the clinical outcomes seen in the placebo-controlled IGON
program and support GED utilization across a broad Crohn's patient population.
With the IGON studies, there was compelling evidence to view GED-0301 as a potentially transformational therapy. As
an oral treatment with unprecedented rates of clinical response and remission and negligible systemic exposure, it could
allow patients to be treated in a fundamentally different way than other therapies in development or on the market.
In CD-001 with a more heterogeneous population, GED-0301 demonstrated meaningful clinical and endoscopic
outcomes across different patient types, including TNF-naive and failures, those with prior surgeries, as well as patients
with proximal and distal disease. Once confirmed in pivotal programs, we are confident that this product will be
transformational for patient care.
Data rollout is expected to continue through the rest of the year. The focus of these data will be the 3 and 4-year results
from the PALACE and ESTEEM programs, which show a highly differentiated benefit/risk profile for OTEZLA
relative to other competitive products. Data from positive Phase II studies for RPC4046 in EOE and CC-220 in lupus
will also be disseminated.
Q3 was a quarter full of advancement for Celgene I&I. OTEZLA's share and duration continued to improve, while
access gains expand the geographic breadth of the product. OTEZLA is well on track to achieve blockbuster status in
2016 and in the years to come.
We moved all major development programs ahead and look forward to multiple upcoming proof-of-concept study
readouts, including GED and OTEZLA in UC, ozanimod in Crohn's disease, and CC-220 in cutaneous lupus.
We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio.
Thank you for your attention this morning, and I'd like to turn the call over to Jackie.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse
Thank you, Scott.
Q3 was a fabulous quarter for Celgene. Quarters like this are only made possible by the cumulative hard work of our
teams around the world, work that builds over time to produce the type of momentum we are currently generating. Our
Q3 performance demonstrates we are stronger than ever, and we advance into 2017 and the coming years in a great
position.
Our 2016 milestone chart shows us well on track to achieve what we set out to achieve this year, and we feel very good
about where we are at this point in the fourth quarter. Even though there are only two months remaining in the year,
there is still exciting data to be presented at ACR [American College of Rheumatology], ASH, San Antonio Breast, and
other medical meetings, so stay tuned for those presentations.

This year, we started to see data readouts from the Phase III trials in our pipeline. This is just the beginning of a
multiyear period, during which we will have readouts on a number of potentially transformative programs. Michael and
Scott spoke about some of these. The Phase III trials still to read out over the coming 12 to 24 months give us the
potential: to see upside for ABRAXANE in immuno-oncology combination therapies; to expand ABRAXANE's
presence in pancreatic cancer; to take REVLIMID into lymphoma; to further expand and diversify our myeloid
business; to see the expansion and diversification of our I&I franchise with two new compounds, ozanimod and
GED-0301, and two new therapeutic categories, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease; and much more.
We will also have Phase II and proof-of-concept data for a number of indications across several compounds, including
CC-122, CC-220, durvalumab, CAR-T, CC-486, and demcizumab, and the flow of data will be strong and steady for
some time to come.
On the commercial side, building on the strong momentum of 2016, in 2017 we look forward to launches across
multiple geographies for REVLIMID in the stem cell transplant setting of newly diagnosed myeloma; the U.S. launch
of AG-221 in IDH2-mutated AML; the ongoing global uptake of triplet regimens on IMiD backbones; and the
geographic expansion of OTEZLA, including the important market of Japan.
These commercial catalysts and the clinical catalysts I highlighted give us high confidence in our ability to deliver on
our 2017 and 2020 targets and produce strong growth for many years beyond.
Let me close by thanking our teams around the world for their performance and thank you for listening to our call
today.

Thank you, Jackie. This is Peter.
Just coming back for one second, I guess I was a little bit dazzled by the Q3 numbers, so I misread actually our
adjusted 2016 EPS range. I just want to clarify. As it says in our press release and our slide, we expect our EPS for
2016 on an adjusted basis to be in the range of $5.88 to $5.92. I apologize for missing that one.
But with that, great quarter, we look forward to answering your questions. Operator, we can take the first question.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Citigroup. Your line is open.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and let me be the first to say great job on the quarter.
So my question is on REVLIMID, and there is two parts. So the first is when thinking about NDMM, so post-transplant
maintenance, how do think doctors are going to feel about this benefit? You highlighted it at the market. And what
gives you confidence that the regulators are confident in filing? And is it being used here at all? So help us understand.
What is the opportunity here and what doctors think?
And then second, you talked about duration of therapy going up for REVLIMID with these combinations. How do we
think about where the inflection point is, given duration, or triple combos probably started a year ago – or you started.
How do we think about when there could be a greater inflection point on duration of therapy to come up? Thanks.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Hi, Robyn. This is Michael. Thanks for the question. So on NDMM, there is a very distinct
post-transplant opportunity in Europe. So transplantation maintenance has been developed a lot by European
investigators, but there is no usage because there is no approval and reimbursement at this moment of time. So there's a
very distinct opportunity.

When it comes to the U.S., there is usage, driven by the data, but I can remind you as to what happens with our NDMM
launch in elderly patients. So once we have the launch and the opportunity to really talk about it and educate, the
market shares and the duration went up, and we're going to see the same thing happening in the U.S. in this situation.
So it's an opportunity for both sides of the Atlantic, although I would say the opportunity for Europe is probably
slightly bigger. So that's the first part of the question.
With the second part, you're right. Talking about treatment duration, you just have to think about where we are with
progression-free survival with the triplet combination. At this moment of time, those which are approved already
provide anything between 20 to 28 months. Our current treatment duration in the U.S. is 18 months. And then you have
the PALACE trial that was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine, where we are talking about
progression-free survival of 40 to 50 months.
Treatment duration needs a little bit of time to build up, and that's the point that I wanted to make. Once a drug is
available and the clinical data is there and the approval is there, it needs a little bit of time to build up. So we need to go
beyond the 18 months. I think when you're looking at our results, we already see the impact of the treatment duration
really impacting very positively with our new label in transplant-eligible NDMM. And with the PALACE data, we
think this is going to accelerate even further.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Alethia Young>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to talk
about REV a little bit in Europe. And maybe you can characterize with Italy or France where you are in market share.
Have doctors started to already adopt this, or are you very low, in the 10% range of market share there? Thanks.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Thanks for the question. This is Michael again. So when we're thinking about REVLIMID in
Europe and the performance of NDMM, it all starts with our ability of reimbursement. So we have reimbursement now
in 20 European countries. As I said in my prepared remarks, we just got reimbursement in Italy. In Q4, we're going to
get reimbursement in Switzerland, and France is coming in Q1. When we're looking at our market shares worldwide
driven by our NDMM launch, they are absolutely what we expected. In the U.S., market shares are going up. In all the
European markets, they are going up. In Japan, they are going up very nicely, so we are actually very, very confident
and very happy about that.
<Q - Alethia Young>: Do you think in France, they're still very low so you have an opportunity to go into the
mid-50s?
<A - Michael Pehl>: There is some uptake in France because in France there's a situation where, under certain
circumstances, physicians can actually can prescribe REVLIMID in a first-line setting, but it's not yet fully reimbursed,
so we have a base level of usage. And we expect a significant acceleration as from Q1 when the full reimbursement is
going to be achieved.
<Q - Alethia Young>: Great, thanks.

Our next question comes from Katherine Breedis with Stifel. Your line is open.
<Q - Katherine Breedis>: Thanks for taking my questions. These are excellent, really volume driven results, and it's
nice to see another solid guidance raise for the year. With respect to the upcoming ASH meeting, we were also hopeful
we might see data from the Phase 1 study investigating POMALYST in combination with durvalumab in multiple
myeloma as well as the Phase 1 study investigating CC-122 in advanced solid tumors, NHL, and multiple myeloma. Do

you think these may still be possible potentially as late breakers, or should we turn our sights to a future medical
meeting in 2017?
<A - Michael Pehl>: Hi, Katherine. Thanks for the question. This is Michael. So I think what we're going to see when
it comes to the combination with daratumumab, there's going to be an update to be provided with pomalidomide. The
durvalumab combination data are still going to take a little bit of time. As with all I-O therapies, the response rates and
the benefit builds over time. So what I said in my prepared remarks was actually like we have to wait a little bit and
we're going to have the readouts by early next year.
Regarding CC-122, we're going to see I think really intriguing and interesting data with combination with CD20 in
follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Particularly to your question of durvalumab, we really want to
give the data the time that it takes in order to really facilitate decision-making. So it's taking a little bit more time, but
by the beginning of next year we are there.
<Q - Katherine Breedis>: Great, thank you so much.

Our next question comes from Mara Goldstein with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Thanks very much for taking the question. I had a question on AG-221, which you expect to
submit an NDA for by the end of this year. Can you just maybe – I just want to explore for a second how that product
will be positioned within the portfolio of in other hematological products and what we should specifically expect from
a carve-out perspective for AG-221 versus REVLIMID and POMALYST and all the other indications you guys are
working on.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Hi, Mara. This is Michael. Thanks for the question. So we are extremely confident to be able to
submit AG-221 by the end of the year for two reasons. Number one is really this very distinct medical need, especially
in relapsed/refractory AML where there's very little available. So if you have targeted therapy that is extremely
well-tolerated and very effective, that makes you very confident when you go in front of a regulatory authority. The
other thing is that our data has matured. So when it comes to the efficacy of the drug, the response rates, and the
duration of the response, we feel very, very confident.
The positioning of this drug is really targeted for this subset of patients that come along with an IDH2 mutation. We're
starting in relapsed/refractory AML. We have actually also an ongoing randomized study, and then we bring it up into
the first-line setting, and respective studies are running already. I can remind you that we have a combination study
with VIDAZA. We have a combination study with 7+3 ongoing. And that complements the other things that we are
developing in AML. I was talking briefly about a new AML CELMoDs which makes us very excited, and we should
really expect very deep responses. And we certainly have our immuno-oncology therapy program ongoing. So there's a
lot of stuff ongoing in I-O. This drug is particularly for the subset of patients coming along with an IDH2 mutation.
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Okay. And just from a detailing perspective, is this something that REVLIMID reps will detail
as well, or this will be a specialty carve-out sales force?
<A - Michael Pehl>: As we have an ongoing myeloid business, I think we can use our existing infrastructure very
nicely.
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Okay, thank you so much.

<Q - Geoffrey C. Porges>: Thanks very much. Michael, a follow on the theme of REVLIMID. First, it was very
helpful to hear the duration in the U.S. Could you give us a sense of where you think average duration is outside the
U.S.? And then just related to that, you highlighted daratumumab and of course the imminent approval of the
daratumumab-REVLIMID-dexamethasone data. That's a second line label, of course. And could you talk about how
your market research suggests physicians are going to change their practice patterns to accommodate
daratumumab-REVLIMID-dexamethasone? Would that have a negative effect perhaps on POMALYST? And also, do
you think it will change any of their prescribing in the front-line setting as soon as that's approved? Thanks.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Hi, Geoff. This is Michael. Thanks for the questions. So starting with the duration in the U.S.,
when we're looking at the first use of the product, we are currently at 18 months. As you probably know, REVLIMID is
not just used once. The combination with other drugs allows others to use it once again. So the overall treatment
duration is now 24 months, and it's constantly increasing.
The REVLIMID-daratumumab data is actually really intriguing because 40 to 50 months of progression-free survival
in relapsed/refractory myeloma is absolutely intriguing. It's not going to have an impact on the overall treatment
sequence in pomalidomide yet likely. But I think it's going to be in a way that, especially in the U.S.,
REVLIMID-daratumumab is going to be quickly taken up to first-line usage, as it is such a great regimen. And that
allows pomalidomide to then really go into the second-line space and be used immediately after. So if you have a great
triplet to start with, you want have another triplet to go on with. And the sequence of REVLIMID and pomalidomide is
actually extremely compelling, and that's something we're seeing already in the market happening.
<Q - Geoffrey C. Porges>: Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael Yee>: Thanks so much. Regarding OTEZLA, I'll give Michael a break for a second. Hey, Scott, on
OTEZLA, strong growth here, which actually looked like it was different than a lot of third-party data. But my question
actually relates to 2017 and your confidence around hitting those numbers. It wasn't necessarily cited related to
comments around guidance for 2017 there and your confidence.
And then I guess for the company just generally, I think most people know about the additional Paragraph IV filing that
was filed to the FDA. Could you just make a brief comment and put some perspective around that and remind about of
the importance of that and where you stand as it relates to IP on REVLIMID? Thanks so much.
<A - Scott A. Smith>: Thank you very much for the question. I feel very confident in the direction of OTEZLA for
finishing this year and going into 2017. I think we have a lot of momentum. And specifically to 2017, I think we have a
high degree of confidence. I'm very excited about the fact that we are just now starting to launch in some really major
impactful countries, France, England, and Wales, Japan early next year. There's a lot of geographic expansion, and we
see the market shares in the U.S. continue to grow. So we feel very good about the targets that are out there.
<Q - Michael Yee>: Okay.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Hey, Michael. It's Mark. Thanks for the question about Paragraph IV. So we expected more
filers all along. We've discussed this for quite a while, and so we're not surprised. We have filed a suit against them,
and we will defend our intellectual property estate much the same way that we did for multiple years with respect to the
Natco and Allergan settlements. So thanks for the question, but we're pursuing all legal defense of our patent estate.

<Q - Christopher Raymond>: Hey, thanks. I wonder if I could go back to maybe the situation in Europe with
REVLIMID and IMNOVID. So I know you probably don't want to talk too much about pricing specifically. But now
that you've gone through maybe a round of yearly discussions in at least a few countries with the new label, generally
are things with respect to pricing versus what you expected in the beginning of the process?
And maybe a related question, as I recall when REVLIMID was initially priced in Europe, it was priced higher than the
U.S., with the thinking that there would be maybe a convergence over time. Where are we generally with that trend?
Have the two trends crossed, et cetera? Any color there would be appreciated. Thanks.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Thanks, Chris. Hi, this is Michael. And I still owe Geoff also the question that you were just
asking. So the treatment duration in Europe is not quite where the U.S. is, and it's understandable because a lot of the
duration in the U.S. of course is driven by this year-long availability of the first-line treatment. So in Europe, we are
roundabout 13 to 14 months at this moment of time, increasing foreseeingly with the NDMM launch. And as I said in
the U.S., first usage 18 months, and then aggregate use 24 months. So there's still a really good way to go for Europe,
and the NDMM launch is going to absolutely drive this.
With your question of NDMM pricing, I think the speed upon which we've been getting the 20 reimbursements in
Europe should provide you with confidence that there's a lot of appreciation of the data and the value proposition of
REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma with payers. And by the way, the overall survival data in the MM-020 data is
really driving that, and we are happy to be able to provide an update of these data. At ASH, though, you can all look at
this.
As a consequence, the price reductions that you have to have in some European markets, not in all but in some, with the
new label will absolutely moderate and 100% in line with our expectations. Of course, there is this trend in the U.S.
where you can maintain a price or increase a price upon value proposition. And in Europe, payers are driving you
down, so the trends of course of prices in U.S. and Europe are absolutely not the same. What I can tell you is that we
are extremely happy with the speed but then also with the appreciation and support that we got by payers in the NDMM
situation in Europe.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Hi, it's Mark. Just setting aside the mechanics of price for a second, what we've seen, and I think
Michael would agree with me, the value proposition of the triplets is being well recognized by payers around the world.
So as we negotiate value and look at the opportunity that these triplets offer, remember, the clinical profiles are
essentially taking what was becoming a chronic disease and making it virtually a chronic disease. In that context,
duration is going to be a big driver, but we've been very pleased at how across the board and around the world,
negotiation on the basis of value versus costs are playing out.
<Q - Christopher Raymond>: Great color, guys. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Terence Flynn>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. You mentioned in the slide and your remarks about
REVLIMID data from the CONTINUUM and MAGNIFY trials. I just wondered if you can give us any more insights
there. And I know you had press released the REMARK data, but why not press release the data from these two
studies? Thanks.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Hi, thanks. This is Michael. Thanks for the question. So what I can share with you and for
everybody on the call, so CONTINUUM is a randomized study of REVLIMID maintenance in relapsed CLL
post-induction therapy, so we're testing maintenance therapy here. So what I can share with you is that the co-primary
endpoint, which is progression-free survival, was achieved in CONTINUUM and that the overall survival data is still
immature. That said, these data are really going to provide us with very, very important information for the future
positioning and investigation of CELMoDs in CLL.

And we think that there is a very distinct need for better therapies in CLL, and we think also that CELMoDs are an
excellent drug class for that purpose. When you're thinking of patients who are relapsing out of ibrutinib, when you
think about the really low CR rate and when you're thinking about the very high number and proportion of
MLD-positive patients with CLL, there is a distinct need for better therapies. We are very excited in that context about
CC-122. With think it has a really differentiated immune profile, and CC-122 is going to be the drug to be moved
forward. But CONTINUUM is going to help us to do this in the best possible way.
The data that we're going to show with MAGNIFY, which is our R-squared study in indolent lymphoma, is an interim
analysis. So we'll be able to compare the data, the Phase II data that adds actually less to our programs than ongoing
our pivotal programs, and confirm those with a much, much bigger patient population that we've been including and
magnifying. We feel extremely positive about that, and so we're going to show the data at ASH.

Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric Schmidt, Ph.D.>: Good morning. I was a little surprised by Peter's open-ended guidance for REVLIMID
sales in 2017. I didn't think that was very much like him, at least his historical conservatism. So is this drug now on a
different growth trajectory? For the last three or four years we've seen very, very steady high teens year-on-year
growth, and obviously in this quarter ex-the Russian shipments it was 25%. Are we seeing an inflection? Thank you.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Eric. It's Jackie. I'm just going to say we're trying to have a positive influence on Peter.
Go ahead, Peter.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: I think there's a compliment in there somewhere, but anyway. Maybe I'll turn to Michael first.
I think the first thing we talked about perhaps on the basis of your question is really the trend in REVLIMID when you
stand back. Worldwide, you can see the results in Q3. We commented; with or without the Russian tender, the growth
rates are just great. And obviously, it's the impact of data that's been built up over quite some period of time. So maybe,
Michael, you could just comment on that in a broader...
<A - Michael Pehl>: I'm just repeating the growth drivers that I was trying to summarize in my prepared remarks. So
the MM launch in U.S. and Europe, the ongoing MM launch upon MM-020 and the label that we have is one. The
triplet combination – and many of them have been approved and reimbursed in U.S. and in Europe are another one.
Now we have the next accelerator, and we were just saying that we were receiving Priority Review designation NDMM
treatment maintenance with a PDUFA date in February in the U.S. is our transplant-eligible label that we're going to
get. We're going to show Myeloma XI data in induction and maintenance from the biggest myeloma study ever. And I
hope you're all going to be there when those data are going to be presented. So there are really multiple amazing drivers
for REVLIMID. And I think yes, there is some inflection at this moment of time, yes.

<Q - Ying Huang>: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering how you would prioritize development of the
BCMA bispecific antibody you just acquired through EngMab versus the CAR-T BCMA you have in cooperation with
Juno. Thank you.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Hi, this is Michael. This is a great question. And I think the right way of answering it is just
reminding ourselves that when we're thinking about multiple myeloma, there are still segments with a very distinct
medical need. So there is absolutely the need to bring better therapies, although we see now all these triplet data
reading out. When we're thinking about patients who are relapsing very, very quickly, and it's actually 25% to 30%

after post-REVLIMID and daratumumab, when we're thinking about patients with high-risk cytogenetic features, when
we're thinking of patients who are relapsing after daratumumab with pomalidomide, there are many patient segments
that even with the available current therapies are really not doing well. That's the first point that I wanted to make.
The second point, BCMA is really a great target. It's selectively expressed. It's almost expressed in 100% of the
multiple myeloma patients. It's got a really ideal target for immune therapy. And having both platforms available,
which is CAR-T and CD-3 redirected killing, gives us really the opportunity to start thinking about treatment sequence.
So you could think about using one earlier and the other one later. Using it in the same patients, think about induction
therapy, or if a patient relapses after one, you can use the other one. And then there is a third element that I think is very
important. CAR-T is not for everyone. CAR-T is for younger patients, and there will be some reimbursement questions
around CAR-T. So you're really happy then if you have an antibody in your portfolio going against the same target.
And then finally, I just wanted to make this remark. Apart from having both, we really have very distinct combination
opportunities. We will be able to combine with IMiDs. We will be able to combine with checkpoint inhibitors.
Everything we have in our portfolio is extremely complementary, so we feel extremely good about that.

Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on the
REVLIMID IP question, as there were also headlines that just hit before your call started about two of the patents being
ruled invalid under the IPR hearing. So I was just curious if you can provide any perspective there or views on what
this might mean in the bigger picture for REVLIMID. Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: No, thanks for the question. It's Mark. So we did receive the PTAB decision late last night, and
thanks for the question so we can address it head on. We continue to believe in the validity of these challenged REMS
patents, which are due to expire in 2018 and 2020, and right now, because we just received the decision, are
considering options for rehearing and appeal.
Just as a reminder, we have 13 other patents that cover REMS, including nine patents that expire in 2020. These are not
patents subject to this decision. And then there are additional non-REMS patents extending as far as 2027 for
REVLIMID, and we will continue to assert those patents. So I don't think that this decision was necessarily unexpected.
We're disappointed, but as you can tell, we're prepared to move forward.

And then for Scott on OTEZLA, when you look at the inflammation markets like psoriasis, PsA, RA, patients are
typically well controlled and then eventually switch. I wanted to see if you could tell us anything about the commercial
experience on it so far for OTEZLA on things like compliance or duration. Is anything notable when patients do move
off OTEZLA? Thank you.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Hi, James. Thanks for the question. This is Michael. I think I'll take the first part and then Scott
takes the second one. I think there was a lot of really important learnings for those who were at ESMO and coming
back. I think the way to look at the space at this moment of time is that there is a rather small and well-defined
population of high-expressing PD-L1 that is going to be treated with monotherapy. Everybody else is obviously
needing a combination, and there's an option of treating those patients either with I-O/I-O combinations or with
I-O/chemo combinations.
When I'm looking at the data and I'm talking to key opinion leaders, there's a little bit of a sentiment to say like if you
have a very low or no PD-L1 expression, there would be a preference for chemotherapy. And of course, the data from
the larger end of my studies has to play out at the end of the day, and there will be some overlap between those
segments in the usage of both. But I think what's definitely worth to be said is that it at ESMO, the combination of
chemo and I-O was absolutely strengthened. We think we are extremely well positioned with that. The data that we've
been showing with ABRAXANE and Tecentriq are extremely positive, and we're looking forward to having our data
being reading out.
<A - Scott A. Smith>: So thank you for the second part of the question. What we're seeing from a commercial
perspective, and I do believe I had a slide that addressed it, is approximately 90% of patients are coming to OTEZLA
therapy from something other than a biologic. So they're either switching off an oral, switching off topical, or coming
onto OTEZLA from nothing at all, and only 10% are coming on from a biologic therapy.
In terms of duration, what we're seeing is duration at one year, which looks at the high biologic range. And so we feel
very good about that duration, certainly well above what you see for other oral compounds in the space. So the duration
of therapy actually looks quite good. One thing from the clinical studies that is very heartening to me, and there's some
four-year data which will come out in a little while, and that says that 65% of the patients who finished one year in the
clinical trial were still on drug at four years, which is really unprecedented, and these were in PsA studies, which is
really unprecedented relative to data from any other comparator or any other clinical trial. So the compliance is good
through one year. I don't have the commercial experience to say what it looks like for two years or three years because
we don't have that data yet. But we believe that compliance will continue and continue to get better over time.
<Q - Geoff Meacham>: Awesome, thank you.

Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital. Your line is open.
<Q - M. Ian Somaiya>: Thank you. I just had a question on the future of maintenance therapy within myeloma. At the
ASH conference, we're expected to get data for subcutaneous delivery of daratumumab, with that drug potentially
given every four to six weeks. And I was just hoping to get your thoughts on that as an option when considering
maintenance therapy, so REVLIMID versus daratumumab as a maintenance option in the future. And whether the
conversation should be limited just to REVLIMID, or are there CELMoDs that you have earmarked to develop for that
setting?
<A - Michael Pehl>: Hi, Ian. This is Michael. Thanks for the question. I think I would like to start your question with
what we've been saying a couple of times already. I think with the upcoming approval of REVLIMID CE and NDMM
maintenance, this is going to be the standard and it's going to be broadly applied. It's already used very broadly in the
U.S., based, by the way, upon data that we've been obtaining from three studies, and we've done a meta-analysis really
nicely that's showing a 2.5-year overall survival benefit. Those are very strong data. Now the application and the usage
and the uptick is going to start in Europe. That's the first thing I wanted to say.

There is an ongoing study of daratumumab in that indication, but maintenance is really a long-term game. If you think
back about when we started to put REVLIMID into maintenance, and we are now at the point of really going to the
finish line, this is something that takes multiple years. And I just wanted to once again say the usage and the approval is
driven upon overall survival data that we've been generating from multiple studies. And the bar here is 2.5 years of
overall survival benefit.
Thinking about our future IMiDs, is there a place for them in maintenance? Maybe, we are particularly excited when
we're looking at those IMiDs, and Rupert [Vessey] has been talking about those in New York because they have a very,
very deep B-cell kill effect. So whether those are going to be primarily used in maintenance or not needs to be decided,
but I would not rule it out.

Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Jim Birchenough>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. I'm just wondering,
Michael, if you could break down the use of REVLIMID in the U.S. in particular between combination use in earlier
lines and single-agent use. And then following that, what's the strategy with your next-generation CELMoD to have
them potentially displace REVLIMID longer term as a standard of care in combinations? Because one of the problems
with having such great data is it becomes difficult to displace something that's so well entrenched. And longer term as
you think about generic risk, how difficult will it be to displace REVLIMID with a potentially better CELMoD?
Thanks.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Thanks for the question, Jim. This is Michael. So even in the U.S., I would say the use of
REVLIMID is still primarily as a doublet, so in combination with dexamethasone. But the use of triplets is really
picking up very, very quickly, and the reason is very, very clear. When you're looking at the progression-free survival
and the response rates and the depth of the response that you can get, there is a compelling reason to do so. There is
multiple opportunities. But I would make the argument that also in the foreseeable future, if you are an elderly frail
patient or if you're a standard risk patient, doublets remain a very attractive option. So that's the first point that I wanted
to make.
Then coming to the second point of your question, we really think that REVLIMID and pomalidomide are great drugs.
We really are compelled by the New England Journal publication that we've been seeing in The New England Journal
of Medicine. But even when you look at the best available data – and I was trying to say this – 25% to 30% of patients,
even with REVLIMID-dexamethasone- daratumumab, are relapsing after 6 to 12 months. There is extremely limited
options if a patient is relapsing after daratumumab or after pomalidomide. And the overall survival of patients with
high risk such as genetic features, despite all these new available therapies, is still only three or four years. That's very
bad. That's absolutely not good enough. We can define these patient populations very clearly. We can define them
clinically. We can define them molecularly, and this is exactly where we want to test our new CELMoDs in, and we
feel extremely good about that.

Our next question comes from Yatin Suneja with SunTrust. Your line is open.
<Q - Yatin Suneja>: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe I'll ask on POMALYST, I think
those results were overshadowed by REVLIMID performance. So could you maybe comment on where we are in terms
of recent duration there? I think in the past, you had mentioned that POMALYST is gaining share in the second-line
setting. So could you maybe comment on how do you see the dynamics shifting there and where do you see the drugs
eventually moving? Thank you.

<A - Michael Pehl>: Thanks, Yatin, for the question. This is Michael. So when we're looking at the pomalidomide
duration both in the U.S. and Europe, it's steadily increasing. What I can share with you is that the treatment duration in
the U.S. is now over 10 months. A lot of that is driven by two factors, A), the use in combinatorial therapy. There's a
lot of data available. NCCN guidelines have recently been updated and there's going to be, by the way, increasing use,
as you heard. Pomalidomide-daratumumab is submitted to the FDA and there's a PDUFA date available. So that's one
element driving pomalidomide is duration, the usage in combination.
The other element is the increasing usage earlier in therapy. So if you use REVLIMID either in combination, as I was
trying to say earlier, and patients are relapsing afterwards, do you want to have another triplet right after, again, with an
IMiD and another combination partner? And that's exactly what we are seeing. I think the great performance of
pomalidomide that we had in the third quarter is really a reflection of exactly that.
<Q - Yatin Suneja>: Great, thank you.

Your next question comes from Brian Abrahams with Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian Abrahams>: Thanks for taking my question and congrats again on the strong quarter. Scott, I was
wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the potential for expanded indications for OTEZLA, in particular
atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis, the next steps there, and maybe how the product profile as well as competitive
landscape in those spaces potentially influences your prioritization of what to pursue next. Thanks.
<A - Scott A. Smith>: Thank you very much for the question. There are four current indications that we're looking at
in terms of expansion. There's also some expansion opportunity within the psoriasis space to go into subtypes, scalp
psoriasis and other things, so there is some expansion there. We have a Phase III program ongoing in Behçet's disease.
We have a Phase II proof-of-concept going on in ulcerative colitis, which should read out next year.
We do have long-term radiographic data from the AS program, MRI and radiograph data which looks very positive,
which shows the majority of patients not progressing during two years of treatment, and so we're having some
discussions to see how we can move that forward. And then we're also taking look at atopic dermatitis. Specifically to
atopic dermatitis, we do have data in from a proof-of-concept study. The study did make its primary endpoint. There
were some – a little bit of mixed data in terms of which endpoints were met in which weren't.
We also have another asset that we acquired through the Receptos transaction in RPC4046, an IL-13 antibiotic, which
there's good strong proof-of-concept of IL-13 in atopic dermatitis. So we're taking our time, looking at all the data, and
we'll have a comprehensive atopic dermatitis strategy in the coming months.

Our next question comes from John Newman with Canaccord. Your line is open.
<Q - John Lawrence Newman>: Hi, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First question I have is you
mentioned in your prepared remarks and your press release that you have increased contribution to the patient
assistance organizations. I just wondered if that is simply in response to high levels of REVLIMID sales, or if that is a
way to make sure patients have access to some of these triplet regimens which would be more expensive.
And the second question I have is, are you seeing any evidence from the payers that they are looking for higher levels
of discounts and rebates on OTEZLA in terms of a percentage of sales? Thank you.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Hey, John, it's Peter. Let me take the first one and then I'll ask Scott to join in on the second
part. So basically all of our contributions on patient support are really demand-driven. So it's really a question of what's

going on in the market and that we don't make exactly the same amount of contributions every quarter, so it does tend
to be a little bit irregular in timing. It's more just based on updates from the different independent groups.
I would say that, obviously, our business has grown. And so when you think about growth rates of our products above
20%, then yes, over time that will accumulate and cause the patient support needs to grow as well. So I would say those
are two of the drivers really as opposed to anything related to usage of the drug differently. Jackie, would you add
anything?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: I just, and you said it, these are independent groups that are working with myeloma
patients irrespective of the regimen that they may be on. So we have no idea what regimen the patients may receive
when we make these donations to these groups.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: And it's the nature of these independent groups across the cancer space, whether it's myeloma,
whatever the disease is, that they are there helping patients get access through whatever mechanisms are provided.
They're not drug specific. Scott?
<A - Scott A. Smith>: Specific to OTEZLA rebates, the rebates or discounts to any particular organization will be
different and individually negotiated, and we don't necessarily talk about those publicly. Right now the rebate levels I
think are relatively low with most of the major payers.
We're at a place where market share and prescription trends continue to move forward. I think that puts some – driving
that demand creates a situation in the market where you have an opportunity to talk to the individual payers in a
thoughtful way about changing the overall footprint from an access standpoint, moving it up, eliminating steps, some of
those things. And so we're constantly in those negotiations. The currency to get into those negotiations is driving
demand and making sure that the product is being utilized, and we've done that to this point. And so we may move into
a period where we see some deeper discounts and deeper rebates happening for increases in access and decreases in
steps.

Our next question comes from John Scotti with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
<Q - John Scotti>: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. So I want to ask again on REVLIMID. As you said
with daratumumab coming online in second-line, duration of therapy, perhaps in a double and then a likely move into
first-line, so in the case that REVLIMID sees those tailwinds from a duration of therapy perspective over the next few
years, and I guess specifically as we look to the future, a couple things. One, is it unreasonable to view any trial hitting
in lymphoma as upside potentially to the 2020 guidance for REVLIMID? And then two, as we think about the
evolution of Celgene post-REVLIMID genericization in the mid-2020s, how do you think about Celgene's ability to
grow through a REVLIMID patent cliff in a theoretical scenario where REVLIMID outperformance makes it more
difficult to grow through that cliff or even keeps flat through that cliff? Thanks.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Thanks, John, for the question. I think I'm going to start. As you rightfully say, there are a lot of
tailwinds for REVLIMID at this moment of time, and we were explaining them for multiple myeloma. We are going to
provide you with an update of our lymphoma program at ASH. And we also invite you to look at the data that we're
going to show for the MAGNIFY study at ASH. We are feeling very confident about the ongoing ASCO studies, both
in the first-line and second-line setting for indolent lymphoma. So definitely further upside coming from lymphoma
until 2020.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: It's Jackie. So just maybe the other thing, I think we have always had a tendency to be a
little bit conservative in terms of when we look forward, what we put in our models for duration, and we have wanted
to wait and see what actual experiences in the marketplace and think about how the data supports that. So I think as
everything has played out, it's gone extremely well. And on a go-forward basis, we would expect that to continue.

So with respect to your question about the patent issue, and I think we've highlighted this if not completely
quantitatively, directionally in some of the things that we have been presenting. We have a tremendous number of
things going on in the pipeline, not only in the multiple myeloma area where all the things that Michael and Mark and
others have spoken about today, including BCMA and other things that we have going on. So we see great potential to
continue to have a very strong multiple myeloma franchise for a long time to come.
While that is happening, we've also got this great diversification coming in the I&I business, tremendous growth there.
We have a lot going on in the myeloid space, where the franchise that we talk about a little bit less maybe just because
today it's nowhere near the size of the myeloma business, but we see that business growing tremendously. And then
Michael has also talked about some of the things that we've learned with respect to CLL and other diseases that are not
in the model at all. So I think there's a lot of optionality in the portfolio, and we feel very confident in our ability as we
get out there to continue to grow for a long time beyond 2026.

Our next question comes from Dane Leone with BTIG. Your line is open.
<Q - Dane Leone>: Hi, thank you for getting everyone's questions in here and congrats on a great quarter. I'm just
asking something that hasn't really been discussed but keeps coming up in all of your presentations. When we think
about CC-90002, the mechanism of action presumably is going to be quite orthogonal to your other assets in the
developmental pipeline. And I was just curious. Even though you haven't gone through great detail of discussion, how
are you thinking about that asset ultimately being developed and the lymphoma versus the leukemia and the AML
space?
<A - Michael Pehl>: I'm sorry. Is that a question related to our CD47 program? Sorry, we just had somebody sneezing
in the room when you said the name of the compound.
<Q - Dane Leone>: No problem. Yes, the CD47 program. I was just curious about your thoughts, especially that
maybe your initial efforts now in AML, how you're thinking about, I guess, that asset potentially being developed in
the AML versus leukemia broader or the lymphoma space as you're pushing into certain assets there, especially with
REVLIMID and maybe CC-122 there.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Thanks. And sorry once again, as we all have a big cold and we pass it to each other in this room.
So the first thing I really wanted to say is – on CD47 is really a part of this growing opportunity and pipeline that
Celgene has been building in I-O. We have new CELMoDs that play in that space. We have cellular therapy, and we
talked about BCMA, CAR-T, and we talked about our CD19 program. We have multiple opportunities regarding
T-cells, not just through our cooperation with AstraZeneca. but also other checkpoint inhibitors that we are extremely
interested in both on the activating and on the suppressing side. And I think CD47 plays extremely nicely into this
whole building toolbox that we have – having as it's an ability to really activate macrophages.
So we see this in the context of building our I-O pipeline. That's number one. And of course, we are trying to test it
very broadly. We're starting an acute – in AML. As you well know, there is the opportunity to take this asset into more
diseases. Lymphoma comes to mind. Solid tumors come to mind. But AML/MDS is certainly amongst the first
indications that we're interested in. We also obtain a strong signal, and then we're going to see how to take it forward.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: I think you get credit for a most creative question too.

<Q - Konstantinos N. Aprilakis>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So my question was actually already
asked, but I'll ask a variation and try to get more granular. Regarding the combination regimens for REVLIMID, you
mentioned doublets are currently being used. Triplets are coming online. Could you get more granular? Which triplets,
where do you see it being used most often?
<A - Michael Pehl>: So thanks for the question, Konstantinos. So we see a very steep increase at this moment of time
in the U.S. And the situation is not exactly same in U.S. than in Europe. Triplet usage in U.S. is of course is already
broader. In Europe, you always have to take the reimbursement hurdle. But triplets are increasingly also reimbursed in
Europe. So where we see a really steep increase at this moment of time is through the combination of REVLIMID and
dexamethasone with Velcade. Based upon the data of SWOG SO777, the first-line study that has been presented
roundabout a year ago – and just to remind everybody, compared with REVLIMID alone, there's a 12-month overall
survival benefit, so that's quite a lot. There's a lot of usage of this combination not just in an elderly population – that's
what we see – but then also certainly in the induction setting.
What makes this very compelling when we're thinking about Europe is certainly the fact that at a certain time point,
Velcade is going to become generic. So you have a very well-tolerated, very effective triplet which may come along
with a very reasonable cost. We're putting a lot of effort behind this combination. And then of course, there is the
combination of – and I just wanted to point it out once again because The New England Journal of Medicine was so
nice, the REVLIMID/daratumumab combination, 40 to 50-month progression-free survival. That's going to drive our
treatment duration big time, and we see that as a catalyst, again starting in the U.S., but I have no doubt that it's also
going to come to Europe.
Peter N. Kellogg
So thank you, Michael, and listen, thanks for all the questions. We've run a little bit over, so I'll just quickly wrap up.
This is Peter. Based on all the comments that Michael and Scott have made and Jackie as well and Mark, you can tell
that we've got very strong commercial momentum right now. And so obviously, Q2 results we're very pleased with.
More good stuff to come, obviously, as we finish up the year, and as we move into 2017 and look ahead and 2020, we
actually feel like we're very much on track to do extremely well against those targets.
Obviously, we're in an exciting period. The fourth quarter is always fun for us. There's a tremendous amount of news
flow at the medical meetings on our products and our pipeline. We continue to enrich our pipeline and move it forward,
which you saw on the deep dive just for protein homeostasis. But obviously from a business development standpoint,
you can see we've broadened the range of things that we're looking at. There is just a tremendous set of opportunities
for us to pursue. So it's an exciting time to be part of Celgene. We're really pleased with our results, and thank you for
your support.
