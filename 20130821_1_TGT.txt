MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation's Second Quarter Earnings
Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will
invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is
being recorded Wednesday, August 21st, 2013.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Gregg W. Steinhafel
Good morning, and welcome to our 2013 second quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are
Kathee Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and John Mulligan, Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer.
This morning, I'll provide a high-level summary of our second quarter results and strategic priorities for the rest of the
year; then, Kathee will discuss category results, guest insights, and upcoming initiatives; and finally, John will provide
more detail on our financial performance along with our outlook for the third quarter and full year. Following John's
remarks, we'll open up the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.
As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via
webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and John Mulligan will be available throughout the day to
answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this
morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Finally, in
these remarks we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our
GAAP results is included in this morning's press release posted on our Investor Relations website.
Target's second quarter financial results reflect strong U.S. profit performance in spite of soft traffic and sales. Our
second quarter comparable sales increased 1.2%, below our expectations going into the quarter, but nearly two

percentage points ahead of our first quarter pace. As a result, we delivered second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.19, at the
high end of our expectations going into the quarter. Our GAAP EPS of $0.95 was in the middle of our expected range,
reflecting higher-than-expected dilution of $0.21 from our Canadian segment.
As we monitor the economy and consumer sentiment, we continue to see a mix of signals in which emerging optimism
is balanced with continuing challenges. This year's payroll tax increase continues to affect spending, particularly among
lower and moderate income households, and household formation in younger demographic groups remains stubbornly
negative. Recent job growth numbers have been encouraging, but labor force participation and income growth remain
weak. And, while emerging strength in the housing and automotive sectors is a long-term positive, the near-term
spending on these big-ticket items is crowding out other spending, particularly in today's environment in which access
to consumer credit remains tight.
As you've heard from all operators and other retailers, we continue to see the impact of trip consolidation in U.S.
households, as our second quarter comp was entirely driven by an increase in basket size, partially offset by a small
decline in traffic. Second quarter sales in our digital channels grew in the teens overall, with mobile traffic and sales
continuing to grow at a triple-digit pace.
Second quarter operating margins in the U.S. were quite strong, especially in light of the pace of our sales. We
delivered a healthy gross margin rate as we saw a relatively balanced mix of sales across categories, and our merchant
teams did a great job managing inventory and price investments. In addition, we continue to benefit from very
disciplined management of expenses, particularly in our stores. In fact, excluding the impact of the decline in the
contribution from our credit card portfolio, U.S. segment operating margins increased from last year's second quarter.
Altogether, we feel very good about our second quarter U.S. segment performance as we overcame
softer-than-expected sales and the year-over-year impact of credit card profit-sharing to deliver a 6.1% increase in
adjusted earnings per share. These results demonstrate the resilience of our team and our operating model in the face of
a challenging economic and consumer environment.
In our Canadian segment, we've reached the halfway point in our 2013 market launch. We opened another 44 Canadian
Target stores in the second quarter, putting our total at 68 today, on the way to our goal of operating 124 Canadian
stores by year end. Launching our Canadian segment has required a massive effort from teams throughout the
company, including building a completely new supply chain infrastructure and integrated technology solution;
completely reconstructing former Zellers locations transforming them into brand-new Target stores; hiring and training
more than 15,000 Canadian team members; and creating unique merchandise strategies and assortments to fit the
preferences of our Canadian guests, including a very strong presence in our home and apparel categories.
The teams' execution on these efforts has been excellent. As a result, our Canadian stores have seen strong initial
traffic, and the mix of our sales in home and apparel has been even higher than expected. However, now that we've
successfully opened 68 stores in Canada, we need to drive trips and conversion in frequency categories like healthcare,
food, and other basic commodities. Sales in these categories have grown much more slowly than we expected, causing
overall sales and profit momentum to build more slowly as well.
Multiple surveys indicate that our prices are very competitive and right where they need to be when compared to
competition in local markets. Yet, we know there is a gap in guest awareness of how low our prices really are. As a
result, we are deploying multiple tactics to help our guests better understand the great value and convenience we
provide in these categories.
Over time, we expect these efforts will drive greater awareness of the assortment and value we provide on these
frequently-purchased items, leading our Canadian guests to regularly shop Target for a balance of both wants and
needs. Our expectations are informed by our experience in launching the PFresh remodel program and City Target
format, as well as our historical experience entering new markets in the U.S. In many of these markets, we saw a
similar pattern in which sales momentum was slower than expected at the launch, but grew rapidly in the first several
years after opening, resulting in achievement of our fifth-year sales goals.

For the stores we've opened, the team in Canada is working to adjust inventory and store staffing to match the pace of
sales in each individual location and, for the segment in total, we have updated the expected timing of earnings
accretion.
Having said that, we remain highly confident in our strategy. We're very pleased with the look and feel of these new
stores, and we have an outstanding Canadian team. We've invested in this segment to position it for long-term success,
and we continue to believe we'll achieve our longer term financial goals in Canada.
Across the company, we are moving quickly to position our business to succeed in a rapidly-changing retail
environment. This requires our team to stay laser-focused on near-term execution while simultaneously allocating
resources and effort to initiatives that will drive longer term sales growth and profitability.
Recent examples of this include the beta launch of Cartwheel, our mobile coupon platform on Facebook, that has
experienced rapid growth since its launch in April. This platform which integrates our stores and mobile into guest
social networks has seen very high levels of guest engagement. In fact, our partners at Facebook have told us that
engagement statistics for Cartwheel are among the best they have seen in the beta stage of any app, both within and
outside the retail space.
We're also dividing meaningful resources to enhance the flexibility of our fulfillment network, which includes our
stores, regional distribution centers, online fulfillment centers, and import warehouses. In addition, we're investing in
data systems that will provide a single, holistic view across vendors, items, our distribution infrastructure, and stores
that will allow us to more efficiently and seamlessly fulfill guest demand in whatever channels they choose.
And, we're pleased with our recent agreement to acquire the DermStore Beauty Group. This unique opportunity, which
follows our acquisition of Chefs and Cooking.com earlier in the year, provides us insight into the superior online
experience DermStore provides, along with access to brands, content, and resources that are valuable to our guests.
As we look to the remainder of the year and beyond, we're taking steps to drive guest traffic both today and over time.
We're steadfast in our commitment to provide value to guests who continue to shop cautiously, investing in everyday
low prices and even lower prices in our weekly circular and flier, combined with compelling discounts available on
Cartwheel.
We reinforced this commitment to value with price-matching policies for both online and local print ads from
competitors, and 5% REDcard rewards and pharmacy rewards allows guests to save even more off our already great
prices. The continued rapid adoption of both of these programs demonstrates the value they provide for our guests.
Beyond low prices, we work to differentiate our assortment and guest experience by partnering with designers and
others to provide unique, unexpected, value-added products and services.
For example, in our stores we're adding service elements to categories including beauty and electronics, and outside our
stores, we will continue to explore acquisition opportunities to augment our digital capabilities, content, and brands.
Additionally, we are building the digital acumen of the organization through hiring and collaborations with leading
technology partners. For example, our recently opened Technology Innovation Center in San Francisco provides us the
opportunity to benefit from technology talent in the area and rapidly explore opportunities that can be brought to
Target, accelerating the pace of our innovation and adoption of emerging technologies and trends.
And, we're building the capability to operate stores in smaller spaces, particularly in urban markets. We are analyzing
results in our first seven City Target stores to understand where in the stores we have the ability to reduce space even
more, allowing us to further shrink the size of this store format. Ultimately, we believe we will succeed over time by
providing value to our guests in a world of and, where we provide the ability to conveniently shop in stores and digital
channels, enjoyable shopping for both wants and needs, access to great design and low prices, and the ability to save
money with an ethical company that supports the communities where we operate.
At Target, we've long understood the power of and, which is summed up by our brand promise to Expect More and Pay
Less. We believe this promise is more relevant than ever in today's environment and we are committed across the
organization to delivering on it every day in every channel.

Before I turn the call over to Kathee, I want to take a moment to thank the Target team for their outstanding efforts in
this challenging environment. The team has already accomplished a lot this year, successfully launching a record
number of stores outside the U.S. for the first time, selling our credit card portfolio to an outstanding partner in TD
Bank, and preserving profitability in a softer-than-expected sales environment in the U.S. Throughout the organization,
we are focused on becoming more nimble, moving quickly to test and learn from new initiatives. I'm proud of this
team, and confident that our efforts will position Target for long-term success.
Now, Kathee will provide more detail on second quarter results, outline the initiatives for the third quarter and beyond.
Kathee?
Kathryn A. Tesija
Thanks, Gregg. We're very pleased with the ability of our team to manage inventory and profitability in our U.S.
business during a quarter in which consumers shopped cautiously and competitors promoted heavily to clear excess
inventory. In our second quarter U.S. results, we saw a relatively narrow spread in comparable sales between the
strongest and softest performing categories. Not surprisingly, sales in less discretionary areas like food, healthcare and
household essentials grew somewhat faster than the company average. However, sales in our home category also grew
faster than the company average, driven by particular strength in our domestic and stationery categories.
Among the other more discretionary categories, second quarter comparable sales in both apparel and hardlines declined
slightly. Within apparel, our children's categories had the strongest results, while the more discretionary women's
assortments experienced softer results in the face of a very promotional environment.
We continue to deliver excitement through limited time partnerships with influential designers who help us
differentiate Target in support of our Expect More, Pay Less brand promise. In the second quarter, we were very
pleased with the results of our collaboration with Lauren Bush Lauren and Feed USA, featuring products in home,
sporting goods, stationery, apparel, and accessories. Beyond the merchandise, this unique program reinforced our
commitment to communities, as Target provided more than 10 million meals for U.S. families through this
collaboration.
We're also very pleased with the initial results for the beta launch of Cartwheel, a differentiated mobile experience that
delivers value for our guests. We launched the Cartwheel app on the iOS and Android platforms in June, and it's
already a Top-20 lifestyle app in the Apple Store. Cartwheel is growing rapidly. It currently has more than a million
users who have saved more than $2 million so far. Among active users, more than 50% have completed multiple
Cartwheel transactions, demonstrating the power of the program to drive sustained guest engagement.
As expected, guests are searching for deals while they're shopping in stores, and we've seen redemption rates in excess
of 50% for offers downloaded by guests while they're shopping. We're pleased with these initial results, and will apply
what we've learned to improve both the Cartwheel experience as well as the development of our multi-channel
experiences in the future.
Beyond new mobile experiences like Cartwheel, our overall mobile sales and traffic continued to grow at a rapid pace.
To build on this momentum, we're investing to enhance speed, search, product information, and check-out on our
mobile site. And this fall we'll begin testing other innovations to enhance the in-store mobile experience including way
finding and improved search, and we continue to invest to further integrate the shopping experience across channels.
Based on successful results from our team member test of buy online and pick up in store, we are moving quickly to
begin offering this option for guests in the third quarter. We'll begin in the Minneapolis market before expanding the
rollout to other markets. We expect to complete the rollout to all stores by the holiday season.
Simultaneously, we are planning team member tests of other flexible fulfillment capabilities, which will begin later this
year, including the ability to deliver online orders from stores as early as the same day, and the ability to pay in one
store and pick up in another. Based on the results of the team member test, we will look to move to guest-facing tests
next year.

And beyond investments to build on our own digital offering, we continue to monitor the landscape to identify
opportunities to augment our capabilities through acquisitions. The recent decision to acquire DermStore reflects the
strategic opportunity for Target to learn from their online expertise, customer service, content development, and
product duration, which combine to create an exceptional online beauty experience. In addition, DermStore's broad
assortment of prestige and dermatology brands will complement Target's product offering.
We continue to approach the economic and competitive environment with longer term optimism but near-term caution.
While overall consumer confidence statistics have improved this year, it's notable that optimism among lower-income
households is lagging behind. And as Gregg mentioned, this year's payroll tax increase and consumer spending on
autos and housing are crowding out spending on other goods and services. For example, in surveys regarding expected
spending on back-to-school and back-to-college items, consumers indicate they intend to spend less than a year ago by
focusing on sales, discounts, and reusing items they already own. As a result, in preparing for the third quarter and
beyond, we're building flexibility into our inventory plans and creating merchandise and marketing programs focused
on driving traffic and sales with compelling offers, innovative partnerships, and key seasonal programs. Target is
known for delivering key seasons for our guests and only the fourth quarter holiday season is bigger than
back-to-school and back-to-college.
This year, we've created a multi-layer strategy to deliver a great guest experience and outstanding value. For
back-to-school, we are offering parents a convenient one-stop-shop for all the must-have items on their shopping list at
a range of price points to accommodate a variety of household budgets, including hundreds of unique items in fashion,
school supplies and accessories for less than $20. In fact, we have nearly 400 items for $1 or less, clearly demonstrating
our commitment to deliver value. Our back-to-school direct mail catalog includes more than $25 worth of coupons, and
we've increased the number of online coupons this year as well. And, of course, parents who use their Target REDcard
will receive 5% off their entire purchase and free shipping on every order from target.com.
To support our back-to-school merchandising [inaudible] (19:17) broadcast themes in various links and languages
which focus on telling stories around iconic school moments that make kids feel like real-life heroes. In addition to the
unique Kids Got Style Instagram program, Target celebrated kids as the most original style leaders. Earlier this month,
parents could Instagram a picture of their children showing off their individual style. Target stylists used select photos
as inspiration to create Kids Got Style mood-boards of colors, fashion items and supplies inspired by each child's
unique style, which were posted to Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Parents were tagged so they could view and share
their photos to their social networks as inspiration for the new school year.
Because we know that quality education is the number-one social priority for our guests, it's also the number-one focus
of our giving programs. So, following last year's success, we're excited about the return of our Give With Target
program, through which Target will donate $5 million to schools across the country. Last year, our guests impacted
more than 30,000 schools through donations from this program, which were used to purchase classroom resources like
electronics, office supplies, and storage and organization products. New this year, Target is inviting guests to allocate
the full donation, double the amount designated by guests last year, to schools of their choice.
For back-to-college, we've created innovative resources and new live experiences both online and in person to provide
the inspiration and tools to make shopping fun and easy. Last month, Target introduced a first-of-its-kind, online, live
experience featuring popular YouTube personalities in life-sized virtual dorms. From July 15th through the 18th,
visitors were invited to shop Target products from the dorm rooms, enter to win college gear, and interact with the
roommates.
Also online, we've created uStyler, a style-focused design resource that puts students in the driver's seat as they put
together their unique dorm room look. Looks can be named, saved, and shared on their favorite social media sites,
where their friends are able to shop them. And we've created the Checklist, a customizable list of key products
available in stores and at target.com to help students shop for small-space living. On campus, Target is hosting 95
shopping events for incoming freshmen around the country as part of welcome week festivities. These events include
after-hours shopping events, which provide free bus transportation to and from our store, where students will be able to
shop for everything they need and want.

Halloween is also a key season for Target, and the holiday falls in our third quarter this year. We plan to deliver this
season with a multi-channel approach focused on driving traffic and growing our market share. We'll offer a
comprehensive assortment of costumes and accessories for the whole family, including parents, kids, and pets. We'll
offer a dominant presentation in our stores, and extend the assortment on target.com. In Home, Target's product design
and development team has created an innovative collection of Halloween decor ranging from classic to scary to help
mom decorate her home inside and out for the big night.
As Gregg mentioned, we're increasingly focused on differentiating our store experience through enhanced service. The
baby category is already one of our signature strengths, but we believe we have an opportunity to further deepen
relationships with guests who are entering this life stage. Expectant parents establish new shopping habits, and it's a
time when they're looking for easy shopping solutions to save time. As a result, we're continually exploring new ways
to elevate the shopping experience for expectant parents.
For example, in 10 Chicago stores, we're testing an interactive shopping experience which features accessible product
displays, including feature fixtures with mannequins, to showcase outfits and allow guests to touch and try out
products. There's also a collaboration center in the area where guests can sit comfortably, access the registry, or get
personalized assistance from a team member. Digital tools on hands, such as iPads, also provide guests easy online
access to product information.
Another part of the store where we see an opportunity for enhanced service is our beauty area. Based on results from
our Chicago market test of the Beauty Concierge program, we rolled out the concept to an additional 200 stores in the
second quarter, including stores in L.A., Washington D.C., Baltimore, and Minneapolis markets. These beauty
consultants are brand agnostic, and provide guests with detailed unbiased information on all beauty and personal care
categories in the store, including product attributes and ingredient benefits, serving as a knowledgeable source and a
friendly face in what can often be an intimidating category. We believe this program serves to differentiate Target in
the beauty space, while still meeting guest needs for value and convenience.
And, of course, in the third quarter, we will continue to introduce unique merchandise throughout our assortments to
deliver newness and excitement for our guests. For example, this fall, we're excited to be partnering with Phillip Lim.
Phillip is a designer we've been watching for years. His aesthetic is chic yet understated and his focus on democratizing
beautiful fashion makes him a perfect fit for our brands. Beginning September 15th, Target will offer a limited edition
collection of apparel and accessories including an assortment of bags, shoes and scarves for men and women at most
Target stores and target.com. Prices will range from $20 to $300, with most items under $50. The entire Phillip Lim for
Target Collection will be presented in the women's apparel department when it debuts in our stores, allowing guests to
find the entire collection in one easy-to-shop area of the store. After the first week, we plan to move items to their
respective departments within the store.
In late September, we'll launch a new line of men's pants from Haggar called Haggar H-26. Haggar is a premium brand
in men's pants, and we're excited to offer a no-iron premium khaki and a classic fit, performance slack in a classic fit,
and original chino in a straight fit. And in beauty, earlier this month, we expanded our hair care assortment with the
exclusive launch of Toni & Guy Hair Meet Wardrobe, a premium hair care line introduced in the U.K. in 2011.
Available for the first time in the U.S. at Target stores and target.com, Hair Meet Wardrobe includes a full range of
shampoos, conditioners, hair accessories, and styling tools, and range in price from $5 to $40.
And finally, we continue to feature exclusive partnerships with influential artists. Reigning Academy of Country Music
Entertainer of the Year Luke Bryan teamed up with Target for his latest release Crash My Party, which is out last week.
The Target exclusive deluxe edition of the album contains four bonus tracks. And, following last spring's success, we're
thrilled that once again we're partnering with Justin Timberlake to release a special edition of the continuation of his
third studio album The 20/20 Experience 2 of 2, featuring two exclusive bonus tracks. Guests can pre-order the album
now on target.com, or purchase online or in stores beginning September 30th.
While we continued to experience the impact of cautious consumer spending and trip consolidation, we continued to
innovate across all our channels to provide our guests unbeatable value and unique experiences. We are confident we

have the right plans in place for the third quarter, and we're moving quickly to ensure we stay relevant in an
increasingly digital marketplace.
Now, John will share his insights on our second quarter financial performance and our outlook for the third quarter and
the full year. John?
John J. Mulligan
Thanks, Kathee. Very pleased with our second quarter U.S. segment financial performance, as the team generated
outstanding profitability despite softer-than-expected traffic and sales. Second quarter U.S. segment comparable sales
increased 1.2%. Sales strengthened somewhat as the quarter progressed, and were further aided by this year's calendar
shift, which moved some early back-to-school sales into July.
Like many other retailers, we continue to see the impact of trip consolidations among U.S. consumers, as average
transaction size drove more than 100% of our comparable sales growth, reflecting increases in both item per basket and
average retail per unit. Year-over-year penetration of sales in our proprietary debit and credit cards grew nearly 600
basis points in the second quarter, and for the first time in our history, debit penetration moved beyond credit. The debit
card has proven to be the engine that has propelled REDcard rewards beyond our initial stretch goals. It is the right
product for a large set of guests who simply don't want another credit card in their wallet.
We continue to measure the change in household spending when guests begin using one of our debit or credit cards,
and we continue to see, on average, a 50% increase in household spending when guests apply for and activate one of
our cards.
Second quarter gross margin rate in the U.S. was 31.4%, up slightly from last year. As I outlined last quarter, this year
we've made changes to our vendor agreements regarding payments received in support of our marketing programs,
which creates equivalent year-over-year increases in our U.S. segment gross margin and SG&A expense rates. These
changes raised our second quarter gross margin rate by about 20 basis points. Excluding the benefit from vendor
payments, gross margin would have declined slightly as our growth-driving REDcard rewards and PFresh remodel
programs created moderate pressure, which was partially offset by rate improvements within merchandise categories.
The merchant teams also did a great job managing receipts in the face of softer-than-expected sales. At the end of the
quarter, average inventory per store in the U.S. was up only 1.8% from a year ago.
As expected, on the SG&A expense line, we continue to the impact of a smaller contribution from the credit card
portfolio, which we sold to TD Bank in March. And, while we tried to do a thorough job last quarter explaining the
impact of the sale and the associated change in our segment reporting, we have received feedback from some of you
that we could have done a better job. You know who you are.
So, to provide greater clarity this quarter, let's go back a year and revisit our second quarter 2012 U.S. credit card
segment results, in which we earned EBIT of $143 million. This segment, EBIT reflected the impact of $74 million in
profit-sharing at the U.S. retail segment, which we described as loyalty program charges in our financial statements. So,
in total, the corporation earned EBIT from the credit card portfolio of $217 million, $143 million in the U.S. credit card
segment and $74 million in the U.S. retail segment. Importantly, all of this $217 million is reflected in the revised 2012
results for our new U.S. segment.
Moving now to the second quarter 2013, we received profit-sharing of $183 million from TD, which was partially
offset by approximately $65 million of our expense to service accounts on their behalf, meaning second quarter
contribution from the credit card portfolio was about $118 million, down about $100 million from a year ago.
Two other things are important to remember: first, not all of the year-over-year decline in credit contribution was
driven by the sale to TD, as the portfolio is smaller than a year ago, and we're annualizing a $30 million reserve release
in second quarter 2012; second, outside the U.S. segment, we continue to offset some of the impact of profit-sharing, as
we have deployed proceeds from the sale to reduce our net-debt position and repurchase shares.

With that as context, we can turn to our second quarter U.S. segment SG&A expense rate of 20.6%, which was up from
20.2% in last year's revised U.S. segment. More than 100% of this increase, or about 6/10ths of a percentage point, was
driven by the decline in the contribution from the credit card portfolio. In addition, we continue to experience expense
pressure from this year's incremental investments in technology and distribution in support of our multi-channel efforts.
And finally, the change in vendor payments increased our SG&A expense rate by about 20 basis points. Offsetting
these multiple pressures, we benefited from favorable leverage of compensation expenses, including incentive
compensation and store payroll, and we continue to benefit from our company-wide expense optimization efforts,
which are identifying opportunities to increase productivity throughout the organization.
Altogether, our second quarter U.S. segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were down only slightly from last year's
revised U.S. results. However, without the headwind from the credit card portfolio, both rates would've increased
slightly. These results are outstanding and notably better than we would have expected in a quarter in which sales fell
well short of our expected range.
In our Canadian segment, sales accelerated from the first quarter as we continued to open stores at a robust pace.
However, we've seen a slower-than-expected ramp-up in sales following the grand opening rush, particularly in our
frequency categories. Second quarter REDcard penetration in Canada was 2.3%, and, consistent with our U.S. segment,
debit penetration was slightly ahead of credit.
As we've seen in the U.S. since the launch of the program, we expect REDcard penetration to continue to grow in
Canada, driving incremental sales across all categories. The Canadian segment earned second quarter gross margin of
$87 million, or 31.6%, reflecting a very favorable mix of sales in the home and apparel categories, offset by the impact
of some inventory clearance.
Second quarter SG&A expenses were $207 million, reflecting both ongoing operating expenses combined with
meaningful startup expenses, as we prepare to open new stores. Altogether, second quarter dilution attributable to the
Canadian segment, including depreciation, amortization and interest expense recorded outside the segment, was $0.21,
compared with our estimate of $0.16 going into the quarter.
Even in a year where we are making meaningful investments in distribution, technology and our Canadian market
launch, we have been able to return a large amount of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.
In the second quarter, we paid dividends of $231 million and repurchased more than $900 million worth of our shares.
Year-to-date, we've paid dividends of nearly $0.5 billion and repurchased shares worth nearly $1.5 billion. And, we
were pleased to announce in June that our Board of Directors had approved a 19% increase to our quarterly dividend,
from $0.36 to $0.43 per share. As a result, 2013 will mark the forty-second consecutive year in which this company has
increased its annual dividend.
Now, let's turn to our expectations for the third quarter and full year. In the U.S. segment, we're expecting third quarter
comparable sales in the range of 1% to 2%. While this outlook is somewhat ahead of our second quarter pace, it is
supported by our experience so far in August and it reflects the benefit of this year's calendar shift, which moves the
Halloween holiday into October from last year's fiscal November.
We expect a small decline in the gross margin rate compared with last year, reflecting the impact of our growth
initiatives, partially offset by the benefit of the vendor payment shift. We expect our third quarter SG&A expense rate
will be approximately 21.4%, reflecting about 60 basis points of pressure from a lower credit portfolio contribution,
and continued pressure from our multi-channel investments and the shift in vendor payments, partially offset by the
ongoing benefit of our expense optimization efforts. Altogether, these expectations deliver a third quarter EBITDA
margin rate about a full percentage point below last year's third quarter revised U.S. segment EBITDA margin rate.
In Canada, the team continues to refine operations in the stores already opened, ensuring that inventory and expenses
match the current pace of sales in each individual store. It's important to note that we're still very early into our market
launch, and as Gregg mentioned, we're deploying multiple tactics to drive sales in our frequency categories over time.
However, given that we had initially positioned our expense structure, fulfillment network, and inventory to support
potential upside to our initial sales forecast, we are incurring markdowns and higher-than-normal operating expense

rates as we adjust to the current pace of sales. This has raised our dilution expectations for this segment through the end
of the year. Specifically, for the third quarter, we expect the Canadian segment will drive $0.22 of dilution to our
consolidated earnings per share.
In total, we expect third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.80 to $0.90, and GAAP EPS of $0.55 to $0.65, reflecting Canada
dilution along with $0.03 of expense from the unwind of the beneficial interest asset resulting from our credit card
portfolio.
For the full year, we have become incrementally more cautious in our U.S. sales outlook, given our own recent results
and those of our competitors. We now expect the full year comparable sales increase of about 1%, down from our prior
outlook for an increase of 2% to 2. 5%. We believe planning for this pace is appropriate and will help to mitigate
downside risk of taking a more aggressive inventory position. As always, Kathee's team remains prepared to chase
business if the U.S. environment strengths unexpectedly.
Even with our more tempered sales expectation, we believe full-year adjusted EPS will remain in the $4.70 to $4.90
range we provided previously, although our expectation has moved to the low end of that range. We expect full-year
GAAP EPS will be approximately $0.95 lower than adjusted EPS, reflecting $0.82 of dilution from the Canadian
segment combined with the net $0.13 of dilution from the credit card portfolio sale and associated debt repurchase.
Beyond this year, we expect year-over-year EPS performance in the Canadian segment to improve meaningfully in
2014. While Canadian segment sales are starting from a different base than we expected, we have ample experience
with U.S. market launches to give us confidence that we can drive stronger sales increases in the next several years, and
ultimately reach our longer term sales and profit goals.
As we've said many times, our experience in opening Target stores for more than 50 years has shown that we're much
more accurate when estimating fifth-year sales than first-year sales. We're still very confident in our Canadian strategy,
stores, and team, and continue to believe this segment will generate $0.80 or more of EPS in 2017.
And finally, beginning next year, we expect to see a meaningful increase in cash available for dividends and share
repurchase. Our U.S. operations continue to generate very strong cash flow. In addition, we expect capital expenditures
in Canada to fall more than $1 billion in 2014, while U.S. capital expenditures are expected to stay essentially flat. The
resulting increase in free cash flow will allow us to continue growing the dividend at our current 20% annual rate, and
meaningfully grow share repurchase from the current pace, while maintaining our goal to preserve our current strong
investment-grade credit ratings.
That concludes today's prepared remarks. Now, Gregg, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Hi. I guess just first question on the comp. John, I think you mentioned that it did get
steadily better throughout the quarter. Any additional color you could give us there? And then I guess on – were there
any regional differences that you could potentially isolate in terms of where some of the transaction weakness was in
the quarter?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: I think the – on the sequentially, I mean it improved month-to-month within the quarter.
None of the quarters were negative, which compared to first quarter was significant progress. July was notably the
strongest, but a portion of that certainly was attributable to that back-to-school week moving in from August last year.
So, we did see it strengthening, but I wouldn't want to overplay that; certainly, a portion of it is attributable to the
calendar.

Geography-wise, we have not seen anything meaningfully different in aggregate across the quarter in any one week or
day. There's differences depending on when back-to-school starts in various portions of the country, but nothing
meaningful across the country.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay. Got it. And then, I guess, you talked about some lower advertised prices in the
circular. Is this really just in Canada, or is it also in the U.S.? And is that some of the gross margin pressure that you're
thinking about in the second half, as you've done a very nice job in terms of rate improvements in between categories
over the last four or five quarters here?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Well, I would say – this is Gregg, in the U.S. we continue to offer hot pricing. There isn't
going to be a meaningful change in our strategy because day in and day out we have unbeatable prices. When you take
a look at our – the fact that our prices are competitive, the price match policy both online and in-store, and our
REDcard's performance day in and day out, we have a very strong value proposition.
And then our circular pricing is even more aggressive than that, and we take market-leading positions. In Canada, we
know that we have an opportunity to break those shopping habits, and we've got to focus on driving need-based trips.
So, there in particular, we will sharpen up our pricing and make sure that we are taking a more of a market-leader
position. Our REDcard penetration is still very, very small there, and we expect that to grow over time. But it's more in
Canada that we're going to make sure that our prices get more notice than they have been up to this point.
Part of that was a conscious plan on our part to make sure that we really won in home and apparel, and we feel real
good about where we are in those two businesses today, so we're proud of that fact. Now we have to just turn on the gas
a little bit on the other side of the equation to make sure that we're getting the Canadian guests to understand what great
values we offer on frequency categories and break some of those well-established habits.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay. And then just real quick, on the dilution in Canada, obviously up quite a bit here in
2013 from the initial expectation. Any way or ability to paint us a picture? I know you still remain confident in that
five-year outlook on the progression towards that $0.80 in 2017. Thank you.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: So, I'm not entirely clear where you're going. Is it that, why are we confident about the $0.80
or what will we see happen here as we go forward, Sean?
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: So, yeah, I guess the question is, is there an ability to say that the Canadian business will be
– you believe the Canadian business may be accretive in 2014?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah, so, on 2014, I think very early here, and we've given you our best view. I think when
you step back, we've been operating 60-some stores for on average about two-and-a-half months. And so, we're giving
you our best information here for 2013, and clearly, sales are a little bit short of where we [inaudible] (44:08) need to
work through some of the inventory and optimizing the business and optimizing our expense structure.
I think as we look forward, getting the other 56 stores open, getting through a holiday, will certainly provide a lot more
information about where we expect to be. But in 2014, I think we expect to see meaningful improvement in the
profitability of Canada. We'll cycle past all the startup expenses, we'll have our inventories more in line with sales
patterns that we now have some information on, our expense structure will be optimized to the sales level, and we'll
start to grow sales.
So, I think we'll see meaningful improvement in 2014, but I would say probably from this perspective today, unlikely
that we'll see profitability on the full year. And we'll be back to provide a little bit more information on what that looks
like and the cadence throughout the quarters, again as we get a little bit more information this year, get the stores open,
get in new markets, and get through a holiday season, most importantly.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay. That's really helpful. Best of luck in the back half. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: I wanted to follow up on Canada and then touch on the U.S. Just to make sure I got that right or
maybe ask it a different way, John. If you look at the incremental Canadian dilution this year, how much of it is related
to those items of clearance? How much of it would be related to, if you will, start-up costs or advertising? And how
much of it do you think is just a different margin structure in the business to drive that frequency in trips?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Yeah, I think parsing that all out is difficult. I would say that the second one, incremental
marketing and advertising is not material to the total move from where we were to where we are today. I think the
biggest driver of the change in profitability or dilution this year comes from – we had a set of sales expectations as we
entered in the market and we also -given all the excitement that we saw building over two years, we protected on the
upside from an expense standpoint and from an inventory standpoint, and the sales have been somewhat disappointing,
and so, we need to work through those inventories.
There's some clearance activity, there was some excess inventory this quarter as well that we worked through, and we
need to right-size the entire expense structure for the sales numbers that we're currently operating at. So, I think that's
the vast majority of it.
I don't think we see – I know we don't see going forward a change in the overall – our view of what the margin rates
were going to be – EBITDA or EBIT rates were going to be in Canada over the long term. We feel very good about
gross margin and, frankly, we expect gross margin will deteriorate a little bit as we begin to drive these frequency
categories. You don't see that in this quarter's results because there was a fair bit of clearance and excess inventory that
we moved through. But we expect margin rates will come down as we grow sales in those frequency categories, but
net-net that'll be good for the business and start to apply leverage against the fixed expenses that we've built for the
business.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay. Great. And then second, turning to the U.S., Kathee, it was helpful to go through all the
initiatives you have and it seems like the issue that is bigger than anything is traffic staying negative versus what you
guys would have probably hoped or expected a year or two ago. If we think about the traffic side of it more
specifically, what in the back half do think is going to help stabilize and improve that traffic trend? Or is it just the way
it is now that this trip consolidation, and that's the way the consumer is and if we're going to get comp, it needs to be
with more items and top line?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: You're right, Greg. Traffic was our issue, and I do think that somewhat that is the way it is
right now. We're seeing a lot of trip consolidation across all guests. I think the part that I'm pleased about is that when
you look at our basket, we are seeing that they're buying more units from Target as well as increased selling price and
they're trading up into a higher price point product, so that's great. I think as we move forward the thing that we're
focused on in driving traffic is really making sure that as they're consolidating and they're doing more in one store, that
we're offering that compelling value and Gregg talked a lot about all of those components but that we make sure that
that continues to be rock-solid, as well as the innovative products.
And I mentioned a lot of those that we have coming like Phillip and Haggar . In our seasonal categories, we've got a lot
of new stuff coming, so that's key. And then I guess the third thing that I would add is just making sure that our in-store
experience remains outstanding, because we want them to be pleased when they come and continue to consolidate their
trip and to do more at Target. So, we have great service every day, but in addition to that, some of the new things that
we're doing with flexible fulfillment like buy online, pick up in store, I think will be fantastic in the back half. And
then, we're also looking at really upping the in-store experience in key categories like beauty and the tests that I
described in baby. So, it's a combination of those three things.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Thanks.

<Q - Matt R. Nemer>: Good morning; thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick follow-up on Canada, and then a
couple on the U.S. business as well. Could you just talk to the inventory overhang in Canada, the clearance that you
spoke to? Is that primarily also on frequency items, or is that more discretionary products?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: The inventory overhang is a function of the shortfall, primarily in some of the seasonal
categories. So, think of – even though apparel and home was strong, the variability by store and the fact that some of
our seasonal categories like lawn and patio didn't perform at the level that we were expecting. So, it was not in the
basic categories or the non-discretionaries, primarily in a subset of the discretionary categories. But it is one of those
things where it's more obvious because it's such a large number of stores, but it's the same kind of fine-tuning that we
go through every time we open a new store here in the United States and have experienced for years and years. There is
always a tremendous amount of fine-tuning and getting the right match of sales volatility, variability, assortment, and
aligning that with inventory. What we're seeing in Canada is just there is such a big critical mass that it stands out and
it's far more obvious, but it's no different than what we've experienced here.
<Q - Matt R. Nemer>: Okay. Great. And then in terms of the average transaction size, could you just elaborate on
which categories are benefiting from the larger basket and the trade-up that you alluded to?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Yeah, I think that we're seeing larger basket in many different areas they're shopping. As I
said, doing more in one store, so shopping around the store. In terms of the selling price, we're seeing strength in
trading up to higher price points in back-to-school. We're seeing strength, for example, in home with threshold, where
they're buying a better product versus opening price point product. And then, we're also seeing some softer sales in our
one spot at the front of the store, which is very seasonal and impulsive products. So, that combination I think is driving
that selling price.
<Q - Matt R. Nemer>: Okay. Great. And then just lastly, if we look at some of the omni-channel and multi-channel
initiatives that are launching in the back half, is there any way to quantify the potential impact or potentially in your
survey work you could talk to how much demand there is for these products, specifically on click-and-collect or buy
online, pick up in store. I know that's half of the volume in some cases for some of your competitors' online businesses.
Could you just talk to how big you think that could be for you in the back half? Thank you.
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Well, we don't have a number that we can share on that. We have, as you know, been testing
it with team members. And I think the key for us is just the convenience for guests to be able to buy it online, but then
they want to pick it up in store. Sometimes, they don't want it delivered and sitting on their doorstep, but often times
they want to be able to get other things in the store, either go along with that core item or just the rest of their list. So,
we think it will be very interesting to our guests. It certainly has been with our team members, but we haven't
quantified the sales number yet.
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Yeah, I would just say this is – we're in a learning environment right now. We'll be able
to give you a lot more specifics after we get through the holiday season. And for us to try and quantify at this stage
would be – it would be a shot in the dark. So, we really don't want to speculate how our guests are going to use that and
– but we'll be back at the end of the holiday, and we'll give you a lot more color around the adoption and the acceptance
rates by our guests.

<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Thanks for taking my question. Thinking about spending in the first half of the year

<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: There is not really a meaningful difference in terms of the rate of spend first half, second
half. We didn't overspend or underspend in the first half to shift dollars to the second half. We've always felt that the
allocation of resources by quarter by half has been pretty appropriate, and our spend is going to be similar in those
kinds of percentages. What we have seen is we've ramped up our spend in the digital channel, it's a less expensive
channel. It gives us different guests and broader reach, and we've become far more efficient in the use of our marketing
dollars. So, I think we're getting the same or more bang for our buck for essentially the same investments that we've
made in the past.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Okay. And then, with regards to Canada, can you elaborate a little bit on the
announcement this week with regards to the Metro partnership in Canada?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Yeah, we're excited to have Metro as a partner to run our pharmacies in the Quebecian
province in the Eastern part of Canada. We think they are great partner. They run a terrific business, and we're thrilled
to have them as our partner.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Okay. And then lastly, it seems like you have a unique opportunity with the REDcard to
clearer communications between Canada and the U.S. You have almost 20% of your customer base. Can you talk about
through e-mail and text what you're doing in terms of personalization?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: We're doing a lot with both e-mail and text and – but I would tell you, Deb, that we're in the
beginning of that journey. We think there's a lot more that we can do, but we're doing things with personalization in
terms of seasonal and timing, but also product categories that resonate with our guests, and we're seeing great results.
We've upped particularly e-mail a lot this year, and it's really paying off. And so, we're on a journey, and we think that
there's a lot of headroom there, and we will go after that in a big way.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Great. Thanks so much, and best of luck.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason DeRise with UBS.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: [inaudible] (56:12) here at UBS. I wanted to ask about Canada's gross margin again; I know
there's been a few questions already. But if you did better on more of those discretionary items, and I guess there were
some shortfalls store by store in terms of certain seasonal items coming through. I mean, is this – how is this I guess
affecting maybe some of your plans? Are you adding more planograms? Is that going to add to some of the SG&A
costs to service all these stores? If it's just different demand for different products, and just reflecting how diverse
Canada actually is, or is it just weather effects, and what have you learned from that process?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: I don't think that we'll be adding a lot of planogram versions. I think we're still tweaking
what's on those planograms, but we understand that and we've got many different versions throughout Canada for all of
their differences across geography and their guests. But I think what Gregg was talking about was, number one, getting
the buy right by store in all of those categories, and then some of the seasonal categories were softer.
So, making sure that we get that buy right going forward, that has less to do with planogram itself. And then, in
addition to that, as we're driving more trips with our frequency categories, that's the side that's been weaker, we think
that traffic will also help sales throughout the store, because the guest clearly likes our differentiated merchandise on
the apparel and home side. So, it's kind of a combination, but it's more about the buy than it is about planograms.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: The other thing I'd add, Jason, is if you step back to where we were three months ago, the
gross margin rate was a little bit above 38%, and the two things we said at that time I think are still appropriate. One,
it's going to be noisy here early by quarter because it's just naturally that way as we're opening up stores; but two, don't

expect us to operate at that high a level.
While the mix was very favorable, we hadn't gone through any seasonal clearance. And so, seasonal clearance is going
to naturally bring that rate down. This quarter, a little bit more than we would have expected, but there again, I said
we're working through some excess inventory given our sales levels. So, we expect through time that the gross margin
rate will normalize at a reasonable level that ultimately will allow us to deliver EBITDA margin rates at say 12% in
Canada, like we've talked about all along.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Okay. And then, I guess, I wanted to ask on the U.S. side about the efforts to increase service,
omni-channel, flexible fulfillment, all of these things. Obviously, that costs a lot to implement. And the way I see it,
and you can correct me if I'm wrong, you're very centralized already. So, should we think about – this is just necessary
to keep sales growing? And maybe it comes in at a lower margin, or are there areas that you can offset that impact?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: I would think of it as this way. In our business at any given point in time, there are
investments that we have to make to continue to get better at what we do, whether it's a service or supply chain or a
technology investment or investments in the guest experience. And so, this is – I mean, we're calling attention to this.
But these are investments that we're going to make in the business because we want to provide a great experience,
which means our expense optimization efforts, as they have in the past, have to more than offset these kinds of
investment.
So, we look at it all-in holistically, and we're saying, hey, we got to get leaner and meaner in certain parts of the
organization and become more efficient, and we demonstrated that last quarter. We were very, very rock solid in our
expense and our productivity. And that affords us the ability to – and the capacity to get more aggressive and do some
of these kinds of things and invest in transforming the business to the future.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: I guess, could you maybe elaborate on that? I know that you talked a bit about that there's the
compensation accrual and that helped. Then you also mentioned that you're better on payrolls. I mean, is that something
where you think there's more room to go in terms of the in-store labor, or is that something where you really wouldn't
want to push too hard on because of the potential implications on revenue? And if that's the case, where else could the
savings be if it's not the store?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Jason, we said at the beginning of the year the investments in multi-channel and everything
we were doing would be $0.20 to $0.25 of incremental dilution or incremental expense in our business. And we said at
that time that through our expense optimization efforts, we expected to offset virtually all of that in the year. We do that
in a variety of ways. The stores have continuously over a long period of years looked for ways to increase productivity
faster than wage rates and faster than sales, so lowering our expense rate. And we think there's opportunities to
continue to apply technology to improve productivity in our stores. But what Gregg was talking about, our expense
optimization efforts are across the entire organization; headquarters, distribution, supply chain, everywhere we operate,
we are looking for ways to take expense out so that we can afford to invest in the business.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Okay. Thank you.
