Thanks, Patricia.
In the second quarter, we delivered $19.3 billion of revenue, operating pre-tax income of over $3 billion, operating
earnings per share of $2.97, and free cash flow of over $2.5 billion. The quarter played out as we expected with
continued solid growth in our strategic imperatives, which now really reflects organic growth. We wrapped on the
acquisitive content and we're at the stage where we can start to get some efficiency as a result of bringing them into
IBM while we build on the new content. Our gross margin is up over 2.5 points sequentially, and positions us for the
continued improvement over the course of the year we talked about 90 days ago. And we had good free cash flow
performance all again as we expected.
In the second quarter we signed a number of large contracts in Global Technology Services, and again, grew our Global
Business Services signings, both of which will start to contribute in the second half. And since the quarter ended, we
announced our new IBM z System, which will be available later this quarter. With all of this, we expect improved
performance in revenue and gross margin in the second half, and we continue to expect at least $13.80 of operating
EPS and free cash flow consistent with last year. I'll spend time on the first to second half dynamics a little later, and
you'll see it's very similar to what we talked about in April.
We've been focused on helping our enterprise clients transform their businesses, to leverage their data for competitive
advantage, and to improve the efficiency and agility of their IT environments. Our strategic imperatives performance
has been an indication of our progress in moving to these areas. As you know, our strategic imperatives aren't separate
businesses but signposts that represent the revenue across our business lines that work together to address demand for
analytics, cloud, security, mobile and social. Our clients are taking the productivity savings we're delivering to them in
the more traditional areas of IT, and reinvesting those savings to move into these new areas. These are the dynamics
you've seen in our revenue.
In the quarter, our strategic imperatives revenue was up 7% at constant currency, which as I said, is pretty much all
organic growth. Over the last 12 months, revenue from our strategic imperatives was up 12% to over $34 billion, and
now represents 43% of IBM. As is typical, I'll focus on constant currency growth rates throughout. A large part of our
strategic imperatives are delivered as a service. Our as-a-service revenue was up over 30% in the second, and we exited
the quarter with an $8.8 billion annual run rate. IBM's Cloud revenue on a trailing 12-month basis is now over $15
billion. That's nearly 20% of IBM's revenue. Let me spend a minute underscoring how we've been able to build Cloud
to a $15 billion business, and why enterprises are increasingly moving to the IBM Cloud. In the second quarter, we
added more leading companies to the IBM Cloud.
For example, Lloyds Bank has chosen the IBM Cloud. Lloyds is one of the most advanced digital banks in the world,
and they expect to become even more agile by leveraging IBM's unique combination of private and public cloud
capabilities. American Airlines is also using the IBM Cloud as the foundation for its broad-based cloud transformation.
Clients are choosing the IBM Cloud for a number of reasons. First, our cloud is hybrid, built for the enterprise, that's
public and private and integrated with on-prem data and workloads. Second, they want to leverage our expertise in
industry and their existing business processes and systems, and we know how to migrate them from one era to the next.
Third, they trust IBM and the IBM Cloud to protect and preserve not only their data but also their insights and AI
training engines to ensure all of the value from their data accrues to them versus going to educate a central knowledge
graph.
And of course, we continue to add state-of-the-art tools and technologies to exploit enterprise data in the cloud. This
includes Watson and Blockchain. You see this last point play out as companies deploy IBM Blockchain and Watson
solutions in the cloud. Recently, we announced an agreement with a consortium of seven of Europe's top banks to
create a new Blockchain service for trade finance for the small and medium business market. And in Australia, we're
working with banks to launch new commercial property leasing services based on Blockchain. And remember, we're
already working with many others, including DTCC, CLS and Northern Trust. Beyond financial services, we're
working with industry leaders like Walmart in food safety and Maersk in shipping. It's still early but we see a lot of
opportunity leveraging Blockchain in the cloud and across multiple industries.

Similarly, in the second quarter, we saw Watson deployments continue to expand globally. The cognitive opportunity is
a global one. It's not centered in New York or Boston or Silicon Valley. So you can't just look and listen in those
places. In healthcare alone, you'd miss that this quarter the first healthcare provider in Latin America is deploying
Watson for Oncology, and BAHEAL Pharmaceutical Group is bringing Watson for genomics to clinicians across
China. In fact, 80% of the hospitals who've adopted Watson for Oncology are outside of the U.S., and that's just
healthcare. We have Watson deployed with other leaders like Bradesco, Honda and Vodafone as well. So across
industries and around the world, our clients realize that data, in fact their own data, is the root of competitive advantage
for all companies.
Remember, 80% of the world's data is owned by enterprises. It's not searchable on the World Wide Web. Its customer
data, and patient data, clinical data, supply chain data, transaction data, and companies want to unlock and exploit that
data. And so that's why enterprises will move to cognitive on the cloud with someone they trust, who has leading tools
and industry expertise, and the data model and business model consistent with their goals. That is the IBM Cloud plus
Watson. I want to also remind you of the importance of the underlying technology stack. We've continued to reinvent
the mainframe and our Power platform to address the most contemporary enterprise workloads.
Our new z14 mainframe is a great example. With a breakthrough in data encryption, IBM Z is capable of encrypting all
data associated with any application, service or database all of the time and with no application change and no
performance impact. Think about what that means for addressing global data breaches, the increase in government
regulations and Blockchain opportunities. It's the biggest reinvention of our mainframe technology since the
reinvention for Linux and open-source software 15 years ago. I'll touch on additional progress and examples of where
we're winning in these areas, and more details on our new mainframe capabilities as I go through the segment
discussions. But first, I'll walk through our financial metrics.
Our revenue for the quarter was $19.3 billion, which is down 3% at constant currency. As expected, we had a larger
currency headwind to revenue growth with about twice the impact of the first quarter. I mentioned earlier that we
ramped on the acquisitions we completed in early 2016. We had 2 points of benefit in the first quarter from
acquisitions, and only about 40 basis points in the second. So excluding the acquisitive content, our year-to-year
revenue performance was a modest improvement over last quarter's rate.
When you look at our revenue performance by geography, in the Americas, revenue in the U.S. was down, while we
had solid growth in Canada and Latin America. Our overall performance in Europe declined, centered in Germany and
the UK. You'll recall last quarter I talked about the impact of the conclusion of services contracts in those countries
which will continue through the year, though we'll get some benefit from the new deals we signed in the second half.
We had sequential improvement in Asia-Pacific, with growth in several markets, including Japan, which is our
second-largest country. I'll come back to the revenue trajectory later in the call.
When you look at our gross profit, our margin was down year to year, but significantly better than the first quarter
year-to-year performance. The year-to-year margin decline reflects both the mix and investments. From first to second
quarter, we got substantial leverage from our high-value model. We added $1 billion gross profit from first to second
with $1.1 billion of additional revenue, while last year we had similar gross profit improvement from first to second,
but we needed more revenue to do it. So that of course resulted in improved trajectory in the year-to-year margin
dynamics. In fact, we had sequential improvement in the year-to-year gross margin performance in each of our five
segments. We'll talk more about the drivers and trends in the segment discussions.
Our expense was down 6% versus last year, with about half of that due to currency, and the balance reflects an
increased focus on driving efficiency in our spend base. As I said, we've been shifting and adding resources as we
invest to build solutions and platforms. In fact, in the first half of this year, we hired 20,000 people into the business. So
our cost-and-expense profile reflects a balance between investing in key areas and driving efficiency across the spend
base. Our operating pre-tax profit was nearly $3.1 billion, which is up about $1 billion from the first quarter.
Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing operating effective tax rate of just under 15%, consistent with last
quarter. We also had discrete tax benefits in the second quarter of about $170 million or $0.18 of operating EPS. We
generated $2.8 billion of operating net income in the quarter and net income margin of 14.5%, which is up 50 basis

points year to year.
On the bottom line, our operating EPS was $2.97. We generated over $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter,
which is up year to year, and over the last 12 months our free cash flow was 94% of our GAAP net income.
So now turning to our segments, Cognitive Solutions had $4.6 billion of revenue, continued growth in annuity content
led by SaaS, and an improved margin profile. Our annuity content, which represents 80% of Cognitive, was up 2% year
to year driven by roughly 4.5% growth in Solutions Software. We had strong SaaS performance with strong
double-digit growth in signings and revenue again this quarter. Revenue was up nearly 30%. As our SaaS business
grows, we continue to invest to build scale. The software transaction revenue was down double digits due to declines in
some of our license-based offerings. And as you know, this was a larger impact in the second quarter given the
seasonality of our transactions. As we've said before, many of our license-based offerings are high-value but in
declining markets. We also wrapped on most of our acquisitions and are focused on investing to combine organic and
acquired content to build cloud-based cognitive offerings.
Let me talk about the progress we are making in parts of the Solutions Software portfolio. In analytics, we saw good
growth in Watson Health and Watson Financial Services and in BI and data discovery, led by Cognos. We announced a
partnership with Hortonworks to combine our data science experience in machine learning with Hortonworks' data
platform to allow developers to access data science and cognitive tools and create intelligent apps. We also had strong
growth in our Watson platform, which underpins our enterprise AI strategy as we build scale. Conversation API usage
and the number of active users are up strong double digits quarter to quarter, as we help clients embed Cognitive into
their workflows.
For example, Crédit Mutuel is live with multiple use cases, including virtual systems for insurance and savings. These
Cognitive applications were rolled out to over 20,000 agents across France, enhancing their quality of service for 12
million customers.
In this quarter, we added new partners like LivePerson, which provides a conversational platform used for the customer
care needs of over 18,000 businesses. Given the growing relevance of AI in digital channels, they announced a new
offering called LiveEngage with Watson to transform the customer care space. LiveEngage can offer intelligent,
personalized digital support to each customer. This is an appealing market. The value Watson provides depends on the
complexity of the conversation, so the number of API calls can vary. But we have the potential to deliver value from
every digital conversation. This will scale as more of today's 270 billion customer support phone calls shift to digital
interactions.
Within our vertical strategy, Watson Health had strong growth, particularly in the areas of state and local government
agencies and oncology as we continue scaling. While market uncertainty persists, government agencies still face the
reality of having to deliver services more efficiently, and our analytics and social program management offerings can
help clients make better informed decisions to reduce healthcare costs and improve outcomes. Both offerings drove
strong growth this quarter.
Oncology is also scaling and is now in over 50 hospitals on five continents. Through the first half, Watson has worked
with nearly 40,000 patients and doctors, and this will grow to approximately 100,000 by year end, and many of these
have life-threatening diseases such as cancer. Watson for Oncology alone has the potential to reach millions around the
world based just on the hospital systems we've engaged to date. So we're just at the beginning of scaling. We continue
to add new cancer types, so our patient reach continues to grow.
We're not just scaling our business into new areas but also improving deployment. For example, we implemented
Watson for Oncology at BAHEAL Pharmaceutical Group in less than a month. This quarter, as I mentioned earlier, we
expanded with BAHEAL into genomics. We also announced a new collaboration with Hackensack Meridian Health, a
prominent U.S. provider, to combine Watson for Oncology with their real-world data to help oncologists improve
cancer treatment and reduce costs.
For another industry example, Watson for Financial Services, which includes the Promontory acquisition, also
contributed to growth this quarter. We launched industry expert trained AI risk and compliance solutions, including

anti-money laundering and Know Your Customer. Beyond verticals, security including security services, which is
reported in Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, grew again this quarter.
,
Offerings like QRadar and Resilient had strong growth as customers look to strengthen their ability to both detect and
respond to security threats. This quarter we announced a partnership with Cisco to address this growing threat of
cybercrime. We will collaborate on threat intelligence research by sharing data, integrating our offerings, and
coordinating on major cyber security incidents.
Turning to profit, Cognitive Solutions gross margin is down year to year though improving sequentially, driven by the
continued investment into strategic areas, including acquisitions and the mix towards SaaS. Cognitive pre-tax income is
up year to year, and this segment has very high PTI margins, which expanded again this quarter, even with a high level
of investment as we continue to embed Cognitive into offerings, build and scale platforms, and drive vertical solutions.
In Global Business Services, we grew signings for the second consecutive quarter and had modest improvement in the
year-to-year revenue performance as compared to first. As we've talked about, we've realigned our practice model to
improve productivity and focus our strategy around three growth platforms. The first platform is where we help our
clients build and execute digital strategies. Next is where we help our clients reengineer their core processes. And the
third platform is where we modernize our clients' applications and move them to the cloud.
This differentiated strategy is beginning to take hold as we accelerated our signings growth in GBS this quarter. Our
cloud, mobile and analytics practices delivered strong revenue growth. Though Consulting revenue was down 1%, our
trajectory improved again this quarter with strong growth in our digital offerings. We continue to decline in traditional
enterprise application work as we shift resources away from these areas to new areas such as SAP HANA, Workday
and Salesforce. We've talked about the path to improvement in GBS which starts with consistent signings growth,
which adds to the backlog, and then ultimately revenue. Our Consulting backlog this quarter was nearly flat year to
year after several quarters of declines. We expect the Consulting trajectory improvement to continue in the second half.
Our mobile practice continues to expand with a portfolio of Cognitive-enabled enterprise iOS apps that can redesign
our clients' workflows. This quarter we announced new initiatives at several different clients including Lufthansa
Group and Singapore Airlines. Application management was down 1% that's been relatively stable over the past several
quarters. Clients continue to look to us to manage the lifecycle of their critical applications. We help them move to new
cloud architectures that improve the speed and agility of their operations, while leveraging the value of their current
systems and data.
Turning to profit, GBS gross profit margin was up over a point sequentially. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we added
more gross profit dollars then we did a year ago, and we were able to do this on less incremental revenue. This was
evidenced with the turnaround that we expect in GBS as we move forward. We continue to shift to higher value work,
while focusing on improving productivity. We yielded savings from workforce actions, and continue to invest to remix
our skills. While we're seeing pricing pressure in the areas that are not as differentiated, we continue to focus on
capturing the value of our new offerings. We've streamlined our practice infrastructure, and are driving efficiencies in
our delivery model through new methods and project management approaches.
In summary, in GBS this quarter, we continued many of the improving trends that started in the first quarter. As we've
said before, that starts with consistent signings growth and we grew signings for the second consecutive quarter. We
continue to shift to our high-value strategic imperatives and we're starting to see the benefits from a redesign practice
model and refocused growth strategy. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities. Put all this together and we expect to
see continued improvement in GBS in the second half. In Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, we delivered $8.4
billion of revenue. While revenue performance decelerated, our margin profile improved compared to last quarter, and
we signed a number of contracts that will contribute to improved performance in the second half.
The deceleration was driven by infrastructure services as we ramped on some acquisitive content and shifted away
from lower value work. While this shift impacted our revenue, it contributed to the improved gross margin trajectory.
We also continue to be impacted by some large contracts that concluded, particularly in Europe which we talked about

last quarter. Our business model in Infrastructure Services is one where we're constantly delivering productivity to our
clients. Our clients trust us with their most critical IT operations as we continue to lead this space.
The way that we expand our footprint is by helping clients move to cloud and drive new workloads by acquiring new
scope and new clients. This quarter we were able to close some substantial new transactions, including a six-year $700
million agreement with Bombardier. We'll move them to the IBM Cloud and help integrate their operations globally.
This will drive productivity, improve their agility and ultimately provide competitive advantage.
I mentioned Lloyds where we signed a 10-year cloud agreement valued at around $1.5 billion. We'll move the bank to
the IBM Cloud and migrate their application suites to this infrastructure. And earlier this quarter we entered into a
definitive agreement with a large telco to acquire its cloud and managed hosting business. This transaction is expected
to close in the second half of 2017. We're working with them on a number of other strategic initiatives, including
networking and cloud services. These transactions will help improve our revenue trajectory in the second half.
Technical Support Services revenue was down 1%, a point better than last quarter's rate. We continue to grow in our
multi-vendor support services where we provide wall-to-wall support for our client's IT operations. Integration
Software revenue was down 1%, which was nearly 2 points better than the first quarter's rate.
Our annuity base remains stable with strong growth in SaaS across our offerings, including WebSphere Application
Server and our hybrid transformation and connect-to-cloud offerings. Transactional revenue within Integration
Software declined as more of this portfolio shifts to the IBM Cloud, which will benefit us over time. Across the
segment we delivered strong growth in cloud, analytics, mobile and security. The as-a-service run rate for the segment
increased to $5.8 billion. Clients are moving to the IBM Cloud because it's built for the enterprise and can optimize
workloads across hybrid environments. The underlying architecture protects our clients' data and insights and is
optimized for cognitive workloads to help our clients create new business models.
The American Airlines example I referenced earlier is a great example where we're building on the partnership we
signed last year. American Airlines announced this quarter they'll move to the IBM Cloud and use it as the foundation
for their digital transformation. They will migrate critical applications, including aa.com, their customer facing mobility
app and their global network of kiosks.
Looking at profit, gross profit margin for the segment was down year to year but up a point sequentially. On a
quarter-to-quarter basis, we added about the same gross profit dollars we did a year ago on less than half the
incremental revenue. So you can see the leverage you can get in this business. We drove efficiencies in services
delivery and yielded savings from workforce actions. We've been investing in our automation capabilities and launched
the IBM services platform with Watson last week. This platform offers next-generation enterprise IT services using
Cognitive technology and will drive operational efficiencies and improve delivery performance for our clients.
We also continue to invest in our IBM Cloud capabilities. We announced the opening of four new cloud centers in the
U.S. extending our capacity with centers in key local markets across 19 different countries. This provides enterprises
with the ability to run their data and applications locally and meet regulatory requirements. Clients can provision cloud
infrastructure when and where they need it. In summary, for Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, Infrastructure
Services revenue decelerated given the ramp on some acquisitive content, and the shift away from lower value work.
Given some of the significant transactions we closed this quarter and strong demand for our cloud services, we expect
our revenue trajectory to improve in the second half. We also expect the improved trends and profit to continue.
In Systems, this quarter we had a significant improvement in our year-to-year revenue trajectory and an improved
margin profile quarter to quarter. This is the second quarter in a row with growth in storage. Our Power declines
moderated and our mainframe business was consistent with what you would expect at the end of a cycle. Mainframe
and Storage margins grew year to year and Power margins improved sequentially. Our overall Systems margin was
down year to year, reflecting mix largely due to product transitions. In z Systems, as I mentioned, our results are
reflective of being in the tenth and final quarter of the z13 product cycle. Revenue declined year to year, gross margin
expanded, and we added four new clients this quarter for a total of 91 since the launch of z13.

We continue to deliver innovation on the platform in support of our clients' evolving workload needs. For example, a
large bank in Europe selected LinuxONE as the strategic platform for their BPM deployments, which will help the
bank achieve significant savings over the next five years. Two large government clients expanded their mainframe
capacity helping them drive down the operating costs for these agencies. In the areas of new workloads, we had wins in
both Blockchain and instant payments. The Blockchain wins were geographically dispersed as we help our clients
around the world tackle business challenges with the emerging Blockchain technology. We closed three instant
payment deals in Europe to help our banking clients comply with the EU payment modernization initiative. I want to
spend a minute on our new z14 mainframe that we announced yesterday.
After three years of development and working with more than 150 clients, this is the world's most powerful transaction
system, capable of running more than 12 billion encrypted transactions per day and provides breakthrough pervasive
encryption. This data encryption engine encrypts all data associated with any application, cloud service or database all
of the time without the possibility of human intervention, and that's with no application change and no performance
impact. We took on this challenge to address both the global data breach epidemic and the need to operate within
government regulations. In fact, of the 9 billion records breached in the past five years, only 4% were encrypted. Even
with the rise of cloud data centers, little real progress has been made encrypting data at any scale because it's hard,
expensive and it impacts performance. That is until now. Our new z14 system encrypts data 18 times faster than x86
platforms, and the x86 platforms are 20 times more expensive.
The reason why 92 of the world's top 100 banks rely on the mainframe is for its high value, secure and scalable
platform. The reason they stay on it is because of its appeal in new workloads and the advances we continue to make in
the underlying technologies to address these, like the new z14 with its unprecedented encryption capabilities, and we
do this with increased performance at lower cost, which is really valuable to our enterprise clients, so we can deliver all
of this within an economic equation that works at the scale required by our clients. The Power growth rate improved
sequentially but was still down. The improvement reflects our transition to a growing Linux market, while continuing
to serve a high value but declining UNIX market. Our Linux on Power revenue grew and we gained share. We again
had double-digit growth in Linux workloads. HANA on Power continues to play an important role in that success.
By contrast in UNIX, declines were driven by our low end and mid-range systems, high-end systems grew. Our Power
portfolio is focused on cognitive and cloud opportunities, and we continue to expand capabilities and partnerships.
During the second quarter, we announced new integrated offerings with Hortonworks designed to help everyone from
data scientists to business leaders better analyze and manage their data and accelerate decision-making. And we
announced integrated offerings with Nutanix to deliver hyperconverged solutions targeting critical workloads and large
enterprises.
We also announced a new version of Power AI, which paired with IBM Linux HPC servers reduces training of deep
learning from weeks to hours. I'll remind you that we'll bring the next generation POWER9 to market in the fourth
quarter starting with two U.S. Department of Energy funded national labs. There are three labs of this type but no
vendor can win more than two. So we've won all we're allowed. These will be the world's most advanced data-centric
super-computing systems, and we'll roll out POWER9 across the Power portfolio throughout 2018.
Storage hardware was up again this quarter increasing 8%, led by strong double-digit growth in our all-flash array
offerings. Flash was the growth catalyst in our storage midrange and high-end offerings. Storage hardware margins
increased both year to year and sequentially.
So to summarize Systems, our year-to-year revenue and gross margin trajectory improved, with consecutive quarters of
revenue growth in storage offset by the expected cycle-driven declines in z Systems and Power. While we face some
shifting market dynamics and product transitions, our portfolio remains optimized for Cognitive and Cloud, and we
continue to expand our footprint and add new capabilities. Our recent z14 launch and the upcoming Power refresh
beginning later in the year will drive further improvement in second half performance.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, in the second quarter we generated $3.3 billion of cash from operations
excluding our financing receivables. We invested about $0.75 billion in capital expenditures, focused in our Watson
and Cloud platform areas, as well as in support of our services and Systems businesses.

And so we generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow, which is up almost $350 million year to year. This reflects
continued strong collections performance for the second consecutive quarter. For the first half, our free cash flow was
$3.6 billion, and over the last 12 months our cash realization rate is 94%, four points higher than last quarter's trailing
12-month rate. The first half free cash flow of $3.6 billion is down $900 million year to year. However, you'll recall in
the first half of last year, we had a $1.2 billion Japan tax refund.
As we look forward to the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to be roughly flat with last year, with the first
half year-to-year headwind switching to a tailwind in the second half from taxes and workforce rebalancing payments.
And of course, this reflects a level of profit consistent with our full-year view of earnings per share.
Looking at uses of cash in the half, our acquisition spend was relatively light after a significant number of acquisitions
in 2015 and early 2016. We're focused on investing and integrating these acquisitions as we expand our solutions and
cloud capabilities.
In the last six months, we've returned $5.5 billion to shareholders, including $2.7 billion in dividends. In April, we
again raised our dividend, and with that we've more than doubled our dividend since 2010. In the first half, we bought
back over 16 million shares, and we ended June with 932 million shares outstanding and $2.4 billion remaining in our
buyback authorization.
Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended June with $12.3 billion in cash and $45.7 billion in total debt. Both of these
are up from year end, primarily driven by the timing of this year's term debt issuances and maturities. $29 billion of our
total debt was in support of our Financing business. The leverage in our Financing business remains at 9:1, and the
portfolio remains strong at 53% investment-grade. We've got more in our Financing business in our supplemental
charts at the back of the presentation. Our balance sheet remains strong, and with our newly-reorganized Financing
entity, we're even better positioned to support our business over the long term.
Let me start to wrap up by putting some additional perspective on our revenue trajectory, and we'll look at it by
segment because our businesses are at different stages of transformation. In Global Business Services, we've said for
some time that the progression is driven by improvement in signings, leading to backlog and then ultimately revenue.
I'd plant the flag to mark the beginning of an improvement in the revenue growth trajectory for GBS back in the fourth
quarter of last year, and we've now had two consecutive quarters of signings growth, substantial improvements in the
Consulting backlog, and a modest 20 basis point improvement in GBS revenue performance from first to second. This
is what improving momentum in the Services business looks like. So now with this momentum and a more focused set
of offerings and improvements in execution, we've seen improved trajectory in GBS in the second half.
In Global Technology Services, with decelerating performance over the last two quarters, we're planting the flag now at
the end of the second quarter. With the ramp in some of our new contracts, we do expect improved performance in the
second half, though we're not counting on a return to revenue growth this year, just an improved revenue trajectory.
And in Systems, storage had been declining, but you'll remember we planted the flag as we got all-flash into the
product line toward the end of last year, and we've now had two consecutive quarters of revenue growth. Power, I'd
similarly plant the flag back at the end of last year; and for System z mainframe, growth is tied more to the 9-to-10
quarter product cycle, which we'll refresh later this quarter.
Finally, in Cognitive Solutions, we've now wrapped on our acquisitions. Our annuity content continues to grow. This is
driven in large part by our SaaS offerings. And as we've talked about in the past, they ramp and build scale over a
longer timeframe. Put it all together and we expect improvement in the constant currency growth rate through the rest
of the year.
Now, when we look at gross margin, I mentioned three drivers of our year-to-year performance in the first half. We've
seen some moderation in the headwinds from mix in investments already from first to second, and I'd expect that to
continue. We're always driving productivity in the business, and much of that gets returned to our clients in the form of
price, or it offsets cyclical impacts, or it goes to the bottom line. In the first half, the net of these factors was an impact
to our margin. But as we move to the second half with new product introduction and improved services dynamics, I'd

expect this to be a benefit to our margin. Put that all together, and just as we expect improvement in our revenue
trajectory, we also expect an improved gross margin profile in the second half as compared to the first.
So in total, those drivers of our first to second half performance improvements are consistent with what we talked about
90 days ago. We'll have a new IBM z product out by the end of the quarter, which will drive an improvement in gross
profit from first to second half. Related to that, we'll also benefit from lower systems development spending. The new
services contracts in Global Technology Services will start to contribute. And with the cost savings we're driving, we'll
have better performance in GTS.
In Global Business Services, we expect the momentum to deliver a better second half. We've essentially wrapped on
last year's larger acquisitions, which are dilutive to profit, and we're now at the stage where we can start to yield more
benefits from operational synergies.
Our ongoing operational tax rate assumption continues to be 15% plus or minus three points, driven by our anticipated
mix. As always, this is without discrete items. But the rate is dependent on the mix of business, because just like every
dollar of revenue doesn't result in the same amount of gross profit, every dollar of gross profit doesn't drive the same
amount of after-tax profit.
So at the bottom line, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share for 2017 and free
cash flow that is consistent with last year.
And with that, we'll take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts
at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, as always, I'd ask you to
refrain from multi-part questions.
So, operator, let's please open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Kate Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your
question.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I appreciate the second half versus first half color,
but curious if you can comment more specifically on the third quarter because of the mainframe launch. Consensus is
modeling both better revenue and better EPS growth sequentially than last year. Are you comfortable with those
bogies? And maybe in regard to that, just talk about how you think this mainframe cycle will compare to past cycles.
Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, Katy, thanks. And thanks for joining the call. I guess, a couple of things. I'll start
actually where you finished on mainframe, because we have in the past said that the economics for the mainframe for
us, what we're looking for is that the overall economic equation cycle-to-cycle kind of holds, and we saw it for the last
four mainframes, including the one that we just finished, and now we expect the overall economic equation to be fairly
stable. That doesn't map to a calendar period, obviously because we announced them at different times, but we would
expect the overall economics of the mainframe to hold cycle-to-cycle-to-cycle now to the fifth cycle. We could have
gone back further, but let's just say that mainframe is roughly consistent with the past. In terms of third and fourth
quarter, I guess, there are couple of things. I think you're interested in revenue, and we'll talk about EPS as well, and
then where does the mainframe fit. On the revenue side of that, typically for seasonal reasons we see about a $1 billion

2Q to 3Q reduction for seasonality.
Now, we're only going to have a month or less of the new mainframe. We're going to have a month of some of these
new contracts, not the full quarter, those will come in the fourth quarter. And so that typical $1 billion impact will be
helped a little bit, $200 million to $300 million, by mainframe or the services contracts, but that's about it for the third
quarter, and then obviously, the rest will be in the fourth quarter. And then from an earnings perspective, given the
power of the mainframe and the profit equation, how it helps mix, plus our typical – typically we have a lot of our
transaction business in the fourth quarter, when you look at our EPS guidance we're up a little bit for the year, we're up
even less than the full year now through the first half. And then third quarter I wouldn't expect to drive much growth at
all. I think most of the growth is going to be in the fourth, again given the cycle dynamics, and quite frankly given the
fact that the benefit really is only a month now, and three months of the fourth quarter. Thanks Katy.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Katy. Can we take the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.
<Q - Wamsi Mohan>: Yes. Thank you. Martin, your Cognitive Solutions' pre-tax margins were up nicely both on a
quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year basis, despite some continued weakness in the transactional business. Can you
address what the main drivers there were for Cognitive margins, and PTI specifically? Was it lower drag from M&A,
better contribution from the SaaS assets, and do you see that sustained, continued sort of year-on-year improvement in
the second half for Cognitive PTI margins? Thanks.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Yeah. Thanks, Wamsi. Well, you've kind of answered your question. So well done. No, it
really is a reflection of a few things. One is that, sequentially we got a benefit from scale. Now, that's annual, that's year
to year as well as sequential, but we're getting a benefit from scale as we build those as-a-service businesses.
And then, just like when we wrap on an acquisition and the revenue benefit, at the same time what we start to do is, we
start to build the consolidation, if you will, and the efficiency in getting those acquisitions on to our own platform. So
we get what I'll call expense savings, if you will, from doing things once as opposed to a number of times around a
unit. So better scale, wrap on acquisitions not only on the growth, but then we get an opportunity to get a bit more
productivity out of them. And yes, I would expect that the margins in Cognitive Solutions, while on a year-to-year basis
because of mix we still see a year-to-year decline, sequentially we'll continue to improve, and those things, the things I
identified, the scale will last forever, and then the wrap on the acquisitions will start to deteriorate in another three, four
quarters.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Wamsi. Can we please take the next question?
Operator
Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
<Q - Steven Milunovich>: Thank you. Martin, you made a number of positive comments about the trajectory of
services. But in the supplemental slides, the signings overall are down 14% year-over-year, and the backlog is now
down 4% year-over-year. What's going on there, and why do you think that's going to improve?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Yes. A couple of things, Steve. First, let's pull signings apart, we'll talk about backlog
because the impact of signings on backlog, as you know and we've talked about it, is different when it's a renewal
versus when it's new business. And signings, they don't play out, as we've said in the past, on a 90-day period.
Obviously, the longer you get, the more it looks like you're back logged. But you've got to get over a pretty long
timeframe in order to have the signings translate directly into backlog.

So in the first half of this year, we had one of the biggest new contract signings we've had for any six-month period. It
was big as it was last year, it was bigger than the year before. So what happens in our backlog as those new contracts
come on, once we go through the transition period, as I mentioned earlier, that for us will start to be September, once
you get through that transition period, all of that translates to revenue rather quickly. That's different from a backlog or
a signing that goes into backlog as an extension of a contract that's 10 years older and is about to expire because that's
just not going to drive any incremental growth.
So yes, on GPS, the backlog is down. The new signings go in though at a rate that will drive revenue in the near-term.
And so what the backlog being down is something that we obviously have to work on a few years out because those
contracts are going to come due, and we have to get them renewed because it's not going to drive any growth, but we
need the backlog. And on GBS, we had second quarter in a row of good signings performance, in fact an acceleration
from the first quarter, and within their backlog now, as we noted in our prepared remarks, the Consulting business now
has gotten itself back to kind of a flat backlog, which in the near-term that tends to yield pretty quickly as we deliver.
So they were battling double-digit declines in backlog for a while. They've worked their way out of that spiral, and so
we'll see a near-term yield on the Consulting side as well.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thank you, Steve. Operator, can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Hi. Thanks for the update. Just on the strategic imperatives up 7%, is high single-digit a good
proxy for organic growth in strategic imperatives for the year, because you highlighted efficiency, I think, Martin. So
we interpret that to mean the focus was skewed more towards maybe margins and revenue acceleration within strategic
imperatives?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: So thanks, Tien-Tsin. A couple of things I think worth noting; yes, we certainly wrapped
on the acquisitions, and so this is a pretty good proxy for the organic piece. And it is mostly as-a-service. So it's not
going to drive the same impact on our big base of business as it would if you wrapped on an on-prem business because
it didn't have the same impact to begin with. Now, by the way, we're not out of the acquisition business, we're still
active acquirers. We just happen to wrap on and are getting our feet under us on everything we did in the past 18
months, but we are still active acquirers. So that will drive some of the growth, but when we think about strategic
imperatives going forward, I would expect that we get a bit of an acceleration from the new mainframe, Power will
drive a bit.
And quite frankly, the services contracts, particularly the new ones we signed and we talked about, they are cloud
contracts. They're to help our clients build and run clouds and move them onto the cloud. So just like we've encouraged
everyone to look at the strategic imperatives on a trailing 12-month basis, which they were at 11% on a trailing
12-month basis, with the acceleration now through the back half of the year, when we get to the end of this year, I'd
expect us to be still on that same trailing 12 months. So the whole calendar year I'd expect us to be in that 10% to 11%
range on strategic imperatives as well.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thank you, Tien-Tsin. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may ask your question.
<Q - Antonio M. Sacconaghi>: Yes. Thank you. Martin, I was wondering if you could just quickly clarify. I think you
said, you didn't expect EPS growth in Q3. Consensus is looking for a $0.09 year-over-year improvement in Q3. Are
you suggesting that's not something that's appropriate? And then more specifically on my question, for strategic
imperatives, it sounds like you feel organic growth is 7%. Are you still confident overall growth will be 10%-plus,

which is something you articulated at your Investment Day? And if you are, is the proper implication to think about
three points of strategic imperative growth coming from acquisitions, which is about $1 billion a year in acquisition
revenue? Is that sort of the framework by which we should think, and are you still confident in that double-digit
sustained growth for strategic imperatives? Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure. Thanks, Toni. So first on the non-question clarifying piece. Look, we got a base
$3-plus on a base. We're roughly flat on it. I think we're at a level now where it's just too fine a number in order to say
am I talking about $0.09 on a $3, almost mid-$3, anyway, so it's a big base, $0.09 too fine for me. On strategic
imperatives, again I do expect us to accelerate in the second half of the year for the reasons we talked about. We got
new mainframe, a lot of the new contracts are coming on. And then the other elements within this, and you can actually
see it in the segment charts, we've got good growth in Technology Services and Cloud Platforms on the strategic
imperative base. That is organic. We have good growth in GBS that is, by and large, organic. We have slower growth
in the Cognitive Solutions, but that's a massive base.
And then obviously where we'll accelerate the most in the second half is the Systems business which was down
dramatically in the quarter, but again, we're at the part of the cycle here where we would expect it to be down. So we
gave the segment view already when we changed, or segment reporting we gave the segment view so you could try to
put together now where we see that shift of business coming from. And as we go into the second half, I think the most
profound shifts are going to be in the Systems business. We'll see continued good growth in the Technology Services
Cloud Platforms unit. We'll see continued good growth in GBS. And then Cognitive, we have made investments. We're
getting growth out of that part of the business. It is as-a-service primarily and therefore its impact on the overall is more
muted, but if we were to acquire something it would likely go back in there. But again, it's more muted because it's the
as-a-service business.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Toni. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Your line is open.
<Q - David Grossman>: Thank you. And perhaps, Martin, you addressed some of this in the last question. But I was
hoping you could help us better understand the growth dynamics in the Cognitive and GBS segments. It looks like the
strategic imperatives are well over 50% of the revenue mix in both those units, but they both are experiencing revenue
declines. So if I've got that math right, can you help us better understand that dynamic and what that implies for the
overall mix as strategic imperatives increase to a greater percent of IBM's overall revenue mix?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Yes. Sure, David. So we'll do them piece-by-piece, and I'll give you two words to describe
both of them. One is magnitude, and I put that against Cognitive. It's a big, big business, and obviously the as-a-service
that we're building has a smaller impact. And so we see growth and we're getting growth in the as-a-service portfolio,
but it's going to take time to build that. And part of that portfolio, TPS, our Transaction Processing business, as we have
on the slide, is down 4%. So that's a very high value business, but it's a big on-prem business that's going to take a
while to out-build, if you will, from an as-a-service perspective.
And then on GBS, the word I'd give you is the transition. So I described a bit on our Consulting business where we got
the backlog back to flat, and the Consulting business has accelerated. The signings in Consulting are good. The growth
is quite strong. The things that we're engaging with our clients are on digital offerings. Those are resonating. So the
Consulting business comes back pretty well.
Then the Application Management business, it's a fairly stable business, and yes, we're helping our clients move those
into clouds. We're helping them contemporize, if you will, the way those applications work, but that's not a big growth
engine. It really is a very stable base. And then in GPS, in our Global Processing Systems business, that's not high
content of strategic imperatives, but it is important work for our clients and it's quite valuable to us. So in GBS, as we
make this transition, the overall will be lifted. And as we've said, we planted the flag on revenue growth back in the

fourth quarter. Now, we've seen a moderately improving trajectory now. And we would expect, as I said on the
prepared remarks, that third and fourth quarters be better again in terms of trajectory on revenue.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, David. We'll take the next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Perfect, thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess I'm just trying to understand the gross
margin discussion, Martin. I realize 180 basis points decline in June is much better than the 300 basis points decline
you had in the March quarter. But I'm curious, at what point do you see gross margins from a year-over-year
perspective starting to stabilize? And does stability in gross margin have to come in line with strategic revenues
essentially decelerating a little bit?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: As we said in the prepared remarks that we do see continued improvement in the
trajectory, so down 3% in the first, down 1.8% in the second, and then second half, driven by both mix and driven by
the work we have underway in delivering productivity across our services platform, the work we have in improving our
GBS margins, which is now starting to come to show up in the ledger. So we see both a mix of structural benefits from
productivity. We see a mix of execution benefit from realizing, if you will, the higher value of the solutions we're
selling. And we see a mix from just the fact that we're in high-value systems business, which is going to mix more
strongly. So yes, we do see continued gross margin improvement on a sequential basis and improvement on a
year-to-year basis sequentially, and that would position us pretty well, I think, then for 2018. But we've got work to do
here in the second half to put that on the table, but we do see it in the third and the fourth.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Amit. Let's go to the next question, please.
Operator
Our next question is from Brian White with Drexel Hamilton. You may ask your question.
<Q - Brian J. White>: Martin, on the z14, it sounds like it will have an impact, a positive impact in second half of the
year. Do you think it will have a more favorable impact in 2018? And if you could, give us just some guideposts around
the attach rate of the z14 or any mainframe cycle to both sales and profits of IBM. Obviously, it's a small direct percent
of IBM's total sales and profits. But if you look at the overall portfolio and the software and services that it drags
through, that would be great. Thanks.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: So first, I think what you started by saying was z14, not much impact in second half, and I
think what we're saying is that it's going to have quite an impact in the second half. It was announced yesterday. It will
become publicly available in September. And so we'll get a month in the quarter, but we'll get three months of it in the
fourth quarter. So just to make sure we're clear, we do see a pretty good impact here in the second half from z.
Now, the timing, that impact will be most profound in the Systems space because the hardware is what obviously goes
out first. We also provide, as you know, we provide maintenance for that, but the warranty period on, so that's not
going to be felt until after the warranty period expires. That's in 12 months plus. There is software that goes with it, but
that tends to be driven by usage, not by placement of hardware. And so that also isn't going to be in the second half. We
finance these, that happens over time, and so we get that money back over time.
And then, we sell storage. There's a little bit of tailwind in the hardware side, but again, a lot of it is software-defined
storage. So the benefit in the second half is Systems-driven. The rest of the platform, if you will, will continue to drive
profit over time, and a lot of that will be dependent on the workloads that it can attract and the workloads it's running
now and how people scale, which we feel quite good about.

One of the things we haven't spent a lot of time on, on the mainframe, because the interest has been around security, the
interest has been around in-line machine learning. But one of the elements of the new mainframe is new software
model, which will allow our clients to partition off parts of the mainframe and run new workloads and test new
workloads in a much more economic way, so they will attract new workloads onto the platform again. So over time,
again, we're not relying on the mainframe as a platform to be any more valuable than it has in the past, but I'll tell you
what, this mainframe solves a lot of problems that clients who don't use it today have, and it provides a lot of new
on-ramps for other workloads.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Brian. Can we please take the next question?

Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi. You may ask your question.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thanks very much. It's Jim Suva from Citi. Martin, you'd mentioned planting the flag post several
times in different parts of the businesses, which is greatly appreciated. The question I have for you is, is there any
correlation to cash flow and cash flow generation regarding those flag post? Like, for example, if signings result in
positive services growth. Is there any impact of secure cash flow as they start, and how should we think about the cash
flows of your flag post comment? Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure. Jim, I think I heard it, but you must be on mobile, was little bit hard to hear it, but I
think the question was, is there a correlation between planting the flag on some of the revenue trajectories and cash
flow. So broadly speaking, the answer is, obviously, yes, but is that kind of at the margin, if you will. So as we turn our
GTS business, and we start to bring on all these new clients that we have and put them on the IBM Cloud, of course,
we expand the capacity of the cloud, but that's already in our plans.
So at the relationship level, everything that has to do with driving revenue is going to have an impact with cash. But the
way we have planned and talked about our cash flow all year of being flat year to year, we've recognized already that
we're driving capacity into the cloud, that we have to build the capacity and the scale we need. And so it doesn't have
an impact into the way we've guided it, but obviously, there is a correlation between what kind of growth we get and
the cash demands, if you will, of the business, but not different from what we've talked about all year.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Jim. Let's take one more question, please.

Our last question is from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi, thanks. If you look historically at sort of the makeup of the different quarters for the full
year, over the last six years, you generated roughly about 23.5% of your earnings for the full year in the third quarter.
Based on your comments about the mainframe and the fourth quarter, is that still the right way to think about third
quarter, and then you get the bulk of the benefit from the mainframe really driving the fourth quarter earnings profit?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Again, I think we talked a bit about the EPS skew, and we talked I think where we're
going to land for the third quarter, but as I said in the fourth quarter is where we see most of the growth begin because
the mainframe in the fourth quarter is where the bulk of it's going to sit. So I'll let you do the SKU math in terms of
percentage in the third quarter, but the answer is yes, we're going to see the bulk of the growth from the full quarter
mainframe in the fourth quarter, as well as the services signings that will have a full quarter impact. And then
obviously, as we go through time and we talked a bit about this on the prepared remarks, and you've seen some of our
announcements about, for instance, the Cognitive delivery platform that we're building. Those build as you go through
time as well, and so all of that will have more of an impact in the fourth quarter.

So just to wrap up again quickly, we finished the first half spot on where we said we would. We've positioned ourselves
now to have the second half that we're confident will deliver. The path from here though, as we've said, is pretty at a
high level. It's an improved revenue trajectory, it's an improved GP margin trajectory, and it's an improved expense
trajectory. And we have now, I think in the second quarter, shown that the GP margin trajectory is there. We've
obviously got the ability, and we showed good expense management and disciplined investments. And then on the
revenue, we've kind of gone through it piece-by-piece to talk about where we planted the flag, and the most recent,
again, second quarter, we'll plant the flag on GTS, so we'll drive an improved revenue trajectory. So thank you for
joining the call. We look forward to talking to you in 90 days.
