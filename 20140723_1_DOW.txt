certain items. The agenda for today's call is on slide 3.
I will now hand the call over to Andrew.
Andrew N. Liveris
Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you noted from our release this
morning, Dow delivered another quarter of earnings growth achieving impressive results on both the top and bottom
line. Our foundation is solid. We're delivering consistent earnings growth, driving strong cash flow from operations,
improving return on capital and aggressively pursuing portfolio rationalization all the while increasingly rewarding our
shareholders.
Specifically on slide 3, you will see that earnings per share grew 16% year-over-year. In fact, this represents our
seventh consecutive quarter of EPS, EBITDA, and EBITDA margin growth. On the top-line, we delivered sales
increases across all operating segments. And this included the first half sales and EBITDA record in Dow Agricultural
Sciences. When coupled with the company's ongoing productivity improvements, these sales gains drove EBITDA
margin expansion of 40 basis points, reaching 15%.
In particular, we delivered a significant improvement in Performance Materials. EBITDA was up 36%, a strong
example of our productivity actions taking hold. We also achieved EBITDA increases in other key segments, such as
Electronic and Functional Materials and Performance Plastics. Importantly, we achieved the results even in the midst of
a continued slow growth environment and with some meaningful headwinds from purchased feedstocks and energy
costs as well as planned and unplanned outages.
Our results this quarter represent steady and continuous improvement in return on capital and illustrate progress against
our strategic priorities, which are clearly focused on rewarding shareholders. We're delivering our results as promised.
This is our commitment and our top priority. We'll update you on all these priorities later in the presentation.
For now, let me turn it over to Bill Weideman, who will discuss this quarter's financials. Bill?
William H. Weideman
Thank you, Andrew. Let me begin on slide 5 with the highlights for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings per share
were $0.74 per share. This compares with $0.64 per share in the same quarter last year. Earnings grew 16% as a result
of increased sales and lower costs. Sales rose 3% to $14.9 billion. Increases reported in all operating segments led by
Performance Plastics as well as sales gains in Electronic and Functional Materials and Ag. EBITDA was $2.2 billion.
EBITDA gains were led by Performance Materials with notable increases also reported in Electronic and Functional
Materials and Performance Plastics, reflecting our business-by-business approach to driving both growth and
productivity.
I will now turn to slide 6. We can see the drivers of our performance this quarter, where we increase margins and drove
sales growth in all operating segments. The company also benefited from ongoing productivity measures, which
enabled higher asset utilization and additional cost reductions. These efforts overcame the headwinds Andrew
mentioned earlier in the call including more than $100 million from the outages in Plaquemine. And further, we remain
on track with our commitment associated with our restructuring actions.
Before turning the call back to Andrew, I will close with some insights regarding what we expect to see in the third
quarter. Overall, we are not planning on any meaningful macroeconomic improvement in the back half of the year. We
expect Ag sales to decline sequentially in line with typical seasonal patterns. And we expect ongoing market demand
and positive pricing dynamics to drive continued strong results in Performance Plastics. Planned turnaround spending
will decline about $50 million versus the second quarter levels. However, these costs will increase about $75 million to
$100 million versus the third quarter of last year with the planned turnarounds. The majority of this increased spend is
expected to impact feedstock and energy, performance plastics, and performance materials.

Capital expenditures for the year are estimated to be between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion, reflecting a deliberate effort
to accelerate the startup of our key growth projects.
And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andrew.
Andrew N. Liveris
Yeah, thank you, Bill. And in summary, the second quarter is another solid proof point of Dow's progress and the
outcome of focused actions we continue to take on the top and bottom line to drive earnings increases across our
portfolio. We're delivering on our strategic priorities, which are shown on slide 8. These priorities are bridging our
near-term execution in 2014 with our near-term strategy of generating sustainable returns once our key projects start up
in 2015.
I will now describe how we are tracking on priorities one, two, and three by segment. Then I will update you on
priorities four through six. Returning to slide 9, by driving productivity actions across the businesses, targeting certain
businesses for growth, being strict stewards of capital, and driving EVA and ROC, we are growing margins in all of our
segments. For example, in Electronic and Functional Materials and Performance Plastics, businesses that we've
committed to grow, we are growing and our EBITDA margins are expanding as we continue to further penetrate
attractive markets such as the one shown on the slide.
In Performance Materials, a segment that we have committed to improve, our consistent actions over the last many
quarters continue to gain traction, resulting in significant EBITDA increases this quarter. We are taking aggressive cost
actions and implementing a broad productivity focus to enhance results, particularly in polyurethanes and epoxy. We
are seeing the benefit of these collective actions, which we put in place 12 months ago, now and with more upside to
come. Our polyurethanes and epoxy teams are hard at work delivering new EBITDA despite business-specific and
industry challenges. And when coupled with the upcoming startup of our PDH investment and our Sadara joint venture,
we are well-positioned to further restore and enhance our earnings profile across Performance Materials.
In other words, we said we would improve and we are. We said we would grow, and we are. We are doing all the
things we said and more. And through this combination of operational, financial, and strategic priorities, we are
overcoming known headwinds to deliver stronger year-over-year results.
Let me give you some deeper insights into what we're seeing in our key segments and markets. Turning to slide 10,
beginning with Dow Electronic Materials. Strong customer relationships and differentiated technology platforms are
driving growth for this business. We delivered increased sales in Asia-Pacific in the second quarter and drove gains in
Interconnect Technologies and higher demand for printed circuit boards in smartphones and automobiles.
Looking forward, we expect mid to high-single digit revenue growth from semiconductors and foundry demand
coupled with higher MSI growth, giving us ongoing optimism for this business through the end of 2014 into 2015. In
Functional Materials, our businesses are benefiting from above-market growth in key attractive market sectors such as
energy and pharmaceuticals. For example, in the second quarter, Dow Microbial Control delivered double-digit sales
gains growth in North America on increased sales of customized solutions aligned with the energy sector. On top of
this growth, our outlook on Functional Materials continues to be positive as food, pharmaceutical and personal care
market sectors also trend upwards, further supporting increased demand for Dow technologies.
On slide 11, in Dow Coating Materials, top-line gains coupled with cost and productivity actions remain our focus. In
the second quarter, the business delivered above market sales increases in both Architectural and Industrial Coatings in
nearly all regions. When coupled with ongoing enhancements to productivity, we expect this business to grow margins
year-over-year. However, this will be partially tempered by costs related to short-term supply constraints in monomers.
In Dow Water and Process Solutions, technology-driven growth continues on increasing demand. For example, we are
bringing in-home water purification to consumers in water scarce regions through the Dow FILMTEC RO system. In
addition, Dow's TEQUATIC PLUS fine particle filter is a groundbreaking solution for treating difficult high solids

water and helping reduce industry costs and waste. Overall, our demand remains strong for the sector, with Dow
positioned as the leading technology provider.
In Dow Building and Construction, market growth remains somewhat tepid, although we are seeing encouraging signs
as year-to-date growth is indeed outpacing the market. With conditions varying by region, we maintain a tight focus on
productivity gains, particularly in Europe where we have seen dramatic improvements in our profitability. Further, our
material science expertise is enabling access to new applications in insulation, roofing and tile.
Shifting to Agricultural Sciences on slide 12 and our market outlook for this important source of momentum for our
company, we continue to deliver strong top-line performance, illustrated by record sales in both the quarter as well as
year-to-date. Our market outlook for this segment remains positive with overall industry growth expected in the
mid-single-digit range. This business, as highlighted in this quarter's results, continues to outperform its competitors
based on its strong linkages with Dow's manufacturing and R&D engines.
Sales of new crop protection products increased 18% in the first half, demonstrating that our technology leadership and
manufacturing expertise in this sector continues to serve as a solid foundation for ongoing growth. Dow is also
capturing the benefit of strong fundamentals in the global seeds industry, growth that is projected at 4% to 6% in the
near-term. Notably, within the quarter, Dow's seeds business drove growth in both corn and soybeans in North America
and Latin America. With Dow as the owner, we have doubled the value of this business over the past five years to
seven years and have clear plans in place to do it again over the same timeframe, leveraging the strengths of Dow's
chemical and material science expertise in manufacturing and R&D to create new molecules and novel traits that will
drive growth across this franchise and to produce them at a low cost to serve.
Shifting to Performance Materials on slide 13 where cost reductions and productivity have been our operating mantra
for well over a year. Sales were up year-over-year, and fundamentals continue to improve for market sectors aligned to
our polyurethanes value chain, notably in consumer comfort and industrial. Improving adoption of new energy
regulations is also driving increased energy efficiency demand. Our cost reduction efforts have yielded results as well,
with significant margin expansion year-over-year in the polyurethanes value chain.
Looking at the Specialty Chemicals portion of this portfolio, Dow Oil and Gas and Mining grew sales double digits on
continued strength from increased project fills in Europe, Middle East and Africa and increased exploration and
production demand in North America. We're also seeing demand growth in Amines, particularly in the consumer,
industrial, and construction markets. We expect these trends to continue in the second half. Fundamentals in the
automotive sector also remain solid as demand in North America, China and Europe continues to be positive.
Sales in Dow Automotive reflect upward trends in this sector, evidenced by above-market growth in the business on
customer adoption of differentiated technologies such as BETAMATE structural adhesives, which are enabling lighter
weight vehicles to improve fuel efficiency. We expect the automotive sector to remain a source of positive growth for
this business and for the Performance Materials segment overall.
Turning to Performance Plastics on slide 14 where we continue to deliver growth in attractive end markets such as
packaging, hygiene, and medical. For example, in Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics, application development
remains strong. As the market drives towards comfort and convenience, Dow is innovating around flexibility and
durability. We grew sales in the target markets I just mentioned and are pointing our resources directly at these
attractive sectors with industry-leading R&D that is differentiated and unique to Dow versus our pure commodity
competitors. And our new capital investments on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Sadara position us well to continue
long-term growth in this high-margin business.
On slide 15, you can see that we are driving near-term margin expansion and growth as we continue to drive
segment-specific actions. As you know, we have defined near-term margin expansion targets by segment and we have
outlined the impact of each strategic value driver to you before as shown on this slide. And we are investing in our
high-growth, high-margin businesses. This quarter demonstrated that we can selectively grow on the top-line while also
maintaining an intense focus on productivity on the bottom line and this balanced approach to value creation is yielding
increasing, sustainable returns across our enterprise.

Very few companies can do both productivity and growth well. Dow has the unique capability to succeed in both
arenas, maximizing return on capital. I'm going to now turn to our near-term priorities, which you can see on slide 17,
and review aspects of priorities one and two as well as four through six.
On slide 18, you can see on the priority we call priority one, successful startup of Sadara and U.S. Gulf Coast
investments, a few comments first on Sadara. We said we would leverage our technology and scale to enable cost
advantage growth aligned to attractive markets and regions, and we are delivering via this once-in-a-generation project.
Let me be clear. The unique nature of Dow's technology prowess and expertise coupled with Saudi Aramco's
tremendous capabilities have enabled us to create the world's largest chemical complex ever built in a single phase.
Only through this unique partnership will this be one of the very few projects in the region completed on time and on
budget. The first units are slated for operations in mid-2015 with full startup in 2016. We have more than 55,000
contractors on site and 800 Dow project experts with engineering finalized and construction more than 65% complete.
On the U.S. Gulf Coast, we said that we would capitalize on positive shale gas and NGL fundamentals to connect
low-cost feedstocks to downstream technology-based growth, and we are delivering. Our investments in the region are
progressing well, evidenced clearly by the June groundbreaking on our world-scale ethylene production facility in
Freeport, Texas, which will start up in mid-2017. Our PDH investment is on track for startup in mid-2015 with 1,600
workers on site, 90% of the equipment on location, and more than 30% of construction already complete. In Louisiana,
the timing of our ethane flexibility project remains as planned with a 2015 startup.
Cost inflation on the U.S. Gulf Coast is real. However, we planned for inflationary pressures and it has not caught us by
surprise. These products remain on budget, and through our scale and first-mover advantage, we are mitigating these
pressures. Looking across the program, we continue to carefully monitor the economics of these projects. We are
leveraging equipment design and sourcing across our global supply chain to remain ahead of the cost curve. Further, we
are capitalizing on our early-mover advantage to secure and retain a skilled labor workforce, keeping cost as tight as
possible. These growth catalysts are a key priority for our company as are our creative innovation investments, which
are part of priority two on slide 19. In fact, innovation is essential in markets where there's reward to stay ahead of
product commoditization lifecycles. On our sales from patent advantage products in 2013, we delivered an average of
13% higher margins versus sales from non-patent advantage products. This depth and breadth of our innovation
pipeline was highlighted in July as five Dow technologies were recognized by R&D Magazine. These technologies
span the sectors of our key markets: water, food, energy, automotive with solutions that are solving global challenges
and driving sustainable and profitable growth for Dow.
Let me also dwell on one of our key product launches for 2015, Enlist. Through the combination of novel traits and
Dow's proprietary herbicide technology, our Enlist weed control system is a fundamental example of how our
innovations and expertise in chemistry and biology are enabling differentiated solutions that farmers need now. Our
current feedback confirms that this innovation remains on track for our 2015 launch. The upside from these
innovations, together with the growth expected from our strategic investments and priority number one are collectively
positioning Dow well over the near and long-term for earnings growth and increased cash flow.
So now turning to another of our key priorities, our announced divestiture program, where we continue to make
significant headway, which is, of course, included in priority number four. As you can see on slide 20, we have
identified a target of $4.5 billion to $6 billion in proceeds from shedding non-strategic assets and businesses. We
maintain our commitment to achieving this target by year end 2015. One key transaction, of course, is our chlorine
carve-out. Market response to our announcement has been positive with strong early interest, and we have a dedicated
team of more than 100 professionals working diligently on every aspect of the seminal project.
We are currently fine-tuning the scope to maximize and preserve integration benefits and ensure we mitigate stranded
costs, which is very complex work and involves hundreds of product and utility streams. And as we look ahead, we're
making critical operating model shifts for Dow as well as for any prospective partner or buyer to ensure we maximize
the full benefit of this completed transaction. We will not trade future earnings for one-time transaction value, and
thereby render downstream businesses uncompetitive.

On slide 21, utilizing our best earner lens, we have also examined potential alternative uses for the capital currently
allocated to our assets, such as rail cars, real estate, terminals, and other infrastructure. And through this process, we
identified nearly $1 billion in expected proceeds from assets we believe are better suited for more strategic owners or in
different financial structures, and we believe we can complete more than half of these by year end. This includes our
rail car fleet where we expect to release more than $500 million in value over the next six months.
We are also reviewing every aspect of our joint venture portfolio, identifying opportunities to release even further value
and returning this value to our shareholders, especially from our large joint ventures. In sum, our full divestiture
program is accelerating on track and moving forward as outlined on this slide, with 12 corporate teams fully engaged in
driving this process forward directly accountable to our executive committee.
On slide 22, collectively, our projects in priority one together with our cost savings and productivity ramp-up and the
upcoming launch of accretive innovations such as Enlist are positioning Dow to achieve EBITDA north of $10 billion
in the near term. Items such as lower pension expense, greater operating leverage, and further productivity efforts will
serve as upside on top of the growth from these catalysts and our business-specific actions embedded in our strategic
priorities.
Our sixth priority is actually our number one priority, which can be summarized on slide 24. Our unrelenting focus
remains on generating returns that exceed the cost of capital, generating cash and rewarding our shareholders. Our
performance this quarter underscores the intensity with which we are executing through our focus on both growth and
productivity and using EVA momentum to drive improvements on return on capital, illustrated by our 150-basis-point
increase in ROC year-over-year.
We have described a number of near-term growth catalysts in our portfolio, including an industry-leading Performance
Plastics franchise with best-in-industry R&D and a low-cost position which is being further enhanced in 2015 with our
Sadara and U.S. Gulf Coast investments. A strong set of integrated franchise businesses, such as Dow AgroSciences,
Electronic Materials, Functional Materials and Coatings that will yield results from key investments and a recovering
set of value driving businesses such as polyurethanes all contributing to the bottom line, plus the investments made in
the 2010-2014 timeframe will begin benefiting these investments in 2015 and beyond.
All of these catalysts plus our focused productivity actions will generate strong cash flows in 2015 and beyond. Simply
put, the early stage of this cash flow have been put to use to accelerate our cash flow story in the back half of this
decade. In the meantime, we have aggressively returned cash to you, our shareholders, with $3 billion in the first half of
2014 alone through declared dividends and share repurchases and another $2.1 billion in share buyback due yet this
year.
In summary, our six strategic priorities are in full execution mode with near-term cash generation fully committed to
these organic investments and to shareholder remuneration. We are constantly reviewing our cash flow to increasingly
focus on rewarding our shareholders. That is our commitment.
With that, Doug, let's turn to Q&A.
Douglas May

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes. Thank you and good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Weideman>: Good morning, P.J.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: In Coating and Infrastructure, your results were kind of flattish while your customers are
reporting some really good numbers. So it seems that they are getting a disproportionate amount of value while the
suppliers are not getting that. So what can you do about that and what kind of discussions are you having with them?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, P.J., actually, Dow Coating Materials now had several consecutive quarters of good
revenue growth, in fact, this particular quarter, plus 5%. If you look at some of our downstreams, they had revenue
growth of 5%, 7%, and one had actually a bang-up quarter at double-digit. They have a different operating model. I
think there was a newspaper article about that yesterday in The Wall Street Journal. Each of their operating models
vary. Some are heavy industrial, some are heavy architectural, some are in stores, some are not in stores with OEMs.
Some at the discount stores, some are not.
What we've got is a group of customers that are actually in all of those, and what we're doing with them is two things to
get our share of the value. One is innovation, clearly, and our launch of FORMASHIELD is a good example of that.
FORMASHIELD, as you may know, is to take formaldehyde out of the air to improve indoor air quality. That gives us
premium pricing at customers' accounts who want to pay for that based on their brand promise. A very notable paint
company on the West Coast has a premium brand just purely based on brand promise of quality, including indoor air
quality.
But it's not just innovation. It also has to be low cost-to-serve, and there we are really, if you like, working hard on the
input costs. Now, we've had some issues on monomers in terms of outages, and that hurt the results a little bit in this
past quarter for coatings and monomers. I'd indicated that in my script, but we are fixing those. Deer Park has been
quite a challenge these last many years to operate with consistency, but it's getting there. And of course, SAMCo, our
JV in Saudi Arabia, is really helping our position in the Far East and the Middle East.
Europe has been a drag, but it's now starting to improve. All of that to tell you between innovation and low
cost-to-serve, we believe we can get our piece of the value pie, but we'll never be a paint company. And of course, just
like every downstream from us, whether it's a consumer goods company like a Procter & Gamble, they have their value
proposition, we have ours. We need to improve our ROC and we're doing that in our part of the envelope.
<A - William H. Weideman>: And, P.J., this is Bill. Just to add one thing on the bottom line as Andrew alluded to,
this is a big turnaround quarter also for chemicals – for Coatings and Infrastructure, and our turnaround expense there
year-over-year was up about $20 million due to planned turnarounds. So that affected the bottom line.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you. And, Andrew, quickly on Ag, you said in the...
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: ... past that [indiscernible] (30:42) value, you will think about expand or a combination. Any
further thoughts on that?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, look, we've indicated multiple times. Well, firstly, let me start from the top of the
headline. There are no sacred cows here. We're not keeping a business for the sake of keeping it. There's none of that.
We are growing this business, as I indicated with the quarterly report here. This quarter, this half has been incredible
launches of new products. We outperformed the market for a reason. We are developing new products at a pace which
is outpacing our competitors, especially in crop protection, but notably even in seeds and traits.
And so crop protection is outpacing growth here with that 18% increase that I indicated. And as we increase value, this
becomes a more valuable property. What we're doing is shedding from the other end of the Dow enterprise, the low
ROC businesses, the businesses we can't grow. And if we ever did do a deal that releases one-time value, we need to

ensure that we can replace it with higher value inside the enterprise. In other words, we'll upgrade value for value, not
for a one-time transaction. But we are open to any sorts of conversations, and I can tell you that this industry probably
has one more round of it in the future, and we are open book, open discussion to anyone who has a good idea.

Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Weideman>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Your stock is bouncing around the conversion level for the preferred shares, and it was hard to
tell if it was much net share reduction sequentially when I look at the share count that's out there. Maybe you could
give us a comment on your plans on how you plan to deal with the conversion of that and neutralizing those shares with
buyback?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Yes, John, this is Bill. So from an overall – to give you a little bit of numbers here on
the share repurchase program. So as you know, we really, really ramped that up, if you will, the first of the year. So if
you see a comparison versus the same quarter a year ago, our shares are up. But if you look at versus this year and you
look at prior quarter, our actual share count is down. So in the quarter, second quarter, we purchased about 17 million
shares, as you know, at a total cost of about $850 million. And the total program, we've bought back about 51 million
shares now for $2.4 billion.
Our share count actually, third average share count for the EPS calculation, as you know, went down 10 million shares
this quarter. And you should expect that to continue to occur going forward. And the reason it's not the full impact is
that share is an average number at the beginning of a period and that is the weighted average, so that's the reason.
You'll continue to see that going down. Yes, you are true that our share price is getting close to the conversion price.
And as you know, that is the most value creating option there for us for our shareholders. So our desire there,
obviously, is for our share price to continue to appreciate and then convert those into common.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: And then on the chlorine carve-out, your text says by year-end 2015 close the deal. Is the plan
still to have a definitive deal announced by the end of 2014?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. John, we would aim to do that. Again, we're not going to run to the wrong answer
here because of the stranded cost issues that I mentioned in my remarks. This is a complex carve-out. I can't emphasize
that enough. I made enough comments in the script to let you know how complex it is. But, yes, that would be the
intent. There's nothing that tells us right now we can't do that.

Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Thank you. Good morning. Andrew, I guess you're on the cusp here of the next Ag
season selling your Enlist product. I was wondering if you could talk about the challenges farmers have today with
herbicide resistance, and then what sort of costs are you able to save them from using a seed-contained product as
opposed to a secondary herbicide treatment.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. I mean this is a very granular question, Bob. So I'll try and give a couple of quick
punch-lines here and, of course, follow up with you and anyone else that wants to know more detail. Clearly, the

efficacy of Enlist Duo, which is the combo, which is of course has 2,4-D resistance as well as glyphosate resistance,
has embedded in it quite a lot of user-friendliness to the farmer, including the reduction of costs. We have not shared
farmer economics with anyone right now, but clearly 2,4-D is so widely used, so ubiquitous, they see it as a solution
that they want. But of course, doing this with choline chemistry takes out the VOC issue and the drift issue and any of
the issues with 2,4-D, which is why this is such a great introduction. It really is a better, friendlier version of 2,4-D
chemistry with, of course, the tolerance and the resistance that you would get from glyphosate as well. Glyphosate
resistance is a big issue for farmers and they're working very hard on finding a reformulation. They are screaming for
this one because of their knowledge of 2,4-D chemistry.
Clearly, the other part of this is that it's a combo. The fact that we can apply to soybeans as well as corn is a massive,
massive positive for them and clearly, they've used 2,4-D for these purposes for over 60 years in more than 70
countries worldwide with thousands of pages of scientific studies, hundreds and hundreds of agencies and regulators
giving it its approval. So it really is an in-place substitution for them. So frankly, the farmer economics both on refuge
in a bag as well as efficacy of row crops is very compelling. I won't speak specifically to pricing.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: And you mentioned monetizing some corporate and maybe some JV interest. I think
you even implied especially your larger JVs. I was wondering if you could give us an update or assessment on how
Dow Corning and maybe how the petrochemical JVs you have are performing and what the outlook there is.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yes. Look, I would say Kuwait JVs, in general, have been good, steady earners for Dow.
They've got a low cost position and whether it's in Kuwait or Canada, and as a consequence of that, they've been
contributing to our equity earnings quite handily here these last – well, actually, over a decade but certainly these last
five years. And Dow Corning has gone through its major bump with polysilicon that obviously was a massive
recalibration of their earnings capability. They're doing the best in the polysilicon world because they are the low-cost
producer. They don't have the margins they used to have. So Hemlock is not doing as well as it did a few years ago.
Now, though, if you look at both of those sets of JVs and you look at my statement, the product mix in the Kuwait JVs
is a commodity product mix in the main. Dow Corning is a downstream value-add company that needs low cost to
serve. What we need to do is get very transparent on how you see those results so they don't get lost in our reporting,
and that's what we're working on trying to figure out ways to do that and of course be value creating and accretive. And
so our focus is on both of those and, Bill, I don't know if you want add anything.
<A - William H. Weideman>: Yeah, overall, just to add – overall our equity earnings, as you know, were flat
year-over-year; but as Andrew alluded to, the greater Kuwait JVs earnings are up year-over-year, Dow Corning
earnings are up year-over-year and then those are offset in terms of increased cost in Sadara as we ramp for production
here next year. So overall, our base joint ventures continue to drive earning increases, including Dow Corning.

<Q - Peter E. Butler>: Have there been any significant developments in your Dow AgroSciences research pipeline

<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Absolutely, Peter. One of the things I implied in the answer to P.J.'s question is we have
Enlist, but we have a strong pipeline of other products being launched as we speak. And I would tell you that our
launches in the crop protection side have been as impressive as anything on the trait side.

Having said that, we just had a novel USDA deregulation of a novel insect-resistant trait and this is going to provide
soybean farmers with a broad spectrum for insect control against something called lepidopteran. I want you to
understand that, that's a pest, okay, so a bad thing. So this is now being part of our comprehensive soybean strategy and
this is really the key thing I want to say that apart from our crop protection, new herbicides and new insecticides, our
focus on soybeans and between Enlist and this new novel insecticide technology – trait technology I just mentioned,
these are massive new products and will enable us to double the value of Dow AgroSciences these next few years. And
these are broad spectra weed control as well as pest control, lower drift, lower volatility with Enlist, and user friendly to
the farmer. We've never been as excited about our pipeline in Dow AgroScience. This has been actually an eight-year
effort that is bearing fruit today. And you saw it in the first half results of Dow AgroScience.
<Q - Peter E. Butler>: Andrew, you've been discussing this possible next consolidation step for it seems like several
years now. Is there anything coming into view?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. I mean, look, I'd say there is quite a few things coming into view. One is that the
European market and its maybe acceptance of GMO is an accelerator with 28 countries now potentially looking at
listing, allowing GMO. That's going to change the landscape and really bring North America and Europe more in line
and create new value for the in-place players who have the technology. European standards will be very strict. So – and
we'll say that you've got to have a combination of crop protection strength and trait strength, and the single-line players,
are they going to realize that with time they just can't rely on one or the other.
I think the mythology of all – everything moving to biology is gone. I think it's a combination of biology and chemistry
that's going to play and we're very proud of the fact that we have both crop protection and biology and that combo and
the crop protection is truly based on Dow's strengths. So look, you can see that what's going to happen here is the five
or six top guys are going to look at ways to combine. Obviously, the early way to do that is through licensing and
exclusive licenses, but clearly there's a model out there for releasing value through consolidation and bulking up on
both sides of the house.

<A - William H. Weideman>: Good morning.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Hey. Obviously, the Performance Plastics business was a star here in the quarter despite the
$100 million outage from Plaquemine. And, Bill, I think when you were talking about the business, it was sounding
like third quarter could even be better. Can you talk about the sequential price increase, I know price was up 7%
year-over-year. Can you talk about the sequential price increase and what sort of momentum you're carrying in that
business into Q3?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Yeah. Yeah, Frank, so you're exactly right. So plastics, as you pointed out,
Performance Plastics overcame $100 million headwind on the two outages we had in the crackers in Plaquemine. From
an overall Performance Plastics standpoint, industry dynamics are very strong. There is very low inventory levels.
There is pricing momentum, you saw that in this quarter. Our belief that will continue and on top of that, you're seeing
ethane costs down now around $0.23, $0.24. So we expect margins going into the third quarter to remain very strong.

<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Terrific. Thanks so much. And then, Andrew, when you're talking about priority 5 on slide 21,
you mentioned that to release value in rail cars over the next six months, frankly, that's a faster timeline than I would
have anticipated given the fact that you guys are involved so much in the chlor-alkali carve-out. And then I think you
also mentioned other financial structures as a possibility. Was that a nod to possible MLP-ing of those assets and just
more broadly, where do you stand on the whole topic of MLP?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. I think one more data point that we provided you on this call, Frank, that partly
answers your first question on speed and timelines and that is we have 12 corporate teams actively engaged. I
mentioned we have 100 people on the chlorine carve-out. This is a company that's paralleling execution on the
operating side as well as execution on the transaction side to release value and to become more transparent where it
makes money, and as a consequence, we're dropping low ROC activities or activities that are best in the hands of other
ownership models.
And then to the second part of your question, we believe rail cars can go to another model. We also believe that we'd be
quite open to structures that are tax advantaged such as MLP. But implied in your question is, is there a big MLP
structure of the Westlake kind in our future? Probably not, because we're a very different type of upstream asset
operator. We operate 18 upstream assets integrated into our machine and maybe the new assets can be – we can look at
them, for example, PDH. We are examining all those, but we don't see any silver bullet in some of these structures for
our mainstream businesses yet. But for sure ancillary assets, we'd be definitely looking at them.

Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Andrew, looking at slide 18, priority 1, you're obviously very, very busy; but
what's beyond 2017 as we go through these next couple of years? Can you talk about – a little bit about what drives
Dow in the last two, three years of this decade in terms of new projects or innovation, et cetera?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: It's very good to first acknowledge that we're very busy, and secondly, to put us into that
timeframe because, quite rightly, David, we've had 18 months of strategic reviews with our board and we've done a
five-year plan, we've done a 10-year plan, as most companies do. And when you put a stake in the ground for years like
2025, you obviously are thinking about projects in 2018, 2020, 2022. And we're not going to disclose those plans to the
market quite right now. We have a lot of work to do to get to 2015, 2016, 2017, and I've already implied that we're
going to generate a lot of cash and that cash is going to our shareholders. So we're going through a massive CapEx
bubble right now. We're using that cash obviously from operations, which has been pretty good and getting better with
our productivity focus, and we're putting that into organic growth such as these big facilities that we'll be starting up in
the first part of this back half of this decade.
The second part of the decade, we have a very robust R&D pipeline where we can make choices to go narrower and
deeper, and we've implied over time that there are deep markets we want to go deeper in and we've given you the five
or six that we're concentrating on. And we'll be looking at ways to keep bulking up and becoming more significant to
customers in that part of the marketplace, not all parts of the market. In that sense, the Dow model of, if you build it,
they will come, [ph] or tons-r-us (47:00), or build a facility and move rail cars and move pallets is behind us. We are in
the value side of the conversation, which is a bit like the question I got on coatings from P.J., where is the biggest value
in the value chains? Where is the biggest ROC in those value chains, and put scarce capital against those. So going
narrower, going deeper, making choices in the back half of the decade off of our robust R&D pipeline. We will be
looking at projects on an ongoing basis. There is no big M&A in our future. I've said that over and over. We are
looking at bolt-on M&As to improve capabilities, whether it'd be in electronics or ag or even some of the businesses
like water. These are the sorts of things you can expect from us in the back half of the decade.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: And just on Sadara, Andrew, how should we think about the ramp-up in the back half of
next year in terms of the ethylene and polyethylene units coming on stream and modeling that for our numbers for next
year?

<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. I mean look, so firstly, to get this thing to 70% complete, as you well know, is pretty,
pretty impressive and I can't speak highly enough about the JV, the people in the JV, the project teams in the Dow and
Aramco people who are working seamlessly together. Having 55,000 contractors on one site is unimaginable to most.
And so as we look at the startup of these units, it's complex. I mean you've got all these units being constructed and in
the middle of it, you're going to start up a cracker and you're going to start up polyethylene units to get early revenues
and get early profits, obviously. But those are the right ones to start up first, because, obviously, they're off the low-cost
inputs that are available in the kingdom and we can see that the EBITDA that will come from those in the 2015-2016
timeframe will help make this project very accretive in a much faster fashion.
But we haven't given you enough information yet to model the earnings other than you can expect average annual
equity earnings contribution to us of $0.5 billion in the first 10 years of operation. I'll let Bill add anything he wants
here, but I would wait another six months to 12 months before we get into any specific guidance there, David.

Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Hi, Don.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Hi, Andrew. A question on Ag, more the near term. You're one of the few players in seed who's
actually talked about better first half results, given that corn acreage was down in the Americas. I know you've got a
small position in the U.S. but a big position down in Brazil. So what is it that's enabled you to grow your corn seed
business? And you seem pretty optimistic on the second half outlook despite what appear to be some real headwinds in
South America, specifically down corn acreage, so just wondering if you could reconcile some of those conflicting data
points.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, it's a great insight, Don, and something I'd expect from you following Ag so closely.
I mean, we definitely are beating competition in Latin America corn despite some of the issues that are going on there,
mostly and totally because of our technology. It's the multiple stack, it's POWERCORE. And frankly, it's
POWERCORE multiple stack that's overcoming the issue on one particular trait that's down there. And I think we've
been able to gain share as a result, and consequently our positioning going forward is that we will continue to be
winners down there on corn, even though you mentioned, of course, the outlook you do, which we, of course, agree
with. But we also not only have that, but we also have [indiscernible] (50:37) in general, broad spectrum crop
protection capabilities, and this is, of course, pre-Enlist, we're not talking Enlist yet. And as a consequence of that, the
combination of POWERCORE and the broad spectra herbicides we have has made us a winner.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: And then moving to a different area, you've maintained very good innovation despite R&D
being cut. I think it's the first quarter in the last few quarters that R&D has stabilized. So where did you make cuts in
R&D and how were you able to make those cuts and still maintain that innovation track record?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Are you talking Ag particularly or just...?
<Q - Don D. Carson>: No, just R&D overall. It's...
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, yeah.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: ... [indiscernible] (51:18) six months flat to year-over-year in this quarter for the first time.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, I mean, very simply, it's what we're doing for the entire enterprise, which is bang for
the buck. We said about a year ago, I've lost track of the time, where we did start to make cuts in the spend of far out
projects. We also made cuts in the spend of a lot of alternative energy projects. We took some bets there and some of

those bets were just too far out. I mean, yeah, you could see that out there in the future, alternative energy will have a
role, whether it be batteries or biofuels or you name it. But it's too far out for us and, yeah, we we're all for R&D, but
we want to be able to count the R&D productivity just like we count any cost input here at Dow.
And so near-term MPVs, things that are touchable and visible in terms of the commercialization of the pipeline,
working closely with marketing, that's been the way we've prioritized, and I think our pipeline hasn't suffered as a
result. The risk-adjusted MPV is still double-digit billions of dollars, $10 billion or so. A few years ago, that might
have been $12 billion. So we haven't really cut, and that's all near-term now, the realization of EBITDA from that
spend.
Bill, did you want to add anything?
<A - William H. Weideman>: It's just re-prioritization, as Andrew mentioned. It's prioritizing our investments in
Electronics and Ag and Performance Packaging, and reprioritization of resources.

Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Hi, Duffy.
<Q - Patrick Duffy Fischer>: Hey, good morning, guys. Question back on the chlorine carve-out, or a couple
questions around it. One, do you think it's going to be one deal, or should we expect a series of deals to solve that issue
for you? And then two, obviously, this gets around multiple a little bit, but how should we think about dilution from
carving off this asset at the end of the day?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Yeah, Duffy, this is Bill. We're open and we're looking at all different structures, one
deal, multiple deals, and those could take different forms. So we haven't nailed that down. We'll take whatever structure
creates the most value.
From a dilutive impact, we're not expecting any dilution on this at all. We're very focused on stranded costs from a
standpoint of making sure we don't have any stranded costs. And so as Andrew also mentioned in his prepared
comments, we are very focused on getting the right structure to maintain our integration in the go-forward. So
hopefully, that answers your question.
<Q - Patrick Duffy Fischer>: Fair enough. And then, one, this is a little bit of a rifle shot, but I think, Andrew, you
had mentioned tangentially kind of the issue that Herculex has had or at least one version of Herculex has had in Brazil
over the last year. Do you see that kind of damaging the Herculex franchise and potentially hitting the revenue there, or
was that just kind of a one-off, one-year issue?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: It's hard to say if it's one-year, one-off, Duffy. It could be consistent, it could continue on. It
could be pest management practices on single-mode products like Herculex 1 that will be impacted first, but we're very
confident to kind of get at your point that our stacked trait product, POWERCORE, will provide resistance. So even if
there's some erosion there, I think we'll more than make up for it through the stacks.

<Q - John P. McNulty>: Yes, thanks for taking my question.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Hi, John.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Good morning. So with regard to your U.S. Gulf Coast projects, it sounds like you've
prepared enough so that you'd expect them to come up on time. Can you give us some color as to how you're thinking
about the industry and the huge amounts of capacity coming on and the talks of labor shortages, et cetera, and how that
may impact the cycle specifically?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yes, we've been pretty consistent on the supply-demand balances in the timeframe of these
projects being announced in the United States. On the slow GDP growth pace, which is a global GDP of 2.5 to 3.5, and
one might argue we're on the lower edge of that right now, then the cycle will start to manifest itself in the late 2014,
2015 timeframe. And by the way, with outages this last quarter, you saw what the effect of tightening could happen
very fast on pricing, so to the question we got on pricing earlier in the call.
But all of that to tell you that if you look at the world at that sort of growth rate, then you're going to need world-scale
crackers to be built on a ratio, and picking your favorite growth rate of one to three a year, and there's been, let's say,
seven or eight announced, five to six very likely spread over a five-year timeframe. And that five-year timeframe is a
five-year timeframe because you're going to get, to your point, slowing some of them down. So some will come on
pretty much like ours, 2016, 2017, probably best is 2017 really and then you're going to start seeing a couple more in
2018, 2019, but that's it. And there really isn't a whole lot more that are going to be built because of the point you made
on capital and on labor and frankly, these are out years now and so they're not going to affect the cycle that you just
asked about.
So we're very confident that independent of low-cost inputs, the whole point on ethane, that the ethylene cycle and the
coincidence of this new capacity are going to be quite well synchronized to advantage companies like ours.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Great. And then just a quick follow-up on the comments around some of the larger JVs. It
sounds like you are looking for ways to unlock some value there and certainly implied in that maybe that some get
shaken out of the portfolio. But I guess I'm wondering, are there assets of relative size that you have JV partners with
where, if the partner was willing to sell, you'd actually be a buyer of assets as opposed to a seller of assets?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, look, we're working this portfolio to keep bulking up the value-add part of the
portfolio, because at the end of the day a commodity is a commodity is a commodity, and if you're going to run a
commodity company, you're going to run a cycle and that cycle is going to be up and down based on your low-cost
position. Nation states are pretty hard to beat and so they're going to have policies that you can't have as a private
enterprise. So our strategy has been to join them and joint venture with them.
But over timeframes, those nation states are more natural owners of those JVs and we recognize that and so then you

businesses.
But having said that, we're putting a lot of effort into growing and the projects that you asked about on the call are clear
examples of that. The innovations you asked about on the call are other examples of that, all of that moving to
