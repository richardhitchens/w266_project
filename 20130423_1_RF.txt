O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Regions First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. We certainly
appreciate your participation and respect your time. We'll keep our comments concise and move promptly to your
questions.
Regions continues to make substantial progress moving forward, with first quarter 2013 earnings reaching the highest
quarterly level in more than four years. Our results reflect continued execution of our business plans and our focus on
capitalizing on our franchise's opportunities. First quarter 2013 net income available to common shareholders was $327
million or $0.23 per diluted share, more than double a year ago and up 25% from prior period.
In addition, the year is off to a good start by many other important measures: loans on our balance sheet hold steady;
our net interest margin remains stable; we're growing our customer base; our mortgage business, while facing
headwinds, is performing well; our operating expenses are being managed with discipline and rigor; and our asset
quality continues to incrementally improve.
Let's begin with a closer look at the balance sheet. We remain on track, absent any unknown economic shocks, to
achieve a low, single digit loan growth this year, as loans outstanding steadied from fourth to first quarter period end
and overall new loan production increased 8% over last year. This new loan production helped to offset first quarter
declines in portfolio outstandings, such as investor real estate and home equity. The pace of decline in investor real
estate portfolio has moderated to the lowest level in three years. As our pace of de-risking slows, especially in the
second half of 2013, we expect total loans outstanding to grow incrementally, marking a very important shift for our
company.
Turning to deposits, we grew checking accounts in the first quarter. This is the first time in over two years that we have
experienced a net increase in core checking accounts since shifting our strategy from free checking to fee eligible
pricing. We believe this turnaround demonstrates Regions' commitment to customer service, our emphasis on providing
products and services that meet customer needs and preferences, and at a fair price. Additionally, we continue to
improve our deposit mix and further lowered average funding costs fourth to first quarter. Over the past three years, we
have reduced our overall deposit cost by 82 basis points.
So let's discuss revenue for just a moment. Mortgage banking remained a significant contributor to fee-based income,
and not surprisingly dipped below fourth quarter's levels. The quarter-over-quarter decline reflects seasonality, less
robust market activity, and our decision to retain 15-year fixed-rate mortgages on our balance sheet. The HARP II
program continues to be a significant contributor to overall mortgage production at about 20% of our volume. It is
important to note that approximately 80% of Regions' mortgage customers eligible for HARP II have yet to refinance.
We are pleased with the recent announcement regarding the two-year extension of this program; we have a
comprehensive outreach program underway to capture these opportunities and to assist our customers and their needs.
We did experience a noticeable but favorable shift in mortgage applications this quarter. New home purchases now
account for almost 50% of the applications as compared to 35% just last quarter. According to the National Association
of Realtors, the supply of homes on the market has returned to pre-housing crisis levels and is at a four-month supply,
further positive evidence that the housing market is recovering.
So let's turn our focus to expenses. In the first quarter operating expenses, excluding special items in the fourth quarter,
declined slightly and are on track to meet our expectations for a lower full-year operating cost versus 2012. The decline

in the first quarter is particularly encouraging given the seasonal increase in payroll-related tax expense. And
additionally in the first quarter we continued to invest in technology that benefits our productivity and efficiency. The
investment is consistent with our commitment to provide new, innovative services and delivery options that our
customers want and need. In 2012, we invested in updating branch systems and platforms. This year we're
concentrating on upgrading our alternate delivery channels. For example, during the first quarter, we enhanced our
transaction capabilities at most of our ATMs. As a result of these advances in technology, over 90% of the transactions
traditionally conducted through a branch teller can now be completed at a Regions ATM.
Mobile banking continues to be a rapid growth channel and a critical area of focus. Earlier this month we launched a
number of product enhancements that enable our customers to more fully bank with us by using their mobile phone.
Moving on to asset quality, trends were broadly positive in the first quarter. As expected, non-performing assets
continued to improve, reflecting ongoing declines in both non-performing loans and non-performing loan migration.
We remain confident the pace of asset quality improvement will continue in 2013.
Finally, we are pleased with our 2013 CCAR results, and you'll soon see us taking actions to execute the plan,
including implementation of our announced stock repurchase program.
I'll now turn the call over to David for a more in-depth discussion of first quarter financial trends. Afterwards, I'll return
for a few closing comments before taking questions. David?
David J. Turner
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Since Grayson's already provided a high-level overview, I'm going to jump
right into the details.
So let's start with slide three on the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, total loan balances remained steady
from the prior quarter. Our Commercial and Industrial and Indirect Auto Loan portfolios continued to produce solid
results. In addition, we experienced a slower pace of decline in the Investor Real Estate portfolio. The Investor Real
Estate portfolio declined 5% linked quarter compared to the previous quarter's decline of 11%. At quarter end, Investor
Real Estate ending balances stood at $7.3 billion, down $2.8 billion from one year ago. Overall balances in the Investor
Real Estate portfolio may fluctuate depending on productivity levels, de-risking and payoff activity.
We estimate that we have approximately $800 million of de-risking remaining in the portfolio, a portion of which will
be offset by new production, and just to remind you that compares to about $1 billion that we mentioned to you before.
In fact, new production in the Investor Real Estate portfolio has begun to pick up as we see more opportunities to make
loans to qualified borrowers consistent with our risk appetite.
We experienced another quarter of solid growth in our Commercial and Industrial loan portfolio. Average loans in this
portfolio grew 2% versus the prior quarter, and total new and renewed production increased 3% over the prior year.
During the first quarter, we saw a broadening of our commercial loan activity across a well-diversified base of
industries and geographies. Consequently, overall business loans increased $268 million linked quarter. Notably, line
utilization increased 140 basis points to 44.8% from the end of the prior quarter and commitments are up 12% from the
prior year.
Looking at Consumer Lending, this portfolio decreased just over 1% link quarter as consumer deleveraging continued.
As a reminder, during the fourth quarter, we began the process of retaining our 15 year, fixed rate conforming
residential mortgages. This strategy supports our overall efforts to grow the balance sheet and effectively manage our
exposure to interest rate risk. This resulted in approximately $180 million of additional loans held on the balance sheet
in the first quarter.
Declines in our total Home Equity portfolio, which includes lines and loans, continue as customers take advantage of
opportunities to refinance. However, we are encouraged by the results at our Home Equity Loan portfolio as loan
production increased 60% over the prior year, primarily due to the introduction of a fixed rate loan product during the

third quarter of 2012. Growth in this product is expected to continue to reduce the pace of decline in our Home Equity
portfolio.
Indirect Auto Loans increased 6% quarter-over-quarter, and total production is up 16% as we continue to expand our
dealer network. At quarter end, we had approximately 2,000 dealers and plan to add an additional 300 dealers by the
end of the year.
Although credit card balances were down this quarter, our production of new accounts was 10% higher than the prior
year first quarter. Currently, our penetration rate is approximately 12% of our households, and we expect this to
increase to more than 20% over time. We have planned a comprehensive marketing campaign for credit cards
throughout 2013 to help facilitate this growth.
We were pleased with the progress we made in the first quarter in holding our loans steady, and we expect to see
growth in loan production and anticipate that production will outpace attrition by the second half of 2013. And based
on what we know now, we continue to project loan growth in the low single digits for 2013.
Now let's move on the liability side of the balance sheet. Deposit mix and cost continued to improve in the first quarter.
Total average, low cost deposits increased $375 million link quarter and time deposits fell to just 14% of total average
deposits. This positive re-pricing and mix shift resulted in deposit costs declining 4 basis points down to 18 basis points
for the quarter. And we have an additional $5.6 billion of CDs maturing in 2013 at an average rate of 93 basis points.
And this compares to our current average going on rates for new CDs of approximately 25 basis points. Further, our
overall total funding cost improved to 45 basis points, a decrease of 86 basis points over the last three years.
So let's take a look at how all of this has impacted our net interest income. Net interest income on a fully taxable
equivalent basis was $811 million, down 2% link quarter, and this decline was driven in part by a fewer number of days
in the quarter as well as a decline in earning assets. Total loan yields were down 7 basis points link quarter to 4.14%.
This was primarily related to the impact of a continued low rate environment on the reinvestment rates of higher fixed
rate loans that are paying off. The resulting net interest margin was 3.13%, up 3 basis points link quarter. Again, this
was driven by a reduced day count, which really resulted in 2 basis points of the benefit, and our debt management
activities last quarter. These activities and the decline in deposit costs served to offset the reduction on earning asset
yields, which is largely attributable to the low rate environment, and we continue to expect our margin to remain
relatively stable throughout 2013 with potential upside if rates rise.
Let's take a look at non-interest revenue. First quarter non-interest revenue declined 7% link quarter, primarily related
to a decline in mortgage and service charges income. As expected, mortgage banking revenue was down in the first
quarter, but well above historical levels. And while 2012 was a record year, we still anticipate 2013 to yield solid
results. As mentioned earlier, we started retaining 15-year mortgages on our balance sheet, which will impact mortgage
income. And you can find a breakout of mortgage revenue on Page 9 in the supplement to our press release.
Mortgage loan production was $1.8 billion, an increase of 13% over the prior year, and mortgage revenue continues to
be driven by HARP II as approximately 40% of all HARP mortgage applications submitted were from non-Regions
customers. In addition, at the end of the quarter, we purchased servicing rights on approximately $3 billion of mortgage
loans, which will help offset some of the mortgage income decline going forward.
Service charges during the quarter were impacted by lower NSF fees, primarily related to seasonality. As Grayson
mentioned, we experienced an increase in net checking accounts as well as our number of households, which will serve
to drive future service charges.
Also, our Now Banking suite of products continued to grow. The number of households using these products has more
than tripled over the last year. Almost 60% of these customers are new Regions customers providing us with additional
cross-sell opportunities.
Let's take a look at expenses on the next slide. Non-interest expenses totaled $842 million, and excluding adjustments
in the prior quarter, this resulted in a decline of 1% link quarter. And during the quarter, we experienced seasonal
increases in salaries and benefits primarily related to an increase of payroll taxes. Professional and legal expenses

returned to a more normalized level due to the prior quarter benefit of $20 million in reduced legal reserves that we
previously mentioned to you. We continue to expect that 2013 expenses will be lower than those in 2012, illustrating
our commitment to prudent expense management and a generation of positive operating leverage.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 26%, which included a $9 million reduction in tax reserves as well as a $4 million
benefit to the valuation allowance. Excluding these items, our tax rate would have been closer to 29%, which is in line
with our more normalized rate.
Let's move on to asset quality. We continue to make progress with respect to asset quality. The provision for loan
losses was $10 million, or $170 million less than net charge-offs. Total net charge-offs were flat link quarter, and net
charge-offs as a percentage of average loans was again below 1%. Both non-performing loans and non-performing
assets declined link quarter 6% and 7% respectively. In addition, delinquencies also declined 10% fourth to first
quarter. Notably, criticized and classified loans, which is one of the best and earliest indicators of asset quality
continued to decline, with Commercial and Investor Real Estate criticized loans down 9% from the fourth quarter.
Our coverage ratios remain solid. At quarter end, our loan loss allowance to non-performing loans stood at 110%.
Meanwhile, our loan loss allowance to loans remains solid at 2.37% at the end of the first quarter.
Based on what we know today, we expect continued improvement in asset quality going forward.
Let's take a look at capital and liquidity. As Grayson mentioned, we were pleased with our overall CCAR results and
the Federal Reserve having no objection to our capital management plan, which we expect to implement soon. Our
capital position remains strong as our estimated Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter stood at 12.3% and our estimated
Tier 1 common ratio was 11.2%. Now, based on our interpretation of Basel III, we expect our pro forma Basel III Tier
1 common ratio will be approximately 9.1%.
Liquidity at both the bank and the holding company remains solid with a loan to deposit ratio of 79%. And lastly, based
on our understanding of the new amendments, Regions remains well positioned to be fully compliant with respect to
the liquidity coverage ratio.
So overall, this quarter's results are solid and demonstrate the substantial progress we are making. And we look forward
to continuing to build our momentum.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Grayson for his closing remarks.
O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, David. Well, in conclusion, Regions is moving forward and gaining momentum. We are executing our
business plans; we're capitalizing on our franchise's opportunities; we're actively managing our strong capital base; and
incrementally improving profitability quarter to quarter.
Our first quarter results demonstrate the progress we're making on several important fronts. And these include:
prudently and profitably expanding our loan application pipelines; expanding and deepening our customer
relationships; lowering our overall funding costs; continuing to stabilize our net interest margin; while at the same time
continuing to reduce our overall risk profile; while adhering to disciplined expense management. We are committed to
further progress in 2013 as we continue to prudently work towards maximizing Regions' franchise value.
I'll turn the meeting back over to List for the instructions of the Q&A portion of our call. Thank you for your time.
M. List Underwood
Thank you, Grayson. We are ready to begin the Q&A session of our call. In order to accommodate as many participants

Now let's open up the line.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Good morning. Obviously you've had had some real nice C&I loan growth and we've just
heard from some other banks of pricing pressure and some terms being given. Maybe you could just comment a little
bit on the rates that you're seeing and the underlying asset quality to what you're adding?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, Matt. Clearly it's a pretty competitive marketplace today and we are seeing pricing
pressure within the marketplace. I would tell you that we're looking at the data. It would seem to indicate that while the
pressure's there, we're still holding spread margins slightly above historical rates. But it does appear that spreads
continue to, very slowly, move downward. But I would say our numbers seem to indicate holding fairly steady with a
bias to the downside.
But we continue to feel like that in our marketplaces and in the segments that we're choosing to compete that we're still
able to hold pricing at a pretty favorable point, in addition, our overall underwriting and structure, which includes
pricing. We continue to believe that we are prudently adding to our balance sheet. And I'll ask Barb Godin – Barb's
with us – to sort of give you a little bit of color on what we're seeing coming onto the balance sheet.
<A - Barbara Godin>: Thank you, Grayson. Yes, what we're seeing right now, very happy with the asset quality that's
going on the book. Yes, there is some pressure on structure, some pressure on price, but all in it clearly is within our
risk appetite; in fact, below our risk appetite levels right now. So we anticipate that that book will perform well both
now and in the future.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Then credit quality overall is obviously very good again this quarter, but anything within
the C&I book that caused the jump, linked quarter, in charge-offs? I don't know if it's seasonal or just some lumpiness
there, but just looking at the charge-off dollars in C&I, went up from $17 million to $58 million, down a little bit
year-over-year. But, anything that you'd highlight there?
<A - Barbara Godin>: Yeah, Matt. It's Barb Godin again. We had three C&I credits, large credits, a total of $39
million. We had a reserve against them of $32 million, and again that's caused a little bit of a bump in the release that
we saw. But again, no trend; it's at the point right now that we're going to see bumpiness as we move out of the back
end of this cycle
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, I think the C&I charge-offs by their nature are always going to be somewhat uneven.
And we saw some unevenness this quarter, but still overall asset quality trends continue to be in the right direction.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore Partners.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning. On my competition question, do you actually have the average new money yields
that you're seeing by product perhaps in C&I and in CRE in terms of what you're bringing on the balance sheet right
now?

<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: John, let me ask John Asbury very quickly to speak to that issue. John runs our Business
Services group and he can speak more specifically to those spreads and yields.
<A - John C. Asbury>: Yeah thanks, Grayson. Good morning. Obviously it depends upon the exact nature of the
client, with the larger client who are among the most creditworthy commanding the best pricing. So you get into mix
issues. I would say typically what you'll see in terms of going on spread to LIBOR in the middle market is going to be
something in the neighborhood of say LIBOR plus 225 to maybe 250. It kind of varies. If you look at the real estate
world, it's a little higher; it's probably within commercial real estate, average pricing 260 to 275 over LIBOR, on those
lines. And you'll see variation, up and down, again, depending upon creditworthiness of the client and size.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. That's helpful, thanks. And then in terms of your – the longer term loan loss reserve level,
you said you're continuing to see some opportunity there to pull back on the reserve, and I just want to get your
thoughts on where the reserve level could end up leveling out. I know it's at around 240 basis points of loans right now,
so I wanted where see where could go to.
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, John, this is David. We've talked historically that we thought the reserve – pending
there's some changes in accounting that are coming, so Lord knows for the time being that our reserves would be in that
1.50% to 2% range. And I know that's a fairly wide margin, and as we get clarity on how things are shaking out, we
will refine that. The question is, the time period on when that – we'll get to that reserve level. It's really based off
obviously charge-offs and what's going on in the books. And we're seeing continued improvement in all of our credit
metrics. You heard about the three credits in C&I, so our charge would have been lower. But I think that going forward
that we would be – we expect to be in sub 2% range, but the timing of that we just can't be as clear.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. Thank you
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Josh Levin of Citi.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: Good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Morning, Josh.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: If the Basel rules are adopted as proposed and you have to mark-to-market the securities
portfolio for changes in rates, how much of a capital buffer do you think you'll need for the impact of OCI volatility on
regulatory capital?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, Josh, we continue to look at that in terms of our modeling. Just rough numbers, we
would be in the 25 to 50 basis points of probably additional capital that we would have to keep to soften any change in
market changes, because of the rapid change that could occur there. Obviously we're hopeful, as the sort of things get
carved out, the final rules; but right now, as is, that's what the capital impact would be.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: Okay. And have you heard of anything from the CFPB regarding payday lending that might
impact any of your businesses?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: You know, we obviously have a short-term lending product that we offer today, and we've
been in close communication with the CFPB to – at this juncture, there's not been any clarification or guidance come
out on those types of products. We're working with them daily to understand sort of what the direction will be and we'll
adjust accordingly. We've continued to adjust the products that we offer to be more customer friendly and continue to –
to continue to try to meet customer needs in that particular part of the segment.

Your next question comes from the line of Gaston Ceron of Morningstar Equity Research.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning Gaston.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into the expense line a
little bit more. I know you talked about this during your prepared remarks, but I wonder if you can give a little more
color on, especially the other expense line and, you know, how much room do you have to bring that down
permanently lower from these levels. I mean, I know you said you expect 2013 expenses to come under 2012, but I'm
just trying to, as you continue to move, to improve operations there, I'm just trying to get a handle on what the
normalized level's going to look like?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, Gaston, we have obviously given guidance on total expenses. As you get down to a
more granular level, it's a little more difficult. If you look at those other expense categories, in particular what you saw
in there were OREO and held for sale expenses. We're seeing some gains on disposition of assets that are in those
numbers and have kept those pretty low. Of course our held for sale and OREO balances together are less than about
$200 million today. And I'll tell you, from an OREO standpoint, that's below historically where we've been. So we see
controlling that going forward as being real important to that other expense line item.
We kind of would think about our expenses in terms of the top three. Salaries and benefits, number one, occupancy
number two, and structure and equipment expense number three. And so making sure that we focus on ensuring we
have the right number of talented people working for us is something we look at. We continue to make investments in
talent; we'll do that going forward. We've looked at our infrastructure in terms of branching. We've reduced branches
more since 2007 than any other bank, about 16%. But nonetheless we continue to look at branch locations and we had
some consolidation last year of branches as we did the year before, and I'm sure we'll have some this year. And we'll
have investments in new branches and new formats. So, you know, there's really no one big rock that you can look at in
terms of expense reduction.
That's why we don't come up – we haven't developed a branded expense initiative. It is cultural. It is built into every
expense line item that we have to make sure that we're prudent with regards to expenses. So I would look at those four
or five things that I pointed to in terms of understanding the direction of where our expenses may go.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: Okay. And I'm sorry, then just a very quick follow-up on what you just said. Regarding
branches, is there any sort of target for a kind of a year-end level or anything like that? Or no, just kind of see how it
develops?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Gaston, we continue to be very disciplined and rigorous around looking at our branches in
terms of branch activity, in terms of transaction counts, in terms of new accounts opened, as well as looking at the
overall staffing in those branches. You know, we – as David said, we reduced our number of branch outlets over the
past three years, last few years, approximately 16%. We continue to have fairly – we still continue to make adjustments
to those numbers of branches, and that develops over the course of the year as our process unfolds. But, you know, you
should not anticipate any large swings in our number of branches, but we may – we're making course corrections as we
see the opportunities, and we'll do that every year. We'll continue to do it
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: Great. Thank you very much.

<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Could you mind touching on duration extension risk and just kind of framing where you guys
think you are now versus let's say 12 months ago? I know you've reshaped the portfolio mix a little bit here.
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, if you look at our investment portfolio, we have extended duration slightly. It's just over
three years. And we've done a couple things there, though. We have some new asset classes in the investment portfolio,
some new issue CMBS; some corporates that we didn't have that we think protect us a little bit on the extension risk.
But you really have to look at our balance sheet in total. And isolating it in any one spot is going to be detrimental. We
are still asset sensitive, as you will see in our disclosure. You saw it in our 10-K, you'll see it in our 10-Q, and we
continue to be that way, which is why we're – to the extent we do have an increase in rates, you should see a fairly
sizable improvement in our net interest income and the resulting margin.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I think when you look at the loan portfolio, you see we put 15-year mortgages on our
balance sheet, but when you look to the absolute level of that in relationship to the size of our portfolio, it's fairly
modest. The other issue is, if you look at our commercial lending, if you look at small business lending and lower end
of middle market, a lot of that is term-based lending with an amortizing loan. But when you – the further up you go in
that market, the less of that you see, and today on a dollars basis, still three-fourths of our Business and Commercial
portfolio is variable rate priced. And so from a duration standpoint, we still think on a loan portfolio, we're holding
ourselves in a pretty good position.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Okay. And then you mentioned that you'd purchased some mortgage servicing assets in the
quarter. Just talk about your appetite there. And do you view that as a little bit of a rate hedge as well?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: We do view it somewhat as a rate hedge, but also as an NIR opportunity to generate some
additional revenues for the company. When you look at it, our servicing portfolio, a little over $40 billion, and adding
$3 billion to that, we think we have the capacity to do that. Our appetite, I would call our appetite limited, but still have
an appetite for that asset and think it's incrementally favorable to our overall operation. We think we've got a team
that's pretty good at that. We want to make sure that we don't create any capacity issues with that team. But we feel
pretty good about where our appetite setting is for that business today. We're still a relatively small – very small player
in that space.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: We're about the 23rd largest servicer roughly, which is about 0.44% market share, so we're
really not that large. But we are good at it, and we have our team dedicated to this. You know, obviously went through
all of the issues and have done a great job. And we like the return profile; you mentioned the rate hedge, that's part of it.
The capacity is part of it too, and we have the ability to add some even from where we are today, and so we'll look
opportunistically for those chances to improve that portfolio, increase that portfolio.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: I had a question about what's going on with housing in your region and the impact on the
NPAs and just delinquencies in general. I'm, you know, hearing that housing has been improving and wanted to get
your take on what's going on as well as opportunities to further accelerate the reduction in exposure to legacy assets
there.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, Betsy, I would tell you that we've been fairly aggressive in shedding distressed
assets related to homebuilders through the cycle and really have a pretty low exposure to that segment today from a
distressed standpoint. I would say what's changed this quarter from last quarter is, if you look across our 16-state
footprint, a quarter ago we saw signs of housing recovery in a number of markets, but not all of them. I would say it's

more widespread today; we're seeing more signs of recovery more broadly across our franchise footprint than we did.
We're seeing inventory levels that are getting back to very low levels, and we're seeing homebuilders starting to
construct homes again. So I would say it's more broad, it's more consistent, and we believe that we're in a position to
take a very prudent position of opportunity on that in the home building space. I'll ask Barb to sort of talk about the
disposition of what distressed assets we still have related to that segment. Barb?
<A - Barbara Godin>: Thank you, Grayson. We don't have as many assets in that asset class as we previously did,
particularly in the distressed environment. In total, Betsy, if I look at our OREO balance as an example, we only have
$133 million of those. We were able to get, move those relatively quickly and for some decent pricing. What we moved
into held-for-sale as well, I mean, right now we only have $66 million left in our held-for-sale portfolio, the majority of
that being turned within 12-month period. So we don't see as much coming in the front end either in the held-for-sale or
OREO from the Investor Real Estate classes.
We're seeing more on the C&I right now coming in. And in terms of overall pricing, however, going back to that
comment, we are seeing a number of markets across our footprint that have increased in pricing. South Florida is one
example. We're even seeing the Atlanta market, the Birmingham market, some of our major markets have clearly
moved in a positive direction.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Your NIM is relatively strong compared to peers, and there's more resiliency there as you
look out over the next several quarters. Would you consider using that to be a little bit more aggressive on pricing and
loan growth generation?
<A - David J. Turner>: Betsy, our NIM obviously is supported in large part due to the liability side of the balance
sheet, first and foremost, our deposits. So, I had mentioned that we have $5.6 billion worth of CDs maturing at a 93
basis point rate going into a 25 basis point rate. You know, as we think about disposition, disposition of these assets,
we've had a program for a long time to evaluate every one of those to get our best execution on disposition. And it's not
just about getting rid of non-performing loans and non-performing assets, but it's what is the best long-term play, best
play for our shareholders. And where we see opportunities to sell, we sell. When we see opportunities to work out, we
keep that. So we do understand that we can get our NPLs down a whole lot quicker if we just pooled them up and sold
them, but we're not confident that that's the best execution for our shareholders, which is why we hadn't done it. And,
Barb, you might want to...
<A - Barbara Godin>: No. I think you hit the nail on the head. We do evaluate bottoms up every quarter. We look at
every single loan and look at what the best outcome is for our shareholders, and that might mean holding those loans a
little bit longer. But having said that, if you look at some of our numbers, our actual numbers that we keep, more than a
year in NPL has dropped dramatically. Again, in general, we try to turn our non-performing loan book over in a
12-month period.

The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Ken
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: My first question, I wanted to ask you about kind of the other side of the net interest income
story. So the NIM stability is certainly helped by a bunch of the mechanisms you've mentioned on the deposit side and
on the long-term debt footprint. But the earning asset balances continued to shrink even though it looks like loans have
finally, in a good way, started to stabilize. So can you help us understand what your outlook is for when you expect
earning assets to bottom? And within that again, against a stable NIM backdrop, do you expect NII to grow room here?

<A - David J. Turner>: Ken, what you're looking at on the earning assets included putting changes in cash and some
of the liability management that we've had, and we'll continue to see some liability management. We hadn't been
specific with those, but we still have opportunities on that front. So, earning assets, the biggest driver of earning asset
stability will be loan growth. And as we mentioned in our prepared comments, we expect that growth to occur in the
low single digits during this year.
The specific timing of that's a little harder because we still are disposing of some of the assets, in particular in our
Investor Real Estate portfolio. But we're encouraged with our increase in production in our loan categories, and I think
that you could see a slowing of the attrition going forward on earning assets. And as we put more loans on the books,
that's also going to support a higher overall net interest income.
Obviously, we're still a little bit at the mercy of the interest rate environment. You've seen the 10-year jump around
quite a bit in the first quarter, and so where we are from reinvesting our cash flows off of our investment portfolio is
important to us, and it's $500 million a month we have to put to work. And so being able to give you confidence on NII
dollars is a little more difficult, but with the loan growth, we expect the ability to be able to do that is enhanced.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I think the – if you look again trying to see what's different this quarter from last quarter,
we still see modest demand for credit. That being said, we've seen better diversity of demand. We're seeing more
demand from smaller middle-market businesses than we've seen previously; again modest, but better diversity of
demand. Still strong demand in the upper end of C&I, but I would tell you that the mix of demand we're getting today
we consider to be an encouraging sign.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. Great. And my second question just relates to operating leverage. We all hear your
comments loud and clear about continuing to move expenses lower, and they certainly are in a great path on a
year-over-year basis so far. But from efficiency ratio perspective, there's always a little bit of seasonality to think about,
but how do we understand how the interplay between that cost control you mentioned and then the revenue growth that
you expect, to translate into potential to improve the efficiency ratio?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I'll speak and I'll let David add to that his comments. But when we think about efficiency,
clearly in a low-rate, slow-growth environment, expense management is, just has to be foundational in the way we
operate the business. And we're going to continue to focus on expenses very rigorously. But if you look at the
efficiency ratio, the two sides of that coin, one's expense, the other's revenue. And quite frankly, when you break our
numbers down more granularly, the revenue side of that equation is probably one we need work on more. The expense
side, though, we continue to focus on and we still believe that, that will come down.
First quarter is always a challenging quarter for a number of seasonal issues and a number of day-count issues, but we
still see the opportunity to improve that ratio going forward with a balanced approach on both sides of that calculation.
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, I would tell you, Ken, that the efficiency ratio, call it 64% and change, from a
seasonality standpoint, has a couple of points in there that work against us in this first quarter. Even with that, we
would like to get our efficiency ratio down into the high-50%s and we think in time we can get there, perhaps needing a
little bit of a rate pickup to get there.
But while we wait for that, our focus is on improving both NII and NIR. To Grayson's point, revenue is the biggest
driver of improvement. So as you think through NII, growing loans and having more of our balance sheet, more of our
earning assets in loans versus securities. So today we have 25% of our earning assets are in investment securities, and
that number should be in the 18% range, just round numbers. So getting loan growth and repositioning there is really
important to us.
We continue to look on the right side of the balance sheet in terms of liability management too, to help us on interest
expense.
And then we're also looking at growing our households, and then we mentioned that in our prepared comments,
because it's important to us to continue to add, in particular checking account households to us, because it brings us a
source of non-interest revenue. And so we think we can continue to grow NIR through – with the development of new

products and services. I mentioned the Now Banking product where we've tripled our customers over the past year; it's
been a great source of non-interest revenue for us.
So continuing to understand what our customers need and want, and developing products and services that meet those
needs, and therefore growing our total revenue will be the key to us improving that efficiency ratio and our
commitment to generating positive operating leverage. So it's not just an expense play for us; it's all about making sure
that we can generate positive operating leverage in the long run.

Your next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Ryan.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Hey, Grayson, how are you. Just one clarification on the question that Ken had asked. So given
the outlook for efficiency and some of the expense headwinds that you faced in the first quarter, can we expect to
actually see expenses continue to fall from the current level?
<A - David J. Turner>: We end up – our commitment has been really kind of year-over-year. The first quarter had
some benefits in it relative to held for sale and OREO expenses, i.e. we had some gains in that quarter. We're
continuing to work on those expenses to get them down even further from the first quarter. But right now our guidance
to you is really a year-over-year basis, is as far as we have committed thus far.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Got it. And then just on the Investor Real Estate, I know you noted that production has
improved and there's something like $800 million of de-risking left versus $1 billion last quarter, so implying that
there's still some core runoff in the portfolio. I think you made some positive comments about demand potentially
picking up. So is there – are you starting to see enough demand on the other side that you could actually foresee this
portfolio starting to grow at some point this year?
<A - David J. Turner>: We have – it is very close. I don't know that we can claim victory just yet on it. We were
down slightly in the first quarter, about $400 million. Production is up, pipelines we're encouraged with. But we still
have that $800 million. The timing of how that gets dealt with is what's harder to tell. Again, we've looked at giving
guidance on what the year will look like, but we are very close to where that attrition stops in Investor Real Estate, and
we believe that you will see that in the second half of 2013.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Okay. And just a very quick follow up on the back of that. Given where we are in the cycle
right now, are you expanding your geographic reach in any of your businesses, whether it's in middle market or large
corporate C&I, or in the commercial real estate business?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: No, we're staying. We are trying to continue to grow our business within our footprint and
within the businesses that we compete today. But we have not expanded beyond our footprint, and we've not expanded
beyond the products we offer today. We don't see doing that at the moment.

<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: Good morning. My first question is a follow-up on your margin outlook, David. In terms of
the debt management actions that you did this quarter, could you tell us what specifically they are, how much is left in
terms of debt management actions, and whether or not what's left is embedded in your guidance for NIM stability?
<A - David J. Turner>: Let me answer it in a little different order, Erika. First I want to be careful about making any
implication of any particular debt instrument that we might deal with. So I have multiple lawyers around me to make
sure we don't commit to that. But I think as you look at our balance sheet and you think about where we are from a
liquidity standpoint that doing some liability management it makes sense for us. We have had some of that liability
management that you've seen that has been baked into our analysis of NIM since the beginning of the year. There are
additional pieces that we have not disclosed that – I don't want to get in, again, to the specifics – that have not been
baked into our overall margin guidance. So there are potential opportunities to pick up some incremental lift. I would
tell you it's not a tremendous amount of lift, but there is some positive upside that could be there, if in fact we execute.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: Got it. And to follow up, again this is probably re-asking Ken Usdin's question, but given
that outlook should – is it fair to expect that earning asset growth will lag loan growth in the back half of the year?
<A - David J. Turner>: Earning asset growth also gets driven by how we use some of our cash and liability
management; so it's harder to compare earning asset changes to loan growth. I think the better way to look at it is to
think of what the composition of those earning assets will be in the back half of the year versus where they have been,
which is obviously more deployment in the loan book than in the securities book as being a big driver. As we think
about overall NIM, we're sitting here at the 3.13%, I mentioned in my prepared comments that two of those points are
related to day count, so you need to level set there. And we're telling you right now that our margin is relatively stable
looking out.
If in fact we can execute on – and it's right to do, to execute on some additional liability management initiatives, then
we might have some incremental lift from there. But, again, caution you on that wouldn't be a tremendous lift. But it
would be incremental.

Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Marty.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Good morning. Wanted to just dive in a little bit more into the statement of the C&I,
broad across geographies and businesses just to make sure we get a feel for what traction you're seeing in the Southeast
region and where is that real strength coming from?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, Marty, as you are well aware, the Southeast has probably been one of the tougher
markets to operate in the last three or four years, and I would – my comment was that what's changed over the last
quarter for us is that we're seeing broader demand from a physical geography standpoint. We divide up our franchise
into a number of different markets, and more of those markets are growing loans this quarter than were last quarter.
In addition, we also divide our customer base up into segments. And I would tell you for the last several quarters, for
example in commercial and industrial lending; we've seen most of that demand for credit in the upper end of that
market segment, just purely from a segmentation standpoint. This quarter we're seeing more demand in the lower and
middle part of that segment, which is an encouraging sign for a recovery.
I do think that we're seeing that broadness both on a segmentation basis and on a geography basis. Clearly, some of the
strongest geographies in our business, in our footprint, have clearly been in the Texas and Louisiana markets. And for a
while, you know, were to a large degree limited to some of those markets; but now it's much more broad.

<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then, David, I wanted to talk little bit more; we kind of had this conversation last
year at this time about the seasonal impacts. There's probably $0.02 to $0.03 of giveback if you look at taxes and
security gains and some of the OREO gains that you wouldn't think of as sustainable. But then there's also the FICA
and option expenses, the fees on the service charges, the deposits, then the day count and NII. Could you look at those
two things as being kind of generally even handed in a sense of the givebacks versus the benefit you get from the
seasonality?
<A - David J. Turner>: Marty, I'd tell you, and again staying fairly broad, that we had obviously mentioned our
income tax numbers, the $9 million and the $4 million. So you need to think about that in terms of – and that's tax,
right, so that's $0.01 there.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Right.
<A - David J. Turner>: And you can look at the traction of our quarter-to-quarter in terms of payroll taxes that we
would have some pickup there. But we had some favorable held for sale and OREO costs too. So it's harder to give
you, without giving you specific guidance for the next quarter, which I'm not going to do, but we're trying to – if you
take your $0.23 and start carving out those one-offs that we mentioned, we're trying to give you some guidance as to
what would not repeat in the subsequent quarters. But I think you hit the specific ones that you should look at.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: It just seemed to me that there's about as much opportunity in the seasonality as in some
of the givebacks, and that's all I was trying to think of generally. Not trying to forecast the next quarter, but just kind of
look at the balance between those two items.

net interest margin?
<A - David J. Turner>: Craig, I don't have that specifically. Obviously, all that's baked into the overall guidance that I
gave you. But I don't have the pieces of that impact and maturities. But we can get that to you.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: And when you think about that impact, how's the mix of it towards the debt side, in terms
of kind of protecting interest rate expense on debt? And also towards kind of variable rate commercial loans?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, a lot of this – we have both. Obviously, we have some pieces in debt that are swapped
and some that are not. And if you look at our overall long-term debt cost, we're just – we're right at [ph] $6 million
(60:09), slightly underneath that. The after swap impact is just under 5%. That's the liability management initiative; if
you just take that globally and think about where spreads are for us today, they provide us an opportunity to execute
some liability management to get that cost down.
We do have some swaps on our loan book. I don't recall anything large rolling off any time in the near term that's going
to negatively impact our net interest income and the resulting margin, though.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Got it. And then just real quick on Income [indiscernible] (1:01:10) I believe the portfolio
is about $6.3 billion now. Can you help us when we think about a trough, expected trough level for this portfolio as we
think of runoff decelerating over the next few quarters here?

starts to grow, and it's a little harder. The kind of guidance that we were trying to give you is that if you take our
number today at $7.3 billion and you think of $800 million of that needing – $800 million being in a "troubled"
category of rolling out. Our production is increasing, we're encouraged by our pipelines, and when that actually shifts
and bobs out, Craig, is a little hard. It will be in the second half of 2013. You know, I don't know that you'll see this by
the end of the second quarter; I think you're into the second half before it occurs. And so that's about as – that's about as
good a guidance as we can give you right now.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: And, David, the only reason I dissected the two numbers, I just gave you the income pre
non-construction portion, is that it looks like the construction portion has already started to grow.
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, it's about $7.3 billion in total; you were giving just the real estate mortgage number.
There's another call it $1 billion dollars in construction. And you're right. I mean, to your point, we like the growth; it's
not a lot of growth, but you can kind of see quarter over quarter starting in the middle of last year there was slight
growth throughout 2013. We are seeing opportunities there, but that book's still fairly small.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Okay.

Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Jennifer
<Q - Jennifer Demba>: Good morning. Just curious on the C&I growth, could you talk about maybe where you're
seeing better demand in terms of industry versus weaker demand? And I'm curious about your multifamily exposure
and how you're feeling about that right now given how strong it's been recently for the industry?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: So Jenny, I'll ask John Asbury to speak to that very quickly.
<A - John C. Asbury>: Hi, Jennifer. Good morning. So as Grayson and David indicated, I would definitely describe
the demand by industry as being pretty broad based. Energy is probably still among the best, but it's not dominating it.
And there's really no clear kind of one, two, three that are driving most of the growth at this point. So it is pretty broad
based. You know, materials, commercial services, supplies, center retailing, very encouraging sign to see that sort of
diversification by industry type. And as Grayson said, also seeing a pretty good spread geographically.
In terms of multi-family, we continue to watch a lot of new construction activity within multi-family. We do believe
that the fundamentals for multi-family remain strong, and we think that there is room for what is going in and as what
is on the books. Having said that, we watch very carefully the markets for evidence of overbuilding, including the
sub-markets.
One thing I will add that's also an encouraging sign is, as we look at new IRE commitments, for Q1 multi-family was
just about 30% of total new IRE commitments, and that's good. It used to be with most of the IRE construction we were
financing – or providing was being dominated by multi-families. So we're now seeing much more diversification by
product type, which is also a healthy sign.
<A - Barbara Godin>: Jennifer, it's Barb Godin. Our actual multi-family outstandings are down on a year-over-year
basis.
<A - John C. Asbury>: Right
<A - Barbara Godin>: From $2.3 billion down to $1.6 billion. So again we're being very careful as to what we're
putting into that asset class.

Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions; I guess we've just reached afternoon. But
one question for you, Grayson, in terms of capital return, obviously you exited the CCAR process this year with a
positive result, I think, in most people's minds. How should we think about two issues, one, moving to a dividend
payout ratio that's much closer to the 30% line in the sand the regulators have provided? And the pace of your
buybacks, your $300 million buyback program, over the next four quarters? Should we just assume that's going to be
even, or is there some other way you all are thinking about it?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well I'd tell you that first of all we were very pleased to get a favorable response to our
capital plan recommendations, and are positioning ourselves to be able to execute those plans over the next several
months. If we sort of look at the progress we've made as a company over the last couple of years in trying to put
ourselves in a position to be able to return more capital to our shareholders, we think we've made good progress.
We have been incrementally increasing our action plans to do that. I think you should anticipate that as our company
continues to incrementally improve our financial results, then we will seek opportunities to incrementally improve our
return to shareholders. It is – as you know, it's a much more disciplined process today, and it's a much more regulated
process, and we're working through that process and trying to demonstrate that we can effectively manage our capital
position. I think that what you saw this year was a very conservative first step on our part, and hopefully over time we
can deliver even better news. I do think that there's opportunities to do that, but we've got to continue to perform. And
that's what we're working hard to do.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. Thank you. And, David, a question for you. You've mentioned several times on the
call your thoughts around debt management, and I certainly appreciate the power that that can have for your net interest
margin. I'd like to take that question in another direction. What thoughts do you have right now in terms of the OLA
and any potential debt issuance you might need to do under that?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, we're continuing to evaluate what that OLA impact will be to the regional space. That's
largely, if you look at some of the letters that have been sent, from Congress in particular, are really leaning towards the
bigger money center banks. But that being said, we understand that we have to consider everything that is out there in
the industry, including how much debt we might need to carry. We are looking for better, clearer guidance as to what
that ultimately would be.
You know, as we have deleveraged ourselves, given where our spreads had traded earlier, we thought was a prudent
thing to do for our shareholders. Our spreads have tightened up nicely; they're obviously never good enough for us, but
we'd like them to be – we're encouraged by where they have moved.
And as we think about how we capitalize the bank, and I'm talking about long-term debt and equity capital, and our
goal is to make that as efficient as possible over the long haul, such that our capital structure is sustainable for any
environment that we may have, whether we're in a low-rate environment or a growth environment. So we obviously
think about that efficiency first, and then we think about whatever regulatory implications there might be from changes.
So to the extent the rules come out and say we need to go in a particular direction, we will adapt and overcome and deal
with it. But right now, we don't have that clear a guidance as to what that means for the absolute debt levels for the
regional bank space.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions, gentlemen.

We have gone a bit over time today. However, we have time for one more question. Your final question comes from
the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Hey, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you. The question I have is regarding the loan loss reserves. You guys mentioned
that you think that the reserves to total loans could fall into that 1.5% to 2% range at some point in the future. Can you
share with us, it seems to me that over the years, the regulators have focused on the reserve methodology based on
classified and criticized loans rather than a GAAP-accounting measure that we all look at, which is reserves to total
loans. Are they still focused on driving or determining your reserve adequacy by the classified and criticized loans? Or
are they moving to this GAAP measure?
<A - David J. Turner>: Gerard, I'll start, and then Matt or Barb can jump in. I would tell you that those are elements
of the same conversation. Obviously criticized and classifieds, you heard in our prepared comments, we think now that
that's disclosed and available to the public, is an important view of what credit quality is at any financial institution. We
use that, which is determined by our internal ratings, as they are at every other bank, as an indicator of what embedded
loss would be based on how those loans migrate through our process. I don't believe the regulators have any stipulated
percentage of criticized and classifieds. That may have been a way they looked at it globally in the past, but I don't
think that's what they're getting at today. I think they're looking for all of us to have a robust process, that's documented
and repeatable, that provides both our shareholders and to them, as our regulators, what an appropriate allowance
should be.
What happens is the coverage ratios, we compare those among peers just to give us an indication as to how we shake
out. But one should be very careful about comparing peer ratios because we all have different loan books. We're in
different geographies, different loan types. And I think that what you ought to look at is how is our loan credit quality
migrating from quarter to quarter, which will give you a better indication of what our ultimate reserving needs to be.
<A - Barbara Godin>: Well said.
<A - C. Matthew Lusco>: Great.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: And then the second question has to do with return on equity. I know you guys provided us
with the return on tangible common equity for the period, but whether you use that ratio or a stated return on equity,
which we calculated to be in the 8% range this quarter, if you had to choose one or two metrics that will drive that ratio
– the return on equity numbers – higher, which would then I think suggest your stock price could exceed stated book
value at some point in the future, is it your loan to deposit ratio? Is it interest rates going up 200 basis points? Is it a
lower efficiency ratio? Better credit quality? I know all of the above will help, but if you had to pick one or two items
that really will drive that ROE higher to get the stock valuation higher, what two would you guys choose?
<A - David J. Turner>: Would you – I'd like to start with net income, be kind of a good one.
<A - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay.
<A - David J. Turner>: I think that, I think then underneath that is probably what your question is, in what really will
drive your income higher? And I'm talking absolute dollars. And so, as Grayson mentioned, and I tried to support that,
for us growing our revenue base is important. And when you are essentially a spread bank, 63% of our revenue being in
NII, you think about what changes there. So you think of liability management; you think about optimizing the left side
of the balance sheet, more loans versus securities, growing earning assets, in particular in loans, which is what we're all
about. So getting our NII up and getting our resulting margin close to what it had been in the past, which was in that
3.35% to 3.50% range.

Okay, you think of NII and what can grow that revenue, and you think of adding new customers and new products and
services. So you've seen that come out of Regions quarter after quarter, and we will continue to stay focused on that.
So really, Gerard, for us, to get the kind of returns that we would all be happy with is really about growing our revenue
base. And of course, we all recognize we're challenged in a low-growth environment; so while we're here we're going
to do the things I just talked about while prudently managing our expenses such that we generate positive operating
leverage, such that we can have a reasonable return to our shareholders until one day that the rate environment changes.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Thank you.
