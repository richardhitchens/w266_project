Marillyn A. Hewson
Thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. All of us here hope that your
year is off to a good start. Let me begin by saying that I am extraordinarily proud of our Lockheed Martin team. We've
continued to maintain focus and achieve strong program and financial performance in a challenging environment.
These efforts enabled the corporation to generate exceptional operational and financial results in 2013 and have us well
positioned for 2014.
While Bruce will cover the financial results in detail a little later, I want to highlight a few noteworthy 2013 financial
achievements from my perspective. Starting with new business. I was particularly pleased with our continued success
in securing new order bookings from both domestic and international customers. These new contract awards enabled
our year-end 2013 backlog to grow to a record level of almost $83 billion. Even more impressively, 2013 marks the
fourth consecutive year we have grown our backlog in a very challenging and competitive environment.
I was also pleased that the international component of our backlog grew to approximately $20 billion, representing
almost 25% of our total backlog. This has us well positioned to achieve our stated goal of expanding international
revenues to over 20% of total corporate revenues in the next few years.
This backlog expansion is aided by two strategic differentiators. First, we continue to believe our portfolio is the best
positioned in the sector, with unique and direct alignment to many of the essential programs identified by both
domestic and international customers. Second, our corporate-wide focus on fostering and expanding customer
relationships directed at how we may best support their critical needs continues to play a pivotal role in securing our
new business awards for our innovative and cost-effective products. Our strong and growing backlog consisting of
multiple years of prior fiscal appropriations driven by our longer-cycle production programs provides strategic
differentiation and a financial foundation of future work.
Another area of noteworthy achievement is our segment operating margin. Outstanding program performance resulted
in segment operating margin expansion to a record level of 12.7%, an increase of 90 basis points above the 2012 level
and marks the third consecutive year of margin expansion. Even more importantly, this performance was broad based,
with all five business areas exceeding or maintaining their 2012 margin levels.
Margin expansion opportunities are expected to emerge in the future as our program portfolio expands in international
programs, plus a transition from the current 50/50 mix of development versus production programs to a higher portion
of production work, as key development programs such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Littoral Combat Ship, THAAD
missile defense system, and satellite programs mature. I know our leadership team is up to the challenge of delivering
on the commitments we have made to our customers with respect to these important and growing production programs.
Another area where we have been successful and which remains a strategic focus is generating robust cash flow. Our
ability to deliver consistently strong cash flows continues to be a differentiator for our corporation. In 2013, we
generated over $4.5 billion in operating cash after making approximately $2.3 billion in pension contributions. Our
strong and increasing cash flow enables us to invest prudently in the future of the corporation in areas such as research
and development and capital expenditures, while simultaneously executing our cash deployment strategy of returns to
shareholders in the areas of dividends and share repurchases. In 2013, we returned over $3.3 billion to shareholders
through dividends and share repurchases, reflecting the return of almost 90% of our annual free cash flow to
stockholders.
Looking forward, our future cash flows are expected to remain strong. Cash flows will be aided by higher pension
recoveries, plus increasing levels of customer advances from higher international work content. Our focus on cash
generation and the potential for continued strong and increasing cash flows is expected to position the corporation to
differentiate us from competitors in value creation and returns to shareholders.
Looking outside the corporation, I wanted to briefly turn to the status of government budgets. Since we last spoke in
October, congressional budget deliberations were completed on full appropriations bills for fiscal year 2014. These
efforts resulted in finalization of the detailed spending bill necessary to fund the government for the remainder of fiscal

year 2014, and the president signed the bill into law last week.
This law sets new spending targets for DoD and civil government agencies. It restores a portion of the sequestration
cuts for the next two fiscal years and brings a measure of near-term fiscal stability that should improve the ability of
our customers and our corporation to plan for the future due to more certainty in budget planning and program funding.
Under this law, sequestration is eliminated for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and replaced with reduced spending levels.
The law also removed the across-the-board spending reduction methodology previously in place under sequestration
and restored the ability for government agencies to move funds and discreetly allocate resources to higher priority
areas, a critical revision that we have been seeking since the Budget Control Act was established back in 2011.
DoD-based budgets for fiscal year 2014 and 2015 were established at approximately $500 billion per year, a level
roughly flat with the fiscal year 2013. While we have not yet seen the specific budget allocations by program, we
continue to believe that our portfolio of products will be well supported in a strategically focused allocation of budget
resources.
These recent budget actions are a welcome first step in the creation of a more measured and strategic approach to
dealing with the nation's fiscal challenges. Until sequestration is eliminated, long-term uncertainty remains. Thus, we
will continue to add our voice to those seeking long-term solutions to national budgetary pressures while working to
eliminate sequestration as law.
Finally, I want to provide some insight into the announcement this past quarter that we will close certain of our
operations, principally those located in Newtown, Pennsylvania; Akron, Ohio; and Goodyear, Arizona, as well as
consolidate our facility footprint at our Sunnyvale, California campus. These decisions are part of our continued
affordability initiative and follow a detailed review of our current facilities' capacity and future workload projections.
The important work being performed at these sites will transition to other Lockheed Martin facilities, with closures of
these sites to be complete by mid-2015.
In 2013, we reduced overhead costs, cut capital expenses, and removed 2.1 million square feet of facility space. These
new actions will reduce further our facility footprint to nearly 2.5 million square feet – by nearly 2.5 million square feet
and lower overhead costs. Although such decisions are extremely difficult because of their impact on our employees
and the communities in which they live, we will continue to take proactive actions when required to address our
customers' challenges and remain competitive in the marketplace.
I'll now ask Bruce to go through some of the details of our 2013 financial performance and our 2014 financial
guidance, and then we'll open up the line for your questions.
Bruce L. Tanner
Thank you, Marillyn, and good afternoon, everyone. As usual, we have included web charts with our earnings release
today that I'll be referencing as I go through my remarks. Let's start with chart three and an overview of last year's
results.
Sales for the year were $45.4 billion, a little higher than we expected, benefiting from a stronger-than-planned fourth
quarter. Segment operating margin was a record level of 12.7%, exceeding last year's record level by 90 basis points.
Our earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.04 exceeded $9 for the first time and included the effects of
two special charges in the fourth quarter, which I'll discuss in more detail in a few charts.
Cash from operations was also stronger than we had it outlooked, helped by collections late in 2013 that had been
expected in 2014. This enabled us to generate $4.5 billion for the year, while contributing an additional $750 million in
the fourth quarter to our pension plan, bringing the total amount of contributions for the year to $2.25 billion.
And finally, we ended the year with a strong quarter for orders, increasing our backlog to $82.6 billion, the highest
level in our history.

So I'm pleased with a very strong year of operational performance.
Chart four compares our sales and segment operating profit in 2013 versus 2012. Sales were 4% lower than last year,
but were slightly higher than we had guided in the third quarter. Segment operating profit, on the other hand, was 3%
higher than last year despite the lower sales level and was higher than the top of the guidance we've provided in the
third quarter, driven by stronger performance in Missiles and Fire Control.
Chart five shows our segment operating margins by each of the five business areas compared with last year's results.
Segment margins were comparable to last year's levels in two of our business areas and higher than last year in three
business areas.
Missiles and Fire Control continued its strong performance in 2013, with each of its lines of business having higher
margin in 2013 than in 2012. Mission Systems and Training also had a significant improvement over 2012 due to
strong overall performance and a successful resolution of contractual matters, including two associated with the
presidential helicopter program in the year.
Space Systems exceeded last year's record margin level, with improved performance across the portfolio and higher
equity earnings from the United Launch Alliance joint venture. Aeronautics margins were comparable to last year, with
improved performance from multiple lines of business helping to offset the diluted effects of additional F-35 volume.
And IS&GS ended the year at the same margin as in 2012 and now has 12 consecutive quarters of 9% or higher
margin.
Chart six is where we'll discuss the special charges that impacted the fourth quarter. As it is our practice, in the fourth
quarter, we evaluated the goodwill on the balance sheet for any impairment. And this quarter, our technical services
business from Missiles and Fire Control was found to have a lower fair value than its book value, resulting in a $195
million non-cash charge to earnings or $0.54 per share. This impairment reflects an ongoing reduction in the level of
sales that technical services has generated in the past few years, as well as lowered expectations for the future.
We're experiencing a heightened level of competitive bidding and awards, which seem to place less relevance on past
performance and discriminating attributes and more on simply lower cost. This charge reflects our belief that this
behavior will continue into the future.
We performed similar impairment test for the remaining goodwill in the books and have no other reporting units that
we believe are at risk of a goodwill charge at this time. Our other special charge in the quarter was for planned head
count reductions that affected several business areas.
In November of last year, we filed an 8-K, which announced restructuring activities at Space Systems, MST, and
IS&GS that included $171 million in severance charges or about $0.34 per share. This amount does not include facility
and other related charges of about $200 million that will occur in future periods. In our guidance charts coming up, I'll
explain how the financial impact of the restructure is reflected in our 2014 guidance and how we expect to recover the
vast majority of these costs in the future.
Moving to chart seven, we'll review our 2013 earnings per share. We increased earnings per share by 8% on a GAAP
basis and nearly 15% excluding the impact of the goodwill charge in the fourth quarter. On a pension adjusted basis
and also excluding the goodwill charge, our EPS grew to $10.49 for the year.
On chart eight, we'll discuss our cash return to shareholders in the year. Our free cash flow for the year was $3.7
billion, reflecting $4.5 billion in cash from operations and about $800 million in capital expenditures. And with
dividends of $1.5 billion and share repurchases of $1.8 billion, we returned 89% of our free cash flow back to
shareholders in the year.
Chart nine shows our backlog performance for the past five years. We've increased backlog each year since 2009 to the
current record level of $82.6 billion. While we said throughout the year that we thought backlog at the end of 2013 will
be close to where we started the year, there were a number of large moving pieces that enabled us to reach this level,
the most significant being a large order for NASA's Orion program that provides several years of funding rather than
the recent trend of funding annual spend plans. Our orders in the quarter were slightly more than $15 billion, meaning

over $30 billion of our $45 billion or so of 2013 orders came in the second half of the year.
On chart 10, we provide some of the key assumptions embedded in our 2014 guidance. First, our FAS/CAS pension
adjustment provides nearly $350 million of income in 2014 compared with $150 million we discussed during the last
call. The adjustment is higher as our asset return was higher than we anticipated in October, and we also contributed an
additional $750 million to the pension trust in the fourth quarter. 2014 represents the first time since the financial crisis
of 2008 that we expect to have both FAS/CAS income and positive cash from pension as recoveries are expected to
exceed contributions.
Next, we've not assumed the benefits from any extension of the R&D tax credit. This is obviously a change from 2013
when we had the benefits of two years of credits worth over $0.20 per share.
And finally, we assumed a flat share count for the year, with share repurchases offsetting the effects of new issuances
and option exercises. Inherent within that assumption is over $1 billion in repurchases, and as usual, we'll continue to
be opportunistic in repurchase activity.
Chart 11 provides our outlook for 2014. We're providing orders in our outlook this year for the first time. We always
discuss our expectation for backlog during this call and thought it'd be helpful to give you our expectation for the order
side of the backlog equation. This year, we're expecting orders of between $41.5 billion and $43 billion, which, when
compared with our sales outlook, would indicate that backlog should remain above the $80 billion level this year.
Similar to last year, we have several large orders, which, depending on when they are closed, could impact our ending
backlog level for the year. In particular, we expect to finalize a C-130J multi-year order for 79 U.S. aircraft worth more
than $5 billion in the fourth quarter of this year. But should it slip to the right, it'd be difficult to achieve that $80 billion
backlog amount.
Sales are expected to be slightly better than we indicated in October as a result of the higher orders received in 2013
and the recent budget agreement. Segment profit and operating profit are expected to be the same this year with the
FAS/CAS adjustment and our other unallocated expenses offsetting each other.
Margin at the midpoint of our sales and segment profit guidance is 11.7%, slightly higher than we indicated in October,
and this includes the 2014 impacts of our restructuring activities, which were not included in our October trend
information.
Earnings per share is expected to be in the $10.25 to $10.55 range, and cash from operations is expected to be greater
than or equal to $4.6 billion, higher than what we generated in 2013 even with the cash receipts that moved into 2013
from 2014 and the restructure impacts in 2014. And we have planned contributions of $1 billion into our pension plans
for the year.
Chart 12 provides our sales and segment profit guidance ranges for each of the business areas. Aeronautics is expected
to grow sales to up to the mid-single digits over the 2013 amount as a result of the F-35 production growth. In 2014, the
F-35 program is expected to be as large or larger than any of our other four business areas. Mission Systems and
Training and Missiles and Fire Control are expected to be fairly comparable to their sales level in 2013, while both
IS&GS and Space Systems are expected to have lower sales in 2014 than 2013.
For segment operating profit, Aeronautics profit is expected to be higher than 2014 with slightly lower margins than in
2013. IS&GS' profit will follow the lower sales volume. And Missiles and Fire Control's profit is expected to be
slightly lower in 2014, as some of the performance improvements that were achieved in the fourth quarter of last year
had been expected to occur in 2014.
Mission Systems and Training and Space Systems both deserve a little more discussion. MST is expected to have lower
margin on essentially comparable sales for two reasons. First, the significant benefit from the contract resolutions
associated with the presidential helicopter program in 2013 will not repeat in 2014, and the 2014 impacts of the
restructuring charges announced in November will also cause the margin to be lower. For Space Systems, we expect
lower equity earnings this year compared with last year and will also experience the effects of the 2014 facility and
other charges related to the restructuring announced in November.

Without these charges in 2014, we project that margins for MST and Space Systems would be around 11% and 12%,
respectively, in line with what we said in October. On the next chart, we'll describe these restructuring impacts in more
detail.
So turning to chart 13. In addition to the $171 million severance charge taken last year, we expect around $200 million
of facilities-related charges to be recorded in segment operating results throughout 2014 and 2015 as we complete the
consolidation activities, and these impacts to profit and cash flow are included in the guidance we're providing today.
These charges reduce Space Systems and MST's 2014 segment operating profit by $55 million and $25 million,
respectively, net of recoveries or about $0.16 of earnings per share and reduces operating cash flow by around $150
million, mostly as a result of severance payments to be made this year.
We would expect a significantly lower impact to segment operating profit and operating cash flow in 2015 as we begin
to see additional recovery of the restructuring charges in our contract pricing, and we would expect to recover the vast
majority of both the severance and facility-related charges in 2016 and beyond.
We'll now turn to our summary on chart 14. 2013 was a terrific year of operational performance by the company, led to
outstanding value increases for our shareholders, and gives us the solid foundation as we begin 2014. We like where we
have positioned our portfolio of products and services, and we're hopeful that we'll see the benefits of greater budget
stability going forward.
I think with that, Shannon, we're ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. You may begin.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Thank you. Good afternoon.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Doug.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Hello.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I'm interested in your discussion of the international orders, and if you could give a
description of what the regional mix of your bookings has been in 2013. And then in particular, there's been a lot of
strong rhetoric coming out of the Middle East and some has been critical of U.S. policies in the region. I'm interested in
understanding, are you seeing a slowing in the completion of contracts there? Certainly, there's been approvals for a lot
of potential sales to that region, but it's appeared you haven't really seen the commensurate amount of orders, I'd say,
across the industry. So perhaps you could comment on that.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, Doug, I'll take the first part, and I think Marillyn is probably better for the second half
of the equation. So I'm trying to think, Doug, off the top of my head, I'm not sure I've got the numbers committed to
memory, frankly, for what it is by region, so I'll give kind of a broad-brush answer there. I would say I did take a look
at [ph] those. I think (24:06) 2013, we had the highest order of concept for international activity we've had in the
history of the corporation. And as Marillyn said in her opening remarks, I think our backlog right now in terms of
international versus domestic is somewhere between 23% to 25% of our total backlog.
So one of the reasons we've tried to tee up the notion that we could grow our international sales from 17% to 20% is
because we expected to see that backlog materialize in the form of those orders as they are received, and we'll start to
see. We ended the year 2013 with 17% of our sales internationally. You'll see that number grow is our expectation in
2014, probably not quite to the 20%, but a little bit below that is our expectation.
If I was to give sort of the regional split in 2014, I think it's heavily weighted towards Asia and the Middle East, Doug.
Although, I don't have the split there. I know we've got a number of orders that took place in our Aeronautics business,

including some C-130 for Saudi Arabia. We had a couple of 18 aircrafts for Iraq for F-16. So while I don't have, again,
the numbers committed to memory, I'm pretty certain, Doug, it would be heavily weighted towards Asia and the
Middle East.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Doug, I'll add on to that about your question relative to U.S. policies and is that slowing
down the completion of contracts and how it's affecting our delay in sales around the world. Over the past year, I mean,
I've literally flown around the world to a lot of different locations and spent a lot of time meeting with customers and
listening to them. And frankly, what they're looking for is for our help. They face a lot of serious challenges relative to
their national security, and they also have a lot of citizen services that they need to conduct. And so, they are talking to
us about specific areas of concern and things that we can help them with.
So I don't see an impact of U.S. policies on the dialogue that I'm having with them from the standpoint of our portfolio
and what we can provide to them. And our priority, for me and for the leadership team, is that we get out and we listen
and we meet with them and we understand what it is that they want and need. And, frankly, we're very confident that
we're well positioned for growth because of the items that Bruce talked about, but just in general, our portfolio, the
tactical aircraft that we have, the airlift mobility aircraft, our integrated air and missile defense, IT, cyber security,
space situational awareness. I mean, I could walk you around our portfolio. These are the types of things that they need
in their countries.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. You may begin.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good afternoon.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Sam.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Hey.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Hi. Bruce, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the cash flow. I know
you mentioned receivable collections in the fourth quarter, but I'm just trying to look at 2013 to 2014. If you have $600
million more in cash reimbursements than the contributions and you're going to make less contributions in general, why
wouldn't cash from ops be higher than the $4.6 billion? I'm trying to think about what is actually going against you
whether it's taxes, receivables, et cetera in 2014 versus 2013.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. No, very perceptive question, Sam. So I think we had nearly a $800 million use of
cash, if you will, for pensions in 2013. And with $1.6 billion in recoveries and $1 billion of contributions, we're looking
at about a $600 million of positive cash in 2014. So roughly a $1.4 billion swing. I think that's at the heart of your
question, why isn't that showing up in terms of cash differential between 2013 and 2014. So there's a lot of moving
pieces to that question.
Recall in the fourth quarter of 2012, we made a $2.5 billion pension contribution. The tax benefits of that pension
contribution showed up in the first quarter of 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we made a $750 million pension
contribution. The tax benefits of that show up in the first quarter of 2014. That's almost a $600-plus million, I think,
swing from just a taxes paid perspective for just the pension contributions made in 2012 and 2013 that affected tax paid
in 2013 and 2014 if you follow that.
Secondly, we had – and you've heard about this and we've disclosed this in our 10-Q and 10-Ks, we had some
withholds associated with the business systems rules for systems like earned value management and some others. And
almost all of the withholds associated with those activities were recovered in the year 2013, and those won't be
replicated obviously in 2014.
We have the LRIP 5 and LRIP 6 contract definitizations for F-35 that occurred in 2013 that brought with it sort of some
catch-up cash for the definitization associated with those two contracts that again will not occur in 2014. We had lower
joint venture cash – or expecting lower joint venture cash in 2014 than 2013 in part because of just lower volume, but

there was also some reimbursement items that the JV contributed to the parents in 2013 that won't replicate in 2014.
And finally, we've got the roughly $150 million or so of restructured cash that's associated with the severance payments
that we'll be making in 2014 that are higher than obviously made in 2013.
So I know that was a mouthful and there was a lot of moving pieces there, but that's sort of the lion's share, if you will,
of why that pension cash swing doesn't translate necessarily to even higher cash in 2014.

Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Loomis of Stifel. You may begin.
<Q - Bill R. Loomis>: Hi. Thank you. Just going back to the goodwill write-down in technical services, can you tell us
either what acquisition in the past that was related to or the type of work? And are you seeing – starting – I know you
didn't have any goodwill write-downs in other areas, but are these trends impacting any other businesses? And then just
a follow-on question on the $30 million charge for lower of cost or market considerations, if you can explain that a
little more? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Sure. So, Bill, I'll take those as well. So the goodwill, once you start moving some of the
businesses associated with the goodwill into different reporting units in the corporation, unfortunately you kind of lose
the track of the original business area in terms of where that goodwill resided. And those businesses have been, I'll say,
reorganized over the past few years, so it's very difficult to kind of pinpoint sort of the original origin of the goodwill
itself.
The type of businesses that this was acquired for are services businesses, as the name implies, technical services. Think
of that as a lot of in-country support of the troops. So aircraft maintenance, actually, some aircraft piloting, vehicle
maintenance that sort of thing, mostly Army in nature. I think about three quarters of this business or so is probably
U.S. Army-based. And as we've seen the reductions in troop drawdown in particular in Iraq and most recently in
Afghanistan, the revenue volume of this business has dropped off fairly dramatically. And again, that's sort of what our
expectations are going forward as well.
So let's see, I think the other question was on – well I should back up. You asked a question about, how does this
translate my words now? How does this translate to other businesses? As I said in the prepared remarks, we do do an
annual impairment assessment at the end of every year. And the types of contracts that are in tech services, some of
those types of contracts are in other parts of the business. I think as we sit here today, as I said in my remarks, we have
clearance right now and we're not, at this time, concerned about another or being at risk of a goodwill impairment
going forward. That's what the plans and expectations that we have in the long range plan that we put together every
year today. So if that turns out to be different, we will revisit that next year.
And finally, the $30 million, as far as the cost to market, we took a look at some inventory that we had on some of our
contracts and just assessed it as being work not worth as much as we had anticipated in some of our training and
logistics businesses. And I think it's a little bit reflective of just the way the market is playing out for us right there right
now.

<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hey, guys. Just a quick clarification from you, Bruce, on the cash. I was wondering – you
went through all the puts and takes. I was wondering if you could just briefly talk about potential opportunities that you
see that would lead to upside in cash. And then, Marillyn, the rest of the question for me is on the portfolio and whether
you feel that you've got the right mix of portfolio companies and businesses and what your view is on portfolio shaping
given the current demand environment as you see it over the next couple of years?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: So Jason, I'm assuming you're asking upsides for cash in 2014 versus, say, over time. I think
we have probably typical planning convention, especially when we do some of our international contracts, we tend to
have assumptions of maybe less advances, less positive cash flows in our planning, then perhaps we actually end up
negotiating. I hope that's the case again this year. We obviously have some contracts – some fairly large contracts we
hope to definitize. I'd like to think we could get some of the billing arrangements on those contracts that's slightly better
terms than we have in our planning.
And that's been our history, frankly. I think we've been good at doing that and sort of improving our cash flow
throughout the year. I think the whole organization from sort of the business side, the program management side, all
has that as an objective, and that's something that we strive for very hard. So while not obviously embedded in the
numbers, I think that's something that we look at very earnestly at every opportunity to improve the cash terms we have
going forward, and I assure you we will do that throughout the rest of the year, and we'll keep your apprised of our
progress in the next three quarters.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: And I could just speak to portfolio, Jason. Your question around do we have the right mix
and what are we looking at over the next few years, I would say, if we just look at how we built the backlog over the
last four years, that demonstrates the strength of our portfolio in recent years. And as you look at the situation with the
domestic budget – with the U.S. budget and our portfolio and the ability for our customers now to be able to focus on
their priorities, I think we're well aligned. I'm very happy with our portfolio.
It looks like it will be well supported in the budget. And we know that we have strong demand internationally for our
missile defense, for tactical aircraft, air mobility, the whole range of our primary platforms that we offer. Even, we're
looking at opportunities for the Littoral Combat Ship variant, as well as the range of services businesses within IT and
cyber security and the communications areas.
So I'm very happy with the portfolio. I think we're in very good shape for the next few years. And we'll continue, as we
always do, to access it and adjust it as we need to. But at this point, I think it looks very good.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Safran of Buckingham Research. You may begin.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Thanks. Good afternoon.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: I wanted to ask the capital deployment question. Look, at one point, I think you were
looking at a possible mix shift maybe between dividends and share buybacks. For 2014, are you still remaining
committed to the dividend increases? Any thought here on consideration on M&A? Just looking for any update on how
you're thinking and what is really what I'm interested in here.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Thanks, Rich. Well, I'm not quite ready obviously to declare a dividend increase. We
meet as a matter of course every September with the board of directors, so that's when we discuss potential dividend
increases, and that will be the pattern we do this year.
So we've been obviously pretty heavy on the dividend increase the past [ph] few years. (38:02) I like to think that we
have the fire power to kind of continue to do that going forward. When you look at the cash flow that we generated last
year, the cash flow this year, and our expectations of recovery of pension contributions, in particular, in additional to
the normal operating cash flow in years to come, I think that gives us the opportunity at least to do that.

So we gave guidance – or embedded in our guidance this year was a little over $1 billion, more than $1 billion of share
repurchases. That's just to offset a dilution of share count. And you should think about – I may get these numbers
slightly wrong, but I know I'm pretty close here. So we've got roughly 9 million to 10 million shares outstanding at the
end of – I should say options outstanding at the end of 2013. We have roughly $10 million options exercised in the year
2013.
We kind of assumed a lower level than that in 2014, think about maybe half of that or a little less, and combined with,
I'll say, normal matching in our 401(k) plan, which we do through share count matching. And our executive
compensation is probably another 3 million shares or so. So it's probably 8 million. I may have the number slightly
wrong, but I think I'm pretty close. 8 million shares, $150 million of shares, it's probably like $1.2 billion or so on share
repurchases. We will offset any share count dilution that's caused by any additional options that are exercised above
that level. And then, as I said in my opening remarks, we will try to be opportunistic throughout the year for additional
share repurchases beyond that.
On the M&A side, we're constantly looking at that. We don't – and obviously, we're not going to comment on anything
until we've actually closed on a deal, but that's – it's always a possibility. I think we've been successful with the strategy
we used in the past. I don't see any [ph] student body list (40:13) that would change that strategy going forward, and
that's probably about as much as I can say on that right now, Rich.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You
may begin.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Yeah. Hey, good afternoon.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Ron.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: First, just wanted to try to better understand the estimate at completion, the EAC, whatever
you want to call it, balance that you guys get, right? So just kind of looking historically, last year, it was almost half of
your EBIT. And when I look at your peer companies, just General Dynamics, Raytheon, Northrop, how sustainable is
that? How do we think about the EACs over time? And just – if you can just give us some more color on that. I mean, I
guess what I worry about is if that gap were to start to close what's that mean, why is it so high now, that kind of thing.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Well, thanks, Ron. Good questions. So I think if you look at our historical – first off,
let me comment, I think you're higher – at the level of profit adjustments as a percentage of the total earnings than what
we really experienced. So last year, I just looked at this not too long ago, we were around 36% or so, I believe, the total
earnings of segment EBIT – excuse me, not total earnings, but segment EBIT was in the form of the profit adjustments.
That's not sort of out of family with what we experienced on sort of a steady-state basis.
I mean, I look – as I look forward to the planned level of 2014 adjustments, it's not far off of that number. I'll tell you
almost every year, when we had a good year, obviously, that number grows from our initial plan. And I sure hope that
that's what happens this year as well.
So I don't know exactly how to compare us with everyone else, Ron. I suspect we have different sort of philosophies as
far as starting positions, on booking profit, on contracts. Everyone has their different life cycle in their own portfolio as
far as whether they're way down the learning curve and have any new development or concurrent development going
on with production that would suggest maybe starting a lighter booking rate. Some folks are further down, selling only
international activities where you will have a pretty good idea what your product's costs by that point in time. You can
probably start off looking at a higher profit level, which would make you have lower step-ups, lower profit
adjustments. I think ours is more comparable to us as opposed to anyone else. And I don't see an issue at the levels

Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Arment of Sterne Agee. You may begin.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yes. Good afternoon, Marillyn and Bruce. Bruce, Could you give us an update on kind of the
skyline of how the F-16 and the C-130 are looking out? Obviously, you mentioned the C-130 in terms of domestic
order potentially coming. But what else does it look like? You've got two very mature platforms here that seem to be
trending down in volumes and affecting the mix shift here in margin.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Good question, Peter. So actually, I think calendar year 2014, we're actually going to
see an increase in the deliveries of F-16s compared to what we delivered last year. So in 2013, we delivered 13 F-16s. I
would expect it will be north of 15, maybe 16, 17 aircraft delivery in the year. Our C-130 program – and I should say
those deliveries will probably go back to, I think, probably in the one per month level for a couple of years. But I think
our backlog on the F-16 program today is through 2000 – I'm trying to do this from memory, 2016, 2017, somewhere
in that range. I'll get that number before the call – before we're off from the call.
The C-130 delivery, we did 25 last year. We've kind of said that the rate we'll be building C-130s at going forward is
[ph] 24 a month. (44:42) I'm real confident, particularly when you talk about the addition of multi-year aircraft at the
levels we've talked about. Again, 79 aircrafts is what the – just the U.S. buy us on that multi-year program. And that's
going to enable us to continue with that 24 aircraft per year level for quite a while.
And I just remembered that I think the F-16 deliveries right now go out to almost the end of 2017. And again, you
should think about there's probably one aircraft per month for the F-16 and roughly two aircrafts a month for the C-130
for sort of that period through that timeframe.

Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. You may begin.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Marillyn, congratulations on a good, very solid first year. My
question is to you. I was wondering if you could maybe give your impressions on maybe a couple of things you learned
about the company that maybe you didn't know a year ago, or your impressions after your first year? And then perhaps
more importantly going into your second year, what are a couple of goals that you have that are specific to 2014 for
Lockheed Martin that – be more specific than just meeting our financial goals and that sort of thing, but what you really
want to get done this year.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, thanks for the compliment there, Joe. I mean, that's a team sport in this company, so
great credit goes to entire team for what I would consider exceptional performance for the year. It has been a very
strong year. And I think what we did in the past year is really position ourselves for continued success, and a lot of
work that the team has done or has been very proactive in strengthening our core business and our international
business.
We've rolled out what we call Lockheed Martin International, which is a leadership focus and resource focus at the
enterprise level to grow our international business. We already do a lot of business internationally in over 70 countries,
but we want to put a concerted focus on that from an enterprise view and bring the full depth and breadth and strength
of our portfolio to the international marketplace. So that is something we initiated in the middle of 2013, and that will
be one of the imperatives that we'll be focused on as we move forward in 2014 and beyond.
Another thing that we initiated in a great way, we've been on this path, but we took it to another level with our
proactive steps in streamlining our operations and improving our cost structure. And as Bruce went through, we
announced several things in the fourth quarter. We've been on that path, but we took it to another level of looking at our

capacity utilization relative to what we see as our workload and making sure that we remain competitive and have that
competitive position as we continue to grow in the future.
And then, the third element that we've been focusing inside and outside the corporation on is our view of being a
technology leader and our innovation. We talked about it as innovation with purpose because it's – the missions that we
support in our company are what attract people to Lockheed Martin to work in this company because we do some of
the most important work in the world. But it's work that involves very interesting and complex solutions that we bring
to customers, which means a lot of innovation and invention that our company does. And we're going to stay focused
on delivering those innovative solutions to what are the needs of our customers today, but also as we look at what their
needs are for tomorrow. So continuing to invest in research and development and continuing to keep a climate for our
workforce where they – it's an innovative culture that continues to focus on that.
As I said earlier, I think we've got the right portfolio in the business in terms of meeting our customers' needs. We'll
constantly look at keeping that portfolio relevant, continuing to invest in the things that we think our customers are
going to need. So being that leading technology provider of – doing everything from fighting cyber criminals to the
fifth generation fighter that's addressing unique needs around the world.
So my focus as we continue forward as a company is that we're going to continue our strategy that has been working,
focused on our core and international business and deliver those innovations, while at the same time, maintaining a
focus on affordability and streamlining our operations.
The last thing I would add is that we have a strong focus on making sure that we're listening to our customers and that
we are actively engaged with them on an ongoing basis so that as their needs change and as they face additional
complexities, whether it's budget pressures or global security challenges, that we understand what their needs are and
that we're there listening to help address those needs with the products and capabilities that we can bring forward.

Thank you. Our next question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. You may begin.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey. Good afternoon, and good quarter.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Thank you.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Marillyn, I want to ask about something sort of bigger picture. I think you've mentioned now
the quality of the portfolio. I think you mentioned it a couple of times in your prepared remarks and in your response to
several of the questions so far. Just seem to pick up on that as sort of a theme, and I wondered if you might elaborate on
that and specifically on how you think the performance differentials between you and your peers might actually play
out over the coming years, and how you think about balancing that fine line between what has been a pretty
cost-focused and affordability-focused strategy to perhaps one that's more revenue-focused and perhaps
technology-focused, as you just mentioned. Is there a – am I catching a sort of shift in how you're thinking about
running the business relative to maybe the way your competitors are thinking? Anything to elaborate there would be
helpful.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Sure. Thanks for the question. Well, I don't think you should sense a major shift in our
strategy. I mean, we have a strategy that we've been working on relative to our core business. This is where we are
going to market as we look at what's happening in the domestic business and budget, it's going to be flat for the next
couple of years. So we recognize in order for us to maintain and hopefully grow our business is to align with where our
customers are, have the budgets and have the needs for our products, which is in the pivot to Asia, as well as in the
Middle East. So a lot of the things that we offer in those regions is because that's where the demand is and actually,
that's where U.S. government services are focusing, and that's a good integration where we can bring our products and
capability.

Relative to the portfolio, I mean, I think if you just step back and look at – let's begin with the Joint Strike Fighter, the
F-35, that's a very significant element of our portfolio. It is one that represents 16% of our revenue in 2013, and it's
going to continue to grow. We've got the eight international partners. We have security cooperation partners with Israel
and Japan. We have other countries that are looking at it, with South Korea, with Singapore, with others that I think
will – that are interested in the Middle East that have expressed their interests. So I still see that as something that is a
differentiator for us because no one else has a fifth generation fighter, and it's a unique capability that is needed around
the world.
At the same time, the F-16, as Bruce was talking about the backlog, I mean, F-16, there's still a strong demand for the
F-16 around the world and there are opportunities for upgrades. We're doing the upgrades in Taiwan, opportunities in
Singapore, and we'll see other opportunities there. So that piece of our business continues.
Missile defense, in that arena with THAAD, PAC-3, the Aegis Systems, MEADS and our opportunities for MEADS,
all affordable systems that have the full domain and very strong in terms of air and missile defense, and then the whole
satellite components that come with that as well. Our targeting systems with Sniper, M-TAD, Arrowhead, those are
also continuing to be in-demand around the world; cyber security, C4ISR.
If you just step back and look at this portfolio and the range of capabilities we have and the depth and breadth of it and
experience that we have, I really stand behind the fact I do believe we have the best portfolio, the best positioned
portfolio for the needs today. And we're not going to rest on our laurels. We're going to continue to invest in that
portfolio and continue to keep it relevant and stay abreast of where our customers are moving and invest in
technologies and things that take them forward.
You've probably seen some of the things that we're looking at in terms of longer range opportunities, directed energy,
or advanced capabilities, and manufacturing advance materials in the energy space. So we've got a lot of things that are
more in our adjacent areas or in areas that both in our core and our adjacent that we're going to continue invest in. But
the basic core portfolio that we have is well positioned and I think well supported by the U.S. budget and great demand
internationally.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Carter, the only thing I might add as I'm listening Marillyn there is I think we've got a
really interesting sort of situation where the products that we are developing are not – and that we anticipate the ability
to sell in production, in particular to sell internationally are not long-tenured products. We've got capabilities. We have
some of those as well obviously with C-130 and F-16s, but no one has sort of the current air missile defense products
that we have in terms of MEADs, in terms of Littoral Combat Ships from a naval perspective, in terms of an F-35. So
we're kind of uniquely positioned that a lot of our products are through the developmental cycle, there will be quite a
bit of time before you see new products develop just because there's going to be a delay in new starts with the fiscal
pressures that we're facing. And our portfolio is available now and it's sort of got the good backing of the U.S. Military
behind it. And I think that's got us very uniquely positioned.

<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Noah.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: I don't know if this is for Marillyn or Bruce or both, but it feels to me like one of the bigger
debates in the space right now is if a company like Lockheed Martin can forecast that revenues will be flat in 2014,
despite all of the churn mostly downward in the defense budget. Argument one is that that's largely everything you're
talking about with the portfolio being differentiated versus the industry. Argument two is that that's almost entirely the
lag effect between the decline in authority in 2012 and 2013 and that there's another shoe to drop, if you will, on the top

line in 2015 and 2016. And I know you're only starting to talk about 2014 today officially, but I thought perhaps now
that you have a 2014 budget and some discussion of the 2015 request, maybe a little more insight into the Pentagon
strategy moving forward, if you could shed a little bit more light on which of those you think it is.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: So Noah, I'll take the first shot, and Marillyn can provide some color – commentary on that,
but it's an interesting question. I think it's one that we've talked about ourselves internally as well. And sort of the heart
of your question I think is, so have we bottomed out or not? And you posed two different scenarios there: one is the
value of the portfolio, and then sort of the lag effect of the budget authority.
I do believe, as Marillyn has said quite vividly, that the portfolio that we have is a differentiator. I think that is what's
enabled us to survive without having huge drops year-over-year. I think the part that again people are missing when we
talked about the effects of sequestration and where we are right now is our portfolio pre-sequestration would have been
growing in these periods of times. So we are seeing reductions, but the reductions are taking us back to sort of a flat
scenario as opposed to taking us to a negative growth scenario.
And I get the point, believe me, that our outlook for 2014 is below 2013 and 2013 was below 2012. But going forward
from 2014, 2015 I think we're going to be – hopefully, we've hit the bottom. If not, I think we're very, very close to that
between 2014, 2015.
And if you just take a look at the budget agreement that was signed this past 1.5 weeks or whatever that provided the
incremental benefits over a full sequestration for fiscal year 2014 and 2015, that essentially makes the DoD top line
kind of flat. And then if you take a look at FY 2016, under sequestration today, that actually shows a slight increase
over the FY 2015 levels as we sit here today.
So I'm, I'll say, cautiously optimistic we've sort of reached bottom and that we have – at least for Lockheed Martin, we
have the opportunity to see some growth in the not-too-distant future.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: I don't have much to add to that. We have looked at it closely, of course. But the DoD
budget is something we watch closely. And so, as we saw the bill get passed and looked at the outlook, I mean, we're
basically flat for the next two years, within that budget does start to increase. So we take that coupled with our strong
portfolio and the ability for the DoD to decide where they want to spend their money as opposed to it being an
across-the-board board cut, we think we are well positioned. And allowing them to make those kinds of decisions
through a non-sequestration environment is how we're going to hold up well and we will be differentiated. So I'm of the
mind that we are – as Bruce said, we have looked at it a lot, we are at the bottom or near the bottom, and we should see
an increase in the next few years.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher>: Shannon, this is Jerry. I think we're coming up on the hour. Maybe one more question then
we'll turn it back to Marillyn for final thoughts.

Our next question is from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. You may begin.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Well, thank you very much. Good afternoon.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Marillyn, you had a chance probably to go through the 2014 budget in a pretty fine detail
now. And if you look at your point, you clearly have a lot of important foundation programs that do make Lockheed
differentiated. Could you address a little bit where some of the shortfalls are versus what it's like? And also, flat in one
sense is good, but the reality is you still have some inflation, so you have to find productivity and other measures to
make up for that. So really the question is sort of, where are the holes you have to fill, which are probably a couple?
And then what about more productivity measures beyond what you've done?

<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well first of all, I mean, there is strong support for our programs as we've looked at it
across the entire portfolio. And we've looked at every one of our major programs to see how they hold up, and I would
say in large measure that we are strongly supported.
The F-35 showed some cuts, but it appears that those are primarily in the government fund side. If you look at our
multi-year order on Orion, the opportunities we have for multi-year on C-130J, and it's just a matter of getting through
that process, I think we are in a good position.
In terms of your comments about inflation and continuing to stay after managing our cost, we are absolutely going to
do that. This is a team that understands that, this leadership team is well experienced with that, and we work it every
day and we'll continue to do so. We're not going to – we've been I think very proactive over the last several years and
we recognize that that is an ongoing thing to constantly stay abreast of what our cost positions are and streamline our
business so that we can continue to be competitive.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: I assure you, Howard, Marillyn is relentless when it comes to her focus on affordability, and I
don't think that will change one iota going forward.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: I don't see any weak areas. We're not perfect as any business is not perfect. But when we
look at the breadth of our business and the ability to bring our very talented workforce to bear with the technologies
and opportunities that we have to keep our business relevant, there's no program that's out there, no major one that's
sunsetting. And we look at our production rates, they are either maintaining or they're growing across our major
programs. So I think I stand by my position. We've got a strong portfolio and we're going to weather this flat period and
then continue to grow.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher>: Final thoughts?
Marillyn A. Hewson
So let me just wrap up for the call today. I appreciate all the questions from all of you today, and I just want to
conclude by saying again that I believe that our 2013 results mark another year of continued high performance in a
challenging environment, and they demonstrate that we continue to be well positioned to provide solutions to our
customers and value to our shareholders.
If you look at our records, backlog of work, our robust cash generation, our solid balance sheet and the exceptional
execution of our employees, I'm confident that it's going to continue to propel our corporation forward in 2014 and
beyond. And it's really due to the integrity, the performance, and the innovation of our workforce that we're going to be
able to support our customers in their essential missions.
So thank you again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you in our next earnings call in
April.
Shannon, that concludes our call today.
