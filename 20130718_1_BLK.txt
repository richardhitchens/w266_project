MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Susan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Teleconference.
Our hosts for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer,
Gary Shedlin; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.
Matthew J. Mallow
Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. This is Matt Mallow, and I'm General Counsel of BlackRock. Before
Larry and Gary make their remarks, let me point out that during the course of this call, we may make a number of
forward-looking statements, and we call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may differ from these
statements.
As you all are aware, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the
results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today on the call. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not
undertake to update any forward-looking statements.
So with that, I will get out of the way. We'll let the call begin. Gary?
Gary S. Shedlin
Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be here to present our second quarter results for the first
time as CFO of BlackRock.

Today, I'll provide some opening comments on our financial performance and also reference selected pages from our
earnings supplement, which has been posted on the BlackRock Investor Relations website. I'll be discussing primarily
as adjusted results. These results exclude, among other items, the financial impact of a significant charitable
contribution in the second quarter, which I will review in more detail shortly. Finally, I'll outline some changes we've
made to our earnings release to improve transparency, and facilitate a better understanding of the drivers of our
business.
As I discussed at Investor Day a few weeks ago, we're focused on three key drivers of shareholder value: organic
growth, operating leverage and capital management. Despite some market volatility over the last six weeks of the
quarter, we delivered on each of these drivers, resulting in a strong quarter and continued earnings growth.
We generated second-quarter earnings per share of $4.15, up 34% compared to 2012. Operating income was $982
million, 18% higher than a year ago, reflecting record base fees in the quarter and continued margin improvement.
Non-operating results reflected a $22 million increase in the market value of our seed and co-investments, as well as a
$39 million noncash pre-tax gain relating to the PennyMac IPO, which we disclosed in our first quarter 10-Q.
The second quarter as adjusted tax rate was 27.3%. During the quarter, we benefited from a number of discrete tax
items totaling approximately $29 million, which were primarily attributable to the realization of loss carryforwards. For
planning purposes, we continue to believe that 31% is an appropriate run rate based on what we know today.
Underpinning our results was continued organic growth, which we achieved despite a challenging market. In the
second quarter, we generated approximately $12 billion of net new long-term flows. As Larry will discuss in more
detail, these flows continue to demonstrate the diversity of our multi-client platform, as our retail and institutional
channels drove our organic growth this quarter, offsetting the outflows experienced in our iShares business during the
month of June.
Despite the fact that organic growth for the quarter was below our stated target, we generated approximately $130
billion of adjusted net new long-term business over the past 12 months, representing a 4% organic growth rate. Because
83% of these net flows were generated by our retail and iShares channels, our organic revenue growth was even higher,
as these channels have higher effective fee rates compared to the firm's overall average fee rate.
As you can see on page 10 in the supplement, second-quarter revenues were $2.48 billion, up $253 million or 11%
from a year ago. Base fees reached record levels on the back of historically strong markets and organic growth. We
experienced year over year base fee growth across all traditional long-dated asset classes.
In the second quarter, we continued to experience strong performance across a number of our single strategy hedge
funds, contributing to a significant year-over-year increase in performance fees. Lower performance fees versus the
first quarter were a result of seasonal factors. Given recent market volatility and the majority of funds that lock in the
second half of the year, we will continue to update you on performance throughout the year.
Our BlackRock Solutions franchise continued to benefit from robust activity. Revenues in the second quarter were
$138 million, up $7 million compared to 2012. Our Aladdin business benefited from continued trends favoring global
investment platform consolidation and clients seeking multi-asset risk solutions, while our FMA business saw
momentum from ongoing regulatory change, especially in Europe.
The Aladdin pipeline remains strong, especially driven by demand from asset managers. And while year-over-year
results were impacted by the timing and recognition of certain fees, we continue to expect mid-teens growth rates for
the business. Securities lending revenue grew 21% versus the first quarter led by seasonal demand, but declined on a
year-over-year basis as a result of spread compression.
Turning to page 12 of the supplement. Expenses were up $103 million year over year, driven primarily by
revenue-related items, including direct fund expense and compensation. This was a 7% increase from a year ago
compared to an 11% increase in revenue over the same period, and resulted in an operating margin of 41.3%, 210 basis
points higher from a year ago.

We continue to believe that scale is a critically important – is critically important to our business, and we see scale
advantages in a number of areas: growing our passive business, leveraging our brand spend, offsetting technology cost
through our Aladdin business and absorbing the increased costs of regulation and compliance.
In particular, as we indicated last quarter, we'll continue to invest in our brand, especially when there's an opportunity
to deliver important messages at a time the messages will have the most meaningful impact. As such, we increased our
brand spend in the second quarter to levels more consistent with the year-ago quarter. We still expect our full year
brand investment to be in line with 2012 levels.
Our margin has recently benefited from positive mix shift and rising global market levels. However, in the last six
weeks of the quarter, we witnessed outflows in certain high margin products and a decline in market levels. As we
emphasized during Investor Day, we remain committed to dual objectives: running the firm as efficiently as possible,
while also investing for future growth. While our margin will fluctuate as a function of mix shift and beta, we remain
confident that we can maintain minimum margins of 40% in stable market conditions.
We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value with the first priority to invest in our
business. In May, we announced the acquisition of MGPA, a private equity real estate investment advisory company.
This deal will double the size of our real estate advisory business, and extend its reach to Asia-Pac and EMEA. The
acquisition will not be material to earnings per share and is expected to close in the third quarter, subject to customary
regulatory approvals and closing conditions.
While not included in the current quarter, on July 1 we completed the acquisition of Credit Suisse's ETF business with
assets under management of $16 billion. This acquisition will extend our footprint in the Swiss market, and bring a
broader range of opportunities to Swiss investors through our iShares platform, while also adding an array of
complementary products to serve our clients across Europe.
Our capital management policy remains consistent. We repurchased approximately $250 million of shares in the second
quarter, matching the value of shares we repurchased in the first quarter. As we have previously stated, in the current
environment we would expect to continue this level of repurchase for the remainder of the year.
Before I turn it over to Larry, I want to address the impact of PennyMac on our quarterly results, and some changes to
our earnings release. Between 2008 and 2012, BlackRock made a series of investments in PennyMac, a leading
national mortgage lender and servicer. In May, PennyMac completed an initial public offering. BlackRock was not a
seller in the IPO. However, as a result of the IPO, we recorded a noncash, non-operating pre-tax gain of $39 million
related to the carrying value of our equity method investment, which is included in our as adjusted results.
As Larry will discuss more fully, subsequent to the IPO in June, BlackRock made a charitable contribution of
approximately 6 million units of our PennyMac investment to a new Donor Advised Fund. The fair value of this
contribution was $124 million, and is included in G&A expense in our GAAP income statement. In connection with the
charitable contribution, we also recognized an additional noncash, non-operating gain of $80 million and recorded a net
tax benefit of $57 million.
Among other items, the financial impact of the entire charitable contribution has been excluded from as adjusted
results. Page 28 of the earnings supplement details the financial impact of both the PennyMac IPO and related
charitable contribution. Going forward, Blackrock will continue to account for our remaining 20% PennyMac holding
as an equity method investment.
Finally, as some of you may have noticed, we have made some changes to our earnings release. Given the diverse
nature of our multi-client platform, we feel that our AUM inflows are best viewed and analyzed through a
comprehensive lens. With that in mind, we have added incremental AUM disclosures by client and product in order to
provide greater transparency on our business drivers, including the addition of average AUM data based on relevant
month-end averages.
Given this additional disclosure, we have also decided to discontinue the reporting of our net new business institutional
pipeline. This decision is not meant to signal any change in the outlook for our institutional business. In fact, our

pipeline at July 11 was $49.3 billion, up $13.9 billion from April 11, with a mix of business largely in line with prior
quarters. We trust these changes will facilitate a better understanding of our overall business.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Laurence D. Fink
Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Gary, and thanks for joining us today on this call. But before we start, I'd like to
reiterate how excited I am to have Gary on board. He's been a close partner of mine and advisor to BlackRock for many
years, and it's great to have him as a full-time member of our team.
Let me begin with a little market context. What started out as a relatively steady first two months of the quarter for
markets took a turn in late May following a series of global events, all within a concentrated period of time. The Fed's
comments on May 22 suggesting a change in narrative, a change in the idea of tapering their bond purchasing program,
led to markets aggressively selling off the long end of the curve. What we witnessed to see also is a rapid sell off from
leveraged investment products. At the same time, growing uncertainty surrounding Japanese policymakers going all in
on their stimulus efforts triggered approximately a 20% three week sell off in the Nikkei after a very large run up.
And finally, continuing market worries about Chinese growth and emerging market capital flows sparked a downturn in
emerging markets. These events drove a material uptick in market volatility, and we saw different types of investor
react in different ways, highlighting the stability of BlackRock's multi-client platform.
In fact, we saw very little in the ways of changes from our largest institutional clients, as we remain committed to their
long-term investment objectives. We did see a market change in trading-oriented investor behavior, particularly with
respect to long duration fixed income and emerging market equity exposure, as those clients used liquidity in our
iShares products to reposition their portfolios.
Many of these macro and policy concerns that attracted attention in the markets remain, along with the ongoing
political uncertainty of the Middle East, are likely to continue to drive global capital market volatility. However, I
remain just as constructive on the long-term upside of U.S. equities that I have been over the last two years.
We've spoken frequently about the benefits of our diversified business model at BlackRock, and we saw strong
evidence of that again this quarter: generated record long-term base fees of $2.1 billion and long-term net inflows of
approximately $12 billion, taking our flows to $51.4 billion year to date.
We benefited from the diversity of the client segments we serve, the diversity of our product set and the diversity of the
geographies in which we operate. During the quarter, we had 11 funds across retail and iShares generated more than $1
billion in flows. These funds did not include our traditional growth engines Global Al and equity dividend, which I
believe showcases BlackRock's highly scalable product breadth, with representation across all major classes, client
segment and importantly, geographies.
In recent quarters, iShares delivered a substantial portion of BlackRock's overall organic growth. This quarter it was
our retail and institutional businesses driving growth and offsetting iShares outflows. Positive net flows in the quarter
were led by multi-asset products, unconstrained fixed income and retail alternatives, three key areas of focus where
we've been investing to build a market-leading position. Our flows also reflect the benefit of our broad platform and
Blackrock's global reach, with positive contributions from both our active and passive franchises, and strong flows in
our EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions.
Before I walk through the results, I'd like to take a minute to discuss some macro trends that have been a key driver of
flows at BlackRock, and I think will continue to drive Blackrock's coming quarters. This is about the great rotation.
The great rotation in equities has been much discussed. We are seeing a rotation at BlackRock, but it's not from fixed
income into equities. It's a rotation within fixed income.
Over the past several quarters, we've been warning our clients about the asymmetric risk in their fixed income
portfolios. The third year bull market, which I was witnessing through my career in fixed income products, has meant

that more than a generation of investors had never seen the losses in their fixed income portfolios.
In the past few months, obviously that started to change. Ten-year yields spiked more than 100 basis points from the
lows of early May through the first week of July, and the Barclay Aggregate Bond Index fell nearly 5% during the
same period. There is a great rotation; we believe it's going to be out of core Barclay aggregate type products, the types
of products that have been benefiting from duration extension in the past, but are now sources of increased risk. We
expect to see flows moving into more flexible, non-traditional fixed income products.
Industry flows into flexible bond products across the industry has increased seven-fold year to date versus the same
period last year, while flows in more traditional bond categories has fallen as great as 80%. We built BlackRock on our
reputation in fixed income. We let that performance get away from us in 2008, and we've spent a great deal of time on
rebuilding the performance platform at BlackRock. And we fixed the business over the past few years, and I'm proud to
say that we're well positioned today in fixed income space more than we've ever been, and we're now ahead of most of
our competitors.
As of the end of June, we're outperforming in a number of key fixed income areas. We've seen strong recent
outperformance in our total return fund, which is a top decile for the one-year period, and should prove to have a better
defensive position relative to our peers. Our Low Duration Bond Fund is a top quartile for a three-year period of time
and is in the sweet spot for yield-starved investors searching for some strong performance with minimum duration risk.
And perhaps most importantly, our unconstrained Strategic Income Opportunity fund, or SIO, is in the top quartile for
one and three-year period. SIO is designed to provide yield, capital return and downside protection in diverse interest
rate environments. It took in more than $1.6 billion in the quarter; now has $6 billion in assets. We're very encouraged
by the retail adoption of this product. As we introduce the fund outside the U.S. and to institutional investors, SIO is
well positioned to be one of BlackRock's largest and most important products in the coming years.
So across the board, we're well positioned to benefit from the changes in fixed income. We've developed strong
offerings across unconstrained, across floating rate, alternatives and multi-asset categories.
For example, this quarter we launched the Asia Floating Rate Income Fund, which was designed to protect against
rising rates, and we saw more than $300 million in flows. In the alternative space, we saw $1.1 billion of U.S. retail
flows in our Global Long/Short Credit Mutual Fund, a product designed to eliminate interest rate risk and provide
credit-driven solutions.
Our Multi-Asset Income Fund, or MAI, has been a strong fixed income substitute. It's a five-star, go anywhere income
solution that continues to see strong momentum, taking in more than $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter. As
investors begin to more fully appreciate the risk in their fixed income portfolios, we have the solutions our clients need.
We're well positioned to reap the benefits of the rotation within fixed income.
The types of outcome-oriented solutions I just discussed have been a key driver in our retail and institutional client
businesses, which generated healthy flows, despite the challenging investment landscape. In retail, our diversified
platform continues to deliver results. This quarter, we generated $5.1 billion in net inflows, with key themes of income
alternatives and outcome-oriented solutions driving positive result across all geographies.
U.S. retail and high net worth had long-term net inflows in the second quarter of $3.5 billion. I just mentioned SIO,
MAI and our Global Long/Short Credit Fund, all which netted north of $1 billion in net flows in the quarter.
Alternatives are rapidly moving into the mainstream, as the funds we launched in the past two years have more than
$2.5 billion in AUM, having raised $1.1 billion in our second quarter. During the quarter, we also launched the
Emerging Market Allocation Fund, an innovative actively managed product leveraging our 12 separate emerging
market teams that create product breadth that few, if any, of our competitors can match.
International retail. We saw long-term net inflows of $1.6 billion, reflecting global consistency in targeted growth
areas, including strong multi-asset fixed income and alternative flows. Multi-asset net inflows demonstrated increasing
interest in our global allocation, managed volatility and dynamic asset allocation offerings, as retail investors looked for
us at BlackRock to provide them solutions to address the market volatility.

Let me turn to fundamental equities. It still is a mixed story. However, we're pleased with the strong start we're starting
to – we're seeing in some of our new managers in U.S. fundamental equities and across the board in our Basic Value
Fund, a great example of the turnaround, with over 275 basis points of outperformance in the past six months.
Our European equities continue to strengthen, led by our top decile performing – performance across a number of our
funds, including our Euro Market Fund, offset by outflows in our natural resources, where we had a dominant position
and remain to be dominant, but where we're seeing outflows in commodity-like type products. And we saw outflows in
our UK equities.
But I'm particularly pleased to be set up when we see a refresh inflows, and that is in our emerging market equities.
One of our new managers that has been with us close to two years now is Andrew Swan, who continues to outperform
meeting his benchmark by more than 300 basis points year to date. Our Global Allocation Fund, which has performed
very, very well. While managing risk exposure for the last rolling 12 months, it earned over a 12% return to our
investors.
Let me turn to institutional, where we generated $7.8 billion in long-term net new business. Flows were driven largely
by a combination of continued shift to passive and demand for multi-asset solutions.
The tone of our conversation with institutional clients remained positive, as evidenced by clients adding to positions
amid all this market volatility. This also speaks very loudly how our clients are looking for BlackRock for helping them
to provide solutions. In that sense, we are seeing bar-belling that continued to be a dominant theme, with large strategic
clients investing in both equity and fixed index mandates alongside alternative solutions to achieve uncorrelated
returns.
Institutional active products saw positive flows for the first time in eight quarters, with $1.3 billion in net inflows.
Strong multi-asset flows offset fundamental equities and active currency challenges. We benefited from our proactive
client dialogue around regulatory changes, as the implementation of RDR-like regulation in Europe drove a large,
highly customized multi-asset strategy sub-advisory win the quarter. We expect to see more types of opportunity
working alongside our distribution partners as they try to respond to RDR, and we believe we will see more
sub-advisory type of relationships as that continues.
Once again, our key growth sub-segments, specifically defined contributions and official institutions, continued to be
strong contributors. We generated $4 billion in our Target Date LifePath product in the quarter, which now nets over $7
billion of new flows. We also saw more than $6 billion of flows from official institutions, primarily into passive equity
mandates.
We continue to evaluate ways to connect to our products and clients with the overlay of risk management through
BlackRock Solutions and our Aladdin platform. Our Aladdin business continues to grow, with multiple successful
implementations and an expanding client base, much of which is global in nature. As Gary mentioned, we continue to
expect mid-teen revenue growth in our Aladdin business.
We signed a record number of advisory assignments in Q2, and we continue to see opportunities to have clients use
Aladdin, especially now with the new regulatory environment we're all living in. We also announced during the quarter
the alliance with MarketAxess, which will allow our clients to tap into a deeper liquidity pool for U.S. credit from the
Aladdin platform. We remain well positioned across BlackRock Solutions, and our financial advisory business
continues to showcase the differentiated and strong multi-client platform.
We were recently retained on two new assignments that speak to our unique analytical capabilities: the first of the
assignment on behalf of Her Majesty's Treasury to provide advice on Royal Bank of Scotland, and the second is a
significant countrywide banking diagnostics. We are proud to be a trusted advisor for global leaders when they face –
faced with issues involving significant financial complexities, and we also work very closely with all the regulators
related to the implementation in terms of new focuses on risk management leverage ratios. And we believe with this
greater and greater scrutiny, more and more clients are going to be looking for Aladdin as a source of risk management
tools.

Now let me turn to iShares. As Mark Wiedman, who runs our iShares business, told you at Investor Day, iShares are
used as both an investment vehicle, but also it's used as an exposure tool by our clients. Amidst market volatility in
June, we saw clients again turn to iShares to express their views, in this case on emerging markets and long duration
fixed income.
In the three weeks following May 22, clients redeemed nearly $15 billion in iShares. The ability to exit quickly, the
ability to exit efficiently and in bulk is part and parcel of our value proposition to an important client segment, a
trading-oriented investors.
These investors prefer iShares as the broadest, most liquid suite of ETFs. They use iShares when they want to take on
fresh risks, as they did earlier in the year and the fourth quarter of 2012, and when they want to exit, as they did
following the Fed comments on tapering. The consequences is that our quarterly flows and our flow market share will
be volatile. Since quarter end, the flows have reversed, with more than $6 billion inflows through yesterday and more
than $30 billion of net flows year to date.
And in fact, despite the volatility we saw in June, we are running at the same rate of growth as we did last year, as last
year we saw a summer swoon in our ETF market. So we love our position in our business, and we expect the same type
of future. But importantly, we look to longer horizons. Over quarters and years, our market share of assets have been
stable and in 2012, for instance, we grew in line with a global industry, with 27% AUM growth and a 14% organic
growth.
The flows in the second quarter reflect the fact that iShares delivered the liquid market exposure that our clients expect.
This was true, even in the products that experienced the most selling pressure, including emerging market equities and
fixed income ETFs. EEM, our flagship Emerging Market Fund, traded a record $5 billion in a day, all in the secondary
market without any creations or redemptions. Similarly, for the first time we saw a $1 billion plus trading day in our
leading U.S. corporate ETF, like HYG and LQD.
So overall, our products performed in a challenging period, but we welcome continued dialogue around the mechanics
of ETFs. We are constantly working with market bankers and exchanges to ensure that ETFs are working
appropriately. As the market leader in the industry, we believe we have a responsibility to lead the charge on market
practices and investor education, not just with respect to iShares, but in the ETF market globally at large.
Turning to the business results for global iShares. We ended the quarter with $1 billion of net inflows. We've seen a
healthy start in the third quarter, with $6.2 billion in net inflows through July 16. iShares base fees of $723 million
represents a 21% year-over-year increase.
Fixed income outflows was $1.5 billion driven on the rotation out of the long duration fixed income. We also
experienced outflows in our commodity-like products of $2.2 billion, in line with the macro pressures in that segment.
Equity net inflows in our ETF products was $2.7 billion, showcasing the breadth of our offerings, as outflows in
emerging market products were offset across the franchise. A key driver in our new flows was our Minimum Volatility
equity suite, where we launched a new marketing campaign during the quarter. This set of products offers investors
equity exposure with flatter peaks and valleys. It's an innovative solution that we developed in-house, and we raised
more than $7.6 billion since the launch of this product only two years ago.
Let me just also add regionally, iShares results were supported by strength in Europe and Latin America, offsetting the
weakness I talked about in the United States. EMEA iShares retained its leading position, with $2.5 billion of net
inflows. Flows were led by equities, with $2.2 billion of net inflows. We actually had our twenty-fifth consecutive
month of positive ETF fixed income flows in EMEA.
Overall, we remain very pleased with the direction of our iShares business. However, we must remain aggressive in
pursuing new opportunities through both product innovation and tapping into new market segments. Let me give you
three examples. First, we launched – we recently launched our fixed income iShares bond series targeted towards
traditional fixed income investors. Second, we launched our Core series product, which we designed for the
buy-and-hold segment, and we delivered $3.6 billion of net positive flows in the quarter. And third, last quarter we
announced our long-term strategic alliance with Fidelity to provide access to iShares in the self-directed segment, and

that partnership is off to a great, great start.
In summary, iShares provides solutions, both for investors focused on liquidity and those looking to build long-term
portfolios using beta products. We believe that we continue to be in a secular bull market for ETFs, and that as a market
leader we will both drive the growth and benefit from the growth of the market.
I'll wrap up my comments with a few other significant events that occurred during the quarter. Our brand campaign
continues to drive increased awareness and recognition, and we backed that up with targeted marketing towards our key
investor segments and products. We're helping our clients to answer the question to what to do with their money, and
we're focusing their attention on the solutions they need to be successful in the current investing environment.
We're also trying to remind our clients that their objective is, in most cases, about retirement, and the noise we saw on
the last six weeks truly has little consequences in terms of their long-term objective needs. And as I said earlier, we
have not seen investor behavior change from what I would call our traditional long-term clients. And I think our ad
campaign is helping our clients understand that we need to be focused not on the noise of the day, but on the objectives
over a long cycle.
As Gary discussed, during the quarter, we used a portion of our ownership stake in PennyMac to fund a philanthropic
entity by seeding a Donor Advised Fund. As a leader in our community, as a leader in the industry, we're committed to
the well-being of our communities where we live and work. This new charitable initiative will deepen our commitment
to public responsibility that has always been fundamental to our business.
We expect the fund to be operational in early 2014, and it will be a cornerstone of BlackRock's philanthropic efforts,
including among other things, helping to promote financial education for low-income families and individuals. I'd like
to personally congratulate and thank Stan Kurland and the entire PennyMac team for the work they've done in building
that business and creating value that will benefit BlackRock shareholders for the years to come.
Finally, in June, we hosted our inaugural Investor Day. Our goal was to provide more exposure to the depth and talent
of our team, and provide a deeper dive into the growth prospects for the firm. I've been fortunate to be surrounded by a
talented and dedicated global team for many years, and that team is a key driver of our performance and growth.
As a result, this quarter shows even in periods of volatility we have a platform designed to deliver for both clients and
shareholders. We are well positioned to benefit from long-term market trends, including the rotation within fixed
income space with our unconstrained alternatives and multi-asset offerings, as well as a continued shift to passive and
the use of beta products to generate alpha with our iShares business.
We will continue to strive to stay ahead of secular changes, and put our clients in a position to meet their investment
goals. We have an exciting opportunity in front of us to execute on the growth plan we laid out a few weeks ago. I
believe that growth plan's intact, and I believe we will continue to drive the types of growth rates we discussed in much
more detail during Investor Day.
I would like to thank everybody and all the hard work for all the employees. And with that, I'll open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instruction] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hello, Mike.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Hey, Larry. Just one question on the fixed income business. You gave a lot of detail. Just
in terms of BlackRock, like how you guys are set up from a fixed income product mix, like what's your offering when
you look at the mix of say like the core products versus what you characterize as either the alternative or the flex
products? And then also just from like a fee perspective, if we continue to see more of that shift over time, what tends

to be the fee rate on those products versus some of the more core products?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: On the unconstrained type of products, the margins or the fees are higher than our core
products, but I wouldn't say dramatically higher. And as we see more and more growth, and then obviously we'll look
to change that, but right now the fees are higher than our core products. And as I said, for our one- and three-year
period of time after fees we've outperformed our peers on that. So that's one positive thing.
We're going to have a lot of clients who are not going to be able to move out of core, and we still – we have great
performance in our core offerings also. It is my view that more clients should be moving more towards more the
unconstrained type of products, and I do believe you're going to see more and more investors moving there. Let me just
also add, two-thirds of our fixed income assets are held by institutional clients. And they're generally slower in terms of
movement, but I do believe the dialogues we're having, more and more institutional clients are asking the question, how
should they be looking at their fixed income portfolio.
As I said in my prepared speech, we had a 30-year bull market. People were very accustomed and very convinced that
having their assets in a core product were – was a foundational component of their fixed income allocation. I think that
is being -that will change over time. I think we'll be a big beneficiary of that change, but as I said, institutions are slow
to adapt. They have to work with their consultants, and I don't mean that in a negative way. They take – they have to
act as a fiduciary, making sure they're – they need to make sure they're meeting the needs as a fiduciary.
But importantly, also, many fixed – many of our fixed income investors, whether they're insurance companies or other
types of organization, they are looking to match their assets to their liabilities. And so a lot of fixed income investing is
liability-based investing, and those type of investors they're not – they're going to be – they're not unhappy with rising
rates if their liabilities are moving alongside with that. So that's why we're here to say there's going to be a rotation, but
it – and it could be large in some segments of fixed income owners, and in some segments it's going to be much less.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned some of the volatility in
May and June and how the ETFs performed. Just on the fixed income side, you mentioned the relationship with
MarketAxess; think you guys now have something with Tradeweb. Just during that same period of time in May and
June, just given the regulations, dealers holding less inventory, any insight in terms of as a big fixed income player how
the markets performed? And based on those relationships what you guys are trying to do longer term?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Sure. That's unrelated it to iShares, I mean...
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Yeah.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: One thing that's very clear that people are using – I think one of the big trends that I think
even surprised me, many investors use iShares and fixed income for beta exposure. Sometimes some investors used to
use some form of derivatives and swaps and other forms of options. Now they're using ETFs. So that's one of the things
that was designed.
There was no question during, I guess, those few moments during late June. There was periods of pretty poor liquidity
in the fixed income market, especially in credit. I'm not particularly alarmed about this. I think the Street has done a
very good job to try to manage their balance sheet issues, managing their leverage ratio issues, managing their capital
issues. We as long-term investors are going to have to deal with this. This is why, I believe, more and more product –
more and more fixed income will be traded on electronic platforms in the coming years. And I think we'll find a new
source of liquidity.
But in the short run, there are bouts of illiquidity that the entire market, and I just want to underscore the cash part of
the market, the ETF component of the market. I mean we saw periods of time of illiquidity. But as I reflect now in a
less – in more calm periods today, what I'm particularly surprised at how well the exchanges and the market
participants of fixed income ETFs performed. As I said, we saw $1 billion of flows in one day. The creates and
redeems worked very well. There was periods of time during the day where there were appearances of discounts, but all
that was was an indication of where the cash market was going.

And obviously there was many cases in which in global bonds where markets were closed overseas and the ETF market
from that close looked like a discount, but it was really telegraphing where the markets were going to go the next
morning. And so we were – I mean we were very pleased with how they performed.
Nevertheless, as a market leader, we are doing whatever we can to assure as great a market liquidity is possible. It is
our responsibility to educate and to inform, to making sure that we have a more liquid market. But the overall fixed
income market is going through this evolutionary change now, as Wall Street is relying less on balance sheet, spending
much more time on flow. They're dealing – they're developing their own electronic trading platforms. MarketAxess is
another one. And as long-term investors, this is something we're all going to have live with and adapt.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. Got it. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hey, Marc.
<Q - Marc S. Irizarry>: Hey. How are you? So just following up on fixed income allocations from institutions. Just in
terms of going from maybe core to noncore products, how are fixed income ETFs playing into those discussions?
And just following on on some of the discussions around what sound like sort of market dislocations, if you will, that
were temporary versus sort of tracking or are long term for fixed income, maybe you could talk about sort of the market
share opportunity.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, I have Mark Wiedman here, and he's going to be able to answer that question with a
lot more granularity than I can. So, Mark, why don't you answer that?
<A - Mark Wiedman>: Hi, Marc. There are two things I think implicit in your question. Let me address them
separately. The first is about growing adoption by what I would call fixed income specialists of fixed income ETFs. So
historically the users of fixed income ETFs have been wealth managers and asset allocators, call them generalist
investors, and that's where the bulk even today of our fixed income ETF holdings are.
With the big transformation that's occurring is we're seeing fixed income specialists who control, I don't know, 98%,
99% of the global fixed income assets actually starting to use fixed income ETFs in their portfolios. For liquidity
purposes they're using them for tactical positioning.
It's our aspiration with the iShares bond launch that we actually penetrate beyond the tactical positioning into longer
buy/hold segments, whether they be in insurance or bank or corporate balance sheets or individuals around the world.
So that's the broad trend, and we see it every day. It gets a bit masked when you see people flowing out of an asset class
because it looks like they're exiting the ETF. What they're doing is using the ETF, that, again those tactical traders, for
the exact purpose for which they bought it, which is the ability to get out quickly when they want to.
The second question you're addressing is the – I think Larry used the appearance, I think that's the right word -- of a
gap between the underlying and the ETF price. And I think the issue here is volatility you can see versus volatility you
can't. What ETFs do is they shine a light on intraday volatility in the underlying asset class, the cash market, the
underlying securities. And so an optical gap can open up in the short term versus net asset value, which is the industry
convention by which, for example, even ETFs we report the value, but it's important to understand that's because the
NAV depends on historical pricing. It's a disciplined conservative tool for valuing securities at the last known
transaction price.
The problem is in fast-moving markets, those prices go stale. So if you're talking about, let's take the example of
overnight equities, emerging market equities or Japanese equities, for example. The ETF will keep re-pricing based on
news during the day, and we've seen this historically in 2011 after the nuclear disaster in Japan; we saw it recently with
the sell-off in Japan, that our leading ETF for Japan, EWJ, keeps trading as if it's a continuous market with the Nikkei

in Tokyo. So that's the first part.
The second thing is on the bonds is understand that the prices in the NAV are recorded at historical last transaction.
What that means is that, for example, in our high yield ETF, the leading one, HYG, 30% of the underlying securities
are priced at security at NAVs three months or more old. 30% of those prices are three months or more old. That's the
industry convention as to how we price our ETFs for disciplined conservative valuation practices, but it creates optical
illusions versus the underlying cash markets because there are securities in which there actually just haven't been
transactions, so that's the basic issue. We believe our securities have performed. Actually our ETFs in particularly high
yield and emerging markets performed better than they ever have. And that's why our clients are actually happy to be
using them, and that's – we're happy to be – that's our key takeaway.
<Q - Marc S. Irizarry>: Okay. And then if you can just give some color on your EM, active EM business, both in
equity and debt. Obviously we saw – we've seen a pretty good bout of volatility here. Are you sensing or seeing from
your clients any change in thinking about being active in EM versus passive in their allocations toward EM?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: No, I think those are who are – a core group of our investors believe that active management
EM is part of their core philosophy, and this is why we've been so aggressive in building our EM fixed income team
and our EM equity team in EM, and also as I suggested, our EM alternatives. We did have a $500 million win in our
EM fixed income team. This is on the active side, as I talked about, Andrew Swan in terms of his outperformance in a
component of that.
But there are another core group of investors and some of them, the official institutions, they're investing in EM
principally through beta products. And so our job, as I've said for many quarters is to provide an active solution and a
beta solution. But, Marc, I've not seen any dramatic shift out of beta into active or vice versa. I think those who are –
who believe in active will continue to invest in active, and those who believe in – who want exposure and they're not as
concerned about excess performance, they're going to go into beta.
<Q - Marc S. Irizarry>: Okay. And then just, Larry, on the active equity business. The flow trends -- they look like
they decelerated or improved sequentially a little bit. How much of the improvement is sort of redemptions slowing
versus wins in active equity? Are you seeing sort of the end of the bout of redemptions? Or is it gross sales that are
picking up? Or what's --
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: I think a lot of it is – a lot of the redemptions are the component of when we transition our
managers, we expect large outflows, and so obviously, that's behind us. Our investors are starting to see the positive
turnaround. We have probably more dialogue than ever before. Some of our trends, we are seeing continuing flows in
European equities where we have a five, three, and one-year track record that's in top quartile.
And so we're – so some of it is – it's a combination of both. But the other thing that we're seeing, we continue to see
more and more interest in multi-assets where clients are looking for equity exposure, but in more of a multi-asset type
of strategy where you could navigate around. And the other thing is it's undeniable: our scientific active equity team
has had great results. I expected to start seeing more inflows, but we're not seeing any outflows, as you suggested. So I
think it's fair to say our – the outflow drag is probably behind us and now it's opportunity.
<Q - Marc S. Irizarry>: Okay. Great. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hey, Robert.
<Q - Robert Lee>: [ph] Quick (49:29) question just going back to the capital management really on the debt side. I'm
just curious, how are you thinking about managing kind of the debt side of the ledger? I mean I think you had, it was
around $750 million of some notes that matured. I mean should we expect that the objective is to kind of chip away at
outstanding debt over time as part of the capital management strategy?

<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Hey, Rob. It's Gary. How are you?
<Q - Robert Lee>: Hey, Gary.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Hey. How are you? So our next maturity is in December. So we're basically a little more than
a year away from that, and that's about $1 billion. So we're obviously monitoring. There's the constant tradeoff. I'd say
there's two tradeoffs. One is basically trying to basically get a feel for obviously where we think rates are going to go
and spreads over the next 16 months. So we're going to be very mindful of that.
But we're also mindful of the negative carry. So we're going to try and balance basically both of those items in terms of
trying to have an outlook and understand the negative carry, but we're certainly not going play that too cute. So whether
it's next month or it's six to eight months from now, that remains to be seen based on our continued analysis. But we're
very mindful of it.
<Q - Robert Lee>: Yeah. I know you don't – you guys didn't provide the balance sheet, but – and I could be mistaken.
I guess I was – I thought you may had some floating rate notes that matured back in April or May, and I was just kind
of curious how you...
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Those were pre-refinanced last year at the time of the Barclays buyback.
<Q - Robert Lee>: Okay. Great. Another follow-up question on Aladdin. Just want to make sure I understand how
some of the new business flows. You've talked about having pretty strong pipelines and expecting double-digit growth
there. Am I right in assuming that there's some upfront costs as you bring on those mandates, so that maybe it takes a
while for profitability on the new mandates to flow through and that with that and given the strong growth you've had
there the last couple of years, should we really be expecting maybe some acceleration over the coming year or so in
Aladdin's growth?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, as we said, both Gary and I said, we expect double-digit revenue growth. Obviously,
it's lumpier, so over the course of a year we expect that. We signed five new mandates in the first quarter and five new
mandates in the second quarter. We have never seen this type of volume. And we are about to sign one of the largest
mandates we ever had. As I said, more and more institutions are looking to take on Aladdin as their risk management
solution. And this is asset managers, this is official institutions, insurance companies, and so we continue to see huge
upside and opportunity to build Aladdin.
We crossed the button the $14 trillion market in terms of assets that we are now analyzing risk on behalf of our clients.
It continues to be an industry leader, and I believe as a industry leader because of the increased regulatory issues that
we all have to face, having a risk system that is cross-product that encapsulates regional issues, regional differences,
compliance issues, it allows investors, especially the more regulated investors, to deal with the regulatory compliance
in a far better way that they would have otherwise.
Especially in Europe, as you have each country now adapting regulatory issues a little differently. And so the
regulatory issues that we are all facing, BlackRock included is enormous. And if we did not have at BlackRock, I'm
going to speak for ourselves for a second, if we did not have a mono-line platform of risk management, of risk
understanding, mono-line platform of in terms of day trade entry, trade discovery, inventory management, we'd have
far more difficulties.
And I think one of the reasons why we continue to have better than industry average in margins has been because of
having this technology in face of all the regulatory added needs that we have to face. Our competitors, who are asset
managers, obviously have the same issues. They are now becoming our clients. They are faced the same issues, and
they're trying to achieve the same type of simplicity and operating structure that we have at BlackRock. And we're
happy to make them our clients.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: And, Rob, I would just add just specifically that the year-over-year comparison in terms of it
being up 5%, I think was to your question, is definitely the result of timing and recognition of renewals and
implementation fees. So there's no question there's some timing issues in there.

And that to Larry's point on the pipeline, I'd say the one really very good piece of news is while we're adding – we
added five clients in the first quarter and five new clients in the second quarter, the run rate of revenues for that group
of clients is increasing fairly dramatically. And in fact in the pipeline, as Larry mentioned, the run rate of those new
clients is even greater than the second quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hello Bill.
<Q - William R. Katz>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for the added disclosure and the actually shorter
prepared marks, so I really appreciate both. Just, Larry...
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: I thought I went too long, so thank you.
<Q - William R. Katz>: Much better than the last few quarters, Larry. In terms of the money market portfolio you
didn't really talk or touch on. I know you covered it at the Analyst Day recently, but there's been a little bit more
movement maybe by the IRS. And I'm just sort of curious, what's been the feedback from your client base as they've
had a chance to ruminate a little bit on some of the proposed change by the SEC? And what might be the behavior
around any of these changes?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: As I said during the Investor Day, I don't think we're going to see that much change. I think
this has been so well telegraphed if we get the IRS changes, as you suggested. We need the DoL changes. That's
something going to be very important. So if we get these changes, which I think are all coming forth, we had a – we
have been working very closely with the regulators as they finalize this. They've asked for our input, as they've asked
for other people's input. We've been – we're providing input to the regulators from input that we've had from our
clients.
As I said, this is so well telegraphed. We're going to have some clients who are going to have to move probably close
more to the government-oriented funds, so they require some form of guarantee or some sort of backstop or they – and
they have to have a constant NAV. Some clients are going to be able to adapt to have a floating NAV. And the reality
is, Bill, because we publish every day now what our NAV is, it really has almost like a implied floating NAV even
today. And as our clients are watching – all of the clients that are in money market funds are seeing how the NAV is
staying much more constant. The industry has done a very good job of self-policing itself. And so I think much of this
is already in the marketplace.
One last thing, we have the final comment letter is due in September, and as I said, we're getting feedback and we're
providing that feedback to our – to two of the regulators from our clients, but as I said at Investor Day, I'm very calm
about this.
<Q - William R. Katz>: Okay. It's helpful. And then a quick question for Gary. I heard you on the $250 million is a
good run rate in terms of repurchase. But with the stock trading where it's at right now and your earnings building, how
are you thinking about on a go-forward basis? And I guess the real question is, as you think about the share count,
should we expect that to continue to migrate lower? Or would that start to stabilize at this point?
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: I think we're obviously going to continue to try and be as consistent and predictable in terms
of our capital management policy, Bill, as we possibly can. As I said, the run rate for the moment, I think, we feel very
comfortable with the $250 million a quarter. We're going to try and be really systematic about that as opposed to
overwhelmingly opportunistic.

And so with that, I would expect for basically the second, the third and the fourth quarter, you'll expect the share count
to come down, and obviously generally kind of gets offset in the first quarter of the year based on employee comp
issuance, but overall you're going to see that count continue to come down.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Yeah. I agree We have not discussed this with our board. This is a discussion that we would
have probably in our later board meetings. But it's very clear that as long as we generate the free cash flow that we're
generating, Bill, which obviously will grow with as we grow earnings, it would be my expectation the board would
authorize us to continue the process of reducing our share count.
But I mean obviously that's subject to conversation. And we do have board authorization for, what, 7 million, 8 million
more shares outstanding right now. But right now our board has agreed to the current rate that we are purchasing right
now. And – but just pay attention to our free cash flow, and we don't need to discuss any more.
<Q - William R. Katz>: Okay. Just one point of clarification; thanks for taking my questions. The $6 billion that
you've gotten on iShares quarter to date, did you provide dynamics of where that's coming into in terms of products?
I'm sorry, I might have missed that.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: No, we did not. I mean it's all public data. Mark, why don't you just quickly answer that?
<A - Mark Wiedman>: It's broadly distributed. I can – I don't have offhand the numbers for the Core series by assets
into where they've come, but we've seen – I'll give you one example of how the Core series is achieving its purpose
relative to more high velocity trading vehicles.
We launched IEMG, which is our low-cost broad EM exposure vehicle; lower liquidity; doesn't have the derivatives
ecology of its big sister EEM. IEMG launched in October. It's nearing $2 billion. That money kept flowing in even
during massive outflows out of EEM. And what that shows is there's two different segments. There are consistent
buyers coming in in a trickle, and then you see other buyers and sellers who are moving in and out much faster.
So I would say, look at the Core series for a long-term investment trend, so we can get you that data. It's out there
public, and then for – you look for more fast money as products like EEM and HYJ.
<Q - William R. Katz>: Okay. Thanks very much, guys.

<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hello, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Kelley>: Hey, Larry. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two quick ones for me. So I'd just be curious
to get your comments on the demand for allocation funds from segmented into institutional and retail demand. So as
you think about financial advisors and you think about institutions, where's kind of the increase or decrease at the
margin in pickup in demand and how your EM Allocation Fund is fitting in within that so far as well?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: You mean the EM Allocation Fund that we did discuss? So where we see clients looking for
BlackRock to do the allocation, these are generally fiduciary mandates where we are working alongside with them and
we are working with them. And we're seeing a rise in fiduciary types of businesses. But I mean principally these
allocation types of products are retail-oriented products. That's what they're designed for. That's where we're seeing in
the RIA channel and other channels where clients are looking to have these types of products.
In Global Al, obviously that's a very large-scale retail product and it's expanding now in the RIA channel in itself. And
so one should not expect large-scale institutional monies moving into these type of products. But for those clients who
are looking for investor decisions as a fiduciary, that will continue to be a larger business of ours. In fact, in this week's
P&I there's a whole article about fiduciary business, talking about how that's a growth area in the investment
management business. So that's where we're going to continue to see that.

And the other area where we see it, Matt, is in our defined contribution and our LifePath business where, as I said
earlier, we had another $4 billion of growth, $7 billion over the quarter. And this is where we are taking that investment
decision or allocation process.
<Q - Matthew Kelley>: Okay. Great. And then as a follow-up, I saw some news out that BlackRock's considering the
launch of a Swiss fund range. So I'm just – I'm curious, and I know that's something you guys touched on in the Swiss
market at your Investor Day, so when you think about that, how have you – what have you set up and what do you still
need to set up? Or are all the pieces in place; now it's just about kind of execution and distribution?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Mark?
<A - Mark Wiedman>: I think what you're referring to is we acquired the Credit Suisse ETF platform. That gave us a
platform in Switzerland. The primary rationale for that was offering Swiss ETFs to Swiss buyers who for tax reasons
can't buy [ph] usage (1:03:48) funds. But it's important to understand that gives us a foundation, which we will be
building on, for offering a broader Swiss complement beyond just ETFs in Switzerland.
<Q - Matthew Kelley>: Okay. Great. And then just to follow up on that. I was actually referring to the broader launch.
I'm not sure if that's something you guys can kind of comment on.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, I mean Switzerland, we continue – we're a big believer in Switzerland. We believe,
whether it's in Swiss francs, whether it's specifically the investment management platform that we have in Switzerland,
our – I think you're referring to our Swiss country manager spoke about launching of some Swiss-oriented product,
Swiss based, and that's just a continuation of our desire to build a stronger presence in Switzerland.
<Q - Matthew Kelley>: Excellent. Thanks for the clarification, and for taking my questions.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Yep.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Worthington>: Hi. Good morning. First on sort of Barclays AG versus unconstrained, how much
capacity do you think there is in this unconstrained market? It seems very intuitive that you'd see this switch from core
to alternative, but I guess is there enough supply to absorb this meaningful potential demand?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: From my perspective, the investment process is no different than managing an AG.
Obviously it requires more flexibility and a lot more technology, making sure you're managing to the level of risk that
you want to take. But there are many competitors in this product. JPMorgan has a great product; PIMCO has a product,
our product.
So I believe the capacity as an industry is in the trillions. I think this is going to be a very large component of the future
bond market. And I look to the key participants to be a big player in it. We happened, as you noted in your research
report, we have really great one- and three-year performance, and we continue to drive great performance in this area.
And we're continuing to see accelerated flows in these products.
<Q - Kenneth B. Worthington>: Great. Thanks. And then 2Q, I think as you opened your prepared remarks, saw two
very different markets. April and May was very different than June, and I think it was mentioned that the tone with
many clients has not changed. But I assume with some clients it has changed. I'd say maybe first, with which clients
has the conversations or the tone changed? And what actions do you expect them to take because of the change in rate,
particularly on the unintuitive side? So you mentioned like Barclays AG to unconstrained, but I guess are there other
areas where you're seeing leading indicators for change, whether it be like dividend stocks or real estate or FX products
by retail or institutional? So any other things worth highlighting there outside of the unconstrained versus Barclays

AG?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Yeah. I think when we see these shifts added to – when you see 100 basis point movements
in rates, you certainly have an accelerated dialogue with your clients. So even our most deliberate of clients we're
looking at long-term solutions. They require a lot of handholding also. And they ask many questions, but overall as I
said, institutionally we did not see much behavior change. As I've said and you reiterated, the dialogue we're having
related to movement out of core products into unconstrained is one consistent dialogue, but I would say two or three
more trends that we had with our clients.
One is we continued to see more questions related to bar-belling. The volatility reminds clients, it frightens clients that
markets can move very rapidly, very violently. So bar-belling becomes a bigger component of what the clients are
asking. They're looking. As a result of that we have not seen any slowdown in the use of index products or beta
products. We are also seeing more and more clients looking for more uncorrelated type of products, equities, fixed
income and other types of products. So some of our alternative products we have lot of dialogue on that.
But the key that I think you see every time you have these bouts, clients have to relook at how much illiquidity they
could afford. And so one of the key things, one of the key things that I think clients why they're moving towards more
beta products is these bouts of illiquidity frighten them, and you just have more structural liquidity in index-based
products. And that trend has not changed.
The other thing that – but on the same side as a indication of the bar-belling, we have more than $3 billion of illiquid
commitments in our pipeline. So we continue to see the same type of behavior, but the need for handholding, the need
to talk about long-term solutions became more and more apparent during these bouts of illiquidity and during the great
change in rates and the psychology of rates.
But we have not seen much behavior change in dividend stocks. I think globally you still continue to – you'd didn't see
any real outflows in dividend stocks as an industry. I think they were a great example of showing less beta – certainly
show less beta on the upside, and they showed less beta downside during the market setback, and now we're back to
almost close to the highs again. Ken, the key for us is to provide consistency in our messaging to our clients. And as I
said, our handholding has to be consistent, and we have to be – we have to talk to our clients above the noise.
Now in ETFs, I think Mark and his team had – because Mark and the team deals with lot of clients who were more in a
component of the iShares is more the fast trading people, his team had to have very different dialogues. So it really –
once again, it speaks loudly of the diversity of our clients at BlackRock, but the core institutional client behavior didn't
change. Obviously, we saw a lot of handholding need in retail.
And probably the greatest handholding needs were in the iShares area, where we saw the extreme volatility where
people were using these products for beta exposure, and in the case of June it was negative beta exposure, not positive
beta exposure. And that's okay.
<Q - Kenneth B. Worthington>: Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hey, Luke.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: You've touched a lot already on the ongoing debate about whether ETFs help or hurt
liquidity during times of stress, I think particularly within asset classes like fixed income where underlying OTC
liquidity is thin and getting thinner.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Yup.

<Q - Luke Montgomery>: If I could ask you to be as objective as possible, to what extent would you acknowledge
that we're in uncharted territory? This is an open question, and do you think the naysayers make any good points? And
what could wrong here that would damage the reputation of the ETF vehicle in the minds of investors? And what keeps
you up at night?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: This is a great question. I'm going to listen to Mark first, and I'll give my response after.
<A - Mark Wiedman>: Hi, Luke. I think that I would say the first thing is we have learned we have a lot more work to
do in educating clients and other stakeholders about how these vehicles behave, what does the current market price
actually represent versus, as I mentioned net asset values, and the like. So there's a lot of work there to educate people
how the tools work.
The good news is the clients who used the tools are all very happy with how they actually performed. So that's the good
news. But there's a lot of work in educating a very broad group of people, including clients, about how the actual
vehicles work. I think one of the things that I think is underlying is that expectations of market liquidity and ETFs
require a little bit of clarification.
The minimum liquidity of an ETF is the underlying liquidity of the asset class less arbitrage cost. That's the minimum
liquidity. So if the underlying is illiquid, the ETF itself also might be illiquid. But some ETFs create additional
secondary liquidity, which Larry mentioned [ph] in regard to (1:13:14) EEM, for example, $5 billion. We see it every
day with our Russell 2000 product, IWM, which trades huge sums every day, which you could never trade in the
underlying. So there's additional liquidity creation. Those are the kinds of – that distinction there, I think it's important
for people to understand, so if you're trading in a obscure asset class like some, many securities, you should expect that
the ETF...
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: We don't trade in those.
<A - Mark Wiedman>: We don't trade in those. Not yet. Basically that ETF will also be illiquid. It doesn't by just
becoming an ETF have magical liquidity. I think that key distinction is the number one thing we need to get out there in
the marketplace for people to properly understand how these vehicles are supposed to perform.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: I would just add. The markets – there's heightened scrutiny of ETFs right now, which I
actually believe is a good thing. There's no question during the moments of stress there was heightened inquiry related
to the flows and the quality of the markets of ETFs. We welcome this type of scrutiny. It's this type of scrutiny that in
my mind helps us strengthen the market for the future.
I'm not here to suggest I don't lose sleep over our commitments in the ETF market. It is a large commitment. We have a
lot of responsibility for the fluidity of this market, for the success of this market and I don't take that responsibility
lightly, and I know Mark and his team does not take that responsibility lightly.
We believe the potential ETFs, as we stated in some of BlackRock research, will be greater than $2 trillion. We believe
this will continue to grow, and so that responsibility is only a greater assure that this market performs as we describe, as
Mark suggested through quite a lot of education. And education can go only so far, but we need to make sure that our
regulators are updated continuously. We have to make sure that all our competitors are taking that fiduciary
responsibility as importantly as we do.
We need to make sure that the quality of the products can withstand the test of time, the test about illiquidity and the
test of time of variances in the markets. If we can achieve that, the trends that we see by investor behavior, the ETF
market will be more than $2 trillion, which is a great opportunity for the entire market. Mark is now telling me $5
trillion.
<A - Mark Wiedman>: Yeah. We're at $2 trillion now globally. We're going to $5 trillion.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: $5 trillion. Excuse me. I knew where the $2 trillion from, but up to $5 trillion. And so there's
a great opportunity to continue to build that. And as I said, from our viewpoint despite the noise, the ETF market
performed very well, especially when you consider the underlying illiquidity.

And it's so important to note, and I just want to – I have to reiterate it because I think that point was not understood: the
fact that we were able to trade $5 billion at EEM without creating or redeeming at $5 billion of market liquidity. So you
didn't have to put $5 billion of stocks into the marketplace, and I think that's a very important component of these
products. And I should also remind people, when you have at the end of the day big inflows or outflows of mutual
funds, you don't have that recreate and redeem; that then results if there's redeems; that then creates outflows and stock
pressure.
So let's not think of iShares or ETFs as something very different. It's just flowing 24/7 or during the market time
opening, whereas in the mutual fund side it's at the end of the day. I'm just trying to say the markets are very similar:
one's just much more transparent. But having the ability to do that creates and redeem through the market makers is a
very powerful differentiating feature.
I think that's the last of the questions, operator. Is that correct?
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?
Laurence D. Fink
No. As I said repeatedly, what makes me very proud at leading this firm is the diversification of our platform, our
multi-client platform, having multi-products, global distribution, risk management. In times where we saw big outflows
in one business we saw big inflows in another business really illuminates how this platform has been built, and really
allows us to be a very differentiated player in the world of investing.
Thank you, everyone. Thank you for your patience. Thank you for your – for all the time you've given us today. Have a
good quarter.
