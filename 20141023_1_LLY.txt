During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current
expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors including those listed on slide three
and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our
products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not
sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Before we cover our third quarter results in detail, I'd like to provide some high level comments about where I see our
company at this important juncture. Losing patent protection in relatively rapid succession for Gemzar, Zyprexa,
Cymbalta and Evista created an unprecedented challenge for Lilly. Leading up to and through this period of patent
expirations, our management team made disciplined choices so that we could invest to drive growth in key brands,
geographies and businesses and replenish and advance our pipeline. We stayed focused on executing our strategy, and
I'm proud of the results we've delivered to date.
In the face of a series of major patent expirations we drove strong financial results from the rest of our business. We've
delivered on our promise to maintain our dividend, while at the same time returning additional cash to shareholders via
share repurchase. And the significant progress we've made with our pipeline, reflected in the large number of
regulatory and clinical milestones achieved this past quarter, validates the decision we made to maintain our investment
in R&D.
As we begin to turn the corner with multiple new product launches over the course of this year and next, having
withstood the profound economic impact of patent expirations for four of our largest products, we also recognize we
operate in an ever more challenging external environment. We intend to apply the same focused disciplined execution
of our strategies that we've displayed in recent years in order to succeed. And I'm confident we will.
We aim to compete effectively and to win in Diabetes, Oncology and Animal Health. This includes investing in
successful launches for Jardiance, Trulicity and Cyramza, including important new indications and line extensions and
continuing to drive growth in our Elanco business following the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health. In the near
term and long term, these businesses represent significant growth opportunities for our company that we must
capitalize on.
In our Bio-Medicines business, we have opportunities to drive a subsequent wave of substantial growth in areas that
include auto-immune disorders, with molecules like ixekizumab and baricitinib, cardiovascular disease with
evacetrapib, Alzheimer's disease with solanezumab with other molecules to follow, and in pain with tanezumab and our
CGRP antibody, all dependent on Phase III data readouts that will be accomplished for the next most part over the next
two years.
In R&D, we will sustain the flow from our pipeline and bring ever-more innovative drugs to patients and do so more
quickly and effectively than in the past. On the commercial side of our business, we will continue our quest to find
ever-more efficient and effective ways to engage physicians, patients and payers. And we intend to capitalize on
compelling growth opportunities in Asia in particular, specifically Japan and China.
Going forward we'll remain focused on executing our innovation-based strategy. Focusing in on those areas where we
have strong presence and capabilities or where we determine we can establish a leadership position. We believe this
provides the best opportunity to meaningfully improve patients' lives and create value for shareholders.
With that, let's turn to the key events since last quarter's call. For the second quarter in a row, we launched a new
product. In the second quarter we launched Cyramza in the U.S. for second line gastric cancer. In the third quarter, in
collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we launched the oral SGLT-2 inhibitor, Jardiance, in the U.S. and in certain
European countries. We're optimistic about the potential of this brand, including the opportunities that could come with
being first to market with a fixed dose combination of an SGLT-2 and a DPP-4 as well as being the first SGLT-2 to
report out results from a large cardiovascular outcome study in the second half of next year.
We've also had a large number of positive developments on the regulatory front. In fact, I cannot recall another time in
my 35 years with Lilly so full of positive regulatory actions. In our Diabetes business we achieved regulatory

milestones in the U.S., Europe and Japan for dulaglutide, our once-weekly GLP agonist. Here in the U.S. the FDA
approved dulaglutide, or Trulicity, for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.
Trulicity truly was designed with the patient in mind. It comes in a single-dose pen that does not require mixing,
measuring or needle attachment and can be administered any time of day independent of meals. We're excited to enter
the GLP-1 market with Trulicity and we believe this product can be a catalyst for growth of the class.
We began shipments of Trulicity here in the U.S. earlier this week. In Europe, the CHMP recommended approval of
Trulicity and we anticipate European Commission approval this quarter, with European launches beginning early next
year. In Japan, we submitted dulaglutide for regulatory review and expect regulatory action in the second half of 2015.
The European Commission also approved the Humalog 200 units per milliliter KwikPen for the treatment of diabetes.
This product is bio equivalent to our current product, Humalog 100, and is intended for people with diabetes who take
more than 20 units of rapid-acting insulin per day. In the U.S., we remain on track to resubmit Humalog U-200 by year
end.
In collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we achieved additional regulatory milestones in the last three months. We
received FDA approval of Jardiance, or empagliflozin, a once-daily oral SGLT-2 inhibitor for the treatment of type 2
diabetes. As I mentioned earlier, we launched the product in both the U.S. and Europe during the third quarter. Also in
the U.S. we submitted the fixed-dose combination of empagliflozin and metformin.
In addition, we made progress with our insulin glargine product, as the U.S. FDA granted tentative approval of
Basaglar. With this action, the FDA determined that Basaglar meets all regulatory requirements for approval. However,
it is subject to an automatic stay of final approval as a result of patent infringement litigation filed by Sanofi. The FDA
may not give final approval until mid-2016 unless the court determines the patent is not infringed or is invalid or
unenforceable prior to that time. We are confident that we do not infringe any of the patent claims asserted and that we
will prevail in this litigation.
In Europe, the European Commission granted full approval of our insulin glargine product. This product, called
Abasria, is the first insulin approved using Europe's biosimilar pathway. Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim will launch
our insulin glargine product based on dates that do not infringe valid and enforceable patents.
As you can see, over these past three months we made significant progress advancing our diabetes pipeline, moving
closer to our goal of offering the widest range of diabetes treatments, spanning orals, GLP-1s and insulins, both basal
and mealtime. We feel each of our products will be competitive in its class, putting us in a unique position to help
people with diabetes as well as the physicians who help them manage their disease.
Diabetes wasn't the only area where we saw significant regulatory progress. Our Oncology group has been busy as
well. We achieved regulatory milestones for ramucirumab across all three major geographies. We received a positive
opinion in Europe for ramucirumab in second-line gastric cancer. This opinion included use in combination with
paclitaxel as well as monotherapy use.
As with Trulicity, we anticipate European Commission approval late in this quarter with European launches beginning
early next year. We submitted ramucirumab to Japanese regulators for the treatment of second-line gastric cancer and
were granted a priority review. We expect regulatory action in Japan in the first half of 2015.
And here in the U.S., we submitted ramucirumab to the FDA as a treatment for second-line non-small cell lung cancer.
The FDA assigned a priority review. And we anticipate FDA action before the end of this year. This could lead to a
launch in early 2015.
Keep in mind as well that we have an ongoing FDA review of ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel in
second-line gastric cancer. The action date for this submission is in the first quarter of next year and we expect FDA to
act on or before the action date.
Finally, with FDA having granted fast track status to necitumumab as a first-line treatment for squamous non-small cell
lung cancer, we initiated our rolling submission, which we expect to complete before the end of this year.

Turning now to clinical news. During the quarter, we also had Phase III trials read out in each of our therapeutic
business areas: Diabetes, Oncology and Bio-Medicines. In Diabetes, we announced positive top-line results of two
Phase III clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes for basal insulin peglispro, or BIL, which is being studied as a
once-daily treatment for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In both trials, BIL showed a statistically superior reduction in
HbA1c compared with Lantus. We've now completed the clinical trials for registration and are on track to submit to
U.S. and European regulators by the end of the first quarter 2015.
In Oncology we announced positive top line results for RAISE. This is a Phase III study of Cyramza as second line
treatment in combination with chemotherapy in parents with metastatic colorectal cancer. RAISE showed a statistically
significant improvement in overall survival in patients treated with ramucirumab plus chemotherapy compared to
chemotherapy alone. We expect to initiate regulatory submissions based on these data in the first half of 2015.
This marks the fourth positive Phase III trial in which Cyramza has improved overall survival, two in second line
gastric cancer, one in second line lung cancer, and this one in second line metastatic colorectal cancer.
Finally, in our Bio-Medicines business we announced positive top line results for three Phase III studies of ixekizumab
in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. All primary and key secondary objectives were met in the three
studies. And ixekizumab was superior to Enbrel on all measures of skin clearance in both of the active comparator
trials. In our Phase III trials up to 41% of patients treated with ixekizumab achieved clear skin at week 12 with just one
injection per dose. These results give us confidence that if approved ixekizumab could make complete resolution of
psoriasis possible for significantly more people. We plan to submit ixekizumab to regulatory authorities in the first half
of next year.
We also announced our decision to discontinue development of tabalumab, our anti-BAFF antibody. This decision was
due to insufficient efficacy in two Phase III trials in lupus as well as in a Phase II trial in multiple myeloma.
I'd also highlight at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology, we presented detailed data from
the Phase III REACH trial, studying ramucirumab as a second line treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
after treatment with sorafenib in the first line setting. While the study did not meet its primary end point of improved
overall survival for the full study population, we saw encouraging results in patients with high baseline levels of
alpha-fetoprotein. These data could form the basis of continued study of ramucirumab in this setting.
During the third quarter we completed enrollment in our core registration program for baricitinib in rheumatoid
arthritis. Later in the call Derica will provide you an update of our plans for top line press releases for this program.
We also began Phase III testing for our CDK4/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, as we dosed our first patients in the first of two
breast cancer trials. Dosing in the second breast cancer trial and in a lung cancer trial is anticipated later this quarter.
In business development news we announced an agreement with AstraZeneca to co-develop and commercialize
AZD3293, an oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme, or BACE, inhibitor, currently in development as a potential
treatment for Alzheimer's disease. We recognize the initial milestone of $50 million pre-tax or approximately $0.03 per
share after tax, as a charge to earnings in the third quarter.
We aim to advance this potent BACE inhibitor quickly into a Phase II/III clinical trial in patients with early
Alzheimer's disease. Lilly will lead clinical development while AstraZeneca will be responsible for manufacturing. The
companies will take joint responsibility for commercialization.
In line with our previously announced plans we completed the sale of Lohmann Animal Health feed additives business
to a management-led group. And earlier this week we announced an expansion of our existing research agreement with
Zymeworks to include development of immuno-modulatory by specific antibodies for cancer.
In other news we announced plans to close and sell one of our three manufacturing plants in Puerto Rico. As a result of
this action we expect to record a charge of approximately $170 million pre-tax or approximately $0.16 per share after
tax in the fourth quarter.

The IRS issued final regulations related to administration of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee under the Affordable
Care Act. The final regulations modify the timing of when a company must recognize expense for their share of the fee.
As a result we recognized a $119 million non-tax detectable charge in the third quarter for the fee we expect to pay in
2015. This accounting change has no impact on the timing of cash payments. Also the third quarter charge is excluded
from our non-GAAP results.
Finally, during the third quarter we repurchased shares worth $300 million under our $5 billion share repurchase
program. Since authorizing the program in October of last year we've now repurchased $1 billion worth of our shares.
Combined with our dividend in the last year we've distributed $3 billion to shareholders.
And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil?
Phil Johnson
Thanks, John. First I'll review our GAAP results and then discuss a few non-GAAP measures to provide some
additional insights into the underlying trends in our business.
Moving to slide eight you can see that our Q3 revenue was $4.9 billion, which is 16% lower than Q3 2013. This
decrease in revenue reflects a decline of $1 billion in U.S. Cymbalta sales following the loss of exclusivity in
December last year. In addition U.S. sales of Evista declined over $150 million following that product's loss of
exclusivity in March of this year. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista in the U.S., the rest of our worldwide revenue grew
7%, mainly from volume.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 5.2 percentage points also driven by the loss of U.S. exclusivity for
Cymbalta and Evista. In Q3 both this year and last year, the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory
sold had a minimal impact on cost of sales. Excluding this FX effect from both 2013 and 2014, gross margin as a
percent of revenue declined 4.8 percentage points from 79% in Q3 2013 to 74.2% in Q3 2014. As in past quarters
we've included a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this
FX effect.
Non-GAAP measures are shown on slide nine. Total operating expense defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A
decreased 8% or nearly $235 million versus Q3 of 2013. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses were down
6%, while R&D was down 10%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to the
reduction in sales and marketing activities for Cymbalta as well as our ongoing cost containment efforts. The decline in
R&D expenses was driven primarily by a reduction in late stage development costs, partially offset by a $63 million
charge associated with the termination of tabalumab development. Excluding this charge R&D expenses declined 14%
and total operating expenses declined 10%.
Other income and expense was net income of $93 million in Q3 2014 compared to a net expense of $31 million in the
third quarter 2013 with the change driven primarily by gains on the sale of certain equity holdings and income from
miscellaneous milestones earned.
Our non-GAAP tax rate of 22%, an increase of 1.5 percentage points compared to Q3 last year. The main reason for
this increase in the tax rate is the lapse of the R&D tax credit at the end of last year.
At the bottom line net income and earnings per share declined 41%. As in the first half of the year this decline is
significant, but very much in line with our expectations and places us on track to achieve our full year non-GAAP EPS
guidance.
On slide 10 we provide the same reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted information for our year-to-date results.
Moving to slide 11 you'll find a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS and additional details about our
reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.

As you're aware nearly all of our peers exclude amortization of intangibles from their non-GAAP results, while we
include this expense. For your modeling purposes please note that we recognized amortization expense of $134 million
representing 2.7% of revenue this quarter. Many of you on both the buy side and sell side have noted that our inclusion
of amortization expense in our non-GAAP results distorts comparisons of our financial ratios with those of our peers.
After careful consideration we've decided that we will exclude amortization expense from our non-GAAP results
beginning in 2015. In particular we hope that this change will assist portfolio managers in making better buy-sell
decisions.
Now let's look at how price, rate, and volume affected our revenue growth. On slide 12 you can see the total revenue
decline of 16% in Q3 2014, shown in the yellow box in the middle of the page, and that this decline was almost entirely
driven by volume. Price added about 1% to revenue growth while the impact of FX was nil. Excluding U.S. Cymbalta
and Evista, the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 7% with about 5.5 percentage points of growth coming from
volume and the rest from price.
Touching on some of the geographic highlights. In the U.S. pharma revenue declined 37% driven by a volume decline
of 38%. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista the rest of our U.S. pharma revenue increased 6%, about half from volume and
about half from price.
Pharma revenue in Japan grew 4% with exchange rate masking stronger underlying growth. As you can see volume
was up 10% in Japan and revenue growth in constant currency terms was 9%.
In emerging markets we saw strong growth of 18%, almost all from volume. Sales in our largest emerging markets
country, China, grew 21%. I'd also highlight the consistent strong growth we've seen from our emerging markets
business this year with 14% revenue growth in constant currency terms through the first nine months of the year.
Finally, Elanco Animal Health posted revenue growth of 10%. The Lohmann acquisition drove 6 percentage points of
growth with our base business driving the remaining 4 percentage points. This lower base business growth is due
primarily to competitive pressures and to a lesser extent to slower market growth in the U.S.
Now let me turn the call over to Derica.
Derica W. Rice
Thanks, Phil. On slide 13 you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rate on the growth rates for select items
of our income statement. FX had almost no impact on our revenue or operating expenses this quarter. As Phil
mentioned, FX only had very little effect on cost of sales. As a result the decline in our EPS is very similar with and
without FX.
Slide 14 shows our pipeline as of October 16. As John discussed earlier, Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim received
European approval and tentative U.S. approval for our new insulin glargine product, and the FDA approved Trulicity.
These approvals leave our regulatory review column empty. However this shouldn't last long as we expect to complete
regulatory submissions for necitumumab, basal insulin peglispro, and ixekizumab over the next three quarters.
As mentioned earlier we began Phase III testing for abemaciclib in breast cancer. We began Phase I testing of two
monoclonal antibodies, one for cancer and the other for rheumatoid arthritis, and we added the base inhibitor through
our collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca.
Finally, we terminated development of tabalumab and of a Phase I oncology asset.
Next, let me remind you of our key events for 2014 and review our updated 2014 financial guidance. We're very
pleased with the progress we've made on the key events we laid out for you at the beginning of the year. As you can see
from the green check marks on slide 15, all the possible regulatory actions resulted in timely approvals. And we
achieved nearly all of the other pipeline milestones. It's certainly been a very productive year, and a pivotal one as we
emerge from our YZ patent expiry period and look to return to growth.

Before the end of the year we expect to begin our second Phase III breast cancer study as well as our Phase III lung
cancer study with abemaciclib. We expect to complete the rolling FDA submission of necitumumab for first line
squamous non-small lung cancer. We expect to receive FDA action on ramucirumab for second line non small cell lung
cancer, and we expect to lose European data package exclusivity for Cymbalta in depression, following the loss of data
package exclusivity for stress urinary incontinence in the third quarter. We continue to expect generic duloxetine to
enter the European market in 2015.
Also after discussions with Incyte we've agreed upon our disclosure plan for the Phase III trials of baricitinib and
rheumatoid arthritis. This includes issuing the top line press release for the first trial late this year or early next year. In
addition the top line press release for the final two trials is likely to be issued late next year after completion of the full
52 weeks of treatment.
Clearly we've achieved a great deal in 2014, and we're looking forward to maintaining this momentum both as we close
out the year and during 2015.
Now let's turn to our 2014 financial guidance. Our performance through September places us on track to achieve our
full year non-GAAP EPS guidance, which remains unchanged at $2.72 to $2.80. We are updating our GAAP EPS
guidance, which is now $2.34 to $2.42 to reflect the charges taken in the third quarter as well as those announced for
Q4.
In addition we are updating a number of the individual line items. We've narrowed our revenue range to $19.4 billion to
$19.8 billion, due to the weakening of the euro, yen and pound that occurred late in the third quarter, as well as the
recent competitive pressures and market dynamics in the U.S. we're seeing in Animal Health. Both of these factors
present future headwinds for revenue.
We raised our estimate of the gross margin percent to roughly 74.5%. A major driver of this change is the weakening of
the euro. While that brings a revenue headwind, it does provide a near term benefit on the cost of sales.
In addition a shutdown to implement production changes at one of our bulk insulin plant will now occur solely in 2015
rather than span 2014 and 2015. As a result idle plant, a period manufacturing expense, will ship out of 2014 into 2015
benefiting this year.
In total our operating expense guidance is essentially unchanged, although we have modified the range for the
individual components. We've narrowed and lowered the non-GAAP range for marketing, selling and administrative
expenses to $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion. And we've added a line to reflect GAAP guidance for the same line item, which
includes the $119 million additional pharma manufacturers' fee. We've narrowed and raised the range for research and
development expenses to $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion to reflect the third quarter charge for tabalumab, the BACE deal
with AstraZeneca and trends in our research spending.
Based on the amount of year-to-date other income, we've raised the non-GAAP range for other income and expense to
a range of $200 million to $250 million of income. While our non-GAAP tax rate guidance continues to be
approximately 19%, we're now providing GAAP tax rate guidance of approximately 20%. These tax rates assume a
full-year 2014 benefit of the R&D tax credit and other tax provisions up for extension. If these items are not extended,
both 2014 tax rates would be approximately 2 percentage points higher. Similarly, our expectation for non-GAAP
minimum net income remains unchanged at $2.9 billion and we're now providing our expectation of GAAP minimum
net income of $2.6 billion.
Finally, our guidance for minimum operating cash flow as well as capital expenditures is unchanged. Keep in mind that
our 2014 financial guidance assumes the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health closes in 2015. Should the acquisition
close during 2014, we'll revise our 2014 financial guidance if necessary. On slide 17 we provided a reconciliation
between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2013 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2014
guidance.
Now, before the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up. From a financial perspective, the first nine months of the year
have played out much as we'd expected. We've seen our revenues and earnings decline due to the U.S. patent

expirations of Cymbalta and Evista. We prudently managed expenses, driving a double-digit reduction in our operating
expense base. From a pipeline perspective, we've met or exceeded our expectations. The flow of positive regulatory
and pipeline news has been substantial. And we've launched three new products, Cyramza, Jardiance and Trulicity. The
steady advance of the pipeline strengthens our confidence in our innovation-based strategy and our commitment to
accelerate discoveries to the people who need them. In addition, it positions us well for a return to growth and
expanded margins in 2015 and beyond.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Phil for the Q&A session.
Phil Johnson
Thanks, Derica. Marla, if you could go ahead and provide instructions to the callers for the Q&A sessions, please.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Charles Butler>: Thanks very much. Two questions, if I may. One perhaps to Derica or maybe even to Dave
Ricks, and the second to you, John. The first is really around the sales footprint. You've done a very nice job at keeping
costs down. But the question is with new launches obviously there is the need for additional marketing expense and
maybe additional salespersons. So I'd love for you to, if you could, provide some idea or thoughts around both the U.S.
and non-U.S. footprint with respect to sales individuals.
And then the second, John, is you made a good comment about keeping the dividend at the same rate, especially as you
enter this particular year. But as you move forward with these new launches, have you given some thought to when it's
prudent for the overall business to actually raise that rate? Thanks for the time.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great, Tony. Good to hear your voice and thank you for the questions. For the sales footprint,
Dave, if you don't mind maybe talking about some of the things that have been going on in maybe U.S. and Europe in
terms of some of the restructuring, since you've been very involved in that. And then maybe Enrique and Sue, if you
could talk about some of the preparations for launches since that's hitting you first in terms of the progression of the
pipeline. And then, Derica, if you want to take the question on the plans we have for the dividend, thoughts around the
dividend.
<A - David A. Ricks>: Great, Tony. Thanks for the question. As it relates to the loss of exclusivity products, as we've
been discussing here over the last two years, we've been taking down sales our footprint market-by-market. Typically
those happen in advance of the LOE event. So in the U.S. you're seeing the full-year effect of sales reductions in 2014,
which mostly occurred in 2013 related to Evista and Cymbalta.
As it relates to Europe, our patents are expiring this last quarter we're reporting on now. Some of those actions have
been taken, some have not. But we do anticipate over the next year rationalizing the footprint to the products we have
and Bio-Med not including Cymbalta, of course, being the major contributor.
Going forward, we're quite confident we have the personnel and coverage to launch our new product portfolio
effectively in those major markets. Of course, we're shifting much more to a specialty type business, so the absolute
numbers are lower than what we've had in the past in Bio-Medicines.
Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Sure. So when it comes to diabetes, Tony, we've had a very significant footprint on a
worldwide basis. I think what we have said before is that we basically expect to leverage this footprint. We do see some

increases, but they are limited when it comes to our overall sales force. We've seen some increases in the U.S. but more
marginal when it comes to Europe.
<A - Susan Mahony, Ph.D.>: Yeah, Tony, with regards to Oncology, we're going to be using the footprint that we
have in Oncology. We've got an experienced Oncology sales team globally, very experienced in thoracic oncology and
as well historically in GI. And we'll be using the expertise and the people that we've got globally on the commercial
perspective to launch our products.
<A - Derica W. Rice>: And, Tony, this is Derica. From a dividend perspective, just historically before we entered this
YZ period, our dividend payout ratio was in the 40% range, the mid-40%s. And that's kind of been on par with where
our peers were as well. We knew as we went through this period that we would see a spike in our payout ratio as we
went through this income decline, so the law of the ratio itself.
As it pertains to when we would consider to increasing the dividend going forward, I don't believe we'll wait until we
have to get back to that 40%, 45% range. It's going to be more predicated on our confidence as we see how some of the
pipeline and regulatory and launch news play out over these next couple years.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Derica. Marla, next caller, please.

Thank you. We'll go to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey. Thanks very much for taking my question. It's Mark. If I may, just two quick
ones. Number one, just a clarification. Can you guys clarify what, if any, interim analyses might be available to you for
solanezumab as well as evacetrapib in 2015, again, if any?
And number two, I was wondering if you could speak about the Tradjenta outcomes trial. I'm just wondering if there is
prospectively evaluated end point of hospitalizations for heart failure. This has obviously become an end point of
interest to the physician and the Wall Street community. Thank you very much.
<A - Phil Johnson>: And, Mark, if you're able to still hear me, are you referring to the Tradjenta outcomes study or
studies, or are you referring to the empagliflozin outcome study that we talked about having data for in the second half
of next year?
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Actually both would be nice.
<A - Phil Johnson>: I knew when I asked the question that would probably – all right, we'll certainly accommodate
that. But, Dave, if you could start us off, please, with the interims for sol [solanezumab] and eva [evacetrapib]. Enrique,
do you want to handle the question on the measures for the outcome study? That'd be great.
<A - David A. Ricks>: Yeah, thanks, Mark. On evacetrapib, we have said we will be conducting an interim analysis.
We expect that to be happening some time in the first half of 2015. This is, of course, a safety review, but also includes
some efficacy features. I think as we've said before, it's a reasonably low bar, given that in lipid management studies
quite a bit of the benefit is often seen in the back half of the trial. So we'll of course await that event and communicate
quickly afterward if there's any change to the program. Otherwise, we continue to expect a final readout on that data in
2016.
As it relates to solanezumab, we did build into the protocol a possibility of an interim review. We have not decided to
conduct that or not. One of the key reasons for that is this review needs to be conducted late enough where we have
enough patient exposures. You may remember in EXPEDITION-1 and 2, a lot of the benefit started to accumulate after
40 weeks of exposure. And there's a relationship between the rate at which we've recruited this study and whether
there'd be value in conducting such an assessment or just waiting a short time further for the final result. The study
continues to enroll and so we'll be making that determination some time in the next 12 months.

<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Very good. So just to clarify we are expecting for our empa [empagliflozin] CV trial to
report out next year, and when it comes to Tradjenta in 2018. So a big difference in terms of when we expect the
results.
Both of these trials have similar measures. So we look of course at CV deaths, we look at MI, and we look at stroke. In
addition to that the Tradjenta trial has hospitalization for unstable angina. So those are the prospective measure that we
look at.
We do have the ability to look at hospitalization due to heart failure. This is of course an important measure. We will
know more about the DPP-4 class I think when the TECOS study basically reports out from Merck Sharp & Dohme,
we shall give some clarity in terms of this particular measure.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Marla, next caller, please.
Operator
And next we'll go to Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you. As you near the launch of your Lantus look alike, the insulin glargine
product, I'm hoping you can give us your latest commercial assessment of the opportunity both here in the U.S. and
then in Europe where you'll launch first.
At one point in the past you talked about what you thought could be the market share potential of your product, which
was quite a bit higher than how Sanofi has described it, and they continue to minimize the threat to their product from
your program. When are we going to learn more from Lilly on some of the EU specifics like pricing and exact launch
timing?
And then my second question is on, as we near the end of 2014 and move into 2015, I'm hoping you can qualitatively
describe the pushes and pulls on R&D spending. It seems that you've crossed a lot of milestones with your pipeline and
maybe there could be some easing up on R&D spending, and that's already a trend it seems like that we've started to see
in 2014. So directionally as you think about R&D in 2015, what should we be considering?
<A - Phil Johnson>: Thanks, Tim. So, Enrique, if you'll handle the first question. And then maybe Jan and I will tag
team the second question for you. Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Well on the glargine I don't think that we've discussed before what do we believe is
going to be our share uptake. I think what we have shared is that we expect that glargine will continue to be a very
important product going forward. Clearly there is a very significant opportunity. How biosimilars in Europe or in the
U.S. this glargine follows basically compete and what those dynamics will be, will be critical to see what is going be
the share of the overall biosimilar market. We clearly are not the only one that are coming. We are maybe the first that
will be entering the marketplace.
But clearly for us we like our chances because we do have the commercial footprint, the expertise in diabetes. And the
very extensive manufacturing capacity and devices to make sure that we can provide an excellent customer experience
and be – go toe to toe with Sanofi.
So we do have expectations for this product. We have to recognize that this is a very significant opportunity overall.
And even any type of level of market share can be basically meaningful from a revenue perspective.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Tim, this is Phil on your second question. Just as a preamble we will issue official financial
guidance including R&D spend on January 7 of 2015 for 2015. In that same meeting as we have in the past, we'll talk
about some of the specific, particularly late stage developments that we would expect over the course of the year,
including Phase III starts. So I'll limit my remarks today to some of the things that are sort of already out there and

known in the public.
For pushes and pulls on R&D spend clearly we've had a lot of trials read out this year that will not be continuing into
2015. That does provide some relief in terms of year-on-year compares.
We do have trials that are ramping up for things like abemaciclib, as we'll have all three of those trials enrolling quickly
we expect over the course of 2014, what remains, and 2015. We also pending the full removal of the partial clinical
hold by FDA could be restarting Phase III trials, and a significant number of them, potentially for tanezumab, that
would also add spend in 2015 we did not have in 2014. And then also the collaboration with AstraZeneca for the BACE
inhibitor, which we're excited about. We'd expect more spend in 2015 compared to 2014.
In the past Derica on many occasions has said that going forward roughly we're looking at the sort of $5 billion number
plus or minus a few hundred million dollars likely as the place that we will be. Obviously dependent upon pipeline
outcomes and good investment opportunities in the pipeline.
Jan, do you want to comment maybe on some of the things that are in earlier stage development that you're following
and are very interested in?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: Right. I think we should remember that positive Phase III readouts also triggers additional
opportunities. And we have a number of line extension opportunities and also then new combinations and so on that we
could pursue which we are currently discussing. And this is oncology, diabetes and the [ph] alternative (47:55) space
for instance.
We also are very keen then of sustainability of the pipeline and looking at additional Phase II investments. And here
Oncology have a number of readouts next year including the galunisertib, the TGF-beta compound, the Met mAb, and
several others.
Diabetes we have the Glucagon receptor antagonist, our oral first in class agent. And in the Alzheimer areas, as Phil
said, we have our new BACE program. In addition we also have our plaque-specific antibody N3pG, which will
generate new data. And just to remind you we have also some very intriguing pre-clinical data with combinations of
BACE and N3pG, which actually cause more or less a total clearance of plaque in Alzheimer models.
In the pain area Phil mentioned tanezumab, our NGF antibody, which we are very excited about based on the previous
data in various pain situations. And we need to clear then the situation with the regulators with some additional
pre-clinical safety data.
We have our CGRP antibody, which we are not only testing in migraine prevention but also more recently in
osteoarthritis, since we believe that this could be a pain mechanism that can be applied more generally.
We also are looking upon data from our PCSK-9 antibody and evaluating then the efficacy and so on to see if this could
be the potential best in class molecule in that area.
And blosozumab, as you know, we delayed Phase III start but we are working very much on a new formulation so we
could come back.
And finally we are getting data from myostatin on muscle building. And we have recently reported that this not only
builds muscle mass but also strength. So we have a lot of opportunities coming both on existing [ph] then enemies
(49:59) but also on some of the new ones.

<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great. Thanks for the rest of the questions. Just had two here. First, can you maybe just
elaborate a little bit more on the Animal Health commentary from your press release and the prepared remarks on
increased competitive dynamics? Just trying to understand that a little bit better.
And the second question was on the near-term Diabetes launches. Can you just help set some expectations on how
you're kind of seeing the shape of those launch curves? It seems like we've seen some kind of non-first-in-class primary
care launches that have seen fairly slow initial uptake in first year ramps. And many of these products go on to be very
successful. But I'm just trying to think of, with these opportunities, is that a reasonable way to think about how these
products will launch? Or is there anything that you think about with profiles or that you can do from a payer
perspective that might result in a different kind of uptake curve for these products? Thanks very much.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Thanks, Chris. We'll have Jeff Simmons take your first question, then Enrique take the second.
Jeff?
<A - Jeffrey N. Simmons>: Great. Chris, thank you for the question. I'll start kind of at a high level, Chris. As you
know Lilly has been very intentional and strategic about its Animal Health business. We've outpaced the industry in
growth the last six years. We intend this year to be at or above industry growth rates. As you saw our growth driven by
both Lohmann as well as organic growth that we'd seen in our existing business.
But as Derica mentioned, there's two competitive pressures that were anticipated. And they are both first in the
companion animal space, seeing a couple new competitive entrants as well as we've seen a market actually not grow as
anticipated. That was driven by, one, cooler weather, and then second is a little bit more movement into the OTC
channels.
On the food animal side we've seen market growth not be quite as aggressive as it was last year. Some of that is as you
know the swine virus has dropped pig population around the world anywhere from 7% to 10%. And some of the – just
some of the natural dynamics in the market.
I would say the other thing that materially impacted us was Zilmax last year went off the market, and we saw 1.5% or
so growth in our food animal business by filling this gap in the marketplace. And so year-to-year that had impacted our
growth rate as well.
But overall we feel very good, acquisition growth, international growth, and innovation growth will allow us to see in
the medium- and long-term at or above industry growth rates.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Jeff. Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Good. Thanks. Maybe some comments on the structure of the market, which I think in a
certain way impacts how we basically view the uptakes of new products. And this is regardless of whether the product
is first in class or second or third in the class.
First, I think when we look at access, about 50% of the market in the commercial space, 50% of the market basically is
available for access when it comes to new products. First in class, second in class, third in class, you're likely going to
be on a lower tier when it comes to the copay, but it is not off formulary.
About 25% of the market in the commercial space is going have some sort of restrictions. So step edits or some sort of
restriction that goes beyond just the copay.
And about a quarter of the market, the rest of the market basically is off formulary. So we need to take that into account
as we look at the uptake of new products in today's world.
In Part D the situation is different, because it basically takes a lot longer to be able to get into the part D formulary. And
it's not as simple to be able to get into a part D formulary in the middle of the year.
Now as we look at uptake for our products, we look at our performance. We've seen the plans when we have access of
course. We also look at our overall performance. But as I look at empagliflozin, as I look at the issue of these two class,
I have to say that I'm very encouraged by the uptake of this class. Not just the overall volume of prescriptions that we

basically see, but we basically have seen an acceleration of the uptake with the additional players coming into the
market. So that to me is very encouraging.
But not only is the quantity of prescriptions interesting, but I think the dynamics of those prescriptions, because they
are coming at the expense of sulfonylureas, so primarily the substitution that is happening is for when it comes to new
patients, our patients instead of going into an SU [sulfonylurea], they are going to SGLT2. That to me I think is
extremely interesting, because there's the SUs today after metformin continue to be very widely used.
So I'm very encouraged by the uptake of the class. It is early for me to make much, many comments about Jardiance,
but I will say based on six, seven weeks that we're in the market that we're off to a strong start.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Enrique. Marla, if we could have the next caller, please.
Operator
Yes. We'll go to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes. Thanks very much. Thank you. I have three questions. First, with respect to the SG&A
outlook, should investors expect SG&A to decline or stay [indiscernible] (55:46) in 2000 and...
<A - Phil Johnson>: David, you're cutting out. We can barely hear you.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Sorry about that. Is this better?
<A - Phil Johnson>: Yes, it is.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Okay. Great. So the first question is with respect to the SG&A outlook, should investors
expect SG&A to decline in 2015 or stay flat? Second, with respect to the earnings impact from the Novartis Animal
Health acquisition in 2015, could you just review what you've stated previously? And also comment on the amount of
amortization that Lilly will exclude? And then third, could you just provide some perspective on the variables that will
impact your decision over the next year regarding whether or not to take an interim look at the solanezumab data?
Thank you.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Okay. Thanks for the questions. We'll have Derica handle the first two. And then, Dave, you want
to do the third please or – okay. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Hi, David. In regard to the SG&A outlook, I'm not in the position to provide you 2015
guidance at this point. As Phil said, we will have a more extensive dialogue around that on January 7. So if you'll just
kind of live with this till then.
And then likewise also in terms of the earnings impact anticipated from the Novartis Animal Health, until we actually
close the deal, which we anticipate being some time in 2015, we're really not in a position to talk about that at this
stage. What we did say at the time we announced the deal is that by 2017, we would expect to have achieved at least
$200 million of benefit – of synergistic benefit that would result in a cost savings. As well as we should be able to get
back to our historical levels of profitability in that 2017 and 2018 timeframe, which for our Animal Health business has
been at that 25% roughly level of profitability.
As it relates to amortization, what we can talk about at this stage is the amortization that we're seeing in our base
business today. Obviously it will be eventually impacted once we close the Novartis Animal Health deal.
But in this quarter alone we had $134 million of amortization expense in Lilly's result. And on an annual basis it's about
$500 million, $540 million. And then obviously if we're able to close the Novartis Animal Health deal that number will
grow or get bigger as a result of that acquisition.

<A - David A. Ricks>: Yeah, I think there was an earlier question on this as it relates to the sola [solanezumab] interim
review. We do have a feature to potentially conduct such a thing.
But the primary – there's many reasons why we would pull that trigger or not. But the primary one relates to patient
exposure versus the amount of time left in the study. So you may recall in EXPEDITION-1 and -2 most of the drug
impact appeared to occur after week 40. And so what you'd want is enough patients with at least that exposure to
conduct the appropriate statistical analysis.
On the other hand if the study enrolled very quickly, it wouldn't be so wise to use alpha to take that look. I think our
current situation for – some investors know, is that the study is enrolling quite well. And so we're not in a position to
make a statement about whether we would conduct an interim review or not, but those are the considerations we would
weigh. And sometime next year we'll have something to say about that.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Dave.
Before we go to next caller I'm sure that our Chief Accounting Officer Don Zakrowski is listening. So I do want to go
ahead and just set expectations. When we provide guidance on January 7, we will still have to make high-level
assumptions about how we'll allocate purchase price and what the financial impact will be to both reported and
non-GAAP results for 2015.
It will be later in the year that we'll actually be able to finalize those numbers, so you should expect that there could be
some variance. Hopefully it's not very large, but some variance on specific line items or the amount of purchase price
allocated to intangibles that are being amortized.
So again we'll do a great job I'm sure with our accounting group to get as close as we possibly can for our guidance.
But you may see some variability as we go through the year and finalize the accounting for the transaction.
Marla, if we could have the next caller please?

Yes. We'll go to line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. Good morning. I have a few. First, emerging markets growth was quite strong. Is that
based on early benefits of your new commercial model? Or are there other factors we should be aware of that might be
shorter-term in nature?
On the pipeline how's the BACE inhibitor from AstraZeneca different from your prior experience and perhaps from
Merck's approach?
And lastly on your PCSK-9, Jan, you indicated you would assess to see whether it could be best-in-class. Are you
setting the bar that high because of the expense? Or could you shed some more light on what you think about your
PCSK-9 inhibitor based on what you've seen to date? And what's sort of the go, no go decision it will be based upon?
Thanks.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Gregg, great, thanks for the questions. Chito, we'll have you take the first one on the emerging
markets growth. And then, Jan, if you'll take the BACE and PCSK-9. And, Dave, if you have any comments to add to
the PCSK-9, feel free to do that as well. Chito?
<A - Alfonso G. Zulueta>: Good to have the first question for the emerging markets for the year. So delighted to have
the question.
We're obviously thrilled to see the strong growth for the quarter and year-to-date. Let me make sure everybody
understands so that part of that strong growth is driven by a tender that we won for Humulin in Brazil. And a few
one-time items with regards to China in our anti-infectives business, the underlying business is growing at around 8%

to 9%, solid growth. The key drivers, again, would be China, really our Diabetes business, strong growth in Latin
America and pockets within the Middle East.
Our fastest growing product, if you exclude Humulin because of the tender, is actually Forteo, which is growing at
24%, 25% year-to-date. We think there's a lot more opportunity there, but so has Humalog. So with the Diabetes
opportunity in China and emerging markets, Humalog is growing over 20%.
I think it's early to say that the actual new commercial model is having an impact. Clearly, I'm seeing across all our
affiliates that the move to non-traditional, non-sales force alternative channels is taking shape, where we're seeing a
significant growth in our interactions with customers using the digital channels, which I think are, from our perspective,
more effective and, in fact, more efficient.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thank you.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Jan?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: Okay. The BACE inhibitor from AstraZeneca is also an oral compound, and it's
non-selective BACE-1, BACE-2 agent, which is similar then to our previous agents and also the Merck inhibitor now
in Phase III. This agent has Phase I data showing a dramatic A beta lowering in cerebrospinal fluid, which is a good
indication that they'll now target engagement in the CNS.
What we need now is longer exposure data in patients in Phase II before starting Phase III to exclude that we see
similar effects as we had on the liver or potentially other side effects, remembering that this class needs a strong safety
component. But we are very encouraged by the data we have seen so far. But, again, we need longer safety exposures
before we can start Phase III.
In relation to PCSK-9, I think we are all very enthusiastic about this class based on initial Phase III data from several
competitors, including some preliminary data on positive MACE outcomes. Therefore, for us I think being behind, we
will have a very high hurdle on this agent looking at what is the LDL lowering efficacy, how long is the duration of
effect and what about injection convenience, the volume and the regiment and so on. And we have not yet made those
evaluations.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. Thank you, Jan. Marla, next caller, please.

Go to line of John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. First question just has to do with your gross margin going
forward on your insulin lines in particular. There's some ongoing manufacturing changes that you're making to improve
the efficiency of your production of your insulins when you benchmark yourself against your competitors. How much
of an improvement do you think we might be able to see on the gross margin line from that and the timing of that as it
filters through?
Second question in autoimmune. It would appear that you have couple of assets there that could be ideally positioned to
compete in somewhat highly competitive markets. How should we be thinking about an autoimmune build out and the
implications of that for 2015?
And then just the last question on Alimta. Any update in Europe on either the German or the UK appeals? Thanks.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. John, thanks for the questions. So we'll cycle among the three business unit presidents.
Enrique, if you take the first question, the gross margin for insulins. Dave, for the commercial support for autoimmune
platform going forward. And then, Sue, if you'd like to handle the European situation for the Alimta challenges. So,
Enrique?

<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: So improving our gross margin for our insulin portfolio I think is critical to us. We are in
the process of executing our insulin technical agenda to be able to do that.
What we have shared in terms of the benefits and improvement is that we should start seeing some benefit, but it's
limited in 2015, and more fully in 2016. Over time because of learning curves and so forth, we do expect this to be very
significant. And we have shared that our gross margin for insulin should improve by several percentage points over
time. So a very important initiative for us. And also is one that gives us flexibility when we look at our facilities being
able to produce different types of insulin. So important initiative and we are very much on track to deliver what we've
been expecting.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Yeah, John, thanks for the question. We're obviously very excited about our possibilities in
autoimmune. I would point out that each of the products have their own marketplace, and so although they may fit into
a therapeutic area that's quite broad, we'll be competing against different products in each case.
We've announced in the quarter, last quarter, ixekizumab's data, and we were very pleased with the fact that it met all
of the 10 points in a very strong way. We are working extremely hard right now to get that submission to the FDA in
the first half of 2015. And we're encouraged by the possibilities for the IL-17 class, but also about the possibility for us
to have a differentiated product within that class and really successfully be able to move patients to the possibility of
complete clearance of plaque psoriasis or a significant portion of them, which is what we understand patients want.
The build out for that business is, as I mentioned on a previous question, not as significant in terms of people and
organization, but it is significant in terms of capability. So the company is hiring from the outside, we're building
medical infrastructure, patient support infrastructure, as well as selling resource to do that. We plan to be completely
prepared to compete with the strongest players in the psoriasis sector at the time of launch.
Baricitinib, we anticipate data soon. I think as Derica mentioned, we will likely have a top line release on the first study
over the next few months. And this also will be in a very competitive space in RA. We see baricitinib as a potentially
disruptive technology in that space and one in which we could really change expectations for the treatment of RA for
many patients.
We'll wait for the data, of course, which will further inform our strategy. But we will also compete effectively in areas
of medical sales and patient support across that product and plan to play to win in RA, assuming the data supports a
submission for baricitinib.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Dave. Sue?
<A - Susan Mahony, Ph.D.>: With regards to the Alimta patent situation in Europe, as a reminder, the European
Patent Office ruled in our favor in terms of validity. And that is being appealed. We still do not have a date for a
hearing with regards to that.
On the infringement, the German case that was ruled for us is being appealed and a date has been set for March of next
year. And in the UK, where the English High Court ruled against us, and that covered France, Italy and Spain, that is
also being appealed with a date set for March of next year.

And the second question is on the BACE inhibitor. There would seem to be three possible reasons why you did this
deal with Astra. The first is that you fear that Merck is too far ahead of your own pre-clinical candidate. The second is
that you see some weakness in the Merck agent. Or the third is that you need a BACE to combine with your other
agents internally. Any thoughts on which of those is most likely? Thank you.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great, Steve. Thanks for the questions. We'll have Derica take your first question. And then,
Dave, if you want to take lead maybe on the BACE inhibitor question. Jan, feel free to chime in as well. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Hi, Steve. We left the guidance range unchanged essentially to say that our business in totality,
in aggregate, we see as being unchanged at this stage. We did modify some of the line items. As you saw, we raised the
bottom end of our R&D. We lowered the top end of SG&A. But in total, we believe that our total OpEx will stay about
in line with what we expected for the year.
And then likewise, we're dealing with some of the top-line headwinds as it relates to rate when you think about our
outlook for the remainder of the year. So overall we felt comfortable with the guidance range that we had. There was
nothing behind or anything beyond that to read into the no change to our EPS guidance range.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Thanks, Derica. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Yeah, Steve, thanks for the question. On the BACE deal, we're very excited about the
collaboration with Astra, not only because we like the asset, we like the space, but also we get a very complementary
type of alliance with AstraZeneca on this.
You mentioned three reasons why we might be interested. I think those are all good reasons. There may be a few
others. This product is clearly ahead of our own internal efforts given the setback we had in 2013 on our own clinical
stage program. It is different in terms of the approach to BACE inhibition from a chemistry perspective. So that's a
good thing. With Merck's program, we of course watch that carefully. We do think there's opportunity for
differentiation and a best-in-class approach, even if it's not first-in-class.
And as Jan mentioned previously, we are excited by – I would say we anticipate a combination therapy, particularly
antibody, small molecule combinations in the treatment of Alzheimer's, will become the norm. And so having as many
of these mechanisms as possible as probably a good thing for combination studies and offering more value to our
customers.
So amongst these three, it's really all of the above, Steve. They're all good reasons to do this deal, and we're excited by
it. We have a aggressive plan for development, and we'll give you further updates into next year on that.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Okay.
<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: And just a final comment on the mechanist, which as you probably know, have a genetic
validation, where people in Iceland then who has the mutation in his BACE cleavage site of APP actually are protected
against dementia and live very long. So I think that seems to be a very attractive option to mimic

Go to Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Great. Thanks for the questions. So first, Derica, can you be a little bit more specific on
the percent of the gross margin benefit from FX versus the plant shutdown delay? I presume that the plant shutdown
delay would then kind of recur or be delayed into the 2015. So just trying to get a sense of what the magnitude of that
difference would be. And if that would be a repeat delay, or if it's something that you would expect then to kind of – it
shifted to 2015 and then it shifted again to 2016. So really there's just a benefit this year, but we need to kind of
anticipate a differential but not a double hit in 2015.

Second question, in terms of your expectations for U.S. coverage and access relative to Trulicity, I was just hoping that
you could give us a little bit of color on your hopes for overall access, unrestricted access, and Medicare coverage.
For Dave the key differentiating features of Xeljanz – versus Xeljanz with baricitinib that are hoped for in the product
profile.
And then lastly for Susan maybe ramu [ramucirumab] approval. It's possible that we could see second line lung
approval in the fourth quarter this year. How should we think about the pace of uptake, the percentage of second line
lung patients likely eligible for therapy, and a duration of real world therapy in that context. Thanks a lot.
<A - Phil Johnson>: I think I've got that down, Seamus. So we've got the percent gross margin benefit coming from
FX versus the shutdown. We'll have Derica obviously handle that one. So then the U.S. access outlook for Trulicity,
Enrique; Xeljanz versus baricitinib profiles, Dave; and then Sue, the ramucirumab approval, some of your thoughts on
the pace of uptake and the percent that could be eligible on the second line. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Sure. Hi, Seamus. In regards to our gross margin revised guidance for the remainder of the
year, what's the primary driver is the benefit, or the FX benefit. So we get a top-line headwind, but we get a tailwind in
terms of the cost of sales impact when you include the FX impact on the inventories expected to be sold during that
period.
As it relates to the shutdown, it is a benefit in this year. We do expect to be more on a normal cycle next year. So this
is, we would view as a kind of a one-time movement. So we wouldn't expect to see 2015 shutdowns being – scheduled
shutdowns being pushed out.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great thanks, Derica. Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Yeah, Seamus, I won't be able to give you what our access goals are for Trulicity. But I
will share once again that as we look at the Diabetes space, regardless of class as we – and regardless of order, what we
basically see is that in about 50% of commercial space, we're able to get access. Maybe with a higher copay, but it is
access. And we believe that we can very much compete in that space and most companies can.
In about 25% of that space you have step edits in some cases. In the GLP-1 class this is going a step edit over GLP-1.
So you have to be on a GLP-1 before you could maybe go on the new GLP-1 that is launching in this particular case,
Trulicity. And in about 25% of the commercial markets, there's really no coverage until basically the PNT makes a
formal decision to be able to do that.
On Medicare, on Part D I think the situation is different because of the schedules. And while we are working to try to
get coverage some time in 2015 I think, the discussions are typically around 2016 coverage for Part D and whether we
can maybe accelerate that into 2015.
I have to say that we have been having discussions with payers around Trulicity, and I do believe that we have a very
strong value proposition, and that's basically what our payers are sharing with us
<A - Phil Johnson>: Thank you, Enrique. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Yeah, thanks for the question. Obviously the big caveat on all this is we need to see the Phase
III data from our program, and we're looking forward to that first study top lining here in the next several months.
Which is, as a reminder, is the TNF-IR study, so these will be refractory patients to TNF therapy. There's a complete
program which also spans pre-biologic patients as well as a head-to-head against Humira, which is our structure study
and is fully powered for non-inferiority.
So one feature that could be different from tofacitinib is the clinical program. We built this program looking at our own
Phase II data but also what they had conducted. And we are optimistic that it will yield the kind of label should these
studies demonstrate the effect we saw in Phase II, they'll be very competitive in the RA market for us.

Of course also we have a different, although they're both JAK inhibitors, we have different receptor activity. We are
selective that JAK1/2 pathway whereas tofacitinib is not. It's a pan-JAK inhibitor. This may manifest in different side
effects or effects. And again the clinical program will have to bear that out.
Recall as well that we are very happy with our dose, our ability to select a dose that yielded a very significant efficacy
result as published in our Phase II studies, really with the side effect profile that we think is quite appropriate for the
RA patients and competitive with biologics, yielding the possibility of an oral medicine with biologic-like efficacy.
And so head-to-head comparisons haven't been conducted. But for instance if we look at our competition, which was
unable to gain EMA approval really based on lack of effect at the 5 milligram dose, we think that could also be
different.
Ultimately in this class for early uptake as well, the overall safety profile emerging from the Phase III program will be
essential to look at. We don't have that data in front of us but have been conducting regular data monitoring committee
meetings and have been pleased that there haven't been any changes made to the program.
So we'll wait for our data to come out. The way we designed this was to have a differentiated profile and really be able
to present to the market something that could change expectations for patients who suffer from RA.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Thanks, Dave. Sue?
<A - Susan Mahony, Ph.D.>: Yeah, Seamus, with regards Cyramza, clearly we're very happy to not only have a
positive Phase III study with Cyramza in second line lung cancer but also to get the priority review. So we are hoping
that will get an action by the end of this year and be ready to launch next year.
Regarding uptake, clearly I can't give you full details of that. But I will say a few things. Firstly, this is the first agent to
show a benefit in a broad patient subset, both in the squamous and the non-squamous in second line setting.
So and we have a good experience with thoracic oncology with Alimta in first line and this would now be in
broad-based second line. So we're excited by opportunity that we've got with this agent in the second line study. And
clearly our plan is to ensure that we have a successful launch.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. Marla, could we have next caller, please?
Operator
Yes. We'll go to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Wow. Thank you. I appreciate it. John, you've been quiet on this call. I have a question for you.
On the last earnings call a lot of us asked you whether or not you were interested in a tax inversion deal. And in
hindsight very smartly you said you weren't. And congratulations. It's been a mess out there.
But I'm just curious what your Washington folks are telling you about prospects for corporate tax reform with the
midterm election in a couple of weeks, looks like prospects for Republicans to gain control of the Senate look pretty
promising. Who knows? It's pretty close. But just how should we think about potential changes to the tax rate form,
which will even the playing field for U.S. companies relative to foreign enterprises. Thanks.
<A - John C. Lechleiter>: Jami, thanks for your question. Up to this point I've been delegating effectively here. But
you got me.
I think on tax reform, obviously a lot depends on what happens in November and some of the subsequent dynamics.
And of course what else is happening in this crazy world we live in.
I think I could say and our guys in Washington would say we're cautiously optimistic that the next two years will bring
about some sort of meaningful tax reforming. I've never seen an issue where I go around and talk to people in both
parties, and everybody's in agreement that we've got a lousy system now that makes American companies less
competitive. People seem to agree on the fact that we need a lower rate, and that a territorial system of some kind

would make sense. There's not unanimity on that, but I think there's – you get fair degree of alignment.
And then we get into the details and that's where the devil is. I mean some companies are capital intensive, some are
R&D intensive, some have the bulk of their operations here, some like Lilly are sort of equally divided between the
U.S. and o-U.S.
So I don't think there's a necessarily easy answer, even if we all agree that the status quo really doesn't represent sound
policy and doesn't really put the U.S. on the best possible footing to be competitive.
So we're going to keep pushing for it. We're going to keep talking about it. And as I say I think I believe there is a
window over the next two years, and I think you're going to see a lot of companies not just Lilly really beating on this
drum as well, Jami.

Operator
Yes. We'll go to the line of Vamil Divan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. So just a couple more on the BACE inhibitor, which
we've discussed quite a bit already. But one is just a very simple question. I didn't understand why you guys listed it on
Phase I on your slide show, in your pipeline I think it was slide 14, when there's already a Phase II-III study that's
ongoing that you guys talked about. At least the Phase II part has already started. So just a simple question there.
And then my other question just related to that study, I couldn't tell from reading the description if you guys are
actually using your Amyvid imaging agent to screen patients, at least those who might have mild AD for entry in that
study. And if you could just clarify if you are or are not, and if not, why not?
And then one other quick one if I could on the Diabetes side with the basal insulin peglispro. I saw that there was a top
line release you guys put out earlier. But if you can just hear this, and at this point now that you've seen some of the
Phase III data internally, what group of patients you think would be the best candidates for that drug, especially given
some of the side effects where we're seeing there on the triglycerides and some of the changes in HDL and LDL.
Thanks.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great, Vamil. Thanks for the questions. I'll go ahead and take your first one the phase of
development for the BACE inhibitor. Dave, if you'd like the second question on the trial itself, and then Enrique for
basal insulin peglispro.
So I believe both AstraZeneca and Lilly follow a similar process for calling something a Phase II asset, and that's when
the first efficacy dose, the first dose of the drug, is actually administered to a patient. We do expect that will happen in
the near term. Just recently that trial has started to screen patients. Should they pass those screens, then after a certain
period, they will receive their first dose. So it should not be too long into the future that you will see that formally
change I think for both Astra and Lilly to show as a Phase II asset. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Yeah, there are many design features in the Phase II-III program we've incorporated, learnings
from our past failures and observations in disease modification in Alzheimer's. Among those include screening patients
for the presence of amyloid plaque. There are many other things. And this is I think why the collaboration makes sense
for AstraZeneca and us to harvest those learnings and – but build that into a BACE program and ultimately try to
maximize the probability of success. So yes we're conducting screens on these patients.
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Well when it comes to our basal insulin peglispro, we have conducted our studies across
Type 1 and Type 2 NICE patients switching from glargine and also in combination with the mid-term insulin and so
forth. So we have a wide spectrum of studies.

I think consistently what we have seen is superiority when it comes to hemoglobin A1c. And as you mentioned
triglycerides and – we are encouraged I think when we look at some of the CV data in terms of – and what we have
shared so far is that we have already excluded – when we look at our trials, we have already excluded the 1.3
[indiscernible] (1:27:05) ratio, and that our observed has a ratio when it comes to the CV events, is basically below 1.
So we are pretty excited in terms of what this product would offer patients. Now specifically to your question, how did
the benefit risk vary across different patient types, I think this is a discussion that we can have when we basically
disclose the detailed data at the ADA.
