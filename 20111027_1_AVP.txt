MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Christy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to Avon Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the conference
over to Amy Chasen, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. Ms. Chasen, you may begin your conference.
Amy Low Chasen
Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss Avon's third quarter earnings results. With me on this
call are Andrea Jung, Avon's Chairman and CEO and Chuck Cramb, Vice Chairman, Developed Market Group and
Interim CFO. I refer you to the cautionary statement in today's earnings release as well as our non-GAAP reconciliation
in the appendix to today's slides.
These slides are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and also include details of our third quarter
regional and P&L results. As usual on the call, we will focus on adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. With that, I'll
hand the call over to Andrea.
Andrea Jung
Thanks, Amy. Thanks for joining us this morning. We've got a lot to discuss this morning, so let me just jump right in.
As you read this morning, obviously we're disappointed with our third quarter results and the slower than expected pace
of recovery. We had a challenging Brazil ERP implementation which caused greater disruption than we had anticipated

and that was the significant impact on Avon's top and bottom line. We have increased macroeconomic volatility which
further pressured our third quarter revenue results. So it's not yet reflected in our financial results. We are making some
tangible strategic progress most notably in North America and I'll talk about that but given the current operating
environment, we no longer expect to achieve mid -single digits sales growth and 50 to 70 basis points of operating
margin expansion in 2011.
We're fully assessing our long range business plan and targeting an operational and financial update to investors in the
first quarter of 2012. Recognizing the underlying strength of the business model, we're committed to improving
performance and better positioning Avon in this changing landscape.
You've read the results this morning. I'm not going to go into great detail about the quarter but just sort of to hit the
headlines, revenue in constant dollars were up 1.4%. Beauty grew slightly faster than that at 3% in constant dollars
driven by the fragrance and color category. Active representative growth was flat. Our adjusted gross margin was down
60 basis points as significant commodity cost pressures offset some positive pricing and favorable FX. The adjusted
operating margin declined 20 basis points primarily due to decreases in Brazil and to a lesser extent, North America.
Our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.38 as you read. Inventory days were operationally
up 5 days in the third quarter. We've got a whole lot progress to go but this did progress from being up 14 days as we
closed the second quarter. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was up $67 million. That was driven by some of
these early inventory improvements. Year-to-date cash flow from operations down $77 million due to the increased
pension funding that we made earlier in the year.
When I look at the lion's share of the top line mix, it was in Latin America and that mix was driven by Brazil. Latin
America growth fell below double digits for the first time in over 10 quarters. Latin America growth in constant dollars
was 6% in this third quarter and that was driven by an unanticipated sales decline in Brazil of negative 3% in constant
dollars. In Brazil, the ERP implementation created greater than anticipated service disruption despite extensive pre
-implementation testing. We had greater than anticipated implementation challenges in the go -live. Significantly
higher business complexity in this market contributed to a greater than expected level of disruption as I said when we
went to the go-live environment. Brazil, as a reminder, has two to three times more volume and SKUs than the other
ERP markets where we've implemented. The market has two times more interfaces and legacy systems. We were also
concurrently migrating to our state-of-the-art Cabreúva facility. So with the scale and complexity sort of the headlines,
the transition from a highly manual operating environment with intensive workarounds to a systematic, unforgiving
ERP system which is what an E1 is, created unexpected knock-on effects in the quarter.
What were these knock-on service impacts? They were really centered in three areas. In the cutover when we went live,
late representative quarters were not visible in the system and that caused us to undercount demand and therefore miss
production of some of those orders.
Secondly, the magnitude of the process changes in receiving challenged the timely arrival of products into the
pick-and-pack line. And that resulted in product shorts and delivery delays. And then the data challenges from going
from the legacy system to the ERP system drove higher than expected inventory imbalances and that led to stockouts.
To estimate, the impact to service disruptions drove about a 8% sales drag in Brazil in the third quarter, 5% of that
coming from loss sales due to ERP and service disruptions. And then about 3% from the representative annoyance
factor which was higher than it was in the second quarter. There's a little bit of a lag on this and even though she is
placing orders, again her units per order are down.
We've got a robust recovery process underway to drive sustained service improvements. These shorts are down from
the double digit levels that we saw in the early go-live days. They're still above pre-ERP levels but getting better. In
terms of the three work streams that we saw challenges in, in terms of demand visibility and the orders that were not
visible, those issues were resolved in September. In terms of the receiving line issues, that again we saw when we went
go-live, those have also been resolved. And in terms of the inventory imbalances, we are gaining strong traction on
that, day by day. A huge effort is going against that. There's still some work to do.

So despite initial signs of improvement, I really don't think we can be satisfied until we see a sustained recovery over
the next several campaigns and months.
In the quarter, we also saw some greater impact from competition in Brazil. I know there's a lot of dialog and
discussion about this in the market. As I said, probably about two-thirds to three-quarters of the issue were the service
disruptions that I just quantified, but we measure this every quarter and we did see some increasing impact from I'll call
it the macros as well as competition. Just firstly on the macros, which is about a point of this, we continue to see the
Brazil beauty market slowing to single digits.
This is not something we anticipated as we came into 2011 but the overall market independent of channel seems to
have been slowing and it's not at the double digit rate it was for many, many quarters in a row. And then we are seeing
some growing impact from competition that did pop in this quarter. We measure it every quarter. The greatest impact
was from franchise players, largely in fragrance. How much of this is coming from the rep annoyance and feeding –
being fed by our rep annoyance; that's something that we'll continue to try and vet out. But again, net-net, there's some
impact from the franchise players, largely in the fragrance category and to a lesser degree, some impact from retail and
that would be centered in the skin care category.
We've got aggressive plans underway to underpin our competitive brand positioning in this market. So obviously in
addition to our focus on service, we're looking at enhancing our innovation pipeline, in addition to the global
innovation pipeline, which has been very successful in Brazil over the past few years. We're implementing a more
heavily Brazil-centric product focus in fragrance, skin care and color. Longer term, we're also exploring strategies to
target diverse regional consumer subsegments within Brazil. Many of you are aware there's different areas of Brazil
and they have very specific consumer needs. So we will be focusing on that more clearly and to that end, we're
evolving the marketing and R&D structures to enhance local market responsiveness and agility right down there in São
Paulo.
So, in sum, as it relates to Brazil, despite these tough near-term challenges, we are taking the right steps for the
long-term. If you look at the underlying Avon Brazil fundamentals which we just looked at, again, we still have the
highest top-of-mind, beauty brand awareness, beauty advertising awareness, beauty purchase penetration in the Brazil
market. And then I think importantly, we've got sustained growth and high retention of our Avon representatives, I
guess no small feat in this particularly challenging time and not just for quarter.
I mean service has been challenging us down there for a while and the – the retention of our representatives. And
importantly the fact that active representative number is actually growing and high right now, I think speaks to the
major focus obviously on keeping our representatives engaged and still with us.
Plans are underway, as I mentioned, to reinforce brand positioning amidst clearly growing competition in that market.
And then importantly as painful as this has been, the ERP transition and the new Cabreúva facility are absolutely
imperative to delivering sustainable service reliability. They're the answer to sustainable service reliability in this
market and they're the necessary infrastructure we needed to put into Brazil to support our future business growth.
Looking beyond Brazil, the pace of recovery was slower than expected in Europe, exacerbated by great macro volatility
and softer consumer sentiment. Macro volatility contributed to a slower than anticipated recovery across both of our
European CBUs. If we look at WEMEA, the growth remains below the historical levels. We had experienced
double-digit growth in this segment and starting in the second quarter, we've been in the mid-single-digit growth and in
this quarter and the third quarter, the 6% constant dollar sales growth was largely impacted positively by that
settlement. So again, much lower than normal growth as we came into this quarter.
There's some acceleration in Central and Eastern Europe. So, we went from negative again to flattish. In Russia, our
sales if you exclude some wholesale returns to Belorussia, we actually went from slightly negative to slightly positive,
but the main point here is not enough. The macros really countered again the recovery that we were hoping for.
I just go to the total company's playbook in the second half and obviously Europe used this playbook, our playbook was
made up of three key platforms. Those were stronger product innovation, high impact offers and pricing and a global
field activation program. And some elements of the playbook are working but not enough to move the needle against

macro volatilities. In terms of the stronger innovation, the early days of the launch of Anew Genics and then Fergie
Outspoken, quite good. We had a very strong Outspoken launch and that really supported the 9% global fragrance
growth, so we did well in this category. And the Genics early selling is very much on track. In a minute I'll talk about
even in the U.S., it is particularly successful. So we're really on track with that very important skin care product.
In terms of high impact offers and pricing, again the results here are mixed from smart value. Our Beauty business was
up 3% on the global basis and that's being handicapped in Brazil, but Beauty was up 3%.
In the Color category, we really did see the results, positive results of the reinvigorated merchandising and smart value
and that turned around with some volume growth in Color. But in the other categories, pricing is pressuring units as the
consumer sentiment softened through the quarter and we're also very, very watchful of competitive pricing and
promotion activity which is dialing up, so we want to be wary of that as we look at our gross margin strategies.
In terms of the Believe field activation, again mixed results by market. Some markets did very well but overall for the
total company with active reps still flat, the incentive was not enough to offset the depressed representative activity as
consumers hold back spend.
We're adjusting the playbook for fourth quarter and beyond, just really understanding if this volatile economic
environment and consumer sentiment remains uncertain. Where books and brochures are printed, we're using Internet
offers to increase pricing and merchandising flexibility and excitement. In terms of some of the markets where again
the Believe incentive was not just in terms of bringing numbers of reps in, it also had a sales threshold. So given the
consumer environment, looking at where we need to reset Believe incentive thresholds to keep some of our top sellers
in the game. And we're reevaluating the balance of push and pull so to speak to strengthen the consumer proposition
given this new environment. We've got to look at the rebalance and the mix trade up across channel and pricing levers,
just to ensure that we've got the right consumer and representative activity.
Despite a slower than anticipated overall recovery, we are starting to see some tangible signs of strategic progress, most
notably in the U.S. In the third quarter, we began to implement a bold plan to turn around the top line in the United
States business and we've shared this with you, but just a reminder, they were to really revitalize smart value, no
different than the company playbook. To recapture holiday sales where we really had walked away from this category
for our consumers and our representatives over the past couple years. And then importantly to implement one simple
sales model which is a very, very bold transformation of – in the field, as you know.
Its early days but this reinvigorated playbook is changing the trend line in the business. If you look at U.S. beauty
average order, for January to July, the average order was down in the Beauty categories. As we started to implement
smart value, it started to improve in July and August and then as we exited the quarter and into October, again when
you look at the combined focus of re-merchandised brochures with a focus on smart value, a very successful Genics
launch in this market and the beginnings of some of the introduction of our holiday beauty gift program, giftable gift
sets, et cetera, again the average order has moved significantly.
When we look at non-beauty, the revitalized holiday program is also starting to bear fruit. The U.S. non-beauty average
order, January through July, down significantly, major double digits. July-August, still down for the major part of the
third quarter because we had not introduced many of the programs until September. So as we exited the quarter in
September and into the month of October, again early days, we are seeing a very significant average quarter change and
that's being driven by this introduction of holiday giftables for the fourth quarter Christmas season.
In the field, we continue the deliberate strategic transition towards one simple sales model. We're continuing to grow
the number of upline leaders, building a foundation for the future. On the right, you'll see that the – in the pink, the
number of upline leaders has crossed over from a deficit to an advantage and sustain that for several months now. And
that is a great foundation for the future.
We implemented the first wave of one simple sales model with no perceptible disruption to the business which was
important, very, very key for us to measure and monitor. So the recent results are encouraging. But we continue to be
cautious because of future variability. I mean we are having notification to district managers in this quarter and then the
first quarter, the major redistricting happens. So again, recent results are encouraging but we are aware that there could

be some future variability. The right program and we feel that this is absolutely foundational for stabilization of the
U.S. business.
So just to sum up the tangible signs of an inflexion point in the United States business. There are some green shoots but
we need to see a sustained improvement over a longer period. It's premature to call it. These are really, really important
months ahead of us and we like the signs, but we caution ourselves, just given the magnitude of the field plan.
Looking ahead, in light of the shifting dynamics in the portfolio and the growing macroeconomic uncertainty, we're
reassessing our outlook for 2011 and beyond. Given our disappointing third quarter results, we no longer expect to
achieve our previous outlook of mid-single-digit revenue growth and 50 to 70 basis points of margin expansion in
2011. It's difficult to predict our fourth quarter performance because the next few months are so critical to
understanding sustainable trends in Brazil and the United States, our two largest markets.
And that's against the backdrop of volatile macroeconomic outlook, see what happens in Europe and whether or not this
is potential for continued softness in consumer spending across the quarter and beyond. So in line with this, we've
begun a detailed assessment of our long-range business plan. The underlying strength of the business model remains
intact. We've got an advantaged category, an advantaged geographic portfolio and direct selling to the advantaged
channel. We need to consider the increasingly complex environment and its impact on the pace of the transformation to
deliver consistent sustainable performance in this company.
We're conducting an in-depth operational and financial review as I said, and that will really be a reassessment of our
internal and external inputs, a deep dive review, market-by-market, role-by-role, an operational review focused on
executional capabilities, a capital allocation review. All of this is going to drive our outlook for key financial metrics
including revenue growth and operating margin and we are targeting as I mentioned an investor update to you in the
first quarter of the year. So we got a lot of work ahead of us. In the next couple months, we don't want to prejudge the
outputs but we're taking the necessary steps to improve performance and better position Avon in this changing
landscape and we'll have a lot more to say about it when this review is complete.
Okay. Thanks. Operator, I think we can open up now for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Christopher Ferrara. Please state your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: It's Bank of America Merrill Lynch. When does Kimberly Ross start officially, and I
guess what will her role be in this review, and obviously the call on what you do with the dividend?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Kimberly Ross's first day is, I think, the Monday after Thanksgiving so November 28th, I
believe. I think she's finishing up at Ahold, transitioning and then just taking Thanksgiving and starting that week.
She'll be highly involved obviously in this review and the capital allocation review and decisions we make there.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Okay. And I guess in Brazil, the landscape, you're talking about landscape changes. I
mean what's really been different there from a business perspective if anything, right, because obviously execution's
been a bigger deal and it just seems like it's kind of run past you guys? And I guess the market, obviously there's been
some macro slowing, but you're talking about kind of landscape changes and it sounds like the market's changed, you
guys haven't kept up with it. I was wondering if you could just be a little more specific around that stuff. And then also
when do you think Brazil will recover? Like give us a shot when you think things will get better there?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well, just in terms of the landscape, I think there are three parts. Obviously one, we can talk
about sort of Avon execution, Avon internal and then competition and then the macros. So, let's just take the easiest one
first. The easiest one being, Chris – I mean the macros, I mean I think we still view Brazil to be a really good beauty

market. Going forward, I want to stress test that. In this review, we had assumptions. We used assumptions as we came
in, in terms of what the overall beauty market would be and how much we would grow times the market and that
number is lower, I think, then many of us would like to see. Competition included, the absolute numbers in the single
digits.
And so as we look at competition, retail and direct selling and in this earnings season and beyond, just what is the – I'll
call it at least near term impact of the category growth in Brazil even though it's still a heated market and what does that
imply and what does that mean. Is it short term? Do people still feel Brazil is going to be one of the top three markets
of growth in the world for beauty? I mean those were some of the premises that we had independent of Avon coming in
to the planning process, right. So, that's the macros.
Then in terms of competition and obviously want to tease out and understand in the landscape how much has been the
annoyance that's fueling competition and how much is just competitive spending and lots of players. So, as I think I've
said before, eyes wide open, highly competitive market. We continue to look at the impact of competition every quarter
and tease it out on our results. We did see more impact this third quarter. Again how much was the annoyance, because
just at this point our service has been tougher for a continued period of time and that lag impact is big on our
representative. And how much of it is just actual competitive activity, sub-segment by sub-segment in terms of – again
we're seeing in franchise, it's really a fragrance story and in retail, although smaller, a lot of spending's being done on
anti-aging and skin care.
So, I guess the answer is to really relook at category strategy given the competition and then – and pricing – trying to
understand in this environment where competition is in pricing, particularly against where we've been positioned
to-date. Okay, so that, those would be the first two.
Then in terms of execution and if I just take ERP aside – I mean I just, I go back to and I didn't want to repeat it today
but I think you all know how fast the Brazil business grew. And again, we really doubled our business in size in terms
of just, as you know units, in terms of numbers of reps. And the infrastructure to accommodate this growth is
something that is here and now as it relates to particularly the move to this new distribution facility in Cabreúva as well
as a foundational ERP opportunity which we didn't go first in Brazil.
We felt it was right and I still stand by right to go in other regions, because Brazil is complex. And when you don't
know things until you get into a go-live environment, what I feel good about is that the post go-live team has had the
experience on each of these issues, albeit they were smaller in impact in other regions when we went live, so they know
exactly what to do. And so, the ERP, it's a day by day thing. I don't want to call it because I need to see sustained
recovery and then how much is the lag impact representative annoyance. So that's going to be what I have to look at in
terms of playing out when those units get put back into her order, although the same number of her and more are
placing orders with us.
So that's the foundational kind of moment we're in, is growing into with sophisticated systems. They are more
unforgiving, they take change management and it is our largest transactional business and number of reps, but I think it
platforms us now for what does allow us to have that sustained service and any other thing that comes down the pipe,
which would knock us off if we didn't have this ERP enterprise system. So big things and painful like I said, but the
right thing to do from a grow-in to an infrastructure that readies us for growth. Is that helpful?
Operator
Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks. It's Barclays Capital. So I guess just the first thing would be on the changes
coming in North America with redistricting and the district manager downsizing notification. I mean can you just refer
back to the experience you had in the U.S. with this sort of similar direction? No question, I think it's the right thing to
be doing but similar experience in trying to downsize the district managers, whatever it is now seven or nine years ago,
and then also when you redistricted in Mexico. I mean, my memory is that it was extraordinarily disruptive. So I would

think it's very early to indicate anything with inflexion point in it for North America at this point even if the holiday
sales are boosting results right now.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yes, that was my point, Lauren. I mean I think that obviously the inflexion point we're seeing is
in the average order and the short term things that we needed to do to fix the portfolio. We were very clear that sort of
given the environment, the macro environment, the consumer sentiment and the – I think the average order and the
earnings especially during the holiday period, which was really missing from engaging the activity, we feel good about
that and it's clearly significantly changed the average order.
But as I said, the caution and the reason that it is too early to call and therefore really hard to predict the fourth quarter
or even first quarter, when we do the redistricting, is that this is very bold and very important. In terms of some of the
actual notifications are going on as we speak. The concept of what we were doing and the number, et cetera, was out
there for quite some time and that in and of itself could have caused disruption. It didn't. So I feel that the
communication was very, very good there but we have to get through this period and it's the absolute right thing to do
to your point. But that's why I'm saying the variability makes it very difficult to forecast and predict.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Okay. And Andrea, do you have anything specific in terms of what that disruption
was? Just I think Mexico is the most concrete example of something similar happening with redistricting. Like what
was the drag and for how long on whether – it's probably not average order but more rep activity and engagement?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yeah, let me get back to you on that Lauren because I want to give you a correct number. It was
different. So it wasn't exactly the same. One simple sales model is not exactly the same but again, we can quantify that.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Okay.
Operator
Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Hi, it's Stifel, Nicolaus. I guess I'm curious why you didn't at least comment on the now
multiple SEC investigations, is there anything that you can say at all? And then more broadly, I struggle with this but
why should investors believe management and the board has any control over the business at this point? And I guess
Andrea you're Chairman, given an average board tenure of over 10 years I believe, how long can the status-quo here
remain? I mean I know we're talking about improvements in North America but things in Brazil are still tough. I mean I
just don't know what to say at this point.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Okay well, Mark, let me just address that first. Look, the buck stops with me. We're disappointed
and I at the top of that list. There's a lot of factors as I just discussed but at the end of the day, we missed the number
this period and I get it. I and sort of everyone connected with the organization is going to do what's right for the
company and shareholders. Right now, our focus is to fully review every aspect of this business market-by-market and
role-by-role. All of the next steps are going to be based on facts and we'll be done with the review to what's right for the
enterprise for Avon long-term. That's what we've got to do. I mean, I appreciate how much goes into a company
beyond a quarter, a year. We have nearly 7 million representative in over 100 countries and the relationship aspect's
important. It's a huge and highly complex direct selling business.
So, we won't be reactive but we will be thoughtful, orderly in our approach to all of these issues and have the discipline
to get to the right answer for the company. In terms of your first question as it relates to the SEC, just it's not
uncommon to have a formal order in connection with an SEC investigation as I understand it. I think what it means is
that the SEC has a formal order open on two matters. It just came in yesterday. We disclosed it. As I understand it,
again they chose to issue a subpoena on Reg FD only and our internal investigation continues and we continue to
cooperate with the government. That's what I have on that.

Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Yeah, hey guys, good morning.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: So when you talk about the brand awareness at Avon but like there's high awareness of Chernobyl
in the Ukraine, so like how do you monetize that awareness? It seems like over the last three or four years, there's been
almost no success given that how much people know the brand. It hasn't like translated in your rep growth. So is there
any strategy in place to really refresh the brand itself or maybe even look at other alternatives to maybe some other
brands in the portfolio?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well, I think that we have continued to improve the image of the brand. I think you can't exactly
translate that in this very moment to know rep growth. I think there are issues as I discussed in terms of some of the
behavior and the consumer sentiment and its play on activity, et cetera. But having said that, our Beauty sales were up
3%. I think mass beauty has been more challenged than high end beauty, but this is all going to be part of the review,
okay? Part of the review will be again what we need to do or do differently, again, either brand spending, brand
positioning. We did as you know look at something like a Liz Earle to say perhaps there are other brands within the
Avon portfolio and how do they help us with higher tier. So it will all be part of the review.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Okay. And then the 14% operating margin target you have out there, I know the dividend. It's just
that it seems like it's been a handful of quarters where you have actually borrowed a bit of dividend. So is the dividend
safe and then are you still comfortable with that margin target?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yeah, just on the margin, I don't want to prejudge the outputs. I mean historically our
assumptions regarding category, geography on geography led us to the outlook and that's what we're going to be
reviewing in the next few months. We're going to undertake a comprehensive review of it, inputs and outputs including
margin and I'll say what we have to say when that review's complete.
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: And in terms of the dividend from a long-term point of view, that too will be part of the
overall business review. Certainly at this point in time, you're right. We have a free cash flow that does not fully cover
the dividend given some of the things that we've had from our disappointing cash management, but also the one-time
cash outlays that are in excess of expenses on restructuring. But net-net, everything is part of the overall business
review that we've talked about.

Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi, with Citigroup. My first question is are there any more ERP implementations that
have to come around the world in big markets or was Brazil the last one? And then my second question goes to this
whatever update outlook saying that you're going to have in the first quarter and I guess my question is, I know you
guys are probably eager to hold our hands and to give us a message and to set a strategy just so that people have some
direction to march towards, if you will, maybe internally as well.
But it strikes me that you guys need to do a tremendous amount of work, probably change a bunch of people in
management, probably change your capital structure, maybe take another restructuring charge, maybe exit a market like
what you did in Japan that I think took you a decade to come to that decision, maybe you come to that decision about
some other markets, that strikes me as a humongous amount of work.
And unless you're planning on handing this off to the new CFO, December 1 and saying, hey, you've got six weeks to
figure this out, it strikes me that saying it's a first quarter solution could be really premature. So have you thought about
the idea, go back and hire McKinsey again, go back and really go to the drawing board, think about taking the company
private? I mean it strikes me that you guys are so totally screwed up in so many ways, the change has to be radical and I
don't know if saying, hey, we're going to come out in February with new financial targets is enough. That's it.

<A - Andrea Jung>: Well, we haven't set a date yet and we do want to do it and we do want to do it right. So again
targeting first quarter, but if we're not ready because we are – everything is – is part of this review including outside
help versus obviously a strong team of people in the company but those – I haven't set a date and we don't want to do it
prematurely.
You are correct on that.
In terms of ERP, it's not the last market. There are other markets in Latin America, but again we're not pulling one
single person out of Brazil until that's fixed in there. There aren't really any other markets who have the same depth of
the legacy issues and/or the interfaces but we'll certainly take all the learnings before we go to another market, okay.

Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hi, it's Morgan Stanley. So, Andrea the Brazil ERP issues, you had another execution
issue in a long line of missteps over the last few years. And rather than going through the specifics in Brazil, I'd just be
curious for your perspective on how you ensure that you improve execution across the company going forward? And
also as you look at the issues over the last few years, do you think they're more related to systems issues at the
company, is it more management execution or what are the key areas you think have driven these disappointments?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Dara, I think that certainly the capabilities, operational capabilities, execution capabilities is a full
part of this review role-by-role. So, again it's not just financial business levers that we're looking at and we are going to
be looking at sort of fresh look at growth drivers, cost drivers but operational capabilities, what we need to do to
enhance it and it's a combination. But certainly from a very decentralized, very patchwork legacy system environment
which has been sort of Avon for 50-plus years, the move to Matrix, that global centralized organization with global
systems platforms from a patchwork has been part of the complexity and really hampered our pace of transformation.
But I think they're all the right things to do because we have to ready ourselves from, again 100 markets doing $5
billion to, more markets doing well over $10 billion and that's been part of the journey.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay. And from a systems standpoint, where do you stand in that evolution? Do you
think you now have the systems in place that are generally correct across the company and will allow you to execute or
do you think there's more left to go there?
<A - Andrea Jung>: There's more left to go. I mean I think ERP which deals with, as you know, obviously supply
chain and financial systems, that is done in North America. It's done in Europe, Brazil, painful, but it's going to be the
absolute right thing and that is very, very important to Latin America. But we've got Latin America, primarily other
major markets in Latin America to go there and then I think we've kind of referred to sort of order management, the
representative, what we've called service model transformation and that is an SAP solution down the road.
Okay, that's the largest sort of – I'll call it slap piece, along with the continued upgrade of the Internet technology. I
mean technology is changing so fast but the e-tools which are in place but constantly have to evolve. And so I think one
of the things that we've talked about as it relates to the capital allocation of CapEx, I think we are really shifting the
mix from what's been probably 3% infrastructure, manufacturing, distribution facilities to exactly opposite. A lot of
that's already in place now and so now what we're doing is focusing most of the CapEx on the continued systems
upgrades to get in a foundational platform around the world with global systems.

problem. I'm trying to get a sense of where you settle out there and are there brand heath indicators that you're looking
at that gives you confidence that you don't have a brand problem?
<A - Andrea Jung>: I think the brand health indicators have been quite good, particularly in the developing and
emerging markets. I mean I just told you highest beauty brand awareness, top-of-mind in Brazil, highest advertising
brand awareness. So I mean again, the indicators say that brand perception and we've done a tremendous amount of
work on product, product quality, product image, et cetera, over the last years. In terms of where do we go from here, if
we have to rebalance and what that – where we are competitively category-by-category, market-by-market, those are
things that will be part of the review. But the overall top-of-mind, beauty brand awareness and brand image particularly
in our developing and emerging markets is quite good.
<Q>: Okay, and just a quick follow-up to that. In Brazil, obviously you sort of mistepped again, related to execution so
the reps haven't been receiving their orders again for the second time. What gives you confidence that this time you
actually can bring them back to your side and that you won't in fact – that they won't just jump ship this time around?
Thank you.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well, I think stabilization of the ERP system is the most important thing for a sustainable service
proposition. I mean what ERP does is allow us to have that sustainability. So again painful in its moments but it is the
answer if you would, when you combine the ERP system as well as the investment that we made which was quite large
and a state-of-the-art new distribution facility with state-of-the-art pick and pack, et cetera, considerably different than
what we had in the old facility. Those are the, I'll call it infrastructure that allows us to have flexibility around growth
to not be again so constrained and stretched to the limit which we were prior systems and our capacity before we made
these investments.

Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hi guys, I'm from Bernstein. I'm a little torn because you guys have been beaten up enough about
your results today which is I guess generally my role on these calls. But let me ask a different type of question. And it's
not about what you're going to say on – well, maybe it is -but it's not necessarily about what you're going to say
financially or operationally in the first quarter, but it's as you look back over the past several years, I think it's generous
to call it a boom bust on Avon. So I'm trying to figure out, do you know why these things happen? Whether it's bribery,
whether it's no cash been generated in the U.S., whether it's – this whole Brazil debacle, I mean why? It's nice to blame
kind of external forces and I'm totally understand that. Sometimes that happens. But have you figured out what's going
on internally that will lead to these cycles?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yeah, and I just want to make sure Ali, I'm not blaming external forces solely for – I talked about
some macro conditions in this quarter which may be different and they are worsening macros since the September
quarter began. But having said that, let me just go back to kind of taking a longer look back.
I mean, look, I get it. There are lot of factors but that doesn't change – what doesn't change I think is that the – as I said,
the channel is good. We like the category. We love the Beauty category and the geographic portfolio confers the
damage. But this is huge and highly complex and over the past several years, we have introduced a significant amount
of change into the company. Some of it's been very effective but again a lot of it, some of those results have been
contrary and what was difficult to predict was the impact of the increasing complexity, also not helped by the shifting
landscape.
And we really need to consider the impact of this complexity and the change on the pace of transformation and how we
going forward assume timing on deliverables as it relates to some of these large scale transformations. And that is why
I think it requires this review of every aspect. And each market is different, so it is going to have to be
market-by-market, with a view to what's right for the business. But I think the complexity and the rapidly shifting – a
lot of [ph] contras (45:24) that it doesn't matter, there are no excuses because they happened. When you combine that

<Q - Ali Dibadj>: What do you think your board thinks?

Your next question comes from Alice Longley. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Alice Beebe Longley>: Hi, good morning; Buckingham. My question is a little bit along the same lines. Just
looking at the operations in Brazil where we've had problems for more than a year, if you look back, what would you
have done differently to make the operations run smoothly and I'm looking specifically as to whether you think the
systems you've implemented are the wrong systems or did you have the wrong people implementing them or not
enough people implementing them?
<A - Andrea Jung>: We've obviously spent a tremendous amount of time looking at the implementation. From the
testing protocols and significant review back in terms of a team, system testing and it was excessive and it involved
thousands of test scripts through multiple cycles and I think we did it right. What – did we wait too long to implement
it? I mean Brazil was slightly delayed.
The challenges that we had in 2010 actually delayed the implementation of ERP and yet, we had to get – I still say, we
have to do it, as painful as this is right now. To have delayed ERP for another year would have been the absolute wrong
thing to do for the business because it would just – would have delayed the sustained recovery in service. It was and is
a very experienced group of people and because they have known what to do in a post go-live environment, I think that
our issues are being handled by a team of people who have a lot of experience. But, do I wish that we had done an ERP
10 years ago?
Yes, I do. But the facts are that we started our ERP, I think we made the right sequence in terms of the regions and that
catch up, it hurts now but it's the absolute right thing to do. Brazil grew faster than we thought it would, we had plans in
place for this distribution facility and allocated the capital. We had plans in place for ERP. It did get delayed. So yeah, I
wish I had done an ERP a couple of years earlier.
<Q - Alice Beebe Longley>: But what does...
<A - Andrea Jung>: We had – if we had had an ERP two years ago on the e-invoicing issue, et cetera, it would have
been a different outcome if it had been in that market. But you know...
<Q - Alice Beebe Longley>: What does delaying the implementation have to do with not executing it well?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well, delaying the implementation just put it on top of the move into Cabreúva. So you kind of
got this simultaneous move into a brand-new facility, training 1,500 people in a brand-new facility as well as a large
scale systems change, a magnitude of which even our outside partners would say, there's not a lot in Brazil. You can do
a lot of ERP implementation but the complexity, the number of legacy systems and just the volumes, the SKUs, it's a
different environment. So again no excuses, but when you put it on top of moving into our new distribution facility and
all the change management that came – had to do it, wish we had done it maybe two, three years ago, but it wasn't the
right thing to do and we couldn't do it in 2010 when we originally wanted to do it.

<Q - Nik Modi>: UBS. Andrea, just big picture-wise and as you think about this review, it seems like execution has
really been a big issue for Avon at least for the last year and a half or so. Just curious how you think about actually
having a COO in the business to help kind of manage all the complexity that you have as part of this direct selling,
multinational? Thanks.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Everything's being reviewed, Nik. Organization and every role is being reviewed and that's one
piece of this overall review.
<Q - Nik Modi>: And then just quickly on Brazil, can you give us a sense of what the demand looked like? I mean
certainly you talked about the out-of-stocks and all that stuff but how does that demand look like third quarter?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well again, without being it a perfect science from what I gave you, it probably would have been
mid-single digits. Not high single digits because of competition, but mid-single digits. Right? It was 8 points about –
from the minus 3%, it would probably be 5%, 6% without this problem, and it wouldn't have been 9% or 10% because
competition was impacting us 3 to 4 points. I'll say 5% to 6%, if I had to guess.
Operator>: Your next question comes from Connie Maneaty. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Good morning, BMO Capital. I have two questions. One is in direct selling companies
the channel really drives the results, all else being equal. And I'm wondering why in many of the most recent hires,
maybe all of the most recent hires, the company has chosen to bring in people with packaged goods experience rather
than a top direct selling manager from a competitor? And I was wondering if you could discuss that a little bit? I'd also
like an update on what's going on with Silpada design. Thanks.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Okay, just in terms of – actually, if I look at the regional management, again the management in
Asia, North America, Western Europe, and Central and Eastern Europe, probably on average have 25 years of direct
selling experience. So, we really are focused on making sure we have direct selling experience in the market, managing
the business as it relates to – even you don't get visibility to below that. But I think we've been pretty aggressive about
recruiting and hiring from direct selling competitors as well as people in the industry as it relates to sales leaders,
people running our sales force, and including some of our markets in many of the markets.
Obviously, just in terms of Kimberly Ross, we were looking as it related to what we needed going forward as CFO, it
really wasn't about the channel experience as much as it was just getting the right person into the company. So, I think
it is a blend on the senior team. And hear your point, but we definitely think that on the ground, obviously having direct
selling experience is a very good thing. All of our general managers, for instance in Latin America, very deep and steep
direct sales experience. So, it is a blend of new capabilities as well as deep, direct selling experience throughout the
company. As it relates to Silpada, I'll just turn that over to Chuck.
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Sure. In the case of Silpada, as you know, silver prices have sky rocketed on it. They've
come back a bit but when we bought the business, it was $17 an ounce. It actually peaked out, I think, at $48. We're
down in the low $30s. As we looked at that business, we knew we couldn't get back all of that margin through pricing,
so we took a very aggressive stance in terms of changing the catalog and we changed out two-thirds of the SKUs, and
normally it would be about a third. And we change the catalog once a year by the way in July when we have our
national sales conference. We also went very aggressively on the remaining third in terms of overall prices, but feel that
going into – really towards the end of the third quarter but most importantly going into the Christmas season, which for
Silpada is November and December, that we have a catalog that will broadly appeal in terms of price points and
offerings, both at the lower end as well as some of the premium products.
It's too early to measure what the impact of that is. What we did do however is recognize that in this economy, we were
going to have to think more about managing the business overall for the cash flow of it than just generating the
revenue, while still keeping enough of an earnings opportunity for the representatives. The only metric I've got in terms
of the representative right now is on the home parties that are being conducted, the average home party is up a little bit
from a year ago. So it tells me right now that there's nothing dramatic in terms of what was done from a catalog point of
view that should impact the business. But it really – it really is a hold on and wait and see for the Christmas holiday gift
giving period in terms of what does happen with that business.

Your next question comes from Javier Escalante. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Consumer Edge Research. A follow-up on Brazil and then to take it in a broader level, I'm not
sure if you're aware but also Natura is accelerating significantly. They grew only 5% in the quarter and they are also
claiming invoicing issues. So to what extent you are getting the right information that data out of the market when you
provide the impact of retail and other direct sellers or competition in general in the quarter? And that takes me to
another issue, do you have a sense whether this RVP spending is expanding your sales force because how can you grow
your sales if your sales force is not expanding? And I know that you are presenting this active rep metric but this active
rep metric is certainly not enough. We need to know whether your reinvestment in RVP is creating the incentives for
people to enroll in direct selling. Thank you.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Sure. Just in terms of inputs, I mean – and this will continue to be part of the review – but yes, we
do look at, when we look at the impact of competition is by competitor as best we can see, so we would try – we would
see the impact of our largest competitor versus a new entry versus retail. And that's something that we continue to
study. So again that's important to us to understand, not just total impact of a competition but from which channel and
then specifically within channel, who if we can discern that.
So that's how we're looking at very closely the completive landscape. RVP, I mean obviously we – as I said, had mixed
results and if you look at the overall RVP, some of it's from sales leadership, bonuses in South Africa and Mexico, that
seems to be working in driving results, higher incentives to offset Brazil annoyance was a piece of the RVP investment
in the quarter.
Again, hate the sales number in Brazil but the fact that active reps were up in what is arguably the worst service
environment we've ever had in that market and we've got a huge sales force and with growth on that number of sales
force putting in orders, that obviously was important for us to counter the rep annoyance and keep them in the game. So
that was an investment that I think is the right one for the long-term in the business. And then we invested in the quarter
in RVP in the U.S. launch of the one simple sales model and again that's a bet we're making but we stand by that bet.
We think it's the right thing to do for the business and that had investment cost.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: But Andrea, if I may, RVP seems to be something very temporary as opposed to real changes
in compensation. So how can you attract and grow your sales force if the compensation remains unattractive and then
you are just offering some promotional spending here and there and it's not permanent?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well, Javier, the RVP I'm talking about is not just incentive. That's a piece of it but the Avon
sales leadership, that is a foundational, multilevel earnings opportunity. That is a compensation modeling change in the
U.S. program of one simple sales model is enhancing earnings, not through incentives, but through the leadership
construct of the compensation model. So those are captured in that and those are foundational commission changes or
earning opportunity changes. It's not about a toaster or a gift. That's in there but the lion's share of this money
increment was on, I'll call it compensation program changes. Exactly to your point.

That's all the time we have for our question and answer session for today. I hand the program back over to Ms. Jung for
