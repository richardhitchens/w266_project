Greetings and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2013 Monsanto Company Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all
participants will be in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank you. Mr.
Hurley, you may begin.
Bryan Hurley
Thanks a lot, Kevin, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining this earnings update and acquisition
announcement. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and
Chief Commercial Officer; Pierre Courduroux, our CFO; and additionally, Rob Fraley, our Chief Technology Officer,
who will join us for the Q&A period. Also joining me from the IR team are Ashley Wissmann, Tim Boeker and Manny
Cruz.
With our announcement this morning that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire The Climate Corporation and
with the usual focus on our outlook for next year, our emphasis this morning will be laying out our vision for how we

plan on driving an additional leg of long-term growth.
Before we do that, let me start with the logistics. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast and
supporting slide, including slides and information about today's acquisition announcement on monsanto.com. The
replay will also be available at that address. We provided you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP and an
ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the GAAP measures in the
slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on
assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a
material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that make
cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and today's press release.
We'll move quickly to the heart of this strategic discussion, and as we do, let me underscore a very brief anchor from
our year-end results on slide 14 in the financial section of the slides. We closed out fiscal year 2013 near the high end
of our guidance with ongoing EPS of $4.56 and nearly $2 billion in free cash flow. Those results represent greater than
20% ongoing earnings growth and closes out our third consecutive year of strong growth. It's also a reflection of the
strength in our global portfolio as the diversity of our business drivers achieve that growth even against greater than
usual variability in fiscal year 2013. Those portfolio drivers continue to have a key role in our outlook for fiscal year
2014.
So with that, let me hand it to Hugh to bring this together in our strategic view. Hugh?
Hugh Grant
Thank you, Bryan, and good morning to everybody on the line. At the risk of stating the obvious, this isn't a typical
earnings call for Monsanto. We're talking about the outlook for another strong year, a breakthrough addition to our
company and how the next step in our integrated farming efforts establishes a platform for the next decade. So here's
my headlines for today.
Number one is our confidence in the core business. After three straight years of strong performance, we're on track for
continued growth. If you set aside our acquisition for a moment, 2014 is a year where we'll be talking again about
growth at our historical rates. That will still show through in our operational growth for the year. That performance
gives us the ability to invest in breakthrough new areas that extend our leadership and deliver the next meaningful tool
for our farmer customers.
Number two, our announcement today to acquire The Climate Corporation increases our confidence that our continued
development of Integrated Farming Systems, or IFS, can be a full-fledged transformational platform. The first wave of
IFS revolved around a single product but with what we've just assembled we're now talking about a true platform with
tools that span from planting the seeds to many of the key variables that growers deal with throughout the growing
season. Looking to the future, growers will need every available tool to produce more yields on the same acre.
Strategically, we believe we are putting the best-in-class analytical capability on the largest global agricultural
footprint. The combination with Climate Corp. unlocks new strategic opportunities and strengthens our growth rate
over the next decade. It's a significant use of cash, but in one transaction we achieve an important leadership position
that otherwise would require considerably more money and time to develop on our own.
For several years, we've talked about the convergence of biology and information in agriculture, as covered in slide 6.
We see today us fulfilling that potential. We now have the tools to make farming more precise. This helps farmers
manage increasing variability and meet the increasing challenges of climate change.
Look at the influence of weather, 9 of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred in the last decade. Farmers today
are challenged to make key decisions for their farms in the face of increasingly volatile weather conditions. Because of
this, we believe there's real opportunity and value in working with farmers to manage the risks that affect them every

year from planting to harvest.
We won't do that single-handedly, it's an opportunity that cuts across the industry and we will use an open source
approach like the one that we've used in the past with biotech traits. That means we'll prioritize building this platform
as a network across all seed companies, our retail partners, equipment leaders, and input providers.
This is a natural extension of our industry leadership. In the same way that we invested in biotech and breeding, we
believe the combination of biology and analytical capability, on slide 7, has that same transformational potential. The
Climate Corp. isn't from the traditional ag industry but their analytical capability and their immediate set of products set
them apart in this emerging space. Importantly, they will also become the integral piece of a full platform for us. That's
an important early-mover advantage as we become a leader with Climate Corp. in taking the big data capability used in
other industries and making it relevant to agriculture.
I've been able to see this technology firsthand and I'm excited about what we can do to further drive yield. I've also felt
the early palpable excitement that underlies the meetings as our science teams get together and discuss how powerful
our combined capability can be to our farmer customers. So here's how we see this working, starting on slide 8.
I think this will be most intuitive to farmers. They deal with variability every day. Every year, they make approximately
40 key decisions on every single field. Each interrelated and that ultimately play out on the bottom line. They tell us
they are looking to use more of the data coming from their fields and their tractor cabs to improve their productivity
and their profitability. The bottom line is many growers are already looking at this area. They recognize there is
opportunity there.
On the farms of tomorrow, we see farmers applying their data to drive nearly all of those 40 key decisions as they
fine-tune dozens of variables with the same meter-by-meter precision that we see in FieldScripts today. And since this
is a technology that doesn't have the regulatory component involved in biotech or in chemistry, it moves more like the
rapid cycle upgrades for computer software.
On slide 9, we show how we see that initial product portfolio shaping up for our farmer customers. The first thing that
we'll do is build on our FieldScripts by using Climate Corp.'s data insight to make those prescriptions even more
powerful by overlaying historic and real-time weather information, creating a better blueprint for planting. From there,
you add tools that help with planting through harvest as well as in-season spray recommendations for pest and disease
control. These help growers make better decisions field by field.
That builds on Climate Corp.'s Total Weather Insurance, a tool that gives farmers a way to supplement conventional
crop insurance using predictive analytics, again for every field. This is also one of the first ways that Climate Corp.
monetized its capability, leveraging this analytical insight to allow insurers to underwrite supplemental insurance. It's
also an important validation point as insurers have already put their dollars behind the science and the predictive power
of these tools.
These tools create value. If we use the example of corn, we believe there's as many as 50 additional bushels per acre
that can be unlocked through better applied data. We've seen this proven out in our current Ground Breakers program
on slide 10. This year, farmers planted 40,000 acres with our initial FieldScripts product. It's early days, but anecdotally
we're seeing a 5-bushel an acre to 10-bushel an acre yield advantage, in line with our tests from last year.
It's compelling validation that field level data directly influences productivity. Our introductory pricing for FieldScripts
for 2014 is $10 an acre, reflecting a portion of the value that we believe we're adding. And that becomes a good model
for how we think about pricing and value across this technology platform. Just as we've done with our existing
technology, we will price as a per acre fee based on the value added with each component as we share that total value
with our farmers and retailers.
As we show on slide 11, in the next two to five years, Climate Corp. expands and accelerates the initiatives that we
started with IFS, and I expect this to be a classic example of more, better, faster. This elevates IFS as the clear new
driver in our corn business as we expect to ramp up in the next few years, first in the U.S. before expanding globally,
and eventually across soybeans and other crops.

In the longer-term, on slide 12, this rewrites the addressable market opportunity. Put simply, our business today under
initial IFS concepts focused exclusively on where we had the seed and trait footprint. That's about 400 million acres for
corn, soybeans, and cotton. The opportunity of an expanded platform is that farmers can use the key elements
regardless of the seed brand that they plant, including those outside the footprint of crops that we participate in today.
Essentially then, this is a new market opportunity of more than a billion acres. And if you look at the collective
opportunity across traditional precision agriculture and these in-season tools, we see a potential industry-wide
opportunity of more than $20 billion in revenue. That's a new, compelling opportunity for our business and it's also in
areas where growers need the most help.
As exciting and as important as our work with Climate Corp. is, it's important to emphasize that we see this as a new
layer on top of the existing opportunities in our base business, as seen on slide 15. What's driven our success in the past
three years is a strong business engine. Nothing has changed in our core business and there's no hesitation that the
operational growth that we anticipated for fiscal year 2014 still drives our business in the near term.
So in summary, we expect that core business is going to grow at mid to high-teens operational growth rate in fiscal year
2014. At an EPS level, we will absorb some of the embedded costs that flow through our financial statements this year
as we bring Climate Corp. into our business. That translates to an EPS guidance range of $5 to $5.20 after
approximately $0.14 of total dilution related to the acquisition.
The clearest way to see the 2014 growth expectations is at the operational level. For clarity, we're providing the outlook
on a couple of additional elements within our financial statements that Brett and Pierre will cover in more detail. But be
in no doubt, we're not taking our eye off the ball in any of the factors that drive our growth in 2014 and Climate Corp.
will extend that growth in years to come.
I think that's the perfect segue to Brett as he walks through more detail on how we stay focused on the growth that
matters for this fiscal year. Brett?
Brett D. Begemann
Thanks, Hugh and good morning to everyone on the line. Before I jump to the operational view that Hugh mentioned,
let me offer the quick perspective of how the opportunity with The Climate Corporation folds into our business view.
First, this is exciting because we'll have something we'll take to our farmer customers to start getting them the tools I
believe they've been asking the industry for. As I've talked to farmers, they know that the next increment of yield is
attainable on their farm and they are looking for help in leveraging the massive amount of data they generate so they
can unlock it to make their farming decisions more precise. As we plan to add The Climate Corporation we have a way
to do that.
Second, as Hugh said, this is expected to take our offering from being a product to a true platform. We'll plan to offer
farmers a portfolio that brings something meaningful to all aspects of their operation. We'll look to leverage our
partnerships with retailers, equipment companies and other input providers to maximize our ability to make this a truly
integrated platform for farmers.
This is an opportunity that layers on the foundation we have in a growing global business on slide 16. So maintaining a
focus on delivering the business in the near term is critical as it is the springboard for this next round of growth. Here's
how I see the keys in 2014.
In the last three years, our business engine has emerged as a balanced global and growing operation. In the last year,
we've removed several key uncertainties, putting our DuPont agreement in place and obtaining several key regulatory
approvals, and at the same time, we opened new opportunities, the most notable of which takes off with the launch of
Intacta this year.
The things we expect to drive our business in 2014 are fundamental to who we are. It's about pricing uplift as we
upgrade our portfolio, it's about the mix benefit we see with technology upgrades, it's about an increasing global

opportunity and it's about our ability to grow volumes. As Hugh said, given the acquisition's dilution on the bottom
line, a useful way to see this growth prove out will be on the operational lines of the P&L. And as I've worked with our
teams, I've emphasized one metric in particular, margin expansion. We expect that to play out in the seed business as
we expect to see margins reaccelerating across seeds and traits as we hit our growth pattern.
Given today's longer discussion on our acquisition, let me focus on the quick list of the metrics and milestones that
matter in 2014. Again this year, the opportunity begins with the corn portfolio upgrade on slide 17. We'll upgrade our
corn portfolio in every major geography with a steady stream of new, higher-yielding products we expect to drive
consistent 5% to 10% price mix uplift. Over the past several years, we've been consistent in our upgrades and pricing
and that approach has resonated well with our farmer customers. As we look at this year's pricing cycle, overall
commodity prices have come down from previous peaks, but we've rolled out these upgrades in pricing with the same
consistency for the Northern Hemisphere season, which is a major proof point and early validation of our line of sight.
If I move to slide 18, that same upgrade cycle holds for our corn trait penetration where we're still growing in the more
than 150 million corn acres in the Americas. In Latin America, the upgrades in both Brazil and Argentina are most
pronounced as we project those take another major step in the portfolio. And despite some shifting in corn acre
expectations for the first season in Latin America, our trait penetration is on plan and helps drive positive financial
contribution even with potentially lower acres.
That opportunity is book-ended by expanding volume opportunity in key corn regions, the best example of that is on
slide 19 with Eastern Europe, where we continue to see significant opportunity as our volume growth is moving even
faster than a growing total market. As an investment in our corn growth and just as importantly as a signal of our
confidence in that growth, we plan to increase our CapEx spending this year to build out seed capacity in several key
corn growing geographies.
2014 also starts what we expect as the reacceleration of soybeans as we begin what I would call the decade of the
soybean on slide 20. In the U.S., the deal we struck with DuPont rewrites the landscape, as we are effectively able to
reach 100% of the market opportunity for Roundup Ready 2 Yield. And in Latin America, we're at the front edge of an
even more significant upgrade as this year's launch of Intacta takes the number of royalty-bearing acres from
effectively zero to a market opportunity of more than 100 million acres. That begins with Intacta where much of the
seed is already in place for this month's initial planting supporting our largest soybean trait launch ever with around 3
million acres expected this year. This year, our dicamba-tolerant platform, Roundup Ready Xtend, also enters Ground
Breakers. So we're on the leading edge of our next blockbuster commercial platform that will be the next upgrade of
this soybean portfolio.
From there, our look would broaden to the overall portfolio and in particular the Ag Productivity business. We now
have strong visibility into the year and into the ongoing market conditions for Roundup where the strength in the
overall business has carried from last year. So going into 2014, we anticipate the overall Ag Productivity business with
a steady to stronger contribution, again, providing a level of confidence to another key portfolio element.
When we look back on 2014, a year from now, these are clearly the determining factors in our ability to deliver that
reliable growth we see from our business engine. And as I wrap it up, let me underscore two points. First, this is a year
where we are talking about one of the strongest operational growth outlooks we've had in recent memory. We expect
that will come through in our margin and our operational growth. And it's a reflection of what I see as a broader, more
reliable global portfolio.
And then I see our operational growth in 2014 as a springboard. I've visited The Climate Corporation and I spent time
with the team. Like Hugh, I'm excited that we have something transformational as we layer our IFS platform on top of
our core growth.
With that, let me turn it over to Pierre to walk through how all of this comes together in the financials. Pierre?

Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Before I go any deeper into the financial view and our business outlook
for the year, let me offer a quick anchor point on the key financial metrics related to The Climate Corp. acquisition.
As Hugh said, we expect this deal to broaden our IFS platform essentially moving up opportunity in our plan and
building a future growth platform. With an acquisition of this size, the financial opportunity is important and if we are
able to realize our accelerated plans for the IFS growth, Climate Corp. could contribute to earnings as early as in two
years. I'll cover the near-term financial impact in more detail, but based on the opportunity Hugh scoped out we see this
as a powerful investment that supports our continued growth.
As we think about that growth in our financial, here is my summary. First, we ended fiscal year 2013 with earnings
near the high end of our most updated guidance, which punctuates another year of strong growth. This demonstrates
that our portfolio came together to deliver in a year with more than the typical variability and clearly defines our
growth path for 2014.
Second, our guidance reflects the business momentum and I believe that the most useful way to see it is through the
operational financial metrics specifically for gross profit, gross margins and EBITDA. This is why we have expanded
our guidance to those metrics for fiscal year 2014 as we think it is important to track and demonstrate the performance.
Finally, we also ended the year at the high end of our free cash flow guidance, generating close to $2 billion in free
cash. In the past year, I've talked about how we can use that cash generation to fund growth and be more aggressive in
returning some of the value we create to our owners, and we've done just that and are already seeing the first benefit as
our average share count has begun to come down and as a result of our buyback programs. And while returning more
cash to our shareowners, we are using our strong cash generation and our solid balance sheet to make a growth
investment in The Climate Corp. acquisition.
Brett described the operational growth we anticipate. Let me tell you how I look at measuring our performance in the
financials, as shown on slide 21. First, we have to move up the P&L to get a clear read of the business performance
outside acquisition dilution, and the first place to look at is the gross profit line where we anticipate total company
gross profit to be in the range of $8.4 billion to $8.7 billion, representing double-digit year-over-year growth. And the
biggest driver of that GP line is the Seeds and Genomics segment, where we expect mid-teens growth in fiscal year
2014. A key factor in this growth is margin expansion, and I expect the historical margin expansion we are used to
seeing will return. In fact, we anticipate three to four points of margin improvements across the Seeds and Genomics
segment.
The growth engine is one that we are most familiar with and it is our corn business. With the core volume growth and
price leap that we plan for and some of the benefits we anticipate from COGS, I expect a rebound in margins in the
range of three points. We also anticipate a strong rebound in soybeans as we had the new royalty stream from DuPont
in the U.S. and as the early Intacta revenue becomes a positive contributor following a year of effectively no South
American soybean contribution. Based on those, I expect a total improvement in soybean margin of six to eight points
for the full year.
Ultimately, at the consolidated level, we expect all of this to result in mid to high-teens growth in EBITDA, which
clearly demonstrates the benefit of the margin improvements coming out of our business. That business growth flows
through to bottom line EPS but will be reduced somewhat as we absorb the embedded dilution related to The Climate
Corp. acquisition in 2014. Notably, there will be several up-front and acquisition-related charges that flow through
various lines in the financial statements split among amortization costs, assumed operating expenses, financing and
employee retention programs that is expected to translate into EPS guidance of $5 to $5.20 after approximately $0.14
of total dilution related to the acquisition. Excluding that dilution, our growth rate would have been right at the typical
mid-teens range.
Part of the confidence we have in this overall business growth comes directly out of our planning process. So it helps to
identify some of the key planning assumptions that underpin our guidance. It is too early to make definitive call on any
full year factors, but within the range of assumptions we are considering, we are monitoring the potential for less U.S.
corn acres this year and the potential for greater volatility in currency outside of the U.S. But we do balance this against

the benefit we anticipate as we see corn cost of goods normalize after a significant 2013 headwind.
As we consider the outlook for the year and as we have seen some shifting in earnings patterns over the past few years,
it is worth outlining the outlook for the first quarter, on slide 22. Looking at this year, I expect our Q1 to be in the same
EPS range to slightly up from last year. We expect the strategic factors that reinforce our overall growth including trait
mix upgrades in Latin America and the early contribution from Intacta will continue to positively impact our first
quarter. Those will come along with the expected continued strength in Ag Productivity as that will also be a positive
driver. But this year, we won't benefit from the positive timing associated with last year's early U.S. season and the
quarter is also expected to include the effect of the widely recognized decrease in summer acres in Latin America as
well as lower acres and some timing effects related to cotton in Australia.
The last piece of the financial outlook I want to cover today is our cash deployment strategy on slide 23. I articulated
earlier in the year that we are primarily focused on funding growth in the business through CapEx and M&A that we
aim at keeping the solid balance sheet, but that we are ready to use any additional cash to more aggressively fund our
buyback and dividend programs. As we look at that cash strategy, I want to first highlight our fiscal year 2013 end
points. With total free cash flow at near $2 billion, we hit the high end of our guidance range and we nearly used 100%
of this free cash flow to return cash to shareowners through buybacks and dividends, which I see as the key proof
points of that philosophy in action. In fact, in the fourth quarter, we spent more than $0.5 billion on share buybacks,
making that the largest single quarter for buybacks ever.
Shifting into 2014, I believe the full elements of our approach will be even more apparent. We continue to expect to
generate strong free cash flow in the range of $600 million to $800 million, which takes into account the approximately
$930 million allocated to The Climate Corp. acquisition and the CapEx plan of $1 billion to $1.2 billion.
Within that bottom line figure, there are a couple of major priorities. First, we will continue to invest in the business to
support our global growth opportunities. This year, we are budgeting more for CapEx. And just as we did several years
ago when we built our seed production capacity in the U.S. ahead of our recent growth, we will primarily deploy our
capital to further build out our seed production capability. That will allow us to support the volume growth trends we
have in core markets like the U.S. and in rapidly expanding opportunities like Latin America and Eastern Europe.
These are investments that we evaluate very carefully and that offer some of the highest returns in our portfolio.
You see that same growth focus in our investment in Climate Corp. This is the most significant M&A we've had in
several years and it is one that has the potential to be transformational in the growth it unlocks by making farming more
precise. Practically, we will fund this acquisition with cash on hand and debt as we use the capacity of our balance
sheet while we can take advantage of a favorable debt market.
Lastly, we'll build on the start we made in 2013 on share buybacks and dividends. We expect this to start to reduce
share count through 2014, and in fact, we have early visibility as the share count is already lower entering the fiscal
year than it was at the beginning of 2013. Regarding dividends, we announced in August that we increased the dividend
by 15%. I see this as a continuing priority as we look to align our dividend opportunity with our business growth.
As we wrap up, let me emphasize that we are very focused on growth. That comes on the business side in the form of
the reliable performance we expect through our operational growth, but it also comes through as we put our cash to
work by investing in new capacity in the business and expanding our platform with today's acquisition. And that
growth is underpinned by our strong business. It is a business that is more diversified and with a broader portfolio than
ever but it is also a business that we expect will continue to generate significant cash to enable us to fund further
growth and further reward our owners.
Thanks for your time. And with that, let me turn it back to Bryan for the Q&A period.

we can take questions from as many people as possible. You're always welcome to rejoin that queue for a follow-up
question.
With that, Kevin, I think we're ready to take any questions from the line.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Perfect. Thank you. Just throughout the entire discussion here, can you add a little
more color on how The Climate Corporation fits into your existing platform, particularly with FieldScripts? And then
also, how long it will take to develop the optimal input algorithms across all the various inputs you're looking at
through your new and existing portfolios? Thank you.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah. Thanks for the question. So I'll say a few words and hand the mic to Rob. The great thing
about this acquisition is we see applicability immediately. So they are out there in the market today, they have a lot of
the algorithms and the data modeling that we had looked at. And literally in one step, we have an installed platform
now of big data as it applies to agriculture. We, as you rightly said with FieldScripts, we've got about 40,000 acres
that's being harvested right now and our preliminary focus is in corn but we see with The Climate Corp. acquisition the
ability to broaden that footprint into our other crops and then eventually into crops that we're not really in today. But I'll
let Rob say a few words on the agronomy of that.
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Thanks, Hugh. And, yeah, we're quite excited about today's announcement. We've talked now
for a couple of years about how the advances in biology and information technology are really creating a convergence
not only in the science of breeding and agronomy but clearly in terms of how we think about modeling growers'
decisions and the global outreach. And Hugh mentioned that a farmer makes about 40 key decisions. Many of those
decisions are very weather dependent and importantly this will accelerate our ability to add new scripts to our IFS
platform. And the other key element is the ability to move this internationally at a faster pace. So, I see the building of
capability and also the speed as the key drivers of this deal.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Thanks very much. More questions on The Climate Corp. Could you talk about how you
arrived at the value for the company? Can you talk about the revenue base they have today or maybe the client base
they have today?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, their revenue base is still small, Bob. So they're in the early stages of rolling out. They'll be
in about a million acres or so this year with their first products. Their first products have been some weather predictive
and weather service models and also some insurance models that are iterative to act on a top-up basis on top of the
Federal Crop Insurance program. So we see in corn at the beginning and across other crops over time tremendous
leverage on taking that weather data and folding those algorithms directly into our FieldScripts. And just to remind
people, FieldScripts this year is on a 40,000 acre Ground Breaker program, and with those, I think about 160 farms,
we've transmitted scripts remotely on an iPad in the tractor cab. The iPad then sets the planter on a variable planting
basis and we are harvesting those at the moment, harvest is late this year, but the early reads on that confirm our 5-
bushel to 10-bushel projection and with Climate Corp. we see that projection strengthening over time.

<Q - Robert A. Koort>: And maybe a follow-up for Pierre, could you tell us how we should feather in the DuPont
payments from a quarterly standpoint?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So, the payment is going to be booked twice a year and the first payment is going to
happen in the second quarter.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Hugh, another question on FieldScripts. How should we think about the ramp-up in both
volume and value over the next few years? Obviously with seed your volume ramp-ups determine biology. What's the
driving factor to determine how many acres you can get on over the next few years? And you talk about this being a
transformational platform, I mean what do you ultimately see as the size of this business relative to some of your seed
and trait platforms?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, Don, thanks for the question. So the ramp will be faster than traditional biology. We're kind
of a captive with our seed business on those first three years of slow takeoff. This is just making sure that we have the
processing capability in getting those algorithms refined and the deal this morning really puts the powder into the
engine room on that. So from 40,000 acres, assuming that we have the results that we anticipate this year, this could be
much larger, much faster. So I think it'll be faster than our traditional seed ramp, Don.
And then from a potential point of view, I mentioned this morning that $20 billion opportunity. We will start with our
own 400 million acre footprint. I think you can move from that very quickly to the 1 billion acre opportunity and it
takes you into crops where we're not selling seed today. So I see this ultimately being a tool for growers where we can
advise them in wheat and in rice and in crops where we don't necessarily need to sell the seed to have that advisory
tool.
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Yeah, Don, this is Rob. Again, a couple of the far-reaching impacts of this deal and one of
the things I really like about it is that it touches almost everything we do as a company. It's really going to accelerate
our breeding efforts and combining the genetic database with the field mapping will accelerate breeding. Clearly,
bringing that weather related predictive capability to the next set of the IFS scripts will make that more predictable. So
as you know, we started out this year with our first script to address population variability and it's gone really well so
far. We've been able to do the wireless transmission to growers that's been very seamless. A lot of the feedback has
been how well that has worked. Extending that and refining those scripts and then adding the next set of FieldScripts
for disease management and extending it to other crops becomes really our target.
The last thing I like about it is it really creates a very intimate relationship to be able to provide more information to
help growers and this is one of the areas where I can tell you as I talk to farmers literally around the world, the farmer
interest in this and both the frustration they have with managing all the data and variables they see against the ease of
execution of this platform is pretty exciting. So I expect the adoption to be pretty fast. I mean we're working, as you
know and you mentioned in the talk, with both equipment companies and other players and retail partners. We clearly
view this just as we did with the early days of the biotech; we're going to look at broad partnerships, broad licensing,
and an open approach to optimize the benefit of the technology to farmers.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: And just a clarification on value. Compared to the $10 you're charging for growers next year,
what is their initial charge on the 1 million acres they're going to be on?

<A - Bryan Hurley>: Hey, Don, this is Bryan. From a practical standpoint, they have a couple of different offerings.
The first is the supplemental insurance offering that doesn't quite work like that in our traditional sense. And then they
have a suite of tools that we end up rolling out from here and those kind of touch all of those in-season factors that Rob
was discussing.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Hugh Grant>: They are still to launch some of the stuff, Don, so they haven't ruled on pricing with some of this
yet.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Cox from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: Thanks. I think we've gone through a lot of this Climate Corp. On the core business, could you
talk a little bit about the earnings headwind you're seeing from lower summer corn acreage in Brazil here in the first
quarter that's embedded in your guidance?
And then a follow-up on the Xtend soybean offering, could you talk about any sort of update on the environmental
impact study?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, Michael, thanks for the questions. Quick word on the U.S. and a quick word on Latin
America. So in the U.S., a late wet planting season and you saw as the season dragged on some corn that just never got
planted and we saw the evidence of that in our returns. So as late as, I guess, mid-September, September 16 or 17, the
governments announced that there was about 3.5 million acres went in the prevent plant program. So those were acres
that just never got planted. There was nothing went on that ground at all. So our book would say of the 97 million acres
that's theoretically there, it's a number short of that and that 3.7 million acres, 3.6 million acres would certainly support
that.
In Latin America, we are very pleased. Brett and I were there week before last; very pleased with trait penetration. So
the platforms have built out very, very nicely. You see growers down there watching, they're playing wait-and-see
relative to the U.S. market. So last year, they had perfect market information because the U.S. harvested so incredibly
early. This year harvests are running really late and the Brazilian and Argentinian growers are kind of playing the
hedge at the moment waiting to see what harvest looks like here. So early signs down there is acres are going to be
crimped; they are going to be a bit smaller. And then Intacta and EIS, Rob? Oh, not Intacta, sorry, Xtend and EIS,
dicamba.
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Yeah, Don – Michael. So the dicamba EIS, we're working and providing the data and the
information. We expect that it will take about a year to complete that. Right now, we're taking advantage of that time
window in terms of our Ground Breakers program and providing additional opportunities for growers to see the
technology. If everything goes well, 2015 becomes a possibility for the market launch.
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: Thanks a lot.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: This is Brett. I would just add one point to the South America situation. The thing that I
track with my team is the big opportunity down there is trait penetration and trait intensification. And as I look at where
we are at with that part of our mix, we're doing really well in South America. Regardless of where the acres land, I feel
really good about how we're stepping up again with our traits. In Brazil, we're looking at double going from 30% to
50%. And in Argentina, we're looking at triple going from 40% to 60% and regardless of where acres land I feel really
good about that.

And the other point that I would add, and this is a point to the benefit of having a very strong global footprint in corn
acres. As Hugh mentioned, the South American farmers waiting to see what happens in North America and they may or
may not know in time to make their planting decision down there for the first season. But we're strong in the first
season, we're strong in the second season in South America and if they don't produce it down there, they'll produce it in
Eastern Europe and North America and we're strong in both of those markets. So throughout the year I feel good we'll
be in the right place at the right time.
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: That's a great point. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Bryan Hurley>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Just two questions of clarification. The first is that with the acquisition of Climate Corp. the
$0.14 in dilution next year, is that operational dilution or is it a combination of non-recurring acquisition charges plus
operational losses? What's the clean number?
And then secondly, for Pierre, do you expect Monsanto's average share count at the end of 2014 to be higher or lower
than it is at the end of 2013?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Jeff, thanks. I'll let Pierre start the second piece but let me just say a few words on guidance and
how we think about it relative to this dilution. And then, Pierre, maybe you can just give a bit color on the $0.14. I
would say that if you look at the business, and it was a tough end to the year with weather conditions and the effect of
planting and we're seeing that still washing through in harvest today. But despite that we're seeing strong growth where
we expected it in the business. And as we look into 2014, even with the dilution we still see good growth opportunities.
In fact, it's no coincidence if you took the $0.14 and added it back, you get exactly our traditional growth rate of mid to
high-teens in the 13% to 17%range. So I'll let Pierre say a few words on dilution, but without the acquisition, we would
have been right on track with our mid to high-teens growth rate. So, Pierre, maybe that as a backdrop on how you see
the $0.14?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: Yeah, looking into the $0.14, and as I mentioned, I mean you've got a couple things in the
$0.14. So starting with the amortization of the acquisition itself, which would account for about a third of the $0.14,
some financing costs and then a breakdown in between retention programs and operational losses, as you mentioned, in
the first years. So that's how we build this $0.14. It's the aggregate of those four elements. So that was to address the
first part of your question, which was regarding the $0.14.
The second part of your question which was regarding share count, so starting the year, we are starting with a lower
share count than we started the year in 2013. And as I mentioned, I mean we have the intention to be still aggressive in
our buybacks during the year. So although we don't forecast a share count for the year, I would expect on average that
that will be slightly lower than last year.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Thank you very much.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thank you.

<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Hugh, now that all the data is in, did you gain share in U.S. corn in 2013?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Well, the problem is, David, the data isn't in. Last year this time harvest was 70%, 80% done and
this year about 65% I think last year and 20% today, 25%. So my view in this is acres are going to turn out smaller. It's
just the gorgeous irony of the business we're in. We had a couple of quarters where the speculation was, why can't it be
a 100 million acres? And I think with the news on this 3.5 million acres that wasn't planted, this year's crop is going to
be smaller. We feel good on the volume, we feel good on the branded sales, but I think it's too early to call yet. Brett, I
don't know if you have anything you'd add to that?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, I just look at the U.S. and what the USDA says is 97 million planted acres and then
the USDA says that there's 3.5 million of prevent plant, and those two numbers seem to contradict for me. So we don't
know where the acres are, but what I can tell you is I feel really good about our global volume. I feel really good about
our branded volumes in the U.S., and regardless of where the acres finally wash out to be and we probably won't know
that until close to the end of the year, I am highly confident at this point we'll feel real good about how we landed in the
U.S. this year. But until those acres finalize, it's pure speculation on what happened with share. But I can tell you the
volume tells me I feel real good. And the returns don't concern me because I don't believe there's 97 million acres out
there. So we'll be fine.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: And, Hugh, just on this $20 billion opportunity, is there a margin we should think about,
growth or EBIT margin, that could translate into earnings for Monsanto down the road?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, margins are going to be very pure because it's information driven. But, Pierre, anything you
could add?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: I mean, it's obviously fairly early but the way to think about it is, once again, thinking
about the potential for yield improvement that those technologies can bring to the farmers. And I mean we've seen
potentially up to 30% yield improvement. And if you apply the value share that we usually use with our farmer
partners, I mean that's the way you can get to some kind of thinking about how we would price. And that's one of the
ways you can get to the $20 billion to $25 billion opportunity that we were talking about. So it's based on yield
improvement, it's based on value share, and then you can run the equations.
<A - Hugh Grant>: You know maybe this helps and maybe I would think about these almost like traits in terms of the
margin opportunity and the pricing opportunity as we deliver the yields that Pierre talked about. The difference
between these and traits is we think the development cycle and the regulatory cycle are going to be much, much faster.
So these will come in iterative waves and they get smarter as time goes on. So I think you characterize them in a similar
way to traits from a pricing and margin point of view but to the earlier set of questions, I think the curve has the
potential of running much faster.
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: And maybe the starting point for the thinking would be our FieldScripts pricing, around
$10 an acre, which is the first generation of those products. So you can range it in between the $10 an acre from
FieldScripts and the potential 30% yields that we can reach.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you.

question.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Good morning.

us understand, how does SG&A and R&D evolve with FieldScripts and with Climate? Do you need more people? Will

R&D be going up? Will the mix of R&D spend be changing at all?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So we're not anticipating significant change from the mix perspective. We definitely are
going to invest, I mean, to support our investment in The Climate Corporation but we already had modeled in our plan
also as part of the investment in our IFS efforts, so it's going to be the combination of those two that are going to drive
our spending. And it's going to be on the people side and it's going to be on some IT resources as well that we'll have to
invest into. But I'm not expecting significant changes based on this acquisition in terms of the evolutions of our ratios.
<A - Hugh Grant>: And then, Vincent, I'd just add, the last two years, Rob, certainly the last year but I think the last
two years, we've been going back and changing a lot our breeding and fields programs to improve the feeds into IFS.
So a lot of the R&D changes that we have made are already institutionalized. And then in my trips to meet The Climate
Corp. team I am blown away by the intellectual horsepower and the capacity of that group out there. They are a fine
team. They become the engine room for our algorithm developments and they will take a bunch of the mass and
modeling in IFS and kick it up to a new level. From an SG&A and R&D point of view, I don't see this as a phase shift,
Vincent. I just see it as leveraging. We are spending north of $1 billion generating piles of data every year. This just
leverages the data that we have much more intelligently.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Okay. And as a follow-up, you've done two acquisitions to get where you are today. Do you
have everything you need? Or should we be expecting other pieces of the puzzle to fall into place as we progress over
the next year or so?
<A - Hugh Grant>: So, you're right. These were two very important pieces. At this magnitude, it's not obvious what
the next one is, but there will be continued build out on this platform. But I think between the equipment piece with
Precision Ag, the data piece through The Climate Corp. and the biology that they hold, that's a pretty powerful triangle.
And the next step for us before we see the next wave of acquisitions, Vincent, is how we build out the platform with
partners.
So today, we're very explicit. We would anticipate partnerships with machinery manufacturers. We would see
partnerships with people in the fungicide and insecticide and herbicide business. So the input providers and in
particular we see tremendous opportunity through our retail network who are specialists in plant nutrition and putting
fertilizer on. So there has always been this question on how do you access the farmer and what's the quality of your
distribution? I think this announcement today puts our distribution partners in the front row seat. So between those
three pieces that's where I see the next level of activity rather than the next big deal.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Okay. Thanks so much.

<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yeah, hi. Good morning.

<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: So, Hugh, as you did your due diligence for Climate Corp., can you explain us the competitive
landscape in weather analytics, who the competition is, and why did you decide to buy this company? The second
question for Rob, if I may...
<A - Hugh Grant>: Please.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: ... is, Rob, are you thinking that the seed growth will slow down globally in 5 to 10 years and you
needed a new avenue of growth through this acquisition? Is that how you are thinking about it?

<A - Hugh Grant>: Thanks, P.J. So I will steal some of his thunder, we don't see that slowing down. And so why
Climate Corp. and then the other question, why $900 million plus and why now? We've been looking in the space for
the last three years since we started the IFS work and Climate Corp. is the best that we've seen. They're unique in the
agricultural space in terms of the quality of the people, their early approaches to the market, and their data analytics. So
they represent a big data platform that's already built for agriculture. And as we looked at it, our conclusion was if we
had tried to replicate this, it would have cost us more, it would have taken us longer, and we would have built it piece
by piece. So I think it's the entry ticket into a $20 billion market opportunity and it starts fast. When you think about
our footprint in seed today and you think what we could do with future partnerships, speed is really, really important in
this. So that's how we looked at it and we didn't see anybody who approaches their capability in the space.
And then, Rob, P.J.'s second question on looking out?
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Yeah and I think just to hammer home on that first piece, I mean, I, having been at the
company for a long time and watching how the integration of breeding and biotechnology changed the seed business, I
think what we'll see play out here is that the integration of biology and information technology is going to do the same
thing. I mentioned earlier, this is already changing the way we breed our crops and that feedback loop in terms of
selecting new seeds, new hybrids, is going to be refined. I think effectively what this will do is increase the
performance of our seeds by allowing that even more refined placement for growers to optimize yield.
And then as we talked about, what you and Brett mentioned in the script, many of these algorithms will benefit other
brands of seed, it will benefit seed with other crops that we're not participating in today, as we can bring those
weather-related algorithms.
I can tell you again, when I talk to growers, the concerns around climate variability, concerns around climate change,
the effect that small changes in temperature have on everything from planting dates to disease outbreak and insects to
plant nutrition are key and now the ability to model all those variables and provide growers with simple scripts that
work, I think is really exciting.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thank you. So we're going to go a little bit longer. There's still quite a few people patiently
waiting in the queue, so we'll go into lightning rounds now. So for my team, here we'll make the answers faster and
we'll try and crunch through a few more of these questions.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Hi. Just two quick clarifications; the Climate Corp. business model was reported at about
charging $30 per acre or about 3% of land value but having a weather insurance risk of about 10 times that. Are you
abandoning that?
And I guess the second part is the total capital invested was about $110 million. What are they doing differently that
you couldn't match their business model with a smaller investment?
<A - Hugh Grant>: So, we will not abandon the insurance products. We see opportunity for those products
strengthening actually in the U.S. but also in some of the international markets over time where there is very large
growers and very little insurance offerings today. So we've been discreet but the feedback that we've had in Brazil and
Argentina is there is tremendous interest in these products. So we will maintain that but we see the opportunity as
bigger than that insurance platform.
And then, Rob, again, real briefly but I think the thing they had that we didn't is the extraordinary people and the
existing algorithms.
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Yeah, tremendous team, great analytic capability and a team that is directly focused on
agriculture. And I think the key synergy that comes from this deal is combining their world-class analytics with our
genetics and agronomic databases. And that's really what creates the absolutely special opportunity for the company.

<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mark Connelly from CLSA. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thank you. I wonder if we could switch gears and talk about Argentina. The news this
morning in my mind is more consistent than inconsistent and I'm just wondering as you think about the opportunities in
Argentina, do you discount them much differently than you discount the opportunities in Brazil?
<A - Hugh Grant>: No, I'm not sure the news you're referring to this morning but if you're asking how do we see one
opportunity versus another, in terms of the runway, we see them both equally.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Okay.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: This is Brett. The news you're referring to maybe is the seed plant delay in Argentina and I
look at that's part of building new capacity and we have large-scale capacity in Argentina that we can leverage as well
as in Chile to help out there too. So we're in good shape.
As I look at Argentina, my focus is first on corn and driving our traits. I feel really, really good about that. We've got a
great track record and great performance down there. Second, I look at the most exciting opportunity that we have in
the company and that's Intacta. And I've worked with Argentina for a long, long time and never made a dime off of
soybeans and we're standing in front of the largest opportunity we've ever seen for soybeans in South America across
that entire 100 million acre footprint. And I couldn't be more excited about the fact that we're ready to dip our toe back
into Argentina and pursue that with a product that brings tremendous value to growers. And I would say enough value
to growers that they lined up and helped us get the final approvals in China to make it happen.
So they know it's valuable and they want it and they've worked hard with us to put a system in place. So I'm very
excited about the prospects in Argentina and Brazil.
<A - Hugh Grant>: If it hadn't been for Climate Corp., it would probably have been a bigger feature of the call today
but Brett and I delivered the first bag of Intacta seed on a Brazilian farm in northern Mato Grosso a couple weeks ago
and then did the pre-launch in Buenos Aires in Argentina. So I think the scattergun's gone in both of those markets.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tim Tiberio from Miller Tabak. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Tim J. Tiberio>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Good morning.
<Q - Tim J. Tiberio>: I guess when you look at the overall integrated farming space, there's a lot of companies
coming at this from different angles. Maybe if you can just sum up very quickly what do you see as Monsanto's
competitive advantage longer-term compared to some of the companies that are attacking the problem but maybe in
more piecemeal approach? Thank you.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, so thanks for the question. I think the piecemeal description I think is fair. That's not
criticism of any company, but everybody's been wrestling with this and it's so big. I think if you begin with the grower
and work backwards, integrating at a field level or at a sub-field level and then bringing the technologies and the
decisions to bear at that level of granularity it's we think what unlocks that increment of yield. And that's never really
been done properly until now. So, Rob, I don't know, in our lightning round, I don't know if you...

<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Yeah, let me just add three things that I think are really unique. First of all, all of this builds
on the genetic knowledge and it's really unique to us, the genetics of each individual hybrid, each individual soybean or
cotton variety and that really gets augmented by the ability to add to that the weather prediction to the potential of the
genetics.
Second thing is we have and it was mentioned, we have a large footprint to build on in terms of seed footprint around
the world and an ability to apply that agronomy to other crops and world areas. And I think the last thing is we're going
into this and we mentioned several times, we see this as being an open architecture model. So we would see ourselves
working with other input providers and retailers and I think that really creates the opportunity for coalescing and
moving quickly with a great deal of speed. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Gulley from BGC Financial. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: Hey, good morning, Rob. Thanks a lot for the kind of the high-level view of climate control,
but I was wondering if you could bring it down maybe a level. Let's pretend that I'm the farmer and you're the
salesperson and maybe think about how you would go through the season. What is it that you're going to be selling me
over the course of the season maybe? And maybe you can bridge that to if I'm getting an initial benefit of 10 bushels an
acre for corn now just from the IFS, how am I going to get from 10 bushels to 50 bushels with additional increments of
value you're going to bring to me as the salesperson?
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Thanks. I'll do it quickly and then I know Brett wants to add a couple of things because he –
it's – and I think one of the nice places to start is there's a bit of selling involved in this but this is really providing
grower with sophisticated real-time agronomic information that really helps them in their decision-making. So the first
thing that comes down to is the seed selection for that farmer field and that seed selection changes as whether changes
in the spring; just like we've seen this spring, farmers change varieties, they change hybrids and that's a very
weather-related decision. In fact, when you look at those 40 decisions that were talked about, many of those are
dependent on a real-time basis on weather.
So down to the rainfall and the climatic conditions of each individual field determines what that farmer needs to be
thinking about in terms of his forward decisions, when to spray to control bugs or insects, what they should be thinking
about in terms of micro or additional nutrition. And those are all of the factors that I think we can help them with, and
importantly, they are all going to be based on our knowledge of the genetics and the ability of our seeds to respond to
those climate conditions and that's what makes it so special. Brett, maybe a couple of comments from a commercial
perspective.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I think as I look at this, it changes the relationship that we have with the farmer to where if
you think about how this goes forward you sit down with the farmer, you've got access now to this tremendous data
capability to first of all recommend the product that fits the best across the field. Then you continue to leverage that
data as well as real-time data that's coming in from the source of the field throughout the year from variable sources to
help us, as Rob was describing. And that's where I come back around to, I think, one of the big competitive advantages
here for Monsanto going forward is we see this as an open architecture. We see this as a platform that brings partners
together so that we're all working with real-time information to go farm by farm, field by field to drive the productivity
of the land.
There's not a farmer out there that does not recognize that there's variability in the field and they're all really excited
that we're trying to help them address that variability and is going to take all of us. And that's the piece that I think will
change how we represent with the farmer the opportunity that we have here.
<A - Bryan Hurley>: Kevin, this is Bryan. I realize we've run long here but we'll wrap up here with one last question
and then we'll turn it over to Mr. Grant just to wrap things up finally.

Certainly. Our final question today is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Hi, yes. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. A question on your soybean gross
margin guidance, up 600 basis points to 800 basis points. I guess that puts you most of the way back to where you were
in 2012. Can you help us understand the components there in, in terms of how much might be cost relief versus
contributions from Intacta and your royalty agreement with DuPont?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: I mean, Kevin, you've touched on the three key points there. I mean that's really exactly
how it plays out. So both Intacta and the agreement with DuPont provide us definitely with revenue at an extremely
high level margins because those are in both cases royalty flows, and there's also an element of cost of goods
improvement that we will enjoy in 2014 compared to 2013, so that's exactly how you get to the six to eight points.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: And a quick follow-up, when would you expect the Climate deal to become accretive,
Pierre?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So as we said during the prepared remarks, we've got case to build this business and get it
accretive as early as in two years, that's the goal we have right now.
Operator
Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Grant for
any further closing comments.
Hugh Grant
Thanks, Kevin. So let me begin by thanking you for joining us on the call this morning. It's an important call. It's an
important time for Monsanto. So let me conclude with two brief points. First, a point on the core business, with
confidence in our base business and if you set the acquisition aside, this is a year where we see some of the strongest
growth in our key operational elements of the business. Secondly and I think this is important because we're building
on that business growth with our acquisition of The Climate Corp. It's an important addition. It builds out our IFS
platform. It creates the IFS platform in the near-term and it will strengthen our growth rate over the coming decade. So
I hope that you will join us for our Investor Day in November. We'll take the opportunity during the November meeting
to further highlight this unique opportunity and I look forward to seeing you there in St. Louis. So thanks again and all
the very best.
Operator
Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a
wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.
