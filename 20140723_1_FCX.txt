cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials, and to the risk factors described in our
Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.
On the call today are Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, President and Chief Executive
Officer; Jim Flores, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas, and we've got other
senior members of our team here with us today.
I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will review our recent
performance and outlook. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $482 million, or $0.46 per
share for the second quarter of 2014. The net income attributable to common stock during the second quarter of 2014
included charges totaling $130 million or $0.12 per share, comprised of $68 million for environmental obligations and
related litigation charges, $58 million for deferred taxes recorded in connection with the reduction of goodwill
associated with the sale of the Eagle Ford during the quarter, and $4 million for net non-cash mark-to-market losses on
oil and gas derivative contracts.
The second quarter results, we reported strong operating performance in Americas and Africa mining operations, and
from our oil and gas business. The results also reflected the impacts of reduced productions and sales from Indonesia
associated with export restrictions imposed in mid-January.
Consolidated second quarter copper sales of 968 million pounds were above the year-ago quarter reflecting growth in
North America. But gold sales of 159,000 ounces were below the year-ago quarter. Our copper and gold sales volumes
were below our April 2014 estimates, primarily as a result of the deferral of exports from Indonesia, which reduced
copper and gold sales by approximately 150 million pounds of copper and 240,000 ounces of gold during the second
quarter.
As indicated in our press release, we expect to complete an agreement with the Indonesian government imminently,
which would enable exports to resume immediately.
The second quarter sales of oil and natural gas totaled 16 million barrels of oil equivalent. That included the Eagle Ford
results through the June 19, just prior to the sale. That exceeded our April estimates by 5% primarily as a result of
higher production from Eagle Ford and the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
Our second quarter average realized copper price of $3.16 per pound approximated the year-ago quarterly average as
$3.17. Gold prices of $1,296 per ounce were slightly below the year-ago quarter of $1,322 per ounce. Oil prices
remained strong during the quarter with Brent prices averaging $110 per barrel, and the average realization by
Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas was $100 per barrel before the hedging impacts.
Operating cash flows generated during the quarter totaled $1.4 billion. That was net of the $400 million for working
capital uses and changes and other tax payments during the quarter, and our capital expenditures totaled $2 billion
during the quarter.
As previously reported, we completed the sale of the Eagle Ford field during the second quarter for gross proceeds of
$3.1 billion before purchase price adjustments, and also completed the acquisition of additional assets in the Deepwater
Gulf of Mexico for $900 million. Combined, the transactions provided $1.8 billion of after-tax net proceeds before
purchase price adjustments.
We ended the quarter with total debt of $20.3 billion and consolidated cash of $1.5 billion. We also reported today that
we redeemed $1.7 billion of face amount of our senior notes, and that was called for redemption last month. That
transaction has been completed.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the slide materials.

Good morning everyone. As Kathleen talked about, the results for the second quarter reflect strong performance from
our mining operations in the Americas and Africa and from our oil and gas business. It does reflect the impact of the
restricted sales from Indonesia because of this export situation, and I'll be talking more about that. Our outlook at the
first quarter earnings release was based on the assumption of resuming production in May and the export restrictions
lasted throughout the quarter.
We did make good progress on our growth projects. At Morenci, we are – commissioning of our new mill started in
May and we're in the ramp-up process for it. The major construction project at Cerro Verde is progressing well towards
a 2016 start-up. Jim will be talking about the Lucius development. The operator Anadarko expects first oil in the
second half of this year. And the Highlander project onshore in South Louisiana is advancing towards completion
activities also in the second half of this year.
We completed the sale of the Eagle Ford asset and the acquisition of the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico interest. That
enhanced our position for the focus area of our growth in our oil and gas business for the future. We are actively in the
process of pursuing additional asset sales transactions, all part of our goal of targeting a major debt reduction by 2016,
by the end of 2016.
As a matter of information, we have changed the name of our company to Freeport-McMoRan from
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold to reflect the expanded scope of our business. Our ticker symbol remains FCX.
The financial highlights that Kathleen reviewed are included on page 4. The major difference from the guidance that
we presented to you earlier has to do with the Indonesian restricted production situation. Otherwise, our operations
performed in accordance with our previous guidance.
The current status of where we are in PT Freeport Indonesia is that since January, mid-January, regulations were
adopted dated January 11. We have not had authorization to export copper concentrate. In those regulations, the
Indonesian government provided for a process to export concentrate, but they enacted a prohibitively large export duty,
which is still in the regulations, but as we understand, is in the process that export duty is in the process of being
reduced. The impact of this is that we've had deferred sales of 150 million pounds of copper and 240,000 ounces of
gold. I used the term deferred because the resources are still there and available for our production and sale in the
future, and we also have a sizable level of inventory of copper concentrates at our site available for shipment.
Year-to-date, these deferrals have accumulated 275 million pounds of copper and 380,000 ounces of gold. We've been
working with the government of Indonesia for roughly 2.5 years now to try to reach a common ground on dealing with
our long-term contract situation, our ability to continue our operations post-2021.
That's a key date because our current contract of work signed in 1991 had a 30-year initial term and it provided for our
having the rights to two 10-year extensions to 2041. Those extensions require approval by the government of
Indonesia. The contract provides though that the government cannot unreasonably withhold or delay these applications.
On the basis of that contract, we reported reserves through 2041. The complication that we face is that in 2009, the
government passed a new mining law that transitioned Indonesia's dealings with miners from a contract of work
system, which is what we have, to a licensing system. The licensing system provides, in general terms, that holders of
licenses are subject to prevailing laws and regulations, and so you don't have assurance of fiscal terms that we and other
contract work holders. The law provides that contracts of work will be honored to their terms. And our discussions
have been dealing with finding a way that's acceptable for us in terms of protecting our shareholders' interest and
finding a way that the government officials in Indonesia can feel comfortable with in terms of their view of their
responsibilities under the government's laws and regulations.
Our initial objective in recent discussions with the government has been to find a way forward of getting exports
approved and returning to normal operations. The financial consequences of not being able to export are significant.
Where we are because we have an interest in a smelter that we arranged to be built in Indonesia in the mid-1990s is we
have the ability to ship copper concentrates to this smelter owned by a company called PT Smelting, of which we own
25%, and our partner Mitsubishi owns a majority interest and operates. We can ship there, and so as a result, we can
ship about half the level of normal sales of concentrates that we have the capacity to produce, and we've been flexing
our operations to deal with that.

We have not made major reductions to our cost structure to-date because that has potentially long-term implications to
our operation and potential for disruptions in the local community and with our workforce. As a result of that, the
reduced margins amounts that we've earned from our operations there have amounted to an aggregate of $1.4 billion,
and that's shared roughly half-and-half by Freeport and the government of Indonesia. So we are working diligently to
first, find a way forward to resume exports and normal operations, and doing that in a way that protects our position for
the ongoing discussions about the arrangements for us to be able to continue operations beyond 2021 on an acceptable
basis. Over the past two months, we have – a month-and-a-half, we have been working with the government on a
memorandum of understanding. We believe that we have reached an agreement with the government officials' been
working with on the terms of that MoU. It is yet to be signed.
Indonesia had a presidential election on July 9 and the results of that vote were only announced on July 22. The
elections during the first half of the year for the president by the parliament earlier have been a distracting issue in
terms of our ability to reach this agreement with the government, but we believe we've reached agreement on the terms
of MoU. Under that MoU which as I said, has not yet to be signed but we expect it to be signed shortly, we have – we
would agree to provide for payment of an export duty over the next three years – 2014, 2015, and 2016, but at
significantly reduced rates from the regulations that were adopted in January. In addition, we would provide a $115
million insurance bond for the development of new smelter capacity in Indonesia, and we have indicated a willingness
to meet the government's objective of developing the smelter capacity subject to further negotiations and those
negotiations involved – include having an agreement on acceptable terms for continuing our operations beyond 2021.
We are talking with the government of providing financial incentives because building a new smelter in today's world
is financially uneconomic. We are also looking at involving strategic partners in the process and so, there's work to be
done on the smelter issue that require further work, but we did – our making this deposit of an insurance fund which
would be released as progress on the smelter is achieved. The new mining law and related regulations provided for
increased royalties.
We currently pay a royalty of 3.5% for copper. The mining laws regulations raises that to 4%. We pay 1% on gold and
the new mining law is 3.75%. As an accommodation to the government to achieve this MoU allowing us to resume
exports, we've agreed to, upon signing of the MoU, to pay the new royalty rates.
Now all of these issues or things that we've done that represent prudent steps in building good relationships with the
government of Indonesia which we have had over the 40 years of our operations there and building the basis a bridge
for continuing good relationships for the long term. It's a situation that we've had a lot of experience with not only in
Indonesia but around the world, in terms of trying to find ways of protecting our interest of our shareholders, at the
same time trying to meet the aspirations of the government officials, and so that is the basis for this concessions that
we've agreed to make in this MoU. We are – have agreed with the government that upon signing the MoU, we will
commence immediate negotiations for amendments of our [ph] CAL (18:01) on items that we will be addressing,
including importantly, the ability to continue operating beyond 2021 on the basis of assurance of legal and fiscal terms
to support the significant investments in developing our underground resources.
Our current outlook numbers, as you see in our release, are based on resumption of exports in August. Any delays in
obtaining these approvals result in monthly deferrals of additional 50 million pounds of copper and 80,000 ounces of
gold. If for whatever reason this falls apart – we don't expect it to, we think we have a way forward with these things,
then we would take steps to adjust our cost structure and reduce our CapEx because it is not sustainable to go forward
in the basis that we've been operating on since January.
Slide 6, I will just refer to in general. It talks about our long-term positive relationship in Indonesia. As you know, this
has been a fabulous asset for Freeport and for Indonesia and the workers in the local community. It's world-class. It's
been very profitable. We made investments of significance during very risky times in the copper markets and risky
times in Indonesia and Papua, and we've all benefited over the last 10 years as copper prices and gold prices have risen
so much, and we've got a huge reserve base to go forward for many years in the future.

We've been there for over 40 years, contributed over $60 billion to the country's GNP. We represent over 90% of the
economy in the area that we operate in, and a significant contributor to Indonesia's national GDP, 30,000 workers. We
developed already the company's only copper smelter, which has capacity that exceeds Indonesia's national copper
consumption, very significant investments to-date, with $15-billion program to develop our underground resources. We
contribute significantly to the local community including this voluntary contribution of 1% of our revenues to the
Freeport Partnership Fund, and so we've done a lot of things and you can see the government benefits from taxes,
royalties, and dividends, notice the bulk of that is through taxes, which we have a fixed rate on.
And the government gets more than 50% of the financial benefits. So there's a lot of reasons – incentives for the
government to work with us, and we're going to work with the government to establish, rebuild, and maintain our
long-term goodwill and partnership going forward. We'll be available to answer questions on this.
Turning to copper markets, you know the first half 2014 has been, in some ways a mixed bag. Going into the year,
there were a lot of questions about the – China's economy and growth rates and how they were going to maintain that.
They had this unusual situation of apparently fraudulent activity at a port in China that spooked the market for a while,
and some elements of China has been less strong than people anticipated, but home balance – China has had solid
demand and has kind of shaken off some of the earlier issues of the year, and remains key to the marketplace. In the
rest of the world, there has been a degree of general economic recovery, again, that has been spotty with the mixed data
we've had here in the U.S. Europe – we've seen in our business in Europe, a gradual strengthening, of course there are a
lot of geo-political uncertainties going around the world today that could have economic consequences.
But having looked at that, to see the level of copper prices that we have today, I think demonstrates the long-term
strength of the profit markets. Prices continue to be supported by supply side challenges which we've talked about for
so many years. Exchange inventories are at extraordinarily low levels. There's limited scrap availability; consumer
stocks are low, and the industry continues to struggle to maintain production level from aging mines and to advance
expansion projects. There is a significant deferral of major projects around the world as companies look to cut capital,
focus on returns to shareholders. The supply side issue will continue to be a major supportive factor for the
marketplace, and we're very excited about the copper markets and where we stand in that market with our large and
growing level of production, and our very large resource space that will give us future growth opportunities.
The projected market surpluses that people were pointing to are – now appear to be at much lower levels than
anticipated, so we are – remain very positive on long-term fundamentals of the marketplace.
Turning to our business, the slide, specifically the slide on page 8 demonstrates that we have performed well. You can
see in relation to our first quarter results, strong performance in North America, South America. Indonesia reflects the
issues that I just spoke about, and in Africa where we've had relatively good reliability of our power sources, which is
key to us there, we've really performed very well. So, our businesses are doing well. You can see the results from a
volume standpoint at the bottom of the chart.
With our projects, we undertook three projects to expand our copper volumes by roughly 1 billion pounds a year. Last
year, we brought the Tenke project online and did that in a very effective way and that expanded operation is
performing well. We achieved another milestone in this quarter by executing the growth project with the start-up of – at
Morenci and that is a significant high-returns project. It will add 225 million pounds of copper per annum, and Morenci
is a resource that we're looking for future long-term significant growth. We benefit with these projects by bringing
talent from our global operations to supplement the work, done by contractors. Every project has its challenges, and
you see that throughout the industry, but when you're working with it, it's easy to look at these numbers and see how
we do it, but it's a lot of difficult work in getting the job done. We are very optimistic about our footprint of our
business in the United States, about our ability to repeat what we've done at Morenci at other sites – so we got Morenci
and other sites.
Cerro Verde is a huge project. When it's completed, this will be the largest concentrator milling operation in the world
at 360,000 tonnes a day – 360,000 tonnes a day. Our team is totally focused. It's a project that is – has less risk than
many other expansion projects because of the footprint, what we've done in the past, we completed – virtually
completed engineering procurement, now we're focused on managing this very large-scale construction project.

None of these are without its challenges, and Cerro Verde has it, but it's really going well and we see a clear line of
sight to start up late 2015. And despite all of the issues constraining production at Grasberg, we continue to make good
progress in our underground development. And this is important in terms of our being able to execute our mine plan of
completing mining in the pit which will likely now extend until the first quarter or so, early 2017.
The Deep MLZ mine, the extension of our current producing DOZ mine, was targeted to start up in the second half of
2015, and this just represents a continuation of block caving that PT Freeport Indonesia started in the early 1980s. So,
these projects are going well. What we're looking to is a portfolio of world scale mines that spans the globe with great
growth opportunities. There are just a handful of mines today that produce 1 billion pounds of copper per year. We
have Grasberg in that category, Morenci will reach that, Cerro Verde will reach that, Tenke Fungurume has the
resource availability to ultimately reach it, and we're looking at expanding our El Abra mine with sulfide resources that
will put it in that category, so we feel great about having this portfolio of assets with potentially five or less operations.
We're really pleased with Jim and his teams doing in the oil and gas business, and now he will give us some comments
on it.
James C. Flores
Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Oil and gas business continues to cook along quite nicely, thanks to a
strong crude market. I think everybody has paid attention to the [indiscernible] (28:23) around the world, and it's
helped buoy, not the near-term but the long-term tail of the crude oil market and so, it's helped our transaction business
but also from a standpoint of realizations that continue to hold up really well, mainly in the Gulf of Mexico. When we
talked about – sales, about 16 million barrels, 5% above our April estimate, and Kathleen said is due to strong
performance in the Gulf of Mexico and also our Eagle Ford, with a $58 barrel margin and 50% of that coming from the
Gulf of Mexico at $73.
Our BOE margin. The results today do include our Eagle Ford production because actually, we sold the [ph] rights at
the end (29:06) of the second quarter, so third quarter going forward will not have the Eagle Ford in it, but will have
additional resources from the Gulf of Mexico as it continues to replace those reserves that we sold at $3.1 billion.
Talking about that transaction on page 12, we sold to Encana, and we acquired and rotated it to about $900 million of
Deepwater Gulf of Mexico interests. We consolidated more interest in our – in the Lucius oil development as operated
by Anadarko, that we have significant interest in and gives us just about a quarter interest in that development. And it's
on schedule for the second half of this year, September, October, started up as far as bringing that nice ore reserve on
production.
Our Heidelberg oil development is a new entry for us. Anadarko also operates a 12.5% interest in Heidelberg. It's
another significant Miocene play just west of our Holstein, so it's very integrated into our geologic thinking and
development thinking. We think there's a lot of oil reserves there, and that development's scheduled to come on second
half of 2016.
Then we've got some complementary oil and gas places to some of the resources we were capturing. So all-in-all, it
was a good – it was very good swing. By the end of 2017, we project these assets to be producing as much as the Eagle
Ford assets. We're going to produce once the decline sets in there and after the drill is finished in the Eagle Ford assets
where we have an engineer. So we feel like, we're [ph] played to (30:36) and a lot more growth and a lot better margin
in the Gulf of Mexico. That's an important step in the debt reduction program. We want to accelerate the corporate
goals of getting down to $12 billion by 2016. It's definitely value-accretive on a EBITDA basis and help refocus our
portfolio on the strategic growth areas there in the Gulf of Mexico. These will be our big areas of growth, of higher
investment returns.
Currently, we're on the eve of beginning to start drilling with our mobile units out in the Gulf of Mexico. By next week,
the Noble Sam Croft goes to work out at our Holstein facility. We've got a rig on our Holstein platform that's drilling
development wells and as this morning, has just drilled our second excellent-looking development well there. The first

one producing over 3,000 barrels a day.
So as we sell these onshore assets and redeploy the capital on our balance sheet and some of the capital in Gulf of
Mexico, we will now be replacing the production with growing production much faster in the years to come, now that
the rigs are in place. We have the Noble Sam Croft that starts next week. We have the Noble Tom Madden that starts at
year-end, and then we have a new relationship out there in the Deepwater, but an old relationship in the drilling
contracting business with Rowan Drilling Company, Rowan Relentless, that's going to start first half of 2015.
And what you're going to see there is a tremendous amount of upside pressure to our production profile there in the
Gulf. Our guys are doing a great job at Holstein. For example, we bought the [indiscernible] (32:10) 11,000 barrels,
12,000 barrels a day. Today, it's over 20,000 barrels a day after just drilling one well, and its great production
maintenance.
So with this activity, it's been a long time coming since the acquisition of 2012, and is one of the genesis of our
combination, was able to accelerate the development activity going forward on these properties. At the same point in
time, further investment in the Gulf of Mexico. So, we project that we'll have $4 billion to $5 billion more – more of
onshore asset sales to further accelerate the debt paydown, debt reduction plan here at the company. At the same point
in time, we will be buying additional interest in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico to complement our portfolio in the
hundreds of millions of dollars. So, we'll be selling in the $4-billion to $5-billion range, and we'll be buying in the
hundreds of millions of dollars to add to our potential going forward.
This has been a very successful program so far. We've spent about $500 million on the last two oil and gas lease sales
in the Gulf of Mexico, and including a significant launch [ph] or after the buy-in (33:18) leases and we feel like we've
doubled the reserve potential or the resource potential of our business from 3 billion barrels to over 6 billion barrels that
we've captured and, same point in time, paying down significant amount of debt here at the company. So we are going
to continue this process and going forward and the future looks bright in all front, the asset sales as well as the wells of
Gulf of Mexico's strategic positioning.
On page 13, it's just kind of gives you the breadth of our operations. Now, we're fully integrated in the Deepwater Gulf
of Mexico, we have operating/producing assets with a great staff, great systems, top-line operations, and doing a great
job out here with all the guys and all the partnerships with all our vendors as well, they really stepped up, so we can get
our jobs done on time and on budget. We have major development projects, and we're doing the tie-backs with our
existing facilities, as well as the major developments that our partners are doing like Anadarko. They've done a great
job at Lucius and also Heidelberg, and then with our exploration/exploitation opportunities, here's the – a picture of the
Sam Croft right here. Now that we have top-line equipment, we'll have three of these drilling by the end of – by the
middle of next year and we'll see some real action here on the development front, on the wells, and the production
going forward.
Those three rigs will be situated between the Marlin, Horn Mountain, Ram Powell, Holstein, Heidelberg, and Lucius
areas on page 14. Right now at Holstein, we have the rig running on the platform as I've said before, we've got the
Transocean Deepwater Champion drilling our copper well right now, exploratory wells just south of Holstein, then its
success will be tied back to Holstein, and then we have the Sam Croft as I said, just moving on today to the west side of
Holstein structure, to re-drill some discoveries we made a few years back. So, Holstein's going to look like invaded, but
it's going to – it really – see a lot of great production growth in 2015 and 2016 because of it.
Going on to our development projects at Lucius and Heidelberg, as I said, these are both on time and you see the net
interest now – about 25% of Lucius, about 12.5% of Heidelberg, and then the fall of this year as Lucius comes on, and
then the fall of 2016, the Heidelberg project will come on, both significant development assets and Anadarko's going to
[indiscernible] (35:43).
On the emerging exploration plays in the Inboard Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous activities, we continue to monitor activity
up here. We've moved – we're getting ready to move a rig in our Farthest Gate West project to work with Lineham
Creek, [ph] VAA would pass (35:59) to 25,000 feet, we're very excited about it, and we're moving forward on the
completion of Highlander, that's on schedule for either late September, early October. Well test, as well as at

Blackbeard East and Blackbeard West, we're moving forward with those wells as well. So we've got a lot of completion
activity. We're going to have a lot of understanding of [ph] products (36:23) and reservoirs and hopefully, some
fantastic production coming, especially out of Highlander going forward.
The 2014 outlook, Richard, do you want to take over from here and kind of?
Richard C. Adkerson
Okay. Thanks, Jim.
James C. Flores
Sure.
Richard C. Adkerson
We're updating our outlook. It reflects the – from our previous outlook, the delay in getting restarted at Grasberg. This
is based on a resumption of exports, return to normal operations in August and shows sales outlook for our company as
a whole of 4.1 billion pounds of copper, 1.3 million ounces of gold, 98 million pounds of molybdenum – by the way,
the price of molybdenum is up over 30% this year, and oil equivalents of 58.4 million barrels equivalents. That's lower
than previous because of the Eagle Ford sale, and as Jim said, we've got investment activities to look for future growth
in that area. We are now projecting at – for the year, unit cost of $1.50 a pound, that's at $1,300 gold, and $12
molybdenum, and $20 a barrel equivalent for oil. Operating cash flows at $3.25 copper for the second half would be at
$6.8 billion, and capital expenditures now are looking to come in at $7.6 billion.
Our sales profile looking forward shows the significant growth for copper. We complete our expansion projects and see
the effects of those expansion projects, plus the year 2016 reflects, in essence, the final activities in the Grasberg open
pit where we'll have very high grades of copper and you'll note the planned gold sales for that year are exceptionally
high. Note also at the bottom right, the growth in our oil and gas sales as these expansion projects Jim just talked about
come onstream.
Quarterly outlook is presented on page 19, again based on restart at Grasberg in August and having a very strong
second, particularly the fourth quarter is for copper and for gold. That's our details. That would result on that basis an
improvement in our unit cost from the experience in the second quarter where we would look to bring in the year,
combined with what we have the first half of the year at $1.50 per pound for copper, and you can see how that breaks
down in our different regional areas. When we look at our models or cash flows on page 21, you see EBITDA numbers
at the top, operating cash flows, which take into account cash taxes and cash interest excluding working capital
changes, and you can see this is an average for 2015 and 2016, and very strong cash flows, between $3 and $4 ranging
from over $10 billion to over $14 billion with that range.
So we've got a business that generates great margin, strong cash flows that allows us to fund our expansion projects.
You can see our current outlook for capital, as our mining projects wind down going into 2016, and then as our oil and
gas investments reflect the opportunities that we've created there, so this is – really, no changes in the 2016 outlook for
that. We referred a couple of times to our commitment to our balance sheet management when we announced the oil
and gas deal. We talked about targeting reducing debt to $12 billion by the end of 2016. We've had some challenges –
copper prices have been weaker than they were prior to that announcement. We've had the issue with deferred revenues
from Grasberg, but we still are committed to having this strong balance sheet.
We sold a very good asset in the Eagle Ford asset in the second quarter. We are working now directly on additional
asset sales across our business. We are prepared to respond to market conditions. We can't predict near-term market
outlooks, but we'll respond to those, whatever they maybe. And we'll look for other opportunities to repay, reduce our

debt, improve our maturity structure, and so forth. We are committed to continuing to pay our current dividend of $1.25
share per year until we get our balance sheet in shape, and once that happens with our business and outlook for
commodity prices, we'll have a chance of paying additional dividend. Beside the asset sales, we have the opportunity of
looking for participation of our strategic partners in some part of our business to reduce capital expenditures. So we're
looking at this at all angles. 2016 will be a very important year in terms of achieving this because of the nature of our
business plans.
So the story of Freeport stays the same. We're working on shareholder returns, managing our base assets, investing in
growth as we reduce our debt. We had a good discussion last night about the challenges of doing that, and there's not
many businesses that can do it, but we have the opportunity to do it. We are going to protect the balance sheet because
we and our board – our board and we, I should say, are convinced that matching up the kind of assets we have, the
nature of the markets that we're in, a strong balance sheet is a key to success in our business. And we want to continue
our legacy of returning cash to our shareholders and look forward to the time when we reset the dividend levels from
where we are today.
That completes our summary of our business. And now, we will open it up for the questions.
Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question
will come from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Yes, Jorge here from DB. Just wanted to follow up a little
bit on the comments, Richard, maybe that you made at the start on presentation 5 where you had mentioned that there
was a possibility of selling other assets. And then just picking up as well on Jim Flores' comments about potentially
even shrinking your oil and gas footprint further from potentially selling things in the $5-billion range and then
re-buying stuff in the hundreds of millions of dollar range. So just kind of wanted to understand, from a balance sheet
perspective, how is Freeport feeling right now? Do you feel that on a go-forward basis, you're going to have to really
do some asset sales to really make those – the $12 billion net debt – I'm sorry, debt target three years out? Just trying to
understand really what's driving the divestiture landscape a little bit. There's been some rumors on Candelaria. Now
there's some talk of further oil and gas asset sales. So just trying to understand on how you're feeling on your balance
sheet right now?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, we are facing the fact that we've had lower copper prices than we had going into
the acquisition of the oil and gas deal. We've had the deferrals at Grasberg. I mean that's just part of the nature of our
business. We have issues that we face, and those create headwinds to reaching that. We don't know what copper prices
are going to be in 2015 and 2016, and we're not going to bet our business on predicting prices.
The way we've been looking at assets to sell, and I think Eagle Ford is a great example of this – this was a very good
asset. There was a very strong market of buyers wanting to invest in that, as many companies are transitioning from a
natural gas orientation to an oil orientation.
We're looking at other assets where – good assets, but assets that don't have the growth profiles that our other assets
have, and seeing if there's aggressive buyers who will step up and pay good prices for them as we then focus on our
assets that have good growth potential. As the future of our oil and gas business, the strategy there is built around the
Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and our deep gas exploration play. So we're continuing to do that. We're assessing the
market, working with interested buyers, and if we can find transactions that, in effect, advance our ability to repay debt
or de-risk the ability to repay debt since we don't know how things are going to unfold in 2015, 2016, we'll act to take
place with that. These things require actions. We look at assets and test the market at times and decide those assets – if
it doesn't make sense to sell those assets, when we look at their underlying cash flows. So this is a dynamic process. We
are focused on debt reduction, and if we find assets that don't undermine our ability to grow in the future, and where we

have buyers that will pay reasonable prices in relation to the cash flows they generate, we'll execute those transactions.
<A - James C. Flores>: Jorge, this is Jim. And just back to what Rich talked about, all of the above balance sheet
management is the mantra across all sectors of the business, and with our large CapEx budget, we could manufacture
more oil, as we're going to do in the Gulf – as we're doing in the Gulf of Mexico and so forth. And the fact of the
matter, selling onshore oil assets, that is a premium market right now. The MLP market's very hot, debt markets are
very low, oil prices are significantly strong even in the near-term or long-term, we can get representative value for
those assets and then replicate those assets in an area in the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater very quickly, and an area where
we have higher margins and strengths.
It's a fantastic arbitrage that complements or that accelerates our corporate objective of reducing the leverage
company-wide. At the same point in time, we're still hitting the same targets of about 200,000 BOE to 225,000 BOE a
day in 2017, and selling and drilling our development wells and bringing it forward. So by meeting those objectives
operationally and bringing that cash flow forward out of those asset sales to accelerate the financial standing of the
company, I think what it's going to highlight is all the resources we've captured, adjoining our platforms in the lease
sales and so forth, and everybody's going to get used to the growing production in the Gulf of Mexico and monetization
of production elsewhere in the company that will go toward the balance sheet repair.
And I think that's what Richard talked about earlier, that's a two-edged sword that's very difficult to do – grow a
business rapidly and pay down debt at the same time, but we are in a position to do it, take advantage of the prices. So
it's more of a – it's a strategic initiative than a defensive. It's just being more aggressive and trying to get our balance
sheet very, very strong and be in good shape to take advantage of the opportunity that comes after 2017.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And we have a great set of assets that allows us to do that.
<A - James C. Flores>: Yeah.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: And thanks. And Jim, since you brought it up, the CapEx did increase for Freeport and it
was mostly on the oil side, about a $400 million increase for 2014. I was wondering if you could talk about it. Is that
sort of accelerating growth in the Gulf of Mexico? Could you flesh out what that incremental growth CapEx is,
especially just after a recent asset sale there?
<A - James C. Flores>: Yes. Number one, we added some CapEx for the Heidelberg development which we acquired
an interest there that obviously wasn't in our portfolio before. But the main driver there is that is that due to the
restricted terms on some of the lease extensions and delays that the federal authorities put out here, we had to go ahead
and move some rigs and then try to get completions on our Blackbeard East, Blackbeard West, and some of the Inboard
Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous completions, so that was a more regulatory-driven acceleration of that activity, and we
certainly hope that leads to higher production rates and volumes, so it is accelerated completion activity in the
Ultradeep was really the [indiscernible] (50:38) so it's short-term, either way.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - James C. Flores>: Okay.

Your next question will come from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Yes. Good morning. A question on Indonesia. In terms of the new agreement, this
memorandum of understanding that you have an agreement to but waiting to sign: it seems like the government is
undoing a lot of the terms of the contract of work and replacing it with what you call these license agreements. Will
they also – will your tax rate now revert back to the statutory rate? Under the contract of work, you're paying a 35% tax
rate which was in place when you signed the agreement in the 1990s, and now I believe that statutory rate, corporate
rate is 25% in Indonesia. Will your corporate tax rate drop as these other royalties go up?

<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Mike, let me – I'm going to go back over some things that I said earlier and just to make
sure we've got the stage set. With this MoU, the basic terms of our contract of work are not being changed, and both
our rights and obligations and the government's rights and obligations for the basic contract are not being changed now,
and we've agreed to enter into a series of negotiations as to how to bridge this gap between our viewing of the world
through the eyes of our contract and the government viewing the world through the eyes of their mining law and related
regulations. And that's the work to be done. The only three things that are currently actions that will be taken as a result
of this MoU are the agreement to pay royalties, the agreement to pay these duties for a limited period of time, and the
agreement to make this escrow deposit.
So the tax rate will remain the same. The government's expectation is that the tax rate would remain the same going
forward and in fact, under their licensing regulations for the form of kind of license that would apply to us if we were
under a licensed situation, there is a current 35% tax rate. So these things that we're doing now are in reality Mike,
concessions that we are making and our business judgment is that those concessions are warranted in terms of resolving
the current impasse we have on the export bans. So it is a compromise to create a bridge for us so that we can return to
normal operations, so that we maintain goodwill with the government to help us reach a resolution that it protects our
shareholders' interest in the long run, and that's our reasoning for doing it. But all of the other terms for the contract are
not being changed with this MoU.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Okay. And another question, just taking a few steps forward from here. In regards to
the construction of a new smelter in Indonesia, is it your expectation that Rio Tinto would be responsible for funding
40% or some percent of the CapEx to build this smelter since they will be achieving – receiving the benefit of it in the
future?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: The structure of the ownership interest and how we deal with the smelter is yet to be
finalized. Rio Tinto does have an interest in operation as you mentioned in the long run, so they'll certainly be at the
table on this. We will also – we've had interest expressed by strategic partners about participating both in Indonesia and
outside of Indonesia, and then the government, we have noted in this MoU a discussion about financial incentives that
the government would be at the table to talk about. So, that is a work-in-progress like much of this MoU. The first step
is the agreements to get us to work. Then, we've got a lot of work to do in terms of the long-term situation, including
the smelter.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: And last question...
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And the reality, Mike is, we know the commission that managed the elections just
announced the results of the vote. There's going to be a transition of a new government that'll come into place at the end
of October. And so, as we go forward, we're going to have a period of time of dealing with the existing administration,
and then dealing with a new government that has a five-year term. So that's another factor that will come into play as
we begin these negotiations on how to go forward.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Okay. This is the last question on this, and this is going to be a tough one to answer
but – you have a contract with the government that's supposed to supersede any changes in law in the country, and the
government comes in with a new mining law and basically changes part of the game. What's to stop the government
from doing that again in a couple of years?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, we are going to have an arrangement, if you – and Mike, we've been dealing with
– you've asked a tough question, we've been dealing with real tough questions here, you know for two and a half years.
And so, this is not an easy answer, but if you read what we said in our release carefully, and if – and in the MoU, we've
carefully crafted an acknowledgment and understanding that with however we come out of this, we're going to have to
have a basis for assured operations on fiscal and legal terms that protect our shareholder interest.
So we will have those legal protections, and then the business judgment will come out as to how do you deal with that
going forward, and experience has taught us that the best way to do that, if it's achievable, is to find a way to deal with
it in a way that reaches common acceptability. Indonesia needs foreign investment – their economy has performed very
well over the last 10 years. They have a very large internal economy that's growing. They've become a member of the

G20. The country has changed so much over the past 25 years I've been going there. And yet, they have a very large,
young population and to put people to work, they don't have an internal savings rate that's large enough to create the
investments to create jobs that whoever is president is going to be – have to have. So, at the end of the day, they're
going to need foreign investments, it's an emerging country and an emerging democracy. They don't do everything as –
in the way that more developed countries, more mature countries do. But there's going to be some imperatives for them
to put people to work. It is a true democracy and so, whoever is president, whoever is running the government is going
to be responsible to these people, because of the way that they can vote.
And so, it's not an easy path and we have to make business judgments. But again, we come back to the fact that those
business judgments reflects our desire to have goodwill and a partnership going forward. And not just they got heels in
and then point to our legal rights. So, we've done this and you saw what we went through in the Congo. We had a
situation there, where we had to make some concessions, but as a result of that, we kept our asset and it's operating very
well.
I believe five years from now, we'll look back and say, we did the right thing. And that's how we're having to look at it,
from the long-term, because this is a very long-term asset, very valuable asset for our shareholders. You just look at
those numbers in 2016 and it comes real apparent to you. We want to be operating there and take the benefit of all of
this work we've done, since – actually since 1988, when we discovered the Grasberg and all during the 90s to develop
our mine plans. We've been looking forward to that year for a long time. And we made a lot of money in the interim
through difficult times in Indonesia, through operational issues, through political, social changes there, through tough
copper markets. You and I know that all too well, Mike. So anyway that's – we're working on this in a way that we're
long-term shareholders and we are going to protect their interest.
<A - James R. Moffett>: Mike, let me answer ..
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Thank you, that's it from me.
<A - James R. Moffett>: This is Jim Bob.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Okay, okay.
<A - James R. Moffett>: There's a restructuring going on in the industry. People have the concentrate when they have
the smelters on their soil. So all these concentrate, which means banned for export mainly to smelters around the world
are going to have the reality, if they're going to have to develop smelters in the country where the concentrate is. That's
what this whole export controversy in about, it's going on in other countries. And that's why the strategic partners build
this smelter – and be coming, because you can't take any cut off, as much concentrate that has to stay on the soil that is
produced. So if you take that into consideration and realize it is we are in these negotiations with this government, not
only are there changes in the social structure of Indonesia, but there is a definite change of policy around the world. So,
the traditional market that has concentrate being smeltered in other countries is going to change quickly.
So, we are in the middle of that. We are in the middle of the social development in Indonesia. But understand that we
built this bridge with this MoU within and take on the [ph] subjects (01:03:18) like what the tax rates are going to be
and what kind of long-term agreement we have to have with the yields reserve in front of us. And we are converting
this mine, an underground mine, and then they are much well aware that we found the resource. We know where the
additional ore bodies are. And so, we have a long-term credibility with this government. And we will come up with
something especially with this restructuring in the whole market, when you talk about the refinery smelter
requirements.
But you're going to see that around the world and there's going to be a lot of statements about when the control assets,
and – but if we look at the world and see people who have tried, they appeared ready with their control of assets, like it
was going on in Venezuela and headlines that you're seeing, where you've got headlines yesterday, Chaos in Venezuela
as a result of political decisions that were made. So, we'll work through this. We've been talking with these people a
long time, and we had this partnership was [ph] ice (01:05:01), our discovery of the Grasberg and the government
needs us to continue to help run that over and Germany has to build technical facilities. We will be building the largest
underground mine in the world. So we have to look at this on a global basis when you're over there negotiating and I

think we've addressed that. So the contracted work will be plus-plus, and that's why we can negotiate differently than
people that don't have it.

Your next question will come from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Good morning.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Good morning, Sal.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Can you tell us again what's the relationship between the extension of COW talk and the MoW
(sic) [MoU] (01:06:09), is there – are they dependent on each other or are they exclusively independent of each other?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, they are not independent of each other. The MoU is a bridge to further
negotiations on the Contract of Work, and the rights to operate beyond – including the rights to operate beyond 2021.
The MoU has two components to it. One is a current agreement to take three actions that I described earlier and then it
sets up for further process for the renegotiation, extended negotiations for an extension and so forth. So it does not, it's
a first step, it's a first step and it was a first step to resolve this export situation and then lead into further negotiations.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: So would you be willing to – so your terms will be that MoU, sorry COW extension should stay as
is, which is sort of post-MoU agreement, which is higher royalty and so forth, that it extends that those conditions just
remain the same for the next 20 years for the – of the extension, is that where you will would stand?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, I think it's a practical matter. With this agreement, we're agreeing to these new
royalty rates for the life of the mine. And you saw that chart that we had on page – where we showed the benefits to the
Government of Indonesia.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Yeah.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Page 6. You can see that royalties are a relatively small part of what we pay to the
government, and yet it's a lightning rod issue. Meaning, publicly, in Indonesia, many people think of Grasberg as a gold
mine, and we pay a 1% royalty on gold. It is an amount of money, but it's not major in relation to our total financial
situation. So this represents, for the royalty, I think, what our royalty rates are going to be for the life of the mine. When
you get to this export duty, that's a short-term situation, leading to the smelter development and that remains to be
negotiated. So that's – the duties, the deposit, that's all part of the smelter picture, that's gotten to be a hot bucket – hot
target. The purpose of this mining law, in large part, had to do with the nickel industry and the bauxite industry, where
Indonesia is a major global supplier. And what Indonesia was doing, was mining raw ores, shipping them to Japan and
China for further processing, and for aluminum and nickel, the major part of the value is created downstream. And they
have prohibited those, and put a lot of small businesses and other size businesses in Indonesia out of business. And
politically, people view copper, even though it's economically different, to be in similar situated, so that's the problem
we've been dealing with. In a country, Indonesia is not alone like this, where you have resource nationalism. They think
about penalizing Indonesian companies and giving a different situation for foreign investors like Freeport is a
politically tough pill to swallow, and that's what we've been dealing with.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: And last one sort of for me is, Rio Tinto obviously has – is going to be a major part of this
Indonesian mine starting 2021. I am just wondering, are they involved in these negotiations and will they be a part of it,
and would they have a say in it or is it – you are dictating the terms?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: We're not – certainly not dictating the terms. We have a participation agreement with
Rio Tinto. We've had a great partnership, it started in 1995. They have rights under their participation agreement. We
have been negotiating with the government directly having discussions with them. There are many issues that we're
going to have to work with together as we go forward, but we have a joint venture, it has a participation agreement, and

they have rights under that, and we will work with them consistent with their rights. But you're right, they're going to
be a significant participant in the operations going forward.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: All right.
<A - James R. Moffett>: This is Jim Bob again. In 1988, we had the blessing to find the largest ore body in the world.
When you look at the copper, gold, silver, depending on copper prices and gold prices. So to find a 100-year life mine
in the middle of New Guinea of 13,000 feet, which provide a challenge. In fact, as you have evolving world, with all
the market forces at work, from the day we found the mine, trying to get out there and get that copper down from
13,000 feet in a remote area that had no infrastructure and had no current employment base. We've looked at every
aspect of this from the day we found the property, but the blessing is that it was the kingmaker and gave us an
opportunity to build up industry to where it is today. So the challenge of how you deal with a 100-year mine life is, in
an ever changing world, we have to keep that in perspective. But the good news is, we have the richest ore body in the
world. An average ore gives us gold and silver byproduct, especially with what's happened to the pricing of gold and
price of copper since we found the mine. The price of copper was under a $1 for all those years as we found the mine.
So we talk about negotiations and looking forward in operations to 2041. We have to look back and say, we're blessed
with the fact that we've got something that's probably will be producing until 2061. So that's what you have to do is to
keep your mind on the pricing side of having that kind of asset and we'll manage through this just like we managed
through all the other challenges.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Thank you very much.

Your next question will come from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Yeah. Good morning everyone.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Good morning.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: As I was listening to your comments, Richard and Jim Bob, about the sensitivities there, that
seems like there's some similarities with what you all are dealing with in Indonesia with what Rio is dealing in
Mongolian and seems like the government kind of has an edge because the projects are further along, a lot of the values
underground. And I'm wondering, how should we – should we be unnerved by statements coming out of the press in
Indonesia that the COW extension discussions would not begin until 2019? And is that just – that's not true? And first
of all can you make me feel more comfortable about that as you're going through this process and, clearly you're
making concessions here. Is that – what's the guarantee that you will be able to take that next step here, number one?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: All right, let me first of all I'll just make a comment about this two-year situation. That is
the result of a regulation that was adopted by the government. It's not a provision in the 2009 mining law, but the
government that we have been dealing with considers that regulation to be important and so that's been one of the
barriers that we've had to getting a completion of discussions on the contract extension. We have spent a lot of time
advising the government that we cannot wait until 2019 to understand our rights to operate beyond 2021 and the terms
of those operations between now and 2019, our plans call for us to spend $8 billion of capital in developing the
underground mine and then we have the smelter situation to deal with. So there is important provision of this MoU, is
that we are going to – we both agree to deal with this issue over the next six months. So from the government
standpoint, they've been looking at this regulation. Our standpoint says our COW makes us not applicable to that and
the MoU says, okay, we are going to work this out. We didn't reach agreement on it now. We are going to work this out
over the next six months.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Okay.
<A - James R. Moffett>: The MOU, Tony, is a bridge and what that does is it supposed to wait until 2019. That was
the mechanism and that's why we made the concessions, so that we can force both our sales and the government to

come to the table and realize that the good news is we've gotten there forward to be producing way and going beyond
2041. But having this smelter issue come up, this mining law versus the COW and the license. That's exactly what we
try to do, to get this MoU, to move this negotiation period of 2019 to today. So that everybody can understand the
realities, that we can't spending all this money underground. Our money on the smelter, without having some financial
issuances [indiscernible] (01:17:45) don't do any good to build a smelter if you don't build this underground mine.
Grasberg is not available to do the smelter. So, this is a very complex situation, but as I said earlier, this mine is so rich
and so big, it generates these kind of problems that we're having to negotiate. That's what the MoU does, it starts the
negotiation how to solve this problem in 2021.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Thank you. And I guess my next question would be, I know you guys have been over there a
lot and just consuming a lot of your efforts these days, but have you been in direct conversation with the new President
Jokowi or members of his team, the old team elect there at this point, and what can you tell us about his certainly
understanding of the seriousness of these matters and his willingness now to meet you guys and his team at the table
here as we go forward?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well. Tony, we stayed out of the political process leading up to the election. It was a
very hotly contested elections, as elections tend to be, and it split parties, it split people in government, and we are
always in the position of not trying to influence elections or getting involved with them. We work with whatever
government people of the country elect and so we stayed out of the political process.
The Vice President under Jokowi was a former Vice President under the first term of SBY and we've known him for a
long time. He is a businessman. We had past relationships with people involved on both sides of the election. Jokowi
has made some positive comments recently about working to resolve the mining issue and we are going to be prepared
to work with them as their transition goes from the current administration to his administration. Our hopes are that we'll
be able to engage with his transition team, his leadership team and working with the current government to help us
begin this process before they've come into office at the end of October.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Okay. Thanks for that Richard and Jim and Bob. And I guess the final question I have is, I
haven't heard any mention today of possibly there was sell down provision, and I – is that – I know in the past you've
talked about that you would be open to possibly divesting a stake that was previously owned by some Indonesian
interest, but has that come up? Is that something that is likely to be a part of a future contract or business license
arrangement and what can you say about that?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yes. It is one of the items. There were six strategic items that we've agreed to discuss in
terms of the re-negotiation, our contract of work. This divestment issue is one of those and we've tentatively agreed on
a process of divestment that would involve increasing Indonesian ownership interest over time to 30% from the current
9.36%. That would involve giving, initially, the government an opportunity to acquire interest. We have talked about
having a listing on the Indonesian exchange, which we view positively and the government views positively any
divestment would be at fair values, but that is not something that is committed to under this or the final agreement
hasn't been reached under this Memorandum of Understanding, but that would be part of the amended COW, but the
current contemplation is that there would be divestment of fair value over time to raise Indonesian ownership interest to
30%.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Thank you Richard. Thank you to Jim Bob. Jim Bob, I'm sorry you were going to say
something too?
<A - James R. Moffett>: What I was saying is in the making out here is the government understands the huge
expenditure, first we want to go underground and then actually talk in the government about a regulation, and they
come out to say that people will have big underground mines will be set at 30% too. There's a lot of people who're
thinking about a lot of different things, mine open pit versus underground. The major expenditures for getting
underground and getting those. So, again, you build the bridge with this MoU. You got all these issues on the table in
trying to get them understood.

<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Thank you so much, gentlemen. If I may sneak in one final question, I'm sorry about this. I
just wanted to ask Jim a question, and I noticed, I didn't hear anybody talk about this, but – and I'm sorry if you – if this
is redundant, but the Davy Jones well test #2, we see that it was not a success. Can you make any further comments on
that, just update us there?
<A - James C. Flores>: Well, it wasn't a commercial success. We have to go offload and we perforated a large section
of [ph] resistive (01:24:17) log section plus also section of a log that was suspect, and we produced a lot of salt water
and some gas out of it. The only comment, really, that makes good sense, these are wildcat completions, we're learning
from each one. The equipment worked flawlessly and so forth. We immediately took all the equipment we could and
then stretched the tubing string and all the long leads out of Davy Jones #2 and moved it expeditiously over the
Highlander, and the Highlander test is really going to be one of the definitive commercial moments in this whole play.
So from the technical standpoint and engineering standpoint, we learned a lot, and I would say everything was
successful, safe and so forth, but from a commercial standpoint, it was a failure.
We are, we are in the process of P&A in the number one well, but we were unable to get the flow, and we are going to
take that equipment on number one well and perforate the lower charge with the Wilcox zone and the number two well
before year end. Those operations plus the operations in the Blackberry West and Blackberry East were, as I said, were
regulatory driven from a standpoint and we are going to learn out of these things, hope to establish some production
there, but all eyes are on Highlander at this point, Tony.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: And what's the timing on that Jim, Highlander. What should we be looking for here over this?
<A - James C. Flores>: Highlander – My engineers are saying September. So I'm telling you October, how is that?
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Okay. All right, fair enough. Thank you gentlemen, thank you everybody, Kathleen too, thank
you.

Your next question will come from the line of Ralph Profiti with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ralph Profiti>: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Most of them have been asked. If I can ask
just one more relating to PTFI and the state of the operation for when it's ready to go back to 100% because for the
better part of eight months, Richard, the workforce has been largely kept in place. I was wondering would it be safe to
say that you have say eight months of advanced stripping and equipment maintenance in place, and to what degree
could we see this as a positive impact in 2015, when you think about things like production, strip ratio and mining
costs, if everything goes to plan?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well. You made a good point, Ralph. We have been – kept our workforce productive
during this time, and we have been able to mine some waste and low-grade material that we would've had to have
mined in the future. We've done a lot of maintenance work. We've kept the DOZ mine operating in a way so that we've
kept the caving operation going in effective way, and so we've really had a period of time, despite this lower sales, of
having safe productive operations from our workforce, and that will benefit us going forward. As I said, we also have a
substantial amount of concentrate inventory that we're going to have to work into the marketplace. The concentrate
market is pretty well supplied already, and so it will take some time to do that. But we will be able to have very positive
operations beginning immediately upon our authorization to export.
<Q - Ralph Profiti>: By this renewed guidance, would it be safe to say that timing to get back to that would be a
matter of weeks?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yes, Ralph, it's Kathleen. We are projecting in the guidance that you've seen that we will
start operations in August. There'll be a period of ramp up for the mill and a period of time to get shift schedule to come
in, but as Richard said, we should get up to capacity pretty quickly.

<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: As an example of that, Ralph, our second quarter unit operating cost for PT Freeport
Indonesia was $2.66 a pound, $1.53 in the first quarter, and if we return to normal operations, for the year we would be
down to $0.96 a pound. So that just shows you how we can recover from this.

Your next question will come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Just want to get back to after you purchased the
oil and gas assets from PXP and McMoRan. There was this notion of self-sustaining assets meaning cash flows from
the oil and gas operations will be basically sustaining the development CapEx for oil and gas operations. With the
intent to sell assets in oil and gas, should we think about differently about that, i.e., mining operations providing the
free cash flow to – for the development of oil and gas?
<A - James C. Flores>: Oscar, it's a good question, because when we sell the Eagle Ford cash flow, that was about
$600 million a year of free cash flow to our business, declining, but it was there. And you talk about some of the
additional asset the size we're talking about, basically, we're going to absorb the short – the CapEx deficiency or
variance between the cash flow and the CapEx level through the asset sales. So we're really – the amount of asset sales
we're going to sell will bridge negative cash flow in 2014 and 2015 on into a flat to positive year at 2016, and then
2016 on, we'll be self-sustaining. So within the oil and gas unit, including the asset sales, we'll absorb all the – any
negative cash flow.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: [indiscernible] (01:30:00)
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: So we're consistent with that approach, Oscar, nothing has changed. It's just the CapEx
will be funded from cash flow and asset sales of oil and gas assets.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: That's understood. But with the additional sales, as you mentioned, between $4 billion and $5
billion, I'm assuming that that's probably on the – if it's onshore California and that's where the vast majority of the free
cash flow is coming. So would that still be the case?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yes.
<A - James C. Flores>: Yes. That will be the case. Remember this, those type of assets have zero tax basis, so the
IDCs during the spending of 2014 and 2015 really help for the tax basis offset and any kind of property acquisitions,
smaller property, [ph] actually (01:30:48) like kind of exchanges, so there is a tax component there that it benefits to
have the negative cash flow that year to offset the tax burden of just downright selling those properties.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then if I may, on Indonesia. There is a statement in the
press release that talks about the MoU and Freeport paying a reduced export duties that would decline as the smelter
development progresses. Can you give us an idea of what level of reduced export duties you're looking at, because
2016, in your mine plan for Grasberg, we still have significant increases in both copper production and gold production
that would be impacted by an export tax.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yes. The process for completing the MoU will include the Ministry of Finance adopting
new reduced export duties that will be declining rather than the current regulation which provides for escalating export
duties. Currently, the export duty starts at 25%, growing to 60%. We expect, and it hasn't been adopted yet, but we'd
expect the export duties to be initially below 10% and then they would decline based on progress with the smelter and
would involve getting an agreement on the long-term rights to operate. Our goal would be to work to get to a zero
export duty by 2016.

<<Q – [06YXT6-E]Oscar Cabrera – Bank of America Merrill Lynch>: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, if I may,
I'll be quick with this one. Can you just remind me of your agreement with Rio Tinto? With the divestment of 30% in
Grasberg, how would that impact the 40% interest in production from the asset?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, we're talking about the divestment of shares in PTFI and that's what – that's all
we're talking about here, PTFI would continue to own 60% in the joint venture with Rio Tinto.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: And in terms of production, does that affect their share of production, Richard?
<<A – [05F880-E]Rich Adkerson – Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.>: No. It's PTFI is what we're talking about.

Your next question will come from the line of Joan Lappin with Gramercy Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joan E. Lappin>: Good morning, everybody. Jim, would you talk a bit, I assume, it's your domain about the Gulf
Coast, the Gulf Coast royalty trust, because that was an important part of the complete transaction a year ago. And
when – what of the properties that remain viable are going to come online and when that will influence that? And also,
I would appreciate it, I guess, it's a variation on the previous questioner. On slide 27, where you show your – well, 26
and 27 sort of fit together, and you're showing your important areas going forward. I assume the biggest green dot
shows the most oil in the new areas that you have just expanded your position in and whatever.
And then my last part related to that is you've shown us these different rigs that you will be using, can you tell us how
the cost of those relate to drillship or whatever compared to the very expensive rigs that we were using in the Shallow
Water Ultra Deep gas project?
<A - James C. Flores>: Okay. Joan, good morning. The Gulf Coast Royalty Trust, I'm going to point you toward
Kathleen Quirk, and also you promised me a trip to Houston to go over this in person, and you haven't shown up yet, so
I'll take this as our meeting from there. And the aspect of the Royalty Trust is not really driving any aspects at Freeport.
I mean we're Freeport, we're doing commercial decisions based on good engineering data and geologic data as I [ph]
inspect in the plant (01:35:52). The Inboard Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous play has grown beyond the Gulf Coast Royalty
Trust footprint, but the most significant potential production asset we have today, the Highlander project is in the Gulf
Coast Royalty Trust. So I would focus a 100% on that, and if we come up with some significant production at
Blackbeard West, Blackbeard East or Davy Jones #2 in the mean time, then that's a bonus. What's depicted on page 26
and 27 is our producing assets, our major operating producing assets, and I emphasized producing because we have not
produced any gas or oil out of the Inboard Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous play, it's a frontier exploration play. On top of
that, to your rig question and so forth, the different operations onshore versus deepwater they don't really relate as well
as [inaudible] (01:36:46). The jack-up market is pretty mushy right now, but we continue to work with our partner,
Rowan, to provide the premium equipment and it's worked out fine. These are lot of intricate operations, you got to
have the top-line equipment. So as far as the rig cost, they're about flat where they were.
<A - James R. Moffett>: And then on the Lineham Creek, Jim...
<A - James C. Flores>: Sure.
<A - James R. Moffett>: ... as part of the loan adjustment, Lineham Creek was a discovery in the [indiscernible]
(01:37:19) and that had been in the prospects [indiscernible] (01:37:23) Inland prospect, which is a very nice structure
just in the east. So I guess you got tremendous attention in the [indiscernible] (01:37:38). So those areas, Lineham
Creek represent some of the structures along it's [ph] 25,000 acres (01:37:51) in the Highlander, which we're focusing
on now has led to the Cretaceous discovery and you have the [indiscernible] (01:38:04) play, and those two in addition
to the [indiscernible] (01:38:12).

Our next question will come from the line of John Tumazos with the John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please
go ahead.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Good morning and thank you for taking my question and for the presentation. I'm a
shareholder and I'm very happy. And I'm impressed with the good moves that the company has made to pick up the
Apache asset, the 20 new leases in the Gulf of Mexico. The Reservoir joint venture in Europe, the Quaterra joint
venture just announced and other new opportunities that you may consider. I'm concerned that some other people might
be worried the company is obstructed by debt or distracted by Indonesia. And I'm very pleased at the progress you're
making in new endeavor in spite of all the distractions. Please explain in a little more detail how you're slowing down
the less productive activities and reallocating, things change dynamically, you get a good drilling result at one property,
you have a road block at another. Tell us a little more how you're being disciplined with the weaker projects to make
more room for more of the good new opportunities, please?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well. John, we have a great team. [ph] Brett (01:40:03) is here and just last week, we
met with 50 or so of his managers in the Americas and reviewed every one of our projects there. Those guys are
interested in what's going on in Indonesia, but they're not involved. They are playing different positions and everyone is
focused. We had our Africa team there too, Everyone's focused on their own business. And we sit down, we went
through everyone of our mines just to the operations they had done so far this year, what we are looking forward, going
forward, what will our growth opportunities, we have a separate group that's working on going through our mining
reserves and resources and assessing how we focus on the next stage of operations.
That was the same process that we went through that came up with the Tenke expansion, the Morenci expansion and
the Cerro Verde expansion. Jim and his team are very interested in what's going on in Indonesia but they are really
focused on running their assets well and looking for growth opportunities and divestiture opportunities – divestment
opportunities and so forth. Jim Bob works very closely with [ph] Rich Lavelle (01:41:23) on our exploration both our
brownfield and greenfield exploration.
So, ultimately, we step back from that and say where is our business judgment for the greatest opportunity to put the
development resources on and then we bring in our development team to focus on that. Dave Thornton and his team
has been running our Molybdenum business very well, of course we did the expansion at Climax. We've monitored that
market, managed production to meet the demands of the marketplace. So it's – while as investors, of course, you are
going to focus on the things that are currently most important from a corporate standpoint. Underneath that, we've got a
great team that's working on the rest of the business. And what I like about our company as opposed to when I look at
the way larger companies do a run in the mining business and in the oil and gas business is because we've got such a
great team, you know it freeze – when we do have a problem like we have in Indonesia or Africa, we can put senior
management to work and working with our guys on that team, and the rest of our businesses does just fine. So, we've
come a long way, and you've been watching us for a long time, from where we started to where we've ended up now
and I couldn't be more pleased with the people we have and the way our team works together, to prioritize and deal
with the broad scope of our business.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you.

<A - James R. Moffett>: John, this is Jim Bob. Just a quick comparison. If we go back 10 years, this export problem at
our great Grasberg mine, how would you like to – been dealing with the issues that we've dealt with in the last five
years, the strike and the accident and this start of the export ban, it would have been Freeport McMoRan Copper and
Gold with a single asset – the best asset in the world. So, when you look at the specialties today that we've got all these
brownfield prospects, for instance in the Congo, you should view that recently we've [indiscernible] (01:44:04) 60
kilometers of ore to surface that we're now [ph] tying (01:44:14) together by using these [ph] projections (01:44:17),
and drilling some deeper, we have a chance to have, again, one of the world-class ore buying – when you take it back,
now Grasberg, we view that deeper [indiscernible] iron ore exploration drilling and reserves. We found the equivalent
amount of copper and gold, it was another Grasberg, just trying to drill in the brownfield projects. So we are blessed
with not only some of biggest world-class mines in the world, but we're blessed with the prospects that are becoming
world-class mines, because of our brownfield exploration effort.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Thanks John.

Your next question will come from the line of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Thanks. Hi everyone. So I have a follow up question on your potential sale of stake at
Grasberg. In case of a direct sale to the government, is it possible that you may have to provide financing for the sale of
that stake?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Not for a direct sale to the government. What I'm talking there is a central government
and that's the way their regulations work. We have, in the past – we've actually undertaken efforts to have a stake in the
shares of PTFI owned by the province of Papua. We believe that could potentially be positive and we would consider
providing some financing for that piece of the transaction. We try to accomplish this several years ago and just wasn't
able to get there and we would be really focused on making sure that any sale like that would be for the benefit of the
province and the people of the province and not some third-party investor, but that will be something that we will be
considering as we go forward.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Got it. So I guess if there is financing, it would be only for that chunk 8% or 9% and,
currently, you're looking at only either IPO or sale to the central government?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, the 8% or 9%, the percentage that we'd be talking about is not defined yet. 8% or
9% is a very large amount of money for an asset of this size, so that's uncertain as to where – any percentage that would
come about. And the process would be, the central government under the way Indonesia works would have the first
call. They had an opportunity to buy this interest that we reacquired from an Indonesian organization in the 2001
timeframe and the government opted not to do it. Then we have the potential of doing some of the province. Then
beyond that, and the listing, the IPO in the Jakarta Exchange, and beyond that, then there would be an opportunity for,
potentially, other Indonesian nationals to invest. So it's a process that is yet to be worked out. It could be a combination
of all of these. Important thing is, is that our shareholders will get fair value out of it and it would take time to execute
all this.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Great. Thanks, Richard.

Next question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Hi. Good morning. I have two questions. Just to be clear on the MoU, the day you sign it,
imminently, whatever that means, the 115 goes into effect, the higher royalties go into effect, but then do the –

whatever the reduced export taxes on the concentrates go into effect, so if they were to be 10% going down to a lower
number by 2016 that you will actually have certainty, the day you start exporting on what those taxes are going to be or
is that something that's still have to be negotiated in that six months comment you made about the MoU?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: No Brian. That would be defined and known and in effect upon signing of the MoU.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Okay. So when you re-export that will all be laid out, so you have a clear run away for
what your paying?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: As soon as we sign the MoU, we will advise the market of what its terms are and what
would be effective immediately and so we will do that.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Okay. Then my second question is sort of putting this all together and you've been very
good over the years about giving forecast of EBITDA and cash flow at various prices every quarter. With all the
moving parts now, you give guidance for 2015, 2016. We assume the resumption of exports in August from Grasberg,
but in that, as Ralph brought up, you probably have better cost in 2015 than we used to just because you pre-strip, you
obviously have a tax now on the smelter going forward, we've obviously sold Eagle Ford and you just did that, can I
assume the stuff on page 21 now given all those pluses and minuses, because it looks like it has changed a little bit,
include all those assumptions or is it free the MoU, if I want to think it that way, because there's a lot of moving parts
here?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: It does not include the impact of the MoU, yet, it does include the Eagle Ford and the
acquisition of the Apache Interest and so forth. So – but it does not include the MoU since that has not yet been – as
that has not been signed.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: And would it have to benefited us, if fair to go back to Ralph's point, so, I think it's good
one that you would have some better cost structure in 2015 and 2016 than you did before all else being equal you have
done all that extra maintenance and pre-strip?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well this does reflect our current mine plan. Now, we view that continually and, as you
know, Brian, over the years, we're always looking for ways of incrementally improving it, and the guys will be looking
at the ways of accessing higher grade material, and with the pre-stripping, the opportunities for that are much better
than they have in the past. We're talking with our guys, for example, about having access to some very high gold rates
in the pit that we might be able to access earlier than later. So, ...
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Look, Brian, the projections that are in the cash flow model are consistent with the mine
plan for PTFI in the back on page 29.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Right. And just on that, I noticed gold's up again in 2017, I assume that's just flow back
from the delay and everything this year and it looks like maybe that can come back for things like that is what you are
talking about?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Right.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: That's right.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: We'll have the chance for optimization and we'll keep you informed as we proceed with
that.
Well, everyone we've had a – oh, wait, we do have a couple more, I'm sorry. David is pointing out. Appreciate it. So,
let's see. So, operator, you want to, I think, see who else is on our list.

Yes. Our next question will come from the line of Brian Yu with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Sounds great. Thanks. In [ph] your endurance with the small call (01:52:51) Rich and the
team. On the duties where you said it starts at less than 10 and goes 10 to zero. Does this apply to both the copper and
gold or just copper? And is there a portion of it that gets credit towards the smelter build?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: It is on copper concentrates, so that would include the copper and gold. I mean we don't
sell copper and gold separately. We sell copper concentrates, which has gold and silver in it, and we get paid for that
concentrate based on the prices of copper, gold and silver metals, but we don't actually sell those metals separately.
That's sold to the smelting company, but we get paid for it. So it is going to be only on exports and on concentrates,
which will include all the metals in the concentrate.
No, there is no credit on the smelter, that's a separate deal. But the latest thing works from a cost standpoint is we only
pay the export duty prior to the smelter coming on stream, once the smelter is built, if we can reach agreement on
building and so forth, the export duty goes away.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Okay. And is there – when it goes to 0% or plan to go 0%, 2016, that would coincide with the
start up of the smelter sectioning?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: No, not with the start up of the smelter. These smelters are substantial industrial
facilities and it takes time to build it. The scale down in the duty as contemplated by the MoU will be made on the basis
of progress towards building the smelter, progress is currently contemplated to be measured on the basis of cost
extended and committed, and the objective would be to say, once you reach a point of no return, once you spend
enough, so that you – the government is satisfied that you're going to complete it, then the duty goes away.
Their view, the government's view, and they've been vocal about this was that the duty was not designed to raise money
for the government but as to write an incentive for the companies to build the smelter.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Okay. And what percentage spend committed or the 0% export duty tied to? Is that like 50%,
75%?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: I think it's best given the current stage of what we are, it is not that are very high. It's not
– the majority of the cost is what we're talking about, it's something less than that, but given that this thing is – had not
been signed yet although we believe the terms we discussed with the government once are going to be adopted, but it
still has to be signed. I think Brian, it's best at this point not to get that specific with what the terms are.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Okay, appreciate it. Thank you.

Your final question will come from the line of Mitesh Thakkar with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mitesh B. Thakkar>: Good morning, gentlemen and thank you for squeezing me in. Just on the oil and gas side.
I understand when in May you guys announced the acquisition of additional interest in Lucius, your working interest
was supposed to go up to 35%, but it looks like now it is 25%. Can you explain a little bit, give us some incremental
color around it?
<A - James C. Flores>: Yeah. In the oil and gas transaction, the existing holders of the Lucius interest, additional
partners, have a preference or right of purchase to any sale that goes on within Lucius and so when we contracted to
buy the Apache 10% interest, two parties, the original partners, exercise that pref rights, which caused us to exercise
our pref right. So we got a reduced interest where Exxon and Impact, a Japanese company, both liked the price we're
paying for Lucius and exercised their right to get their percentage and it reduced our interest to the 5.1% versus the
10%. So that's the reduction and, therefore, instead of it being a $1.4 billion acquisition, it was $900 million.

<Q - Mitesh B. Thakkar>: Okay. Great. And just on the Indonesia, the 2015 copper and gold guidance came down
[indiscernible] (01:58:09). And I was just wondering if you are doing all the pre-stripping today, shouldn't it actually go
up instead of going down or is the benefit just on the cost side?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: No. There were some minor changes we made to the startup of Deep MLZ in 2015, which
affected the volumes in a modest way. The open pit really didn't change significantly from what we had previously, but
we're projecting a couple of months delay from what we had before for the Deep MLZ and that's the impact you're
seeing.
<Q - Mitesh B. Thakkar>: And that impact has nothing to do with the negotiations going on right now or..
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Correct.
<Q - Mitesh B. Thakkar>: ...is it kind of [indiscernible] (01:58:53)?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: No. During this whole period, we've been proceeding with the development of our
underground resource that including the Deep MLZ and the Grasberg Block Cave. And so, this is just an issue related
to the completion of the Deep MLZ mine and its roughly a quarter.
<Q - Mitesh B. Thakkar>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much guys and thank you for being kind with the time.
Richard C. Adkerson
Okay. We appreciate everybody's attention for being kind with your time. We had a lot to talk about and we will have a
lot to talk about as we go forward and we look forward to that. If you have any follow-up questions, please direct them
