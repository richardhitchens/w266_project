With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
Susan, thank you, and good morning, everyone and welcome. As you know, we've reported earnings of $1.2 billion for
the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding DVA and our repositioning charge net income was $2.2 billion or $0.69 per
share. These earnings were below expectations reflecting the high level of legacy costs most notably in legal and
related expenses.
We also had a reserve release, which was significantly smaller than in previous quarters as our credit trends are
normalizing, and we have not yet begun to release mortgage reserves. To be clear, we are not satisfied with these
bottom-line earnings and our focus is not only on putting the drag of legacy issues behind us, but also on optimizing the
efficiency and returns of our business as a whole.
Despite the disappointing bottom line, our businesses generally performed well during the quarter. Investment banking
increased its wallet share. Loans grew in core businesses such as Latin American consumers where we saw double-digit
growth. In addition, we decreased Citi Holdings' assets by 9% during the quarter for 31% reduction for the year.
Our capital strength improved during the quarter with the Tier 1 common ratio increasing to an estimated 8.7% on a
Basel III basis. Although the environment has shown signs of improvement, we believe it's likely to remain challenging
with continued spread compression, the introduction and implementation of new or evolving regulation as well as the
costs associated with putting legacy issues behind us. This puts even greater importance on getting our operating
efficiencies to a level we're satisfied with and on allocating our resources to opportunities with the greatest risk
adjusted return.
Regardless of the environment, Citi needs to be recognized globally as an indisputably strong and stable bank. We
believe the proper essentials are the combination of a strong balance sheet, made up of high quality assets, supported by
the appropriate levels of capital and liquidity. Along with our risk profile, our necessary levels of capital and liquidity
are a function of the consistency of the quantity and quality of our earnings. And as a Company, we need to deliver on
our commitments.
When I became CEO on October, I stated three main objectives to accomplish by early in the New Year. First, conduct
business reviews and prepare the 2013 budget, which drove our repositioning charge in the fourth quarter. Second, was
to structure of my management team, which was announced on January 7th; and third was to finalize and submit our
CCAR, which was submitted on the same day.
Throughout this period, I spent a good amount of time meeting with stakeholders; our clients, investors, regulators, and
of course, our people. Let me make a few points based on those conversations. First, our strategy is to focus on our core
banking businesses by trying to provide best-in-class products and services to people and institutions leveraging our
global footprint, which includes the world's growing fastest markets and cities. We believe our strategy is aligned with
the dominant secular trends.
Second, we'll continue to seek ways to refine and optimize the execution of our strategy and focus on operating
efficiency, As a Company, we need to show expense discipline and that we could be smart allocators of our resources,
driving them where they can catalyze strong risk-adjusted returns.
For example, the $900 million in expense reductions we expect to realize in 2013 from the repositioning actions we
announced in December was driven by a bottoms up review of where and how we're going to allocate our expense
dollars. That said improving our operating efficiency needs to be BAU not just an annual event. Third, we are very
focused on Citi Holdings considering the disproportionate drag it places on net income and returns.
In 2002 we reduced the size of Citi Holdings by 31% and it now makes up 8% of our balance sheet. That being said
there is no silver bullet which will immediately resolve Holdings. We'll continue to manage these assets and our
associated expenses in an economically rational way while taking advantage of any reasonable opportunities to reduce

them more expeditiously. And as you know our North American mortgage portfolio makes up the majority of Holdings
assets.
Trends in that portfolio were favorable in the recent quarter and we continue to watch the U.S. economy and housing
market very closely. But before I turn it over to John, I'd like to emphasize that we recognize our net income today
doesn't yet reflect either the amount or caliber of earnings our shareholders expect and that our franchise is capable of.
It will take some time to work through the challenges of the current environment to realize this potential. Improving our
operating efficiency, returns on assets and tangible equity in a risk balanced manner and returning capital to our
shareholders, are critical goals going forward.
I'm a believer in you are what you measure, and I intend to set clear goals and hold my management team accountable
for them. Similarly, we'll share key metrics with you in the coming months so you can hold me accountable as well.
Now, John will go over the slides, and then we'd be happy to answer any of your questions. Thank you.
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. To start, I'd like to highlight some significant items affecting our
results this quarter. First, CVA and DVA were a negative 485 million pre-tax and $301 million after-tax in the fourth
quarter, for a negative impact on EPS of $0.10. In addition, as previously announced, we recorded a $1 billion pre-tax
repositioning charge in the fourth quarter, or 653 million after-tax, for a negative impact on EPS of $0.21.
For comparison purposes, in the fourth quarter of 2011, CVA and DVA had a minimal impact at negative 40 million
pre-tax, and repositioning costs were 428 million pre-tax, or 275 million after-tax, for a total negative impact of $0.10
per share. Adjusting for these items, we earned 2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012, or $0.69 per share, as
compared to $0.41 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Throughout today's earnings presentation, I will be discussing our results excluding both CVA/DVA, as well as the
higher than normal repositioning costs in the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2012, to provide comparability to prior
periods. I will also discuss prior quarters excluding the impact of gains and losses on minority investments, as well as
the tax benefit in the third quarter of 2012. A full schedule of repositioning charges by business is included in the
appendix.
In addition, as shown on Slide 4, there were a few other significant items, which are included in our results. First,
operating expenses in the fourth quarter included legal and related costs of nearly $1.3 billion, compared to $529
million last quarter and $832 million in the prior year. Legal and related costs in Citicorp including Corp/Other
increased significantly from prior periods to $735 million, driven primarily by U.S. consumer related matters. And Citi
Holdings legal expenses were roughly $550 million, including the previously announced $305 million charge related to
the foreclosure review settlement.
Second, the net loan loss reserve release of $86 million this quarter was significantly lower than prior periods.
Year-over-year, about half of the decline in the reserve release was driven by Citicorp, mostly in North American
cards, and about half was driven by Citi Holdings, reflecting declining loan and reserve balances versus last year. In
Citi Holdings, we recorded a net reserve build in the fourth quarter, as a significantly lower net reserve release was
more than offset by the impact of losses on loan sales. This compared to a reserve release of $663 million last year.
On Slide 5, we show total Citigroup results for the quarter. Revenues of $18.7 billion were up 8% from last year, while
operating expenses of $12.8 billion were roughly flat, and higher legal and related costs were offset by a 3% decline in
core operating expenses. Credit cost of $3.2 billion increased 11% versus last year.
Net credit losses of $3.1 billion declined by 25%, However, as I just discussed, the net reserve release of $86 million
was down significantly from $1.5 billion last year. We earned $2.2 billion of net income in the fourth quarter, or $0.69
per share, up from $0.41 per share last year on a comparable basis. This was driven by loan growth, lower core
operating expenses and lower net credit losses, partially offset by the increase in legal and related expenses, and the

lower net loan loss reserve release.
Citigroup end of period loans grew 1% year-over-year to $655 billion, as loan growth in Citicorp continued to outpace
the wind-down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 7% to $931 billion. We saw an expected decline in deposits during
the fourth quarter, reflecting the run-off of episodic deposits which came in at the end of the third quarter, as well as the
expiration of the Transaction Account Guarantee, or TAG program. This decline was partially offset by continued
growth in core operating account balances.
On Slide 6, we show full year results including the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Throughout today's
earnings presentation, I will be discussing Citicorp results including our operating businesses, global consumer
banking, securities and banking, and transaction services, as well as the corporate/other segment.
Full year 2012 revenues for Citigroup were $77 billion, up slightly from 2011, with less than 5% of revenues coming
from Citi Holdings. Operating expenses were down 2% and credit cost also declined, as a significant reduction in net
credit losses was offset by a smaller loan loss reserve release in 2012 versus the prior year. For the full year, Citigroup
earned nearly $12 billion of net income, up 18% from last year.
On Slide 7, we show quarterly results for Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp generated fourth quarter revenues of
$17.6 billion and net income of $3.2 billion. Year-over-year, revenues grew 9% and expenses were up 3%, and higher
legal and related costs were partially offset by a 2% decline in core operating expenses. And, for the eighth consecutive
quarter, we grew loans year-over-year in every business in Citicorp.
Total Citicorp loans grew 7%, with consumer loans up 3% and corporate loans up 11%. Citi Holdings had revenues of
$1 billion and a net loss of $1 billion. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $156 billion of assets, down 15%, during
the quarter and $69 billion, or 31%, year-over-year. At quarter end, Citi Holdings accounted for 8% of total Citigroup
assets.
On Slide 8, we show a nine quarter trend for Citicorp's results. As I noted, Citicorp's revenues of $17.6 billion were 9%
higher year-over-year, and down 4% sequentially mostly reflecting seasonally lower capital markets revenue. Expenses
of $11.3 billion were up 3% from last year and 2% sequentially due to the higher legal and related costs. Citicorp's net
credit losses of $2.1 billion continued to decline in the fourth quarter, down 19% from last year driven by improvement
in North America cards. And the net loan-loss reserve release in Citicorp was $137 million, down significantly from the
prior quarter and prior year mostly reflecting a decline in the net reserve release in North America cards.
Year-over-year, we grew Citicorp's earnings in every quarter of 2012.
On Slide 9, we showed Citicorp's pre-tax earnings by business, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves. For the
full-year 2012, earnings grew to just over $20 billion, up 40% from 2011, driven by Consumer Banking and Securities
and Banking.
Slide 10, shows the result for North American Consumer Banking. Total revenues of $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter
were up 3% year-over-year largely driven by higher gains on sales of mortgage loans, partially offset by a decline in
cards revenues. Total card revenues were down 3% from last year and lower average loans were partially offset by an
improvement in spread. Lower retail services revenues also reflected improving credit and its impact on contractual
partner payments.
Total operating expenses of $2.6 billion were down 3% year-over-year primarily due to efficiency savings. On a
sequential basis, the increase in expenses was primarily driven by higher legal and related costs. Credit cost of $1.1
billion increased 10% year-over-year and were up 25% sequentially. Net credit losses declined by 27% year-over-year
to $1.3 billion driven by improvement in cards; however, the net loan loss reserve release was significantly lower than
prior periods at $215 million this quarter compared to $784 million in the prior year and $518 million last quarter.
Looking ahead to 2013. Assuming a continuation of the current economic environment here in the U.S, we expect the
average quarterly net reserve releases in cards to roughly approximate the fourth quarter level.
Earnings before tax excluding the impact of loan loss reserves nearly doubled from last year to $1.5 billion. Overall we
continue to see progress in our North America consumer franchise. Average deposits grew for the seventh consecutive

quarter up 9% year-over-year including double digit growth and checking account balance.
In branded cards accounts also grew for the seventh consecutive quarter up 3% year-over-year and for both card
portfolios net credit margins continued to expand year-over-year.
On Slide 11, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. On this basis both revenues and
expenses grew 4% year-over-year. In Latin America both revenues and expenses grew 7% from last year and in EMEA
we generated positive operating leverage with revenue growth of 11% and expense growth of 5% year-over-year.
In Asia revenues were down 2% from last year while expenses were up 1% however on a sequential basis revenues
were flat as we began to move past the headwinds in both Korea and Japan. I'll talk more about Asia in a minute. Most
drivers for international consumer banking continued to grow in the fourth quarter. Total average loans grew 5% from
last, card purchase sales were up 10% and investment sales grew 36% year-over-year. Credit costs of $869 million in
the fourth quarter were up 12% from last year driven by 12% growth in net credit losses, due mostly to loan growth as
well as some specific commercial loan charge-offs in Latin America.
On Slide 12, we show our Asia consumer results in a bit more detail. Total revenues remained under pressure in the
fourth quarter due to the continued low rate environment and the impact of regulatory headwinds in certain markets
most notably Korea. Our underlying business volumes however reflected continued franchise strength and importantly
credit performance remained very good, reflecting the high quality of our portfolios.
We also maintained expense discipline across the region, while still investing in important markets such as China.
Looking first at the card business, revenue grew 2% year-over-year with significant growth in card purchase sales. In
total purchase sales grew 8% from last year, and excluding Korea purchase sales were up 9% versus prior periods.
Investment sales revenue showed strong performance, up 14% year-over-year, and down moderately from a
particularly good third quarter, as retail investor sentiment improved and we continued to retract high quality
customers. Revenue pressure was most into our retail lending and deposit businesses, down 10% year-over-year as
spread compression offset volume growth.
Volumes reviewed in Korea in particular. Excluding this market, average retail loans grew 8% year-over-year. Our
overall outlook for Asia remains positive and we continue to believe we can grow 2013 revenues as an annual rate of
4% to 6% from current levels. We also believe that longer-term as customers become less risk averse and interest rate
normalize, revenue growth in Asia will converge with the existing driver growth, and that should feed through the
earnings given our efficiency, portfolio quality and strong market position.
Slide 13 shows our international consumer credit trends. Credit quality in our international consumer portfolio remain
strong in the fourth quarter. For total international consumer banking, the NCL rate increased 17 basis points from last
quarter to 215 basis points, driven by Latin America, while 90 plus days delinquencies were fairly stable at just above
90 basis points.
In Latin America, the increase in the NCL rate reflected a $50 million sequential increase in retail net credit losses.
Roughly, a third of this increase was related to two specific commercial loan charge-offs in Mexico. And the remainder
primarily reflected seasoning of the portfolio, mainly personal loans in Mexico, Columbia and Brazil. In Latin
America, we expect retail banking NCL rate should normalize in the range of 2.5% by the second half of 2013.
The cards NCL rate in Latin America remains stable in the fourth quarter at 7.7%. However, we would expect this
portfolio to normalize to a level of around 8.5% in 2013 as the portfolio seasons. On a combined basis therefore, we
expect the NCL rate in Latin America to normalize in the range of 4.5% by the second half of 2013 based on what we
see today. In Asia, both the NCL and delinquency rates remain fairly stable as 1% and 50 basis points, respectively.
Slide 14, shows our Securities and Banking business. Revenues of $4.8 billion grew 47% from last year and were down
14% from the prior quarter on seasonally lower capital markets revenues. Investment Banking revenues of $996 million
grew 56% from the prior year and 8% sequentially with higher revenues in all major products. Overall, our wallet share
in Investment Banking improved this year in most products and regions.

Equity market revenues of $455 million nearly doubled from last year driven by improved derivatives performance as
well as the absence of the prior periods proprietary trading losses. However, sequentially equity market revenues were
down 11% on lower derivatives revenues.
Fixed Income Market revenues of $2.7 billion grew 58% from last year driven by significant improvement in credit and
securitized products as well as higher revenues in rates and currencies. Sequentially, Fixed Income Revenues declined
27% from a strong third quarter.
Lending revenues, excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans were $397 million in the
fourth quarter, up 17% from last year on higher loan balances and improved spreads and down 11% sequentially on
loan sale activity. Total operating expenses of $3.4 billion were down 2% from last year driven by efficiency savings.
Credit costs were $78 million in the fourth quarter and net income grew substantially year-over-year to $1.1 billion.
Moving now to Transaction Services on Slide 15; revenues of $2.6 billion were up 1% from last year. Treasury and
Trade Solutions was up 1% year-over-year, driven by a continued growth in deposits and trade loans, partially offset by
ongoing spread compressions. Securities and Fund Services revenues were flat for last year as growth in fee revenues
was also offset by continued spread compression. The drivers for Transaction Services continued to show strong
momentum.
End of period trade loans were up 24% from the prior year. Average deposits were up 16% and assets under custody
grew by 10%. Expenses of $1.5 billion were up 2% from last year due mostly to higher legal and related costs as well
as certain episodic items, which also drove part of the increase from the prior quarter. We experienced negative
operating leverage in Transaction Services in the fourth quarter, reflecting both spread compression in revenues and the
increase in expenses.
While we currently expect client volumes to continue to grow, revenue pressure from spread compression is likely to
persist in the near-term. Quarterly expenses, however, should be somewhat lower than fourth quarter 2012 levels as we
go forward. As such, we expect to return to positive operating leverage in Transaction Services on a full year basis in
2013.
Slide 16 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues of negative $76 million were down from the prior year driven
by the absence of last year's hedging gains and lower investment yields. Expenses of $805 million were significantly
higher versus last year mainly due to higher legal and related expenses. Assets of $249 billion included approximately
$46 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $144 billion of liquid available for sale of securities.
Slide 17 shows Citi Holdings assets. We ended the quarter with assets of $156 billion in Citi Holdings or roughly 8% of
total Citi Group assets. The $15 billion reduction in the fourth quarter reflected $4 billion of asset sales, $10 billion of
net pay downs and roughly $1 billion of cost of credits.
On Slide 18, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1 billion were down 2%
year-over-year as declines in local consumer lending were largely offset by higher revenues in the special asset pool
reflecting an improvement in asset marks. Citi Holdings expenses were down 15% year-over-year to $1.5 billion,
mostly due to the reduction in assets, and on a sequential basis, the increase mostly reflects the $305 million charge
related to the foreclosure review side.
Credit cost increased 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. Total net credit losses of $972 million were down 36%
year-over-year. However, we recorded a net loan loss reserve build in the fourth quarter and a significantly lower net
reserve release was more than offset by the impact of losses on loans side. This compares to a net reserve release of
$663 million last year.
Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings result on Slide 19; rep and warranty reserve builds, legal and related
costs and repositioning charges continue to weigh on Citi Holdings in the fourth quarter.
On an operating basis however excluding these items we maintained a modest positive operating margin again in the
fourth quarter and our goal is to continue to generate positive margins although there may be quarter-to-quarter
fluctuations arising from periodic gains or losses as we continue to wind down the assets.

Credit trends remained favorable this quarter with North America mortgages comprising 75% of total net credit losses.
We ended the quarter with $8.4 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgage loans and Citi
Holdings for 33 months of loss coverage. On Slide 20 we show mortgage loan and adjusted net credit loss trends over
the past few years.
Since the fourth quarter of 2010 we have reduced the North America mortgage loan in Citi Holdings by 27% driven by
$19 billion of pay downs, $6 billion of asset sales and $9 billion of net loss.
In the recent fourth quarter we sold nearly $600 million of delinquent loans. We have also significantly reduced the
quarterly net credit losses on the portfolio, down 40% since the fourth quarter of 2010 to $762 million even while
roughly $60 million of losses were accelerated into the recent quarter as a result of the continued actions we are taking
to fulfill our commitments under the national mortgage settlement or NMS.
We currently expect NMS to continue to have an impact on net credit losses through the second quarter of 2013.
Delinquency trends improved as well through the fourth quarter in both residential first mortgages and home equity
loans. Assuming a continuation in the current economic environment here in the U.S., the net credit losses on these
portfolios should generally decline over time as a portfolio continues to shrink.
On Slide 21, we show our net interest margin and revenue trends. Our net interest margin expanded in the fourth
quarter by 7 basis points to 2.93% with about half of the improvement driven by our trading book and remainder
reflecting lower funding costs, partially offset by lower loan yields. Net interest revenue also increased from last
quarter, and growth in Citicorp net interest revenue offset the ongoing wind-down of Citi Holdings.
On a full year basis, our net interest margin remained relatively stable versus last year at 288 basis points, and we
currently believe we can maintain our net interest margin at roughly this level for 2013 with some quarterly
fluctuations.
Turning to total Citigroup expenses on Slide 22, while reported operating expense up $13.8 billion in the fourth quarter
were 5% higher than last year, core operating expenses excluding legal and related costs and repositioning charges
declined 3% in constant dollars to $11.5 billion. We currently believe $11.5 billion is an indicative base for quarterly
operating expenses going into 2013. From this level, City Holdings expenses should decline over time with the ongoing
reduction in assets.
We will continue to pursue ongoing reengineering opportunities, and we continue to expect to achieve $900 million of
expense savings in 2013 related to our announced repositioning actions, with full-year expense savings of $1.2 billion
beginning in 2014. These total expense savings will likely be offset in part by volume related cost, particularly as we
seek to grow client volumes in the low interest rate environment. Overall, however, we expect core operating expenses
in 2013 to be lower than full year 2012. Of course, legal and related costs will likely continue to be elevated and
somewhat volatile, although we would not expect our fourth quarter levels to be the new norm.
On Slide 23, we show our key capital metrics through the fourth quarter. Under Basel III our estimated tier-1 common
ratio increased to 8.7% versus 8.6% in the third quarter. And our Basel I teir-1 common ratio remains flat at 12.7%.
Adjusting for the final market risk rules that became effective this month, our Basel I teir-1 common ratio would have
been approximately 11.2%.
In summary, our results in the fourth quarter reflected the challenging operating environment as we face elevated legal
and related cost and continue spread progression, particularly in the U.S. and Asia. In consumer banking we continue to
see strong loan growth in Latin America and in Asia we began to move past some of the regulatory headwinds which
slowed volumes in the second half of the year. Importantly, the credit trends in our global consumer portfolio remains
favorable with net credit losses and delinquencies at historically low levels.
In Securities and Banking, we demonstrated our ability to grow revenues, while maintaining expense discipline and our
Investment Banking franchise showing good progress.

Finally, in Transaction Services, we faced the continued low interest rate environment in many global markets, but we
showed positive operating leverage for the year and higher volumes offset spread compression. We continue to reduce
Citi Holdings which represented only 8% of total assets at year end. We also ended the year with demonstrated strength
in both capital and liquidity. As we go into 2013, we are keenly aware of the challenging rate environment, but remain
positive in our ability to grow volumes to offset this headwind given our unique global footprint. We are also highly
focused on efficiency and optimizing our core businesses in order to drive improved returns.
With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.

Operator, can we get the first question please?
Questions And Answers
Operator
Yes. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
Glenn Schorr, Analyst
Hi, thanks very much. I guess, John, you gave some good detail on some of the improving credit trends in holdings on
the mortgage portfolio. I guess, the blunt question and I know we've asked it in the past is what more do you need to
see to start freeing up the reserves. There is 8.4 billion you have 33 months now. It's a big difference because it goes
hand in hand with the question of how do we get that P&L impact of holdings lower. So, just curious on your thoughts
there?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Glenn, your observations are absolutely right as far as. And the main point there is alpha as far as being able to begin
charging those NCLs against the reserves is one way of driving Holdings towards breakeven. But as we've said last
quarter, we want to make sure that those trends and we do see some strong positive trends in the housing market. We
want to make sure that they are sustainable. And at the end of last quarter, we pointed out to -- we wanted to see the
U.S. get pass the whole fiscal cliff issues.
Well, unfortunately at the end of the year, the resolution of the fiscal cliff was basically kicking the can down the road.
So, I think what we would like to see now is how the U.S. deals with the ongoing debt ceiling debate, and the
upcoming sequester on expense reductions. We get through that and see how the economy performs. We see whether or
not those trends that we see now are sustainable and then we have got decisions to make.
Glenn Schorr, Analyst
Crystal ball, let's say 2013 event though?

Glenn Schorr, Analyst
They're going to put another ban date on it. Okay.
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. We'll take a look.
Glenn Schorr, Analyst
Okay. The $10 billion in pay downs this quarter that you mentioned. Is that a -- are there specifics to the portfolio that
would make fourth quarter more or less or is $10 billion a quarter fair enough to think about?
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Glenn, I just want to make sure that we're focused on the same items. When we were talking about the net pay
downs and that's not overall in the mortgage portfolio. I don't think --
Glenn Schorr, Analyst
I'm with you but -- correct, but it's inside Holdings' assets, correct?
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, okay, that's fine. That's fine. Look, we've guided you for some time now that the pace of reduction in Holdings is
going to slow and it would necessarily be smooth quarter-after-quarter. So, I wouldn't look at that $10 billion of net pay
down necessarily as being indicative, but we don't anticipate that it should drop-off dramatically in the next quarter or
two.
Glenn Schorr, Analyst
Got it. Back in Slide 26 in the appendix, you gave us the Basel I to Basel III work through, and I guess, there's a 24%
increase when you go from one to the other and that's been kind of consistent. What we've seen at some of the
competitors is as portfolios have reduced and as credit has continued to get better, some changes to the models, and
therefore Basel III assets go down, therefore your Basel III cap ratio goes up. Curious on what would be different on
Citi's portfolio that we wouldn't see something similar?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
So, if the overall -- assuming that we continue to reduce the risk in the portfolio and there's an improving environment
that is the way the model should work.
Glenn Schorr, Analyst
So, bottom line is that at year-end, you didn't make big changes to the models for what you've seen on credit and so
therefore no big reduction of Basel III, but?

John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
No, no, no. The reduction that you see in Basel III primarily reflect again movements in the actual books itself.
Glenn Schorr, Analyst
Yeah. I appreciate that. One last quickie is, you mentioned on the $1.3 billion of legal cost this quarter related to some
consumer management. I'm not much sure if you -- I mean, I can take a guess, but it wouldn't mind just a little bit more
color there this way we can make our own decisions on whether or not we think that's the appropriate run rate or fourth
quarter was unusually high?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. One shot from me, Glenn. We don't go into detail on specific reserving actions unless it's in connection, with a
settlement that we are announcing. But look, many different aspects of U.S. consumer related products and offerings
are the focus of reviews across the industry. Including by several of our regulators. I don't think it is any secret that the
CFPB has been reviewing various consumer products and in fact they are currently reviewing us. But I'm not going to
say anything more about individual regulator discussions.
Glenn Schorr, Analyst
Okay. Thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
John McDonald, Analyst
Hi, John. A couple of clarifying questions about your outlook comments. So you indicated that you hope to keep the
net interest margin stable. Would that imply that you expect to have some expansion of net interest income dollar given
that the balance sheet is growing?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. The answer to that is, it somewhat depends and I'm going to have to fudge it little bit only because of the impact
of the trading book and how that impacts net debt interest. So when you look at our core banking operation, we should
have some improvement in net interest revenue. The difficult thing to project always though is the exact movements of
interest revenue and therefore, NIM on the trading book.

In this quarter, for instance, I mentioned a roughly half 4 basis points of the 7 basis point improvement came about as a
result of the trading portfolio.
John McDonald, Analyst
Okay. That's fair enough. And then on the expense outlook, you said core operating expenses should be turning at 11.5
billion per quarter, right?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
I said but that's a good base on which to start to think about it.
John McDonald, Analyst
Okay. And for the year, you expect that core operating expense to be lower in 2013 versus '12, what's the amount in '12
you're looking at when you say it will be below that?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Take a look at the full year reported operating expenses for Citigroup.
John McDonald, Analyst
Okay. Do you have the number that you're looking at?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
I think there is a slide in appendix --
John McDonald, Analyst
46, 47.
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
About 29, so it's 46.3.
John McDonald, Analyst
Okay, okay. So, you expect the core operating expense to coming below that in '13 that's what you are shooting for and
that's before the $900 million of repositioning saves, just how does that -- how do you think?

Page 12 of 34
No. I rolled it altogether. I'm trying to stay away from giving you a specific number. But think in terms of the 11.5, as I
said as being an indicative base for moving forward. Of that 11.5 base, we are going to deliver the 900 million of
expense saves coming off the repositioning. We're going to drive down expenses in Citi Holdings. We're going to have
to spend some amount of money off of those two reductions in order to fuel volume growth that we'll see in the
business, but we're also anticipating continuing or reengineering program and therefore, driving out more expenses on
top of the 900 million.
John McDonald, Analyst
Okay. And then, finally, we heard you say legal and related costs a lot today as you went through your remarks and just
a little bit of color on what's included in that type of category, because there was a lot of expense increase in this
quarter attributed to legal and related, and what are your thoughts as we go to it. It's obviously tough to predict this
stuff, do you expect to make some improvement on that front in '13?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
As I said we don't think legal unrelated, what does this include, let me get to one of your specific question. It certainly
includes the results of announced settlements. I mean we call that out for you just as we did with the $305 million
settlement that we reached in connection with the foreclosure review itself, right. It would include other reserves that
we take in relation to ongoing legal and regulatory matters, for which we don't comment because they are just things
that we are not going to comment on publicly until they become a fact.
So, given that those are the types of items that you look at and given the environment that we are in, that's why we
would expect legal and related expenses to remain somewhat elevated as we move forward. Legal and related to this
year ran about $2 billion plus, closer to 3, $2.9 billion. It's a $600 million or $700 million increase of where we were
last year. I think you are going to be looking at those types of levels going at least in the near-term.
John McDonald, Analyst
Okay. And one final specific question. Can you talk how much you had in expenses related to mortgage loot bags and
that might be ending with the independent foreclosure review settlement?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. The -- one of the good things coming out of that settlement is that we can stop incurring those expenses, those
expenses were running us just south of $200 million a year.
John McDonald, Analyst
Okay. And were they disproportionately in holdings?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
They were all in holdings.

Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
James Mitchell, Analyst
Hey. Good morning, John. Can I ask about the LCR you guys have disclosed in the past that you even under the more
stringent criteria you were ahead -- I think in the third quarter 116% LCR. With the new changes have you had a
chance to look at that and what way you might be and does that give you an opportunity to free up some cash?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. It is a very timely question. Actually, during the quarter we actually did reduce the amount of excess cash that
we were carrying towards the end of the quarter.
James Mitchell, Analyst
Yeah. That was my next question. Thanks.
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
So, whereas we were running levels a little bit north of 400 million, we are currently at about $350 billion level on the
excess cash. But even at that reduced level under the new rules, we are running an LCR ratio something to the tune of
its either 116% or 118%. So, we still think that we are certainly in compliance with the new rules as fully rolled out as
we understand.
James Mitchell, Analyst
Okay. Fair enough. And so, when we look at your balance sheet down on a period end basis down 70 billion, is that a
function of the fact that you used a lot of that cash to pay down debt. I mean, obviously you did have some decline in
Citi Holdings as well, but was a good chunk of that used to pay down debt?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, a fair chunk of that went to pay down debt. We also had, as we said, some deposit run-off, largely the run-off of
those episodic deposits that we talked about coming into us at the end of the third quarter. And then we also made some
additional investments in available for sale securities.

Right.
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
So, I'd say, roughly on the 60 billion, it's probably 50% going towards the long-term debt, 25% due to the deposit
rundown, and 25% or thereabouts on the growth in AFS securities.
James Mitchell, Analyst
Okay. Fair enough. And then, maybe the last one, I guess, I'll take a shot at capital return. Obviously, there has been a
lot of chatter. You can't really say exactly, but can maybe discuss maybe just broader view of how you think about the
CCAR?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I'm going to turn that one over to Mike.
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Jim.
James Mitchell, Analyst
Hi.
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
The way we approach CCAR was probably not surprising to most. It's really job one or mission one really to put a
submission in that where we could get approval. And so we were obviously focused on doing that. I think second thing
we were focused on is in 2013 giving ourselves the goals of getting to and breaking a 9.5% Basel III Tier 1 common
ratio. And so, I think those two things were the guiding principles of our submission, and I'll leave it at that.

Page 15 of 34
Thanks for taking the question. It sounds like you're not ready to comment on future cost saves, although there was a
comment earlier that some additional efficiencies should be coming. So, I do want to just prod a little bit there, like as
we think about the 1 billion or so savings that you disclosed last month, is that kind of down payment on something
that's going to be pretty big, or is this a pretty big chunk of what the overall pie might be?
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
Matt, I think that what you described as the down payment was, as I described, the results of our budget process. And I
think as we went through the budget, we came to some conclusions that we had expenses, people, businesses in places
that we didn't think we were going to be able to earn the requisite returns on those businesses over the intermediate
period, and chose and made decisions to exit, down size, rescale those activities.
I think as an institution, and you heard me mention it, that from an operating efficiency perspective, our businesses and
geographies need to be focused really BAU on the way they think about and run their businesses. And so, we're trying
to drive, as we come out of this budget process, a mentality that rather than having one-off events or annual events
around repositioning charges people need to have specific metrics by which they are going to be held accountable for
delivering against their businesses, and that they need to make real-time decisions in terms of how they choose to make
that happen.
Matthew O'Connor, Analyst
And in terms of the timing of some of the metrics that you'll provide us, and I guess just kind of the overall strategic
review, and I can appreciate you're a couple or few months into this, what's the timing of that in terms of when you'll
communicate to investors and the Street?
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
We are working through it, and I think over the next coming months we're going to come out with that.
Matthew O'Connor, Analyst
Okay. And I realize it's still being formed, but like as we think about which metrics are important to you, I'm not going
to pin you to the level, but in terms of whether it's the ROA, the ROE, the efficiency or all of them, are there a couple
of key ratios that you think about?
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I mentioned -- in my opening remarks I mentioned a few that I think are critical and my guess is, as we refine
this, we will speak to in no particular order. I've mentioned operating efficiency. I think ROA is one of those things. I
think that return on tangible common equity is a ratio that we should probably be out speaking and measuring ourselves
to.
Matthew O'Connor, Analyst
Okay. And then just lastly, if I can, maybe a question for John. If we look at some of the capital markets revenues, and
I guess specifically FICC, I think last quarter you had a very good quarter. Maybe the first three quarters you gained a
lot of share, and it seems like at least so far who we've seen report this quarter, you might have given back a little bit
this quarter. Is it just something different in your mix? Is it because it's more global or just a product set that maybe

explains some of the relative weakness in 4Q?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, I'm going to defend the FICC. I wouldn't call it weakness in the fourth quarter at all. I actually think we
had a very good fourth quarter in our FICC business, and I think that for the full year, you have got FICC revenues up
28%, that's good performance. I think that that ongoing performance reflects a lot of the repositioning that we did in the
business in 2011. So, relatively speaking, we probably had a more of an outperform in the third quarter, and therefore,
it makes the fourth quarter, when you are doing quarterly sequential comparisons, look a little small therefore. But I
think that if you judge the year in its entirety, that's really the way to look at the business, and I think the business had
an excellent 2012.

And your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
Brennan Hawken, Analyst
Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to follow-up first on something Glenn hit on, the reserves in
Holdings, and just want to make really clear. There is nothing that you are seeing there in the data? I mean, given your
comments, John, I wouldn't assume so, but just want to make sure here that would be preventing you from really seeing
any reserves there?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
I think we've been pretty clear that we feel pretty good about the underlying credit data in that mortgage book.
Delinquencies continue to improve. The NCL as you can see continued to go down. We put up some data for you at the
Financial Services Conference I spoke about at in December. That point to some of the improvements that we see in the
portfolio related to the dollars and the percentage of the portfolio. FICO score is over 660, and the amount of loan that
had either FICO scores less than 580 or LTV over 100%, and all of those trends are showing favorable movement. So
the book looks pretty good.
Brennan Hawken, Analyst
Yeah. Agreed. It seems -- and then you combine that with the home price improvements that we've seen now over the
last three quarters. It just seems really odd that we wouldn't get some reserve release. I mean, dysfunction in
Washington is something that we are probably going to be able to count on until we normally would have been able to
collect social security, God knows whether that will happen. So, it's just -- I guess, I'm just trying to figure out, what's
really preventing the release there, especially given the DTA?

If we end up with a sustainable stalemate that then produces sustainable trends maybe that will give us the basis then to
make some other decisions.
Brennan Hawken, Analyst
Okay. And then could you quantify the impact that the loan sale had on the holding reserve build this quarter? It sounds
like there was a little bit of noise there.
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. There was little over $100 million worth of losses that we took -- net losses that we took on loan sales in the
quarter, and that flows into that LLR line.
Brennan Hawken, Analyst
Got it. Okay. And then also on reserve in Asia, we switched to a build there. Are we seeing sort of a cyclical, any
reason to believe that that's now sort of a cyclical shift where there will be some build for a while, or is that more
one-time in nature?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
I don't think it's one-time, but I think if you look at Asia over the last three or four quarters, we are sort of bouncing
around a level of reserves. I think we had a reserve build in Asia, I can't remember it was the first quarter or the second
quarter, then we had some small releases. Now we've got a small build. So I'd just look at it as fine tuning the reserve
levels.
Brennan Hawken, Analyst
Okay. Then just a couple quick ones on cap markets. You guys don't provide comp ratios in securities and banking, but
when you look at the expense ratio delta, it sort of didn't show the improvement there that some of the peers,
particularly those reporting yesterday, showed. Could you give some color on what's going on there? Is there any
reason why those would diverge, or is there any noise that might imply that the actual trends didn't diverge as much as
the reported numbers would imply?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
I think, when you take a look at the business, you have to take a look at the full-year results in order to really get a true
measure of performance. And I don't have the full-year securities and banking numbers in front of me, ex-CVA and
everything else, but I believe that we did show improvement in the efficiency ratio in securities and banking during the
course of the year. And I think even now, if you just take a look at securities and banking, our efficiency ratio compares
pretty well with the efficiency ratios of some of our peers. Having said that, and as Mike indicated in his opening
remarks, we are still not satisfied with where we are and we intend to drive for improvements in efficiency ratios in all
of our businesses.

Betsy Graseck, Analyst
Hi. Good morning.
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Hi.
Betsy Graseck, Analyst
Couple of questions. One, at a recent conference, I think, you mentioned mid-term goal on ROTCE of about 10%, and I
was wondering if you can give us some color or clarity behind timing on that, and how much the announced changes
that you've made get you to that goal?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I think that we would wrap up the timing on -- more specific timing on that in Mike's opening comments, where
over the next coming months, we will get you more specifics on that goal, as well as improvements in ROA and
operating efficiencies.
Betsy Graseck, Analyst
Okay. And then on the comments around investing to get the revenue share that you are looking for. How do you think
through the timing? Just as you go throughout the year in 2013 you generate the expense saves, the $900 million that
you discussed, and then you are investing that along the way, or are you needing to see some revenue improvement first
to have a self -- business unit self-invest?

I think, it's -- when we talk about operating efficiency, Betsy, it's the want to have the balance between strong focus on
expenses, but understanding that you can't cut yourself to where you need to be and that we have businesses we need to
make investments in, but understanding that expenses are the things that you can control. So, we're going to be looking
across the Company in terms of where and how we make those investments and we're going to have a set of parameters
and understanding around those investments as they come for people to make them, but we need to be in a position to
be able to make those on a regular basis and drive that in a BAU way.

Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.
Erika Penala, Analyst
Good morning.
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Hi.
Erika Penala, Analyst
Hi. My first question is actually a follow-up to Matt and Betsy's questions. Mike, specifically regarding GCB in Asia
and LatAm, we appreciated John's comments with regard to revenue growth potentially starting the conversion to
earnings growth in Asia, and now we have a public comparable in terms of looking at credit growth trends in Mexico
now that Santander is public. I guess, I'm wondering have you got a chance to evaluate whether or not the infrastructure
in those two regions are right sized to potentially the reap the revenue acceleration, or is it still sort of unwieldy relative
to the secular changes of retail banking generally? And tell me if you need clarity on the last part of the question.
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
Sure. If I think if I understand your question right, I think, Erika, it's important to understand the way we think about in
the way we have asked Manuel to drive our consumer business, and that is that we operate the consumer business in
roughly 40 countries around the world. We recognize that aside from a few individual countries, our scale is not going
to come from any one particular country, that our scale has got to be driven on a global basis.
So, as we think about our lending platforms, our card platforms, our -- the mundane things of account openings, we've
got to make sure that the systems and the way we approach things allows us to recognize that scale on a global basis.
So, I don't think of our consumer business as being constrained in the intermediate term in terms of any individual
geographies, but it's making sure that we have this drive to comment on our platform so that that can occur. I'm not sure
if that answers your question.

I guess just to be clear, there are not any additional investments that you would have to make in specific countries in
those regions? I know you are focusing on China, but in Mexico, for example, to reap sort of the credit growth and the
revenue growth if the Mexican economy is picking up as much as folks down there are saying, there's no additional
reinvestment coming.
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. We've been making investments. We started making reasonable investments into Asia last year and around the
world, Asia, Mexico and other places, we have continued to invest, and I expect we'll continue to invest in some of
those higher growth areas into the future.
Erika Penala, Analyst
Okay. And just a quick one, that's not on Holdings' reserves, if I look at the provision levels in GCB North America, it
was up quarter-over-quarter, but flattish year-over-year. I mean, is the bump up just simply seasonal, as the volume
spend is higher in the fourth quarter and could potentially come down on a dollar level in the first quarter?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
You're talking about the overall provision, or just the NCL rate? I just want to make sure I'm --
Erika Penala, Analyst
The overall provision in GCB North America?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
When you get into the overall provision, then you get a little bit into loan loss reserve releases. So I think -- let's talk a
little bit about credit losses separate from loan loss reserve releases, because I think we've given you the guidance on
the loan loss reserve releases that specifically in cards going forward we would expect the loan loss reserve releases to
be roughly at the level where we are in the fourth quarter, at least into 2013.
When you take a look at the NCL rates though, the net credit losses have been improving, the net credit loss rate has
been improving in both our branded and our retail services portfolios throughout the year. We've now got -- I don't
have the numbers right in front of me, but we've got a 3.92% or something like that NCL rate in branded cards, that's
pretty low.
I would anticipate that you'll see some increase in that rate during 2013, just because it's at a historically low level. I
think even in 2013 you are looking at a level that's going to be in the low 4s. So we are not looking for some change in
the underlying credit dynamics of either of our card portfolios.
Erika Penala, Analyst
Okay. That was helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Not a problem.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mayo with CLSA.
Michael Mayo, Analyst
Hi. Can you hear me?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Sure.
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Mike.
Michael Mayo, Analyst
Okay. John, if you could just clarify, what was return on tangible equity for Citigroup? However, you look at it
excluding all the noise, what was ROTE for last year or for the fourth quarter, or both?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
I don't have that number in front of me, Mike, I'm sorry. It's somewhere in the 5% range, I believe, for the full firm for
the full year.
Michael Mayo, Analyst
Okay.
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Just don't have it specific.
Michael Mayo, Analyst
That's fine. Assume it's 5% for the whole firm, what would it be just for Citicorp?

Okay. And John, just in very simple terms, maybe it's a summary comment, your reserve release declined from around
$900 million down to $100 million, or $0.19 down to $0.02. Why was the reserve release so much less?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
It's unfortunately, Mike, it's not going to be a very simple comment. But I guess if I was going to break it down, it
would be that there were some episodic releases in the third quarter, which did not repeat. Don't forget, in the third
quarter, we called out that we had a $600 million reserve release in that third quarter specifically related to increased
net credit losses that we were and rest of the industry was forced to incur by some new guidance issued by the OCC.
The loan loss reserve release associated with cards has been tracking down as we talked about. I think if you take a
look at the cards book, we released about $800 million of reserves in the second quarter about 550 million in the third
quarter. And now, we are down in that $200 million to $300 million range in the fourth quarter and that's what we think
we're going to be going forward.
So, we sort of reached where we're going to be in cards and rest of it is just a lot of individual noise around the
portfolio. Take a look at international consumer. Our international consumer, we had a $100 million net reserve build
in that business in the quarter. That's due to the growth in those portfolios.
So, unfortunately there isn't a one sentence answer that I can give you on that, it's just a collection of how we take a
look at, it's a collective view and an individual view of each portfolio.
Michael Mayo, Analyst
Okay. And then for Mike, I asked this question when you first got the CEO job. It's been five years now, you either
look back, at your performance, what would you want to see to show that you were successful?
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
Probably going back to your first line of questioning, we've got to get to a point where we stop destroying our
shareholders' capital. We say that would certainly be at the top of the list, that we run smart and efficient business that's
good at it, it's allocation of its resources around its customer and client segments that it continue to have the ability to
lead and accompany those clients around the world. That it served the social purpose. There is several things in there.
Michael Mayo, Analyst
And then for us the investor, I guess that in turn would lead to higher stock price, is that I guess a secondary focus, if
you do everything else right.
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
I wouldn't call it a secondary focus. We understand why we come to work and it's a primary focus.
Michael Mayo, Analyst
The reason I ask, I mean as a new CEO, you have so many options of what you could do with the stock price. You
could have the whole all the Directors take a lot of stock and you had some CEOs take their personal net worth and buy
extra stock and as investors think that's a huge focus, I guess, whenever you are done your review perhaps we'd hear
more about what you might do along those lines. Is that a safe assumption or?

Michael Mayo, Analyst
Okay. And would you ever consider having a target of where you want the stock price to be. In other words, if you are
looking for higher returns on equity and you get the business mix that you ultimately want and the efficiency and
capital allocation. Would you have target in mind or is that just left up to the stock market to kind of let valuation fall
wherever it will?
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
I think we need to look at all the metrics that are out there. You talk to what are the challenges of that particular metric
in terms of how the market is approaching certain things, but it is obviously something we need to keep in mind.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.
Gerard Cassidy, Analyst
Thank you and good afternoon.
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Gerard.
Gerard Cassidy, Analyst
Can you share with us on the sale of the assets out of Citi Holdings, the pricing trends that you are seeing compared to
the delinquent mortgage sales, for example, that you've sold in the past I think through the third quarter it was over $14
billion. Are you seeing better pricing now that the markets have improved a bit?

Page 24 of 34
Pricing did improve slightly in the fourth quarter, I'll tell you that. I won't say that it went up by leaps and bounds, but it
definitely improved over the level. Certainly that we saw at the beginning of the third quarter, I'd say the pricing on
some of those asset sales improved towards the end of the third and then held up in the fourth is the way that I would
characterize it.
Gerard Cassidy, Analyst
Okay. And did you finance any of the sales of the assets in the quarter?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
No.
Gerard Cassidy, Analyst
Would that be a consideration of yours on a go forward basis to help accelerate the disposition of some of those assets?
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
Actually, we've done that in the past. If you look at some of the deals that we have announced, we've actually taken on
those financings in certain amounts in order to make sure that the deals would go. So, that is not something that we
would shy away from. Again it's a matter of being the right deal at the right price. I think in terms of what we always
say economically rational.
Gerard Cassidy, Analyst
Sure. Shifting away for a moment to the net interest margin. Your interest bearing liability costs in the quarter when we
look at it with and without the FDIC insurance is higher than some of your competitors. Is there an opportunity to bring
those costs down or is it just because of your global footprint you just need to pay higher costs in markets outside the
U.S.?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
I think that especially on the international deposits, I still think that we've got some opportunity. We probably have
some more opportunity on the international deposits to bring some pricing down that we do on the domestic deposits.
So, I wouldn't say that we completely -- as long as we stay in low interest rate environment in those countries, I do
think that we've still got some opportunities.
We continue to reposition those books away from time deposits. So, even when you take a look at what goes on in Asia
in particular or specifically even what we would consider to be normal checking accounts here in the states which don't
bear interest. A lot of the checking accounts in foreign countries do bear interest. So, as you start to grow those
checking balances, you're going to -- even though they are operating accounts, you're going to see an increase in your
interest bearing.
The trick is to make sure that you're growing the real operating accounts and shifting the mix away from time deposits
which have much higher rates than just a base checking account. So, even within, it's nothing that gets reported as
interest bearing deposit. There's a mix shift that you can still work on and we're certainly in the process of doing that.

Gerard Cassidy, Analyst
One last question one the balance sheet, what's the duration now of the securities portfolio?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
I'm sorry, Gerard, you just broke up just for a second. What was the --
Gerard Cassidy, Analyst
Duration of the securities portfolio in years?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
When we look at -- and I'll focus on the AFS portfolio that we sort of used for the excess liquidity. I think that we used
to say it was slightly under two years, now I would characterize it as being slightly over two years, but it's still roughly
in that two-year tenure.
Gerard Cassidy, Analyst
Okay. And then one final question for Mike. In looking over the next two to three, maybe even five years when you
look to increase shareholders wealth, is there -- would you consider ever spinning off or selling parts of some of your
assets such as your bank in Mexico for example, we all know how well Mexico is doing and it doesn't seem like
Citigroup is getting enough credit for its position down there. How do you try to capture that, those good assets that
might not be recognized today by the market?
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
I think when you look at the way come to work, we think our strength comes from our global network, in the
interconnectivity of our network and our ability as we've described to leading a company, our clients and customers
around the world and that's products, that's businesses and we think that the value lies in that, point one.
Point two is I'd say that, in many ways, our model is becoming more unique and has the ability to even become more
valued over time. So, if you look at where I just came from in Europe to deleveraging regulation in many cases are in
some cases we are forcing some firms to abandon global strategies in some cases to abandon regional strategies and I
think that the importance of a bank that can do the things we do for its global clients is only becoming more valuable
and we think that the future lies in that. So, we're committed to that and that's what we are going to invest in.

Marlin Mosby, Analyst
Good afternoon.
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Marlin.
Marlin Mosby, Analyst
Wanted to ask you a couple specific questions and then ask Mike a very broad strategic question. If you look at the 1.3
billion of expenses related to the litigation and foreclosure settlement, can you break that out between Citi Holdings
and what was in Citicorp?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
I think that's already broken out for you on one of the first slides that we've got in the presentation package I think if
you look at Slide 4.
Marlin Mosby, Analyst
Yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't see that there, I got that.
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Good.
Marlin Mosby, Analyst
And then, if you look at the loss improvement you saw in Citi Holdings we talked a lot about release of allowance.
When you are starting to look at the actual charges and the losses coming down, can you give us a little bit more color
about what's driving that and how sustainable this new low level of losses would be?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
You are talking about the low level of losses, Marty, I assume you are referring to the net credit losses that --
Marlin Mosby, Analyst
That's correct. Yeah. That's about a 46% drop that was out there this quarter?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. And as we said we try to give you little bit more color on that on the following slides, Slide 20 where we break
out the net credit losses on mortgages, which constitute certainly the vast majority of the NCLs in that business, I mean
mortgages basically constitute three quarters of the NCLs that we have in holdings. And I think you see a fairly clear

trend on that page now. We certainly, again, given the current environment and where we see things today, we would
anticipate some continued improvement in those trends.
Marlin Mosby, Analyst
And then lastly, the strategic question as we have structured the management team, it's kind of a traditional consumer
versus business type of structure. Have you foreseen driving the businesses that you can make sure that the focus in
those two units in cross-sell and the relationship building is continues to move forward and maybe kind of evolves a
culture of it is little bit more traditional banking in nature as you continue to build out a new direction?
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
If you look, Marty, what we announced, as we announced Co-Presidents of the Company, Jamie and Manuel each
running in essence global product and coverage organizations; Manuel on the consumer side, Jamie on the institutional
side. In those roles, they have got all of the products reporting into them. So, you can then go to the next level and look
what we did is part of the reconstructive operations and technology.
Obviously, operations and technology are critical parts of the operating businesses that were in. So, in 2008 and 2009,
we actually pulled operations back from being embedded in the businesses, I think to reset the functions around the
controls, we saw necessary going into the more challenge environment as well as to be mindful around caution bloat
that we thought had existed.
I think we are at a point today after making what I would characterize as good progress against those whereas we look
at business decisions that need to be made and where we want to make investment and how we are going to spend those
dollars, I think those become not just operations, technology, safety and soundest decisions, but they become more
broadly business decisions and I want Jamie and Manuel thinking about that.
So, in my earlier comment that Manuel has got to take our consumer business to scale around a drive towards common
in our consumer franchise and that Jamie has got to continue to ring the synergies of what I call adjacencies amongst
our businesses, our client sets out and to make sure that we can provide the things we need, we can develop the things
we need, but we can do M&A in an efficient way.
And so, I think a part of the organization attempts to dictate and drive that. From a geographical perspective, I had the
four large region heads reporting to me as well, and when you think about the balance in an organization, you want the
balance between your products and your geographies, and obviously the third piece around your clients and you are just
going to make better decisions.
When I can look at what's going on in the products, I can measure what's going in the geographies and I can see what
our clients and in particular, our global clients are doing around the world, we can just make better decisions about
where we want to be, how we want to be there and where we want to use our resources.
Marlin Mosby, Analyst
And would you see profitability kind of as we manage or monitor that being focused on those two big pieces primarily,
being in consumer and commercial or still kind of a measured approach across all of the different geographies,
products, all that. Or is, those two business units really with what you are breaking are going to drive the profitability
overall?

No. I think as a Company that comes to work in 100 countries around the world every day, we've got to have a balance
between geography and product. Our products are global, many of them are world-class, we've got to make sure that
that get celebrated and used in the right way. But we come to work -- and I'll go back to the example, I've used before
that when we think of EMEA where I came from, we operate in 55 countries and we come to work very differently in
most of those countries.
And so, if you're going to make sure you get the most out of your franchise you have got to be mindful of that and
make sure that you're driving the metrics and holding people accountability for the things that that you need to do. If
not, what you tend to see, is you tend to see styles drift or you tend to see the business start to veering into activities
that really aren't core to its overall mission and principles. And having spent, three or four years trying to clean that up,
I'm not anxious or willing to go back there.
Marlin Mosby, Analyst
And then, lastly and thanks for your time here. When you look at just the business lines and segments that are reported,
do you see any changes related to that in relation to the changes you made here in management? Bye.
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
I think right now we are focused on the metrics that really drive these businesses. I think over time as always we need
to make sure that our reporting structure matches our management structure and I think today it does show, I am
comfortable with it, but over time we will continue to reassess that.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
Vivek Juneja, Analyst
Hi, just on -- Mike on the lines of some of those questions that you have been getting. Are there significant
country--businesses that you think you consider exiting and as you think about savings, do you see them more U.S. or
non-U.S. following this down payment that you talk about?
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
You characterized it as a down payment, I didn't. I think that we went through an extensive exhaustive amount of work
around the work for the 2013 budget. Again, I think we made a number of decisions in terms of what it was, we felt we
needed to do and what were the right choices around those things. Again, I think as we go forward, I don't want to be in
a position or the Company to be in a position where we do these in one-offs.
It's got to be BAU. We've got to continually be assessing how and where and with whom and in what ways we're using
our resources and that's got to be driven and compared at the business level. I think that's got to be something that's
ongoing rather either being done on an occasional basis or in a step function basis.

Vivek Juneja, Analyst
When you talk about individual country, when you talk about having all these metrics that you are going to put, are you
going to vary them by country because obviously individual country dynamics vary a lot, your market position varies a
lot. So in some countries given on that--based on that you're not going to be able to have the same efficiency ratio as a
most efficient bank, so, are you going to be customizing it that way or are you going to drive more top of the house and
if so what level do you intend to share with us when you do?
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think that we need to and we've already started the work around the country strategies and again we come to
work as you describe in many places in very different ways and therefore the things that we want to hold people
accountable for and the things we want to measure need to vary and that's the direction that we're taking the Firm. I
think in terms of sharing those metrics at a granular basis, I don't-- being in 100 countries, I don't think that's something
that we would care to do or probably in some ways you would find worthwhile.
But certainly at the top of the house which will be a roll up rather than drive down we will be choosing those metrics
that we want to share with you.
Vivek Juneja, Analyst
But maybe like at a confidence level like you do right now, like Asia, Latin America that kind of?
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
Again we are working on metrics over the next couple of months will be out with some things.
Vivek Juneja, Analyst
John a couple of questions for you. When you look at your Basel III capital ratio, your assets seem to have come down
more than RWA. Did something change to cause the fact that the RWA didn't come down as much, especially given
that you have reduced assets in Citi Holdings which should actually have a higher risk weight associated with them?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
I accept the fact that not every asset in Citi Holdings is weighted the exact same. So, I'd say that for this quarter when
you take a look at the total amount of $15 billion that came down, some of it was in lower risk weighted assets or
favorably risk weighted assets than at the higher end. It's just simply that, it's just a matter of mix.
Vivek Juneja, Analyst
But then on top of that you came down $50 billion plus in Citicorp, so I'd have thought that at the very least you would
come down by --I guess what you are saying is what you are coming down is much lower risk weighted even in
Citicorp that's why your RWA is not coming down that much?

Think about the reductions that we made in cash, it booked $60 billion.
Vivek Juneja, Analyst
DTA, the disallowed amount, John, went up by $2 billion what did the total amount of DTA do?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Total amount of DTA in the quarter increased by about $2 billion--
Vivek Juneja, Analyst
56 million
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
I'm sorry, sir.
Vivek Juneja, Analyst
Is that about 56?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
About 55.3 I think these are numbers that will be in the K.
Vivek Juneja, Analyst
And lastly just a clarification on (Inaudible) I expect legal related charges to continue out of 6% rate going forward, is
that did I hear that correctly?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
I don't think that's what you heard at all, what I said was that the legal and related expenses are going to stay elevated
and somewhat volatile, but that we certainly didn't expect $1.3 billion of expense that we had in the fourth quarter to
represent a new norm.
Vivek Juneja, Analyst
Okay. Alright, thank you.
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Okay Vivek.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust.
Eric Wasserstrom, Analyst
Thanks very much. John just, this is just more of a structural question, but if I did my numbers correctly in each of the
major business lines within Citi Corp, generated between let's call it 1% and 9% in positive operating leverage
year-over-year. Do those figures sound about correct to you?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Yes, I don't have it in my head, but each one was positive.
Eric Wasserstrom, Analyst
So I guess my real question is this those numbers the only adjustment that I have made was to exclude CVA and DVA
but nothing else about what you might consider non-recurring or otherwise diminishing environmental expenses?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
So the only difference between the way that I would have explained it, and probably and the way I would think of it is I
would also adjust for the fourth quarter repositioning, which around a $1 billion or so in the fourth quarter of this year
compared to 400 million, but that's the only adjustment that were differing on we're not going to get that wide of a gap.
Eric Wasserstrom, Analyst
So, the heart of my question is this and so we sort of generally agree on that point. It would seem then that given what
you've articulated with respect to additional expense initiatives, and some of the benefits of the repositioning action and
some of the things that are being undertaken in Asia et cetera. Even in the context of a difficult rate environment, how
doesn't it then suggest that we're going to see continued operating leverage across these business lines over '13 and let's
call it static environment?
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
The answer of that is, I am not going to say in business-by-business, because spread compression is going to hit you
differently in different businesses, and I think we've seen that certainly in transaction services, if you're not able to
offset spread compression, but the volume you can have the impact of spread compression, it will take away revenues
without impacting your level of volume. And so therefore, you're really running the same stuff through your shops, so
your ability to take expense out is then just limited to your ability to generate reengineering savings, which may or may
not be enough to offset the impact of spread compression.
So, in general, you're thinking about at the right way, but it is somewhat dependent business-by-business it's also
dependent upon the magnitude of the spread compression that is impacting each businesses.

Great, and then just a follow-up on that. Outside of spread conversion which is obviously something that you probably.
What then would be in your mind the other big risk factors that would disrupt the realization of positive operating
leverage across the various businesses.
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Well, general economics if we are not, if our customers aren't growing their businesses, if our customers are not have a
change in sentiment as far as how they view the general economy and cut back on either savings or borrowing or any of
that, that can certainly is a risk factor.
Eric Wasserstrom, Analyst
So, it sounds like outside of deterioration in about our macro environment what you are suggesting is the spread issue
remains a serious one to look at, but other than that, we should probably be thinking about continued low single-digit
operating leverage expansion.
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Although I probably will be directing you to make sure that you do a thorough reading of every risk factor that we
publish in the 400 page 10-K that will be delivering to you at some point in time in the next 45 days or so.
Eric Wasserstrom, Analyst
Well, I will look forward to that.
John C. Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer
Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.
Andrew Marquardt, Analyst
Just following on one of the questions I guess on expenses, can you talk about the areas that you are most focused on
investing in. You talked about obviously the cost sales and there is more to come. It sounds like after this first cut, but
the investment spend that you need to focus on to drive the volume and the revenue. Can you talk a little bit about
where you are most focused?

Sure, we are focused in few areas, one is in the operations and technology area in terms of continuing to combine
streamline, develop and roll out common systems around our global network, I think that would be one significant
areas where we've made investment. We're going to need to continue to make investment. We're always investing in
our people, in terms of wanting to continue to retain and attract talent and in particular in our institutional parts of our
business. We will be continuing to invest in the build out of our commodities businesses around the world.
We'll continue to be investing in digital and digitization around our consumer banking. Those are probably a few of the
more significant investments.
Andrew Marquardt, Analyst
Then regionally, if we were just to focus on the global consumer bank, it sounds like you're turning the corner in terms
of revenue in Asia and remains very strong, how should we think about revenue in North America?
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
I think from a North American in particular I would say U.S. consumer perspective. I think the environment, while,
John, spoke to some of the positive attributes. I think that needs to be balance for some of the realities of the low
interest rate environment. I think that as others have forecasted, and I think that we see is a slowing in terms of the
mortgage refinance boom and the economics that have been associated with that. I think those are two reasonable
headwinds that we're going to have to overcome in 2013 in North America consumer.
Andrew Marquardt, Analyst
Outside of mortgage in the cards business, should we think about that actually growing this year or still muted?
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
I think we've done a lot of work. We've made progress and we've stabilized the portfolio. We've got to get growth back
into it and that's going to be a focus.
Andrew Marquardt, Analyst
Okay thanks. Then just lastly as you are going through your ongoing kind of business reviews and work on operational
efficiencies, have you had a chance to get a sense of longer term the all-in kind of earnings power of the franchise, will
you also be updating us on your views on that longer term. I guess historically you guys have talked about it kind of in
ROA 125, 150 is that still applicable or should we wait for an update?
Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer
I think addressing those questions in reverse order I think that you know the ROA 125 to 150 in this environment is not
a practical goal to set out there in the short term. So we'll be resetting that I think we'll be coming out over the next
coming months as I said with some things that were going to be measured against and we'll try and lay that out and
show you best we can in the past for the company going forward.
