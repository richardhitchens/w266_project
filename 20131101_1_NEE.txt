With that, I will turn the call over to Moray.
Moray P. Dewhurst
Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results and continued to
make good progress on the initiatives laid out at our March Investor Conference. Our earnings growth in the quarter
was driven primarily by continued investments at FPL, and the addition of new contracts at renewables projects at
Energy Resources.
With three quarters of good performance behind us, we are well positioned to close out the year above the midpoint of
the range of adjusted EPS expectations that we shared with you in January, subject to our usual caveats.
At the same time, we've continued to execute on our existing backlog of development and construction projects. And
we have made further progress in firming up some of our incremental investment opportunities.
At FPL, net income growth was driven by investment in projects that are designed to further improve an already-strong
customer value proposition. We remain very focused on execution and all of our major capital projects are on track,
with the Riviera Beach and Port Everglades organizations, both running on time and on budget.
We have filed for the necessary regulatory approvals for the new gas pipeline and the peaker upgrade project. And we
have made good progress in defining a path towards our goal of keeping nonfuel O&M roughly flat in nominal terms
through the period at the current rate agreement.
At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings growth was driven primarily by new investment in our contracted renewables
projects. In the third quarter, we brought into service roughly 125 megawatts of wind in Canada that is contracted under
the Ontario Feed-in-Tariff program. We continue to execute on our backlog of approximately 800 megawatts of
contracted U.S. solar projects, of which about 300 megawatts are expected to come into service in 2013, with the
balance expected to come into service by the end of 2016.
We've also been successful in adding to our pipeline of contracted renewables development opportunities, and I will
provide some additional details later in the call.
During the quarter, we moved forward with our companywide initiative to improve productivity, which we referred to
as Project Momentum. After careful evaluation, we have identified, and are moving ahead with a number of ideas that
we expect to yield in total somewhere between $200 million and $250 million in annual cost savings. The transition
costs associated with this initiative negatively impacted adjusted earnings in the third quarter by $0.05, and we expect
the full year impact to be roughly $0.09 or $0.10. We will provide more detail on the impact to both FPL and energy
resources when we walk through their quarterly results.
With the progress we've made year-to-date, we continue to see a long-term adjusted earnings per share compounded
annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2016 off our 2012 base. Our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we
provide, including normal weather and operating conditions.
Let me now walk through our results for the third quarter of 2013. I'll begin with the results at FPL before moving on to
Energy Resources, and then the consolidated numbers. For the third quarter of 2013, FPL reported net income of $422
million or $0.99 per share, up $0.06 per share year-over-year. As you evaluate the numbers, you may wish to keep in
mind that they include the transition costs associated with Project Momentum that I spoke about a moment ago. This
includes a negative impact of roughly $0.04 in the quarter and we expect the full year impact to be approximately $0.07
or $0.08.
The principal driver of FPL's earnings growth in the quarter was continued investment in the business. We invested
roughly $700 million in the quarter and expect our full year capital investments to be in the order of $3 billion.
Regulatory capital employed growth of 9.3% over the same quarter last year was the main driver of net income growth.

Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11.07%, this includes the impact of the Project Momentum transition
costs, absent these costs the regulatory ROE would have been 11.25%. Under the current rate agreement, we record
reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each period, in this case, the 11.25% that I
just mentioned, excluding special charges such as the Project Momentum transition costs. During the quarter, we
reversed $10 million of reserve amortization recorded earlier in the year, in order to achieve this predetermined ROE.
Looking forward, we expect to maintain a regulatory ROE of 11.25%, excluding momentum transition costs for the
balance of the year, which will likely mean we will use between $170 million and $180 million of reserve amortization
in 2013 and we'll end the year with a reserve amortization balance of approximately $220 million to $230 million,
assuming normal weather for the remainder of the year.
Looking beyond this year, we believe that our expected end-of-year reserve balance when combined with our weather
normalized sales growth forecast of 1.5% to 2% per year, and our current O&M expectations as well as the
commitment of a four year total of roughly $7 billion in infrastructure CapEx will allow us to support regulatory ROEs
in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.5% to 11.5% for the remaining period of the current rate agreement.
Furthermore, we expect that we can do this while keeping typical residential customer bills the lowest in the state and
among the lowest in the country and improving on our already-excellent reliability in customer service records.
If we are successful in meeting our expectations, by 2016 we will have further improved our already-outstanding
customer value proposition and we will be well-positioned for whatever proceedings required to determine rates for
2017 and beyond.
Turning to our development efforts, all of our major capital projects at FPL are progressing well and in October we
received approval from the FPSC for 2014 nuclear clause recovery of our full request, which includes recovery of the
extended power upgrade investment completed earlier this year. FPL's nuclear plant upgrades were the largest in recent
U.S. history and added more than 500 megawatts of zero emission capacity to our system.
In addition to helping improve our fleet's overall fuel diversity, these upgrades are already delivering millions in fossil
fuel savings for FPL customers. Our Riviera Beach and Port Everglades modernizations are both running on time and
on budget. Riviera Beach is about 90% complete and is expected to come into service by mid-2014. Site clearance at
Port Everglades is underway and construction is slated to begin in the spring of next year with an expected in-service
date by mid-2016.
We are also moving through the regulatory process on a number of our growth initiatives. Last week, the commission
voted unanimously to approve FPL's natural gas transportation capacity contracts that support a new pipeline into the
state. While this decision is still subject to appeal, it is an essential first step to enable the Sabal Trail Transmission and
Florida Southeast Connection Pipeline projects to move towards construction.
Additionally, a commission decision on our accelerated storm hardening program is expected in the coming weeks, and
hearings on our request to upgrade peaking capacity included in our environmental cost recovery clause filing earlier
this year, are currently scheduled for December with a commission decision expected in January.
The programs we have laid out to accelerate and expand reliability investments to improve our system infrastructure
are also progressing well. During the quarter, we activated more of the functionality of our smart meters including
remote connect and disconnect. We also continued our deployment of automated feeder switches and fault currant
indicators. Year-to-date, we have avoided almost 300,000 customer interruptions due to this technology.
We have also commissioned a new substation relay system, designed to help reduce outage exposure and outage time,
and it will be rolled out to many of our substations over the coming years. We continue to make good progress on
hardening our feeders, replacing wood transmission structures with steel or concrete, as well as our other storm
hardening efforts.
Recall that general infrastructure and storm hardening investments do not have separate cost recovery mechanisms,
costs incurred as part of these programs will be absorbed in our current rate structure for the next four years.

Let me now spend a few minutes on the Florida economy. Overall Florida's economy continues to improve, most of the
indicators we track have improved relative to a year ago, and the economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.
Unemployment ticked down again in August to 7% falling from over 11% in August 2010. The number of jobs in the
state is up 1.8% compared with a year ago, outpacing the average for the rest of the country.
However, we are seeing some signs that the rate of growth may be moderating. Consumer confidence has diminished a
bit in recent months, and there are signs that the strong growth in retail sales may be tapering off. As the accompanying
chart shows new building permits have dropped from their recent peak, although they remain at a healthy level.
As you all know, events in Washington in recent months have not been supportive of consumer confidence and some of
what we're seeing here in Florida maybe just a temporary pause.
Nevertheless, as we have noted before, we believe that full recovery in Florida will depend in part on continued
improvement in other parts of the country. The fundamental attractiveness of our state remains strong and a number of
studies suggest that Florida has improved its economic competitiveness relative to most other states over the past few
years.
Turning from the general Florida metrics to our own, Florida's customer count averaged approximately 53,000 or 1.2%
higher than in the comparable quarter in 2012.This is a significantly-higher growth rate than we expected, or than we
have been running recently. However a significant portion of this, probably about a quarter, can be attributed to the
rollout of our remote connect and disconnect capability enabled by our smart meter program.
This ability to more efficiently and inexpensively manage the connect and disconnect processes has in turn, led to a
sharp drop in our number of inactive accounts, that is meters installed for which we have no customer account.
While this sharp increase in customers and the corresponding decline in inactive meters is an excellent development, it
does complicate our analysis of growth. Not surprisingly, the larger number of new customer accounts being activated
are disproportionately residential, and therefore have lower usage than our average retail accounts. Thus the impact on
volume growth from new customers is much less than 1.2%.
In the accompanying chart in the top left, we've attempted to adjust for this effect. We estimate that customer growth of
1.2% drove volume growth of 0.5%, while weather-driven usage was negative 0.7% and underlying usage per customer
was down slightly. Regardless of the exact contributions from customer growth and usage impacts, it is clear that
overall weather-adjusted volume was up only slightly compared with the third quarter of last year, while a single
quarter of weak growth should not be cause for concern, we will obviously be watching closely to see if there's any
structural change going on, or if we are just seeing a temporary effect.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2013 GAAP earnings of $281 million or $0.66 per
share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $190 million or $0.45 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the
mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges and the net effect of other than temporary impairments, or OTTI, on
certain investments. Beginning in the third quarter, adjusted earnings also exclude after-tax operating results associated
with the Spain solar projects.
Energy Resources had a good quarter with contribution to adjusted EPS increasing $0.07 versus the prior year
comparable quarter, despite the impact of the transition costs associated with project momentum that I spoke about
earlier on the call. These transition costs negatively impacted the quarter by roughly $0.01 and we expect the full-year
impact to Energy Resources to be approximately $0.02 or $0.03.
Contributions from new investments were the primary driver of adjusted earnings growth for the quarter and generated
roughly $0.08 of the year-over-year increase. The gas infrastructure business contributed $0.02 to growth due to
additional production over the prior year, offsetting these gains were lower contributions from our Customer Supply
and Trading businesses, which declined $0.03 versus the third quarter last year, due in large part to lower margins in
our Full Requirements business, all other effects in the quarter were minor.

The Energy Resources team continues to drive execution on our growth plans. As mentioned earlier in the call, during
the quarter we brought into service a Canadian wind project with a capacity of roughly 125 megawatts. As a reminder,
we have approximately 475 megawatts of additional Canadian wind capacity, which we expect will enter service in
2014 and 2015.
We continue to expect to bring approximately 300 megawatts of contracted solar projects into service this year or early
next year with the addition of our 20-megawatt Mountain View project and the partial commissioning of our Genesis
and Desert Sunlight projects. The balance of Genesis and Desert Sunlight as well as our 250 megawatt Macquarie
project are expected to come into service by the end of 2016.
Turning to our U.S. wind program, the team recently signed a PPA for a 200 megawatt project, which is expected to
come into service in late 2014 or 2015, bringing our total new contracted U.S. wind development portfolio to
approximately 1,175 megawatts. The IRS recently provided additional clarity around the requirements for projects to
qualify for the PTC under the Safe Harbor Provisions that were included in the January PTC extension. The new IRS
guidance essentially provides that U.S. wind projects satisfying the Safe Harbor Provisions that are placed in service by
yearend 2015 will be eligible for the PTC.
While we have yet to determine the impact that this guidance could have on our projections, the new wind projects in
the 2014 to 2015 timeframe, we consider this a positive development for our U.S. wind program and we will continue
to provide updates on our expectations as we move forward.
We are also working to continue to build our Solar business. We previously discussed the potential for adding one or
possibly two more large scale solar projects before the end of 2016 and I'm pleased to note that we have recently
entered into an agreement to purchase a development project from First Solar, who will complete the development
process and also provide EPC services for us.
While there are a number of additional milestones to be achieved before we can consider this transaction complete, this
is an important step for our solar portfolio. This project will have a capacity of approximately 250 megawatts and
operate under a 20-year PPA. Total capital cost is estimated at $1.1 billion.
Together with the 40 megawatts projects that we announced earlier this year, this project would bring the portfolio of
incremental solar to about 290 megawatts, near the top-end of the expected range of zero megawatts to 300 megawatts
that we discussed at our Investor Conference. We now have nearly 1,100 megawatts of U.S. contracted solar projects in
our development portfolio.
As we do each year in the third quarter, we have updated our equivalent gross margin hedge slides, and included an
additional year forward. The portfolio of financial information for 2014 and 2015 can be found in the appendix to the
presentation. For 2014, all projects which are expected to be in service by the end of 2013, have been moved to their
respective categories, which in this case include both contracted wind for the wind projects, and contracted other for
our solar additions.
For 2015, projects expected to come into service in both 2014 and 2015 are included in the new investment line. I
would like to emphasize that this includes only contributions from projects for which we have a signed PPA.
I would also like to remind everyone that these charts use a metric that we call equivalent EBITDA in order to put all
our businesses on a comparable basis for the purpose of analyzing our exposure to first order changes in future
commodity prices, primarily movements in forward prices for natural gas, power and spot spread. Equivalent EBITDA
is not a GAAP measure and should not be thought of as a surrogate for, or a constituent of cash flows.
Looking at the company on a consolidated basis, for the third quarter of 2013, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was
$698 million or $1.64 per share, NextEra Energy's 2013 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS was $607
million and $1.43 respectively.
The corporate and other segment was up $0.04 versus the prior year primarily because last year's Q3 results included a
small asset impairment charge of $0.03. We continue to expect the full year contributions from this segment to improve
modestly relative to 2012, in part due to increased contributions from our Lone Star Transmission line, which went into

service in the spring of this year.
Other areas of our Transmission business are also progressing well. We were recently designated by the Ontario Energy
Board to develop the East-West Tie Line transmission project, with our partners Enbridge and Borealis. While we still
need approval to construct the line following the development process, we certainly consider this a positive first step.
We look forward to providing you with updates on this project, as well as others mentioned at our Investor Conference
as our Transmission team continues its development efforts.
Before closing, I'd like to make a few comments on our financing plans and cash flow position. We've repeatedly noted
the important role of balance sheet strength and credit play in our overall competitive strategy. At our Investor
Conference in March we discussed our expected growth in cash flow and our focus on returning to credit metrics more
consistent with our past performance no later than 2014.
We indicated that, dependent on our success in firming up what we call incremental investment opportunities, we
expected to need to issue up to $1.5 billion in equity in 2014 in order to achieve our target credit metrics. We have also
indicated, we expected the majority, if not all of this, to be in the form of straight common rather than equity units. In
the accompanying chart we have shown some of the principal credit metrics that we track, with our expectations for
2014, and the corresponding ranges that the rating agencies indicate for those metrics at our ratings. You will note that
we expect to see our metrics returned to levels fully consistent with our rating by next year.
Since the March Investor Conference, we have obviously enjoyed significant success in firming up many of the
incremental growth opportunities. While various approvals and permits are still needed, we feel very confident that we
will be able to move forward with much, if not all of the incremental investment sometime over the next three or four
year. As a result, today, our best estimate is that we will need to issue at least $1 billion in incremental equity before the
end of next year.
In pursuing the necessary financing to support our growth plans, including issuing new equity, we expect to be, as we
have been in the past, opportunistic as to the exact timing and structuring of specific transactions. We will take
advantage where we can of favorable market opportunities and we'll not lock ourselves into a preset schedule.
As you think about our financing needs, as well as our overall value proposition, it will be important to keep in mind
our cash flow position. We have previously indicated we expected to see strong growth in cash flows in 2013 with
more to come in 2014 and we are on track relative to our expectations this year. In 2012 our cash flow from operations
was about $4 billion, this year we expect it to be about $4.8 million and next year we expect it to be somewhere
between $5.6 billion and $5.9 billion, consistent with the range we suggested back in March. This would represent
growth of nearly 50% over two years.
The accompanying chart attempts to put this in perspective. We show on the left side of the chart a range of expected
distributable cash flow for capital holdings in 2014, capital holdings is the entity that aggregates all our non-FPL
financing activities. Distributable cash flow is defined here as net of expected interest and principal repayment
obligations on all limited recourse, project level debt at Energy Resources, as well as net of expected maintenance
CapEx. We then compare this with total senior debt at capital holdings, as well as with the sum of senior debt at lower
rated, subordinated debentures. As you will see the coverage is strong, and is of course further supported by the parent
guarantee.
For comparison, on the right side of the slide, we have also put FPL on a roughly similar basis, treating all our
infrastructure capital as maintenance CapEx and comparing the resulting expected 2014 distributable cash flow with
the total first mortgage debt outstanding. While there are some differences between FPL and capital holdings not
reflected in this analysis, the general comparisons may be helpful to you.
In short, if we continue to execute well and if we are successful in meeting our financial expectations for 2014, we will
have a very strong and balanced cash flow position across the portfolio. Before leaving the subject of cash flow, I feel
sure that one or two of you will have questions about the status of our thinking on so-called yield co. First, let me be
clear that we have made no firm decisions at this point. We continue to examine the concept of recycling capital by our
focus on investors with a strong interest in yield-oriented vehicles supported by renewable assets, whether in a public

or a private format.
During the quarter we have observed further developments that appear to support the viability of the concept, at least
under current market conditions. We spent some time looking at the specifics of our own portfolio and now estimate
that we have perhaps 1,500 to 2,000 megawatts of operating assets that would fit the desired format with another 1,200
megawatts in the development pipeline all of which could potentially be contributed during the 2014 to 2017
timeframe.
Longer-term additional projects might become suitable especially as wind projects complete their 10-year period of
PTC eligibility. I want to reiterate that we have made no firm decisions and continue to study various alternatives. We
will keep you up-to-date with our thinking as it evolves.
Overall, with good performance in Q3 and continued progress on our new initiatives, our financial expectations remain
much the same. We continue to see our 2013 adjusted EPS in the upper half of the $4.70 to $5.00 range that out for you
in January. For 2014, we continue to expect earnings per share to be in the range of $5.05 to $5.45 and for the
longer-term outlook, we continue to see adjusted EPS growing at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through
2016 off a 2012 base.
As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating
conditions, and in the appendix we have provided a number of sensitivities around our 2014 expectations.
And we'll now open the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So first just to elaborate a little bit further on yield co and I'm sure further questions
will go. Could you talk a little bit more specifically of those operating assets, how are you thinking about the 1.5 to 2
gigs, what are those assets? If you can at least talk broadly. And then secondly with respect to the development
pipeline, are those assets that have tax attributes today or you think about when you see development those that are
rolling off tax attributes?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Let me take the development side first. As you would expect that is all renewables,
because that's where our development efforts have been concentrated for some time and a mixture of wind and solar,
but excluding wind projects that would be PTC projects for reasons that we discussed before. Of the base existing
operating projects it would be a mix of projects, heavily renewable, potentially some of our contracted fossil assets as
well and the renewables being a mix of wind and solar – wind as either completed its PTC period on which we didn't
take – didn't elect PTCs.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: And then maybe just more broadly here if you will. What's the timing on making a
decision. I mean I don't want to put you back in a wall here or anything but just broadly speaking, what are you waiting
for perhaps the better way to ask it?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: I guess the best way I can respond to that is we're waiting for our own analyses to be – to
reach a crystallization point. I would say at this stage each round of review that the senior team has done, has
enlightened us further but has also raised more questions. So there will be a series around to those. And until we're
comfortable that we've got all our issues addressed, we don't feel any compulsion to any pressure to make a decision
one way or the other. I think we talked on the last call, we certainly talked in the conferences about some of the issues

that we have. So I'm not going to reiterate those things. But until we're really comfortable that we've got all the pieces
buttoned down, as I say we don't feel any compulsion to make a decision one way or the other.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent and then just lastly here if you will. Obviously you've got IRS guidance in
the quarter. Can you speak to perhaps how much wind you expect to have in the pipeline or qualifying for the PTC by
year end? And how just this has sort of evolved – how the IRS guidance and pushing it into 2015 has evolved you're
thinking on the pipeline opportunity?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: I think it's a good question. I think the short answer is no, I can't because it's still fairly
recent. And it has had an impact already on the market. So as we discussed before, our customers react to their
expectations about the PTC program just as we do. So I think, we are now going through sort of another round of,
jointly with customers and potential customers, of trying to figure out how much more that may add. So the plus side is
a fundamentally good aspect, as I think it provides us more opportunities. There is a little bit of a short-term negative
because it takes some of the pressure off individual situations. So I think we should be in a better position to give you
some thinking about that at the – probably at the next call, but right now we're just not far enough along.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Are you looking, specifically at yield cos, are you looking at the general idea of an alternative
structure.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: We are looking at the general idea of an alternative structure, but with a definite focus on
trying to create a structure that's appealing to yield-oriented investors with a strong interest in renewables, is probably
the best way to put it. So as we discussed on the last call, we're looking at both what I'll call the public yield co vehicle
of which there are some examples out there, as well as potential sort of private alternatives, private analogs if you like.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: I guess yield co is kind of a vague term. Okay. And then why are you not carving out Project
Momentum implementation costs from your adjusted earnings?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: I guess, we could have, I mean our feeling is they are part of our operating results, but we
wanted to call them out so you can make whatever adjustments for modeling purposes that you should choose.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And when do you expect that 200 to 250 to start hitting the income statement?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, we're already seeing some benefits this year, we'll see a lot more next year. I think
the best way to think about that is an annualized run rate by 2016. So by the time we get to 2016, we should have the
full value of that flowing through.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And, can you just describe, is this head count, is this process, is it all of the above?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: It is all of the above. We undertook a process that generated something like 9,000
individual ideas that various teams worked through and analyzed and in the end, we have about 1,000 individual ideas
that we're now pursuing, so they range all over the map in every department of every part of the company was
involved. So it's just a little bit of everything. Certainly there are some head count implications and the transition costs
are largely driven by those head count implications, but there's a lot of changes to the way we conduct work that will
allow us to see benefits over time.

<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: In your Resources waterfall chart, you usually have existing assets kind of broken out. I guess
that didn't change, but you had a pretty – pardon the pun, tough wind headwind, what does that do to earnings?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah, I mean there were lots of – as you might expect within that broad category, there
were lots of ups and downs. Wind for the existing assets was actually a bit better than last year. The wind resource was
about the same, we got a little more output out of the projects. So it's just a whole series of pluses and minuses, but net,
the existing assets delivered about the same.

Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Just to sort of follow up on the equity needs and the potential for a yield co. Would it be –
could one assume that the equity needs would be somewhat satisfied by a yield co?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: In theory, I think that's possible. In practice, I don't think it is that likely. I think the yield
co alternative needs to be thought of as sort of a restructuring of where the basic financial structure. So could be, but I
think it's better to think of the equity as just separate from.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. I got you. And then in terms of the equity, should we think of this as basically common
or should we think of it as potentially hybrids or something else?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: You should think of it is as primarily, if not 100%, common. We continued to manage to –
with a slice of the hybrids and a slice – well, let me be explicit. Hybrids for us means the deeply subordinated junior
debentures and then equity units may be what you're referring to when you say hybrids. But both of those have a place
in the capital structure, but I think we have about the right amount of each of those right now.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Great. And then back to Project Momentum, it does appear that you guys are using a
more conservative approach in terms of accounting for the costs to achieve. And I was just wondering, how long would
those costs to achieve should we think – is there sort of a flow in terms of how they'll progress? You mentioned that the
full benefit will sort of show up in 2016, but how do we think about the costs to achieve. I mean will they be steadily
sort of run rate here for the next couple years, or how should we think about the costs to achieve and how they might
impact your earnings going forward?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: At this stage, I would expect that we will see the bulk of them this year, as we indicated in
the prepared remarks, we've got maybe $0.10 for this year. There probably will be some in 2014, don't know how much
at the stage, but not likely as much as $0.10. And then 2015 and beyond, I would be surprised if we had more than a
few pennies.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Great. And then just finally on the sales growth. You did mention that it was just a little
anomaly here within terms of usage or at least a little bit of a change. And we are seeing, as you know, around the
country sort of more-significant pullbacks in usage, weather – weather-normalized usage. Any sense, I mean you did
mention on the prepared remarks and everything, but any sense as to anything or any more color that you can give with
respect to that for what you're seeing so far.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, if it's anything, I think it's most likely to have to do with general economic
conditions. We don't see any signs that this is driven by we'll call incremental efficiency. So we bake into our
expectations about a percentage point decline every year, as new efficiency standards kind of roll through the capital

stock. So it's hard to see that this recent phenomenon would represent any sharp change in efficiency. So I think it's
much more likely if it's – if it is real to be just due to economics. So I think the main thing there is to – that we know
that several of the indicators at the general economic level seem to be kind of taking a pause. And then we also see that
same phenomenon in our usage. So we're just a little more cautious that we may be not slowing down, but the rate of
growth may be coming down a bit.

Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks for the incremental disclosures, very helpful.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Thank you.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: When we think about how you've contextualized the percent or the portion of your non-utility
business that could potentially be eligible for the yield co structure, how do we translate that into the percentage of the
$1.2 billion to $1.4 billion of distributable cash you're showing on line 13 comes from those eligible projects?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: I think the short answer is you can't right now because we haven't made the connection
between those two because frankly they've been independent streams of activity. So stay tuned on that.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. And, then obviously we'd have to also figure out – or you have to figure out how much of
debt goes with that and to get to a bottom-line yield distributable cash number, how much is amortizing, those are all
the sort of pieces that we have to figure out, right?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Absolutely, the modeling of what it would look like has to take into account all of those
things. The other thing to be noted there is just to reiterate that our commitment to the strong credit position, we would
have to make sure that were we to move forward with a yield co structure that we adjust back up at the corporate level
to make sure that we retain the appropriate financial mix and credit metrics that we're targeting there, so that's an extra
layer of complexities not just which assets we'd move down and what's the debt associated with them, but it's also the
ripple effect back to the parent company to make sure you've got everything balanced back there.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Otherwise set them flaming which you can't just push a lot of assets down without also pushing
the right amount of debt balance so that the parent credit remains strong?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Fair enough.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Is that, is that right?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah, fair enough.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: We're just saying the same thing.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yes.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: To circle back to Paul's question, I do think it's- can you comment a little more on what type of
metrics you use to measure customer – underlying customer demand as it pertains to weather versus energy efficiency
and things because in other regions like for instance Arizona, which is also a state recovering from a housing bust.
They also saw a big pull back in what they considered to be normalized, weather-normalized demand very similar to

what you're talking about. So can you talk about the type of metrics you use to try to get at that and then how comfort
you are that they sort of capture that or what they might be missing?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, I'll do my best. I think the real challenge here is that we don't have any metrics that
we can really look at on a short-term basis that drill in on this problem. That's one of the reasons why we many times
said in the past that any one quarter we should expect to see weather-adjusted usage per customer move around quite a
bit. So even in a period – I'm now going back several years when on average, underlying usage was growing at about a
percentage point a year, we would still see individual quarters where it didn't grow at all and other quarters where it
grew at 1.5% or 2%. So those sort of quarter-to-quarter things are very hard for us to sort out. So to the quarter
question, longer term, you can look at the – the basic thing you have is the usage pattern by segments of customers.
And so part of what's going on here is the customer mix is changing and the usage patterns of the customers within the
different segments in that mix, also appear to be changing a little bit.
In short, we have seen over the last few years, much stronger recovery in the residential piece and in the small end of
the commercial segment, and much weaker recovery, if any, in the large commercial piece. So we really, in terms of
metrics, we actually look more to the trends at the segment level.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: That's actually very helpful. Thank you, Moray.

Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Moray, as you look out in the last quarter in terms of developments on yield co, I wonder if
you could just talk at a high level as you think about the cost to capital of these approaches coming to investors that are
seeking cash flow. Not in detail, but just holistically as you think about cost of capital, the right investor base, et cetera.
How you think about that relative to within NextEra?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure. I'll take a crack at that. I think I'm going to end up repeating things that we probably
said on the last call or said at one of the conferences. To me, this is a question about whether there is a segment of
investors who simply value a cash flow stream with particular characteristics differently from the way that the rest of
the investor base does. And here, in particular, we're talking about a cash flow stream that has high current income,
relatively stable, but also with strong and visible growth. I think if you look at the yield co structures that have been
introduced so far, that element of significant predictable growth has been an important distinguisher of how they trade.
So to me, that indicates that to the extent that there's a discrete investor segment here, it's one that both likes the solidity
of current income, but also is willing to pay for a visibility into a meaningful growth pattern.
So that – I think what you're trying to do is structure a vehicle that appeals to that particular segment, and then the real
core question is; how big is that segment? How much more is it willing to pay for the cash flow stream than other
investors? And is that a transient phenomenon or one that is going to be around for a while? So that's kind of the
framework that at least I think about. I'm sure, Jim and others have slightly different versions, but that's how I think
about it.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: That's helpful. And within the approach to yield co, one thing that investors sometimes think
about is the economic participation of parent, that is incentive payments back to the parent as return levels are reached.
I know it's a little bit more specific, but I know the goal is obviously always to maximize the value of NextEra
shareholders. As you all think about potential participation of the parent in returns at whatever yield co could be
contemplated, is that something that you are generally sort of possibly disposed towards because you want the parent
growth and parent participation.

<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: It's certainly yet another of the things which things that you have to consider, I guess the
main point I make there is, it does seem to me important that you, to the extent you can, you create alignment of
interests between the two sets of investors that one of our concerns is not getting a situation where the interests are
divergent. And in that sense, the kind of incentive structures that you're talking about, I think can play an important role
if they're designed correctly, but that if, it's an important if. The specifics of how they're designed are important. But I
see them as mostly about aligning interests.

Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Yeah. Hey, guys. Couple of items, one on the O&M cost reductions, the $200 million to
$250 million. Is that incremental – I assume that's the main driver for keeping nominal O&M flat and that there couldn't
be kind of a potential down – actual downward trajectory in O&M being driven off of that.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: A couple of comments on that, on a number of occasions, I think at one of the conferences
in September, I kind of tried to frame it on the FPL side by saying that last year we had about $1.5 billion of non-fuel
O&M. If you just extrapolate it at a traditional 2.5% a year growth rate, what we have been running the last few years
out to 2016, you would have found that to attain the goal of keeping nominal O&M flat, that would have translated to
about $150 a year run rate reduction. And so that's kind of the scope of the challenge. Now the $200 million to $250
million obviously includes Energy Resources at all other parts of the business, but it's why we feel pretty comfortable
that we have line of sight on the actions that will be necessary to give us a decent shot oat that goal of keeping O&M
flat in nominal terms. Now in direct answer to your question, we certainly haven't, we're not saying this is all that there
is going to be. In fact one of the important things coming out of Project Momentum is a commitment to ongoing further
searches for improvement. So this is where we are today, we've got a lot of work to do to make sure we deliver on that
but we're certainly not going to treat that as, that's the only thing that it could possibly be.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And one or two other questions unrelated on the O&M side. When you comment on
the five to seven long-term EPS growth, are you now including items like the pipeline in that number, is that still
outside of that number?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: No, the 5% to 7% is adjusted EPS growth at the enterprise level. So it's inclusive of
everything. And certainly when we shared that range in the March Investor Conference, we discussed the pipeline as a
potential project in the incremental investment category. So clearly it was included in that and it certainly remains so.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: And finally the earnings tower...
<A - James L. Robo>: Michael, this is Jim. I just wanted to add to that. Given the combination of the progress we've
made on Project Momentum along with the progress we've made in our development efforts on both sides of the
business. I said this in September, I'll say it again now, I will be very disappointed if – we have a lot execution still left
to do over the next three years, but I'll be very disappointed if we don't earn at the top end of that range through 2016
i.e., what I have the teams focused on is earning $6.00 in 2016.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And on the pipeline, just I want to think about the earnings tower, do you actually
accrue AFUDC during construction of the pipeline and then that kind of converts the cash once it comes online in late
2017.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yes. And, Michael, it's possible – in response to your first question, what you may have
been thinking about is where the pipeline shows up in the segment discussion in our forward-looking statements. This
does get a little more complicated, but everything that we've discussed to date has had the potential contribution from
the pipeline clustered in the FPL segment. Although, we have also indicated that those are not strictly FPL assets, so
that may be part of the confusion.

Our next question comes from Brian Chin with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Are there any commitments that you can make with regards to the dividend as it relates to your
decision about whether to do a yield co or not?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well first of all, the answer is no, the dividend obviously is a board decision. But I'm not
quite sure I'm following that in a relationship between the dividend and the yield co in your mind.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Right well – well when we think about a yield co mechanism, there's significant amount of cash
that does come from NextEra Energy Resources that currently helps go towards the parent that helps go towards
funding a variety of different activities within the NextEra structure. In the event that you were to dropdown any of
those assets into a separate yield co mechanism, I'm just wondering whether that might have an effect on whether you
might want to think about your dividend per share for NextEra shares. Is there a separation of that dividend or is there a
commitment that you can make that the yield co would not have any impact on the dividend. Just trying to get a sense
of how you think about that.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Okay. I think I would have to think a little further about the question. I guess my initial
reaction is, at least at this stage, I don't see the yield co necessarily leading to any fundamental change in the dividend
policy, again the dividend policy is a matter for the board to decide and any specific implementation within that policy
is also a matter for the board to decide.

Our next question comes from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Hi, Moray and congratulations on another great quarter.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Thank you.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: I just wanted to ask, you've mentioned, if I heard correctly, that the ability of
Florida Power & Light to realize its allowed ROEs through 2016 was predicated on certain assumptions regarding load
growth, and you gave those numbers, but I'm not sure I heard them correctly. And I was just wondering if I could ask
you to repeat them and perhaps break them down into their various components.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah. On the – in terms of volume growth out through the 2016 period, the average is
about – the expectation to average about 1.5% to 2%, the vast majority of which is coming from customer growth.
Essentially, what we do for the forecast there is take the – I believe it's the University of Florida population projections
and then factor them down to implications for customer growth. So, probably three quarters of the growth in the base
expectations is coming from customer growth, but the total volume growth expectation is about 1.5% to 2% a year. So
call it 1% to 1.5% customers and maybe another 0.5% per year on the usage side, and the usage piece, just to remind
folks, is really still sort of cyclical economic recovery i.e., getting back towards the average usage customer levels that
we saw in 2007, 2008.

<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: So do you happen to have the underlying population growth assumption and the
usage assumption that go into the 1.5% to 2%?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: When you take the population growth of, call it 1.3%, 1.4%, maybe 1.5%, so the rest is the
usage piece.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Okay. So, you see usage rising sort of marginally maybe a quarter or a 0.5% per
year as it reverts in your view to the 2007 levels, and then the ongoing population growth. And have you felt that there
was reason to modify that assumption? It just strikes me as optimistic given trends around the country and recent
experience in the service territory?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: A couple of comments, Hugh. First of all, baked into that usage value is as I think I
indicated earlier, an assumption of about a negative 1% a year impact of the ongoing effect of efficiency standards as
capital stock rolls through. In terms of the other part of your question, obviously people can judge for themselves
whether it's optimistic or pessimistic, it's actually pretty consistent with what we have been running for the year, the last
year and a half or so. Actually the usage growth has been a little stronger than that, over that period. So this quarter is a
little bit of a pull back from what we have seen. And that's why I was indicating earlier that we just need to have a little
more time to see whether that's the start of a new trend or whether it's just a short term blip.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Great. Quickly on the yield co, NRG Energy appears to have acquired some wind
and gas assets from the Edison Mission Energy portfolio to contribute to its yield co, are those assets that you looked at
and if so, can you tell us why you decided not to proceed?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: I can't comment on specific assets, all I can I say is, as I've said in the past that we look at
a lot of different things particularly in the renewable space.

Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Thank you. I actually hate asking questions about yield co again, but just putting it into
more of a context. So you're saying that you see up to 2,000 of existing assets that will qualify for a yield co structure
and about 1,200 of assets currently under development. I mean this is such a small portion of your total portfolio. I
mean is this really worth pursuing a public yield co structure given the costs associated with such a process?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, I think the only answer I can give you to that is we don't know that's why we are
continuing to study it. But obviously, the fact that we are continuing to study it suggests that we think it could
potentially be significant. I think if you look at the potential multiple expansion on certain types of assets depending
upon what you believe about how they're implicitly valued today, you can still scale that up and have it be a meaningful
amount in terms of shareholder value creation. So certainly we're going to try and find opportunities like that, but we
just don't know at the moment. Jim is going to comment as well.
<A - James L. Robo>: Angie, I think the thing to think about is, that's over a period of years that we've laid out,
somewhere in the order of the next three years to four years.
All – effectively all of our renewable assets – contracted renewable assets ultimately would – you could conceptually
think about being able to be in the yield co once the project financing, the tax equity, and the PTC lives rolled off and
so I think it's not right to think about this being all of it – it's all of it that we can think about in a period of the next
three to four years.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: How about adding the gas pipeline assets to that structure, the future gas pipelines?
